Auditors A resolution for the reappointment of the current auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting A number of other resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting as special business.
Resolution 6 will, if passed, give authority to the company to increase its authorised share capital from 77,500,000 to 90,000,000.
Resolutions 7 and 8 will give the directors flexibility to allot unissued shares, although the directors have no present intention to issue any further shares save on the exercise of options granted under the Intermediate Capital Group Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 and the Intermediate Capital Group Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1997 and the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.
Resolution 7 will, if passed, authorise the directors to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate amount of 4,004,461, representing approximately 29% of the current issued share capital of the company.
Resolution 8 will, if passed, authorise the directors to disapply pre-emption rights of existing shareholders on future issues of ordinary shares for cash in respect of up to a maximum nominal amount of 690,424, being 5% of the current issued share capital.
These authorities will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the company in 2005 and in any event no later than 15 months after the passing of the resolutions.
However, the directors have no present intention of exercising these authorities, except pursuant to any exercise of share options.
It is intended to renew such authorities at successive Annual General Meetings.
Resolution 9 will, if passed, authorise the company to purchase its own shares up to a maximum of 14.99% of the current issued share capital.
The price payable for shares purchased will not be more than 105% of the average of the market values for the ordinary shares as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days before the day on which the purchase is made, nor less than 20p the nominal value of the share.
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the company to be held in 2005 and in any event no later than 15 months after the passing of the resolution.
The authority will only be exercised if to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
At the date of this report, there are outstanding 2,168,760 share options under the Intermediate Capital Group Executive Share Option Scheme 1994, the Intermediate Capital Group Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1997, the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, which represent 3.1% of the companys existing issued share capital and would represent 3.7% of the companys issued share capital if the authority to purchase the companys own shares being sought were fully utilised.
Resolution 10 will, if passed, enable the company to pay out, in aggregate, up to 400,000 per annum to its non-executive directors by way of fees.
The current level of 200,000 contained in the Articles of Association, which was set in 1994, is sufficient for this year to 31 January 2004.
However the company needs to be able to attract additional high quality non-executive directors in order to maintain the appropriate balance on its Board, and would be unable to do so within the existing limits.
Authority is therefore being sought to increase the limit in aggregate to 400,000 per annum.
Resolution 11 will, if passed, give authority to the company to apply to the Inland Revenue for the approval of a Save As You Earn Plan.
This scheme will create a better balance between incentives available to executive directors and senior executives and other employees of the Group.
Political contributions No contributions were made during the year 2003 nil for political purposes.
