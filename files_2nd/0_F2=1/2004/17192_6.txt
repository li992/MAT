Annual General Meeting The nineteenth Annual General Meeting of Wilson Bowden plc will be held on 27th April 2005 and the Notice of Meeting has been mailed to shareholders with this Annual Report.
The Directors are proposing four special resolutions resolutions 10, 11, 12 and 13 at the Annual General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association of the Company.
The reasons for the amendments are as follows: Electronic appointment of proxies The amendments proposed by resolutions 10, 11 and 12 will facilitate the electronic appointment of proxies via facilities such as CREST, by providing the Company with discretion to decide what, if any, evidence is required before determining whether a proxy appointment is valid.
Indemnity to Directors and Officers The Articles of Association of the Company currently provide that every Director or other Officer of the Company shall, in certain circumstances, be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs of the Company.
The amendment proposed by resolution 13 will, if approved, enable the Company to make use of the changes to be introduced by the Companies Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise Act 2004 that will relax certain of the current prohibitions on companies indemnifying their directors against liability and permit companies to pay directors defence costs as they are incurred.

Amongst these initiatives was the introduction of a staff bonus scheme, which will enable all eligible monthly paid staff to share in the Groups success.
The Group continues to deliver high levels of performance by investing in its employees, developing their skills, measuring and improving achievements through regular reviews and focusing on improving team effectiveness.
The development of technical, personal and managerial skills is key to the Groups success.
Combined expenditure on the Construction Industry Training Board levy and the Groups direct training budget continues to exceed 1 million per year.
In-house training consultants provide technical support and guidance, with assistance from external trainers on specialist subjects as and when required.
Health and safety Following last years review of the Groups health and safety processes, 2004 saw the creation of a fully integrated Health and Safety Department.
The department provides guidance and solutions to the operating businesses on all aspects of health and safety and serves to strengthen further the health and safety culture within the Group.
The new system for monitoring safety performance introduced towards the end of 2003 is now fully operational.
The system sets and closely monitors the achievement of standards for health and safety on all sites and during the year the average performance exceeded the benchmark standard set by the Group.
The Board is committed to ensuring that the Groups activities are carried out in accordance with relevant statutory provisions and all reasonable and appropriate measures are taken to avoid risk to employees or others who may be affected.
Whilst management is committed to providing a safe working environment with the appropriate working practices and training, this can only be achieved if employees equally give their commitment to a rigorous health and safety culture.

Accordingly, the Group continues to have in place all the procedures and information appropriate to the going concern assessment required by the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Having reviewed the Groups resources and a range of likely trading out-turns, the Directors believe that they have reasonable grounds for stating that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
