qxd 13 3 05 12:13 pm Page 31 iv From 1 January 2004 to 21 February 2005, none of the directors had any beneficial interests in the companys securities other than ordinary shares, nor any non-beneficial interests in any of the companys securities, nor in those of its subsidiary or associated undertakings.
Accordingly, 100% of the allocations were released following the expiry of the two-year retention period.
ii At the end of the performance period to 30 September 2004, the company ranked fortieth in the relevant comparator group.
Accordingly, 75% of the allocations were released to participants.
iii The released shares were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and National Insurance contributions NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2004 in the second table on page 30. iv At the end of the performance period to 1 October 2003, the company ranked in fortieth position in the relevant LTIS comparator group.
Accordingly, 75% of the original allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion.
v At the end of the performance period the companys TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator group.
If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion as soon as practicable thereafter.
vi Roger Wood stepped down as a director and left the company on 30 September 2004.
Upon leaving the company, he waived all rights to the LTIS allocation made to him on 1 April 2004 137,965 shares and accordingly this allocation lapsed.
Since the 2000 allocation was in retention on the date he left the company, 141,710 shares were released to him on 1 October 2004.
The 2002 and 2003 allocations have been reduced to the figures shown, so that they represent the proportion of the performance period for which he was employed by the company, i. e. 83% and 50% respectively.
The total number of shares released will be determined in accordance with note v at the end of the performance period.
vii The vesting date was the next business day after the end of the retention period in relation to the 1999 allocation and the next business day after the end of the performance period in relation to the 2001 allocation.
