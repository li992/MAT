0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:39 am Page 55 Copper anode production of over 236,200 tonnes was a record for the copper smelter.
The 2004 production exceeded 1 the performance in the corresponding period by 11%, or 24,000 tonnes, due to the increase in availability and substantial 2 improvements in operating throughput rates, together with the absence of a re-brick during the year.
3 4 North Queensland unit costs on a C1 basis increased to 59.4US per pound during 2004 from 49US per pound in 2003, 5 largely as a result of the stronger Australian dollar but also reflecting higher costs associated with increased treatment and 6 refining charges on surplus concentrates, and increased development and filling activities that were required to facilitate the 7 rising production of metal during the latter part of the year.
These cost increases were partially offset by improved production 8 and operating cost efficiencies, higher metallurgical recoveries and increased refined metal production.
9 10 Developments 11 South America 12 Concentrator flotation capacity was expanded during the first half of 2004.
As a result, mill throughputs increased in the second 13 half of 2004 with the plant consistently achieving above three million tonnes per month.
Four additional haul trucks were delivered 14 during September 2004 to enable the mine to continue to maintain total material movements as the pit deepens.
15 16 The ongoing ore delineation drilling programme, undertaken both within the existing ore envelope and for extensions at depth, 17 confirmed in excess of 80 million tonnes of additional ore reserves, as announced in June 2004.
The mine plan was re-optimised 18 based on a new geological model with additional mineralisation, and together with improved metal prices and improved cost 19 profiles this resulted in an increase in contained metal reserves of more than 20%.
This is expected to lead to an additional 20 350,000 tonnes of contained copper and 1.2 million ounces of gold over the life of the mine being extracted, which will extend 21 the Alumbrera mine life by 2.5 years and will ensure metal production into 2015.
A new Ore Reserve Statement for Alumbrera 22 was completed in December 2004 which identified a further 30 million tonnes in additional mineral resources.
The JV team at 23 Alumbrera will continue an intensive in-pit resource definition programme during 2005, with the objective of adding further 24 to the Ore Reserve base.
25 26 Independently of the Alumbrera Joint Venture exploration work, Xstrata Copper has also scaled up its Alumbrera district 27 exploration programme.
The past years exploration activities have identified a number of promising geological targets with 28 further potential in the Catamarca Province.
These targets will be followed up with a drilling programme in 2005.

The project will provide an additional high-grade mining 8 zone in Enterprise, enabling the mine to maintain its rated capacity of 3.5 million tonnes per annum and improve the utilisation 9 of the existing hoisting and concentrator capacity.
Current plans indicate that the mining block will contribute a supplementary 0 5.3 million tonnes of copper ore at a grade of 4.5%, or 240,000 tonnes of contained copper metal, over the next 11 years.
1 Capital work commenced on the project late in the second half of 2004 with initial production scheduled to commence in 2 late 2006.
3 4 Also in June, Xstrata Copper announced the approval of an AUD7.2 million $5 million leaching plant to recover around 5 2,500 tonnes per annum of additional copper from the electrostatic precipitator dust in the Mount Isa copper smelter.
6 7 In November, capital expenditure of AUD41 million $29.3 million was approved to expand the Mount Isa copper smelter.
8 The project comprises the installation of a second rotary holding furnace, a copper slag cleaning furnace, a converter slag 9 treatment plant and associated plant and equipment.
These are all designed to increase the smelters capacity from 240,000 0 tonnes per annum to 280,000 tonnes per annum by mid 2006.
The project will also improve the copper smelter matte process 1 recoveries between the copper ISASMELT furnace and the copper converters by 2%: reduce the operating costs and improve 2 the overall operating control of the smelter.
3 4 During the second half, a gas agreement was concluded with Enertrade for the supply of coal seam methane gas to the 5 Townsville copper refinery.
This will result in the conversion to gas at a lower unit cost than the current naptha fuel utilised 6 within the refinery.
7 8 Exploration activity is continuing to focus on leveraging value from Xstrata Coppers strong regional asset and infrastructure 9 base in North Queensland, targeting mineralisation in the Mount Isa Cloncurry district.
While global zinc metal production increased by 2.7% to 4 around 10.1 million tonnes, zinc metal consumption, driven by strong growth in China and North America, outpaced increases in supply and rose by 5.4% to 10.3 million tonnes, resulting in a global supply deficit of more than 200,000 tonnes.
These improved fundamentals have been particularly supported by domestic demand in China, with the country becoming a net importer of refined zinc during 2004.
Until the final quarter of 2004, LME stocks were supported by private stockpiles of zinc delivered into warehouses.
During the final quarter, however, stocks fell steadily to around 631,000 tonnes by the end of December, 17% lower than levels at the end of the previous year and the lowest level recorded since September 2002.
0 1 Improved market fundamentals and a weaker US dollar assisted zinc prices to recover from the lows of the past two years, 2 rising by 35% to finish the year at $1,270 per tonne.
The average LME zinc price increased by 27% in 2004 to $1,048 per 3 tonne, up from $828 per tonne the previous year.
4 5 Global production of zinc concentrates in 2004 remained at a similar level to the previous year at 9.6 million tonnes.
Lower 6 production from Australia and Peru was only partially compensated for by increased output in China and Namibia, resulting in 7 a further tightening in the supply of zinc concentrates.
This led to a reduction in industry negotiated treatment charges TCs 8 which fell from an average of $148 per tonne in 2003 to $141 per tonne in 2004.
9 0 Lead 1 Global consumption of refined lead metal rose by 2.8% to seven million tonnes in 2004.
The main driver behind the rise 2 was increased demand from China, up by an estimated 9% in 2004.
Production of lead metal remained at 6.7 million tonnes, 3 a similar level to 2003, as increases in refined lead production in China and Kazakhstan compensated for reduced output in 4 Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
5 6 The tightness in the lead market which began to develop during 2003 continued during 2004.
Lead stocks at LME warehouses 7 fell to levels representing less than one week of global consumption, and by the end of 2004 stock levels were as low as 8 40,500 tonnes, compared to 107,500 tonnes at the start of the year.
Backwardation was a key feature of trading throughout 9 the year, reflecting the tight physical market.
0 1 Low levels of stock, steady global production rates and increased demand pushed LME prices to 14 year highs, with the cash Sulphuric acid plant absorption 2 price for lead breaking the $1,000 per tonne mark on several occasions.
At the end of July, the LME lead cash price briefly rose tower at San Juan fide Nieva, Spain 3 above the quoted zinc price, and consistently traded over $850 per tonne in the second half of 2004.
The average cash price 4 for lead in 2004 was $887 per tonne, 72% higher than the average price for 2003.

Stronger prices for both lead and zinc drove this increase in profits, contributing $110 million to the rise in EBIT.
4 However the positive effect of prices was partially offset by the weaker US dollar against the Euro, Australian dollar and Sterling 5 in 2004, which reduced operating profits by $61 million.
6 7 Xstrata Zinc again made excellent progress in achieving cost efficiencies and production synergies across the business, cutting 8 unit costs in real terms by $13 million in 2004.
9 10 Zinc-Lead Australia 11 2004 has been a transition year for Xstratas operations at Mount Isa.
The transformation programme put in place since the 12 acquisition of the asset from MIM has achieved greater capacity utilisation and, together with measures taken to extend the 13 operations life, this has ensured that continued production at Mount Isa is financially viable.
Turnover from the Australian zinc 14 and lead operations rose to $251 million, around 51% higher than in 2003, reflecting stronger metal prices and increased 15 production in the second half.
EBIT improved to $12 million, from a loss of $27 million in 2003.
16 17 Production ramped up in the second half of the year, as the transformation initiatives at Mount Isa started to bear fruit and 18 as mining conditions at George Fisher benefited from the work carried out in the first half on a new mine design, improved 19 mining sequence and increased development rates.
Ore hoisted in 2004 was 4% greater than the previous year.
20 21 George Fisher achieved ore production of 2.4 million tonnes in 2004, 9% higher than in 2003.
Production at the Isa lead mine 22 was 22% lower than in 2003, due to lower production in the first half.
Second half production increased by 11% compared 23 to the first half of the year, and the operation achieved a record tonnage of contained zinc metal and lead metal in December 24 2004, an increase of over 100% against the corresponding month in 2003.
This level of production has been maintained 25 into 2005.
26 27 Zinc in concentrate production increased by 13% compared to the previous year to 169,400 tonnes, due to higher tonnes 28 milled, together with improved grades and recoveries.
Lead in concentrate production was 115,400 tonnes in 2004 compared 29 to 119,200 tonnes the previous year.
During the first half, the Mount Isa lead smelter was impacted by lower levels of 30 production from the lead mines and a subsequent lack of concentrate during the first half of the year.
However capacity 31 utilisation improved in the second half of the year as the mines ramped up underground production, with ore tonnes milled 32 rising by 16% compared to the first half.
As a consequence, production of both lead in concentrate and zinc in concentrate Stamping silver bars at Britannia 33 Refined Metals, UK in the second half rose by 14% and 23% respectively, compared to the prior corresponding period.
Higher levels of production 34 have continued into 2005.
35 Loading zinc ingots for export at San Juan fide Nieva, Spain 36 McArthur River Mine MRM production was in line with last year.
In an effort to improve the quality of MRMs concentrate, 37 Zinc ingots ready to be MRM ran numerous trials in the concentrator to achieve a product tailored to specific market requirements, primarily reducing 38 dispatched to customers the silica content and increasing the zinc grade.
These trials were successful and led to the adoption of a modified flow sheet 39 which increases the grade of the concentrate from 46.5% to 47.1%.
However, the trials had a short-term impact on recoveries 40 and this, together with lower zinc and lead grades from the mine, impacted the amount of concentrate produced during 41 61 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:39 am Page 62 62 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 operating and financial review | zinc EBIT variances: Zinc-Lead $m Zinc Lead Total EBIT 31.12.03 pre-exceptionals 24.9 7.2 17.7 4 Sales price 64.9 44.6 109.5 Volumes 4.7 12.8 8.1 Unit cost real 16.1 2.7 13.4 Unit cost inflation 8.6 4.0 12.6 Unit cost foreign exchange 47.8 13.0 60.8 Foreign currency hedging 1.0 1.0 0 Depreciation & amortisation excluding foreign exchange 9.0 0.9 9.9 1 EBIT 31.12.04 pre-exceptionals 62.2 5.8 68.0 2 3 Pro forma includes MIM Group acquisition from 01.01.03 Excludes discontinued operations Avonmouth 4 5 Zinc Europe 6 The San Juan fide Nieva smelter in Spain achieved record zinc production for the sixth consecutive year, producing over 491,000 7 tonnes of melted cathode and over 472,000 tonnes of saleable zinc, an increase of 2.5% and 2.3% respectively over last year.
8 Production of melted zinc cathode in the smelter is expected to reach 500,000 tonnes in 2005 following the completion of a 9 7,000 tonne expansion in December 2004.
During 2004, the San Juan fide Nieva smelter also produced 662,800 tonnes of 0 saleable sulphuric acid.
Germanium production decreased to 700 kilograms compared with 7,509 kilograms in 2003, due to 1 lower germanium content in processed concentrates.
The Arnao plant produced 16,500 tonnes of zinc oxide and the Hinojedo 2 roaster produced 29,000 tonnes of liquid sulphur dioxide.
3 4 At Nordenham, 2004 production again reached record levels of over 154,000 tonnes of melted cathode and over 147,000 5 tonnes of saleable zinc over 10% higher than the plants rated production capacity at the time of Xstratas acquisition.
6 Further increases in production are expected in 2005, from continuing operational improvements, including the use of calcine 7 from Hinojedo to resolve bottlenecking in roasting capacity.
Additional external oxidic material will be inputted to allow 8 increased production.
