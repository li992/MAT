Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 16 Partnership WORKING TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE MORE Cairns goal is to make a positive social impact in areas where the Company operates.
We recognise that the social and community impact we make is fundamentally linked to the achievement of our business objectives.
Wherever we operate our goal is to obtain an understanding of the social environment and the risks associated with an operation, and then prepare management plans covering our operational activities and how we work with communities.
Wherever possible, we seek to apply an operational approach that informs and involves the people from the communities in which we work.
Over the years we have participated in programmes to share skills and facilities with local communities and provided support for programmes focused in the areas of education, sport, health, animal welfare and infrastructure development.
