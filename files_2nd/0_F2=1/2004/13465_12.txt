The domestic US market for low sulphur coal continues to grow due to its competitive cost per delivered energy unit and restrictions on Energy group sulphur emissions by utilities.
Continued strong demand for low cost and low sulphur western coal is expected to increase with the announcement of numerous new coal fired generation projects and Coal Coal Energy Rio Tinto share Rio Tinto share Earnings contribution increased utilisation of existing coal generation capacity in the US.
million tonnes million tonnes US$m MINED RESERVES 2004 operating performance KECs attributable production of 118 million tonnes of coal was nine per cent higher than in 2003 as a result of higher demand for low sulphur coal.
Earnings of US$119 million were 35 per cent higher than 2003 earnings of US$88 million.
This increase represents higher realised prices and sales volumes and a lower tax charge.
KEC also made progress in implementing value delivery initiatives that led to cost reductions, productivity improvements, reduced capital requirements and value adding marketing benefits.
These benefits were partially offset by higher fuel prices.
A detailed review of the mine plan and projected cash flows of the Colowyo coal business was completed in June 2004.
This indicated that future operating and development costs are substantially higher than previously estimated.
As a consequence of this, an exceptional charge of US$160 million was recorded in the first half of 2004 for the writedown of Colowyos fixed assets and recognition of related contract obligations.
This is excluded from adjusted earnings.
