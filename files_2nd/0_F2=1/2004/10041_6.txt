Market review From engine condition monitoring to wheels and braking systems, flight deck instrumentation to flight test sensors, countermeasures to target simulation, fire detection to ice protection, and thermal management systems to ammunition handling equipment, Meggitts sales derive primarily from aerospace and defence.
The group enjoys a well-diversified portfolio.
This is balanced between civil and military customers, between the manufacture of original equipment and aftermarket products and services, and between new and mature aircraft programmes.
In 2004, this position was reinforced by the timely acquisition of Dunlop Aerospace.
This increased our civil OEM original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket salesnow almost as strong as those of the groups defence systems businessand positions us to capitalise on growth in the recovering civil aerospace market.
Beyond aerospace, Meggitts extreme environment engineering products for land-based industrial gas turbines, and diverse applications in defence, automotive and medical applications for the groups electronic sensors products, play their role in a strategy designed to protect shareholders from the effects of demand changes in individual markets.
With defence budgets on the rise in the United States, with the civil aerospace sector showing signs of recovery, and with demand for electronic sensors expected to continue growing from a broad range of high technology markets, Meggitt is positioned for continuing growth in 2005.
Stryker mobile gun replenisher Continuous firing capacity is fundamental to combat success.
It helps if soldiers are free to keep the mission in their sights rather than the breech of a gun.
That means machines to line up and load ammunition.
Our replenisher, developed for the mobile gun in Stryker, a US Army rapid response armoured vehicle, loads a 50lb, 105 mm shell with surgical precisionevery ten seconds.
Ammunition handling systems soldiers can rely on.

But there is more to this sensor than long life.
And there is more to measurementits primary functionthan meets the eye.
After five years development, this sensors astonishing resolution means that measurements can be taken and movements made to within a nanometre about the length of a hair after a clean shave.
That is why it has been chosen by the International Space Station to bring precision to the environment in which important scientific experiments must be conducted.
Resolution: 1 nanometre in 1 mm range, 10 nm in 9 mm range Sensitivity to temperature: below 100 parts per million per C Operational provision sensor head: -150C to 85C for missions to Mars Reliability: 2.5 million hours mean time between failure 4 High radiation survivability: sensor 5 x 10 Rad Sensor head power consumption: below 15 mW With precision.
