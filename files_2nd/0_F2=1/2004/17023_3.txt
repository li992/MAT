M C Donohues annual bonus of 259, 000 includes an amount of 114,000 which was paid to a money purchase pension arrangement for his benefit as a result of a request by him that up to 114,000 of any bonus that might otherwise have been awarded to him for the 2003 04 financial year be paid as a pension contribution in the manner described.
R J Davies was paid the above sum as compensation on termination of his employment on 9 January 2004.
The compensation for loss of office was at a level which was lower than the remuneration which would have been payable to Mr Davies under the two year notice period in his service contract.
This sum includes 500 paid as consideration for certain restrictive covenants set out in the termination agreement, legal fees of 9,400 in connection with the termination of his employment and the payment for outplacement counselling services to a maximum of 20,000 on the production of invoices.

34 Westbury plc Annual Report 2004 2004 account 26-64 7 5 04 10:56 am Page 35 REMUNERATION REPORT Pensions Executive directors in the employment of the Company are eligible to join a defined benefits pension scheme, under which contributions are payable by the Company.
Members currently pay contributions at the rate of 7% of pensionable earnings.
For executive directors, the scheme provides a pension upon retirement at the normal pension age of 60 equal to one thirtieth of final pensionable earnings for each year of service subject to 2 3rds of final pensionable earnings and Inland Revenue limits.
A spouses pension equal to one half of the members pension is payable on the members death: childrens pensions may also be payable.
A lump sum of four times the members salary is also payable in the event of death in service.
Once in payment, pensions are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 3% per annum for benefits accrued before 5 April 1997 and in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5% per annum for pensions accrued after that date.
Except in the case of M C Donohue and C J Cole, the remuneration on which these benefits are based is subject to the Earnings Cap.
In the case of J H Bennett, the pension benefits which the Company has committed to provide which will be subject to the Earnings Cap will be calculated without regard to retained benefits under a personal pension arrangement.
The effect of this commitment has been included in the figures below.
Messrs Donohue and Cole have potential maximum pensions of two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
The table below sets out the disclosures for the executive directors who are members of the scheme under the Stock Exchange Listing Rules columns 2-4 and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 columns 5-8 :- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Increase in Transfer value of accrued pension Accumulated total the increase in Increase in over the year to accrued pension accrued pension accrued pension Transfer value of Transfer value of Increase in 29 February 2004 at the end over the year over the year to accrued pension at accrued pension at transfer value net of inflation of the year net of inflation 29 February 2004 28 February 2003 29 February 2004 over the year M C Donohue 28,534 189,537 459,399 32,919 2,481,184 3,226,284 723,077 R J Davies 4,164 33,275 34,097 4,957 210,749 330,591 113,500 J H Bennett 2,985 37,125 36,205 3,915 435,427 549,541 107,194 N T Fee 2,952 40,700 28,109 3,980 363,234 496,965 126,811 C J Cole 67,358 124,922 543,795 68,925 355,127 1,039,460 671,315 Notes 1The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the actuarial professions Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values in columns 4 and 8 are shown net of the directors contributions paid over the year.
2R J Davies left the scheme on 9 January 2004.
The value of his deferred benefits has been calculated using market conditions as at the year end.
3The rate of accrual of pension has changed during the year for some members.
Following an amendment to the schemes Trust Deed and Rules the schemes governing documentation accrued pensions are now calculated as one thirtieth of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service, although the maximum pension at age 60 remains unchanged at 2 3rds of final pensionable earnings subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Prior to this change some members accrued pension smoothly over their full period to normal retirement age, giving a lower accrual of pension in each year.
The change has resulted in higher accrued pensions for Messrs Donohue, Cole and Davies than would otherwise have been the case.
It has been assumed that Mr Coles accrued pension is not restricted by Inland Revenue limits.
