We look forward to further progress in 2005.
Richard Manning, President and CEO Hanson Building Products North America Operating and financial review continued Review of operations North America 2004 results compared with 2003 Hanson North America reported continuing operating profit improvement in 2004 of 6.9%.
Continuing turnover was 1,599.0m which was 0.5% below the prior year of 1,607.1m.
These results were impacted, as in 2003, by the weakening of the US dollar.
In constant currency, 2004 continuing turnover was 11.0% above the prior year.
Continuing operating profit of 215.3m was 13.9m above last year.
This includes an adverse exchange impact of 20.0m and on a constant currency basis the increase was 18.7%.
Dollar operating margins have increased from 12.5% to 13.5%.
The division benefited from property profits of 14.3m 1.7m and a reduction in the pension charge of 8.9m compared with 2003.
The improved performance is based on significant benets delivered from the 2003 reorganisation of the aggregates business together with operational improvements across the group.
Latterly, price increases have helped to mitigate the impact of significant input cost increases, most notably in the Pipe & Products division, and volumes were generally strong at the end of 2004.
All acquisitions completed in 2004 have been fully integrated and are ahead of pro-forma expectations.
We will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in 2005.
Aggregates Continuing turnover of 950.7m was 0.1% below the prior year of 951.4m.
Margins improved by 2.9ppts and continuing operating profit increased by 31.1% to 117.7m 89.8m, including 14.3m 1.7m of property disposal profits.
This improvement was achieved despite input cost increases in areas such as fuel and electricity.
The management team has successfully achieved a significant step change in performance.
This includes increased operating efficiencies, reduced costs and increased selling prices, based on good underlying demand, for most of the year.
All regions have improved profits and the annualised benets of the reorganisation targeted for 2005 are $30m.
Heritage aggregates and ready-mixed concrete volumes are up 2.4% and 1.4% respectively this year.
This is despite continued delays to the approval of SAFETEA, the successor bill to TEA-21.
Our strongest markets in the year have consistently been in the south east, particularly aggregates in North Carolina and Georgia.
Our operations in Texas had a challenging year, having been impacted by wet weather at critical times of the operating season and rail related supply issues in Houston.
Notwithstanding these short-term difficulties, year-on-year heritage volumes are at and we believe market fundamentals in Texas remain good.
In California, however, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt volumes have declined, mainly due to lack of state funded highway work.
Demand in our other markets generally remained robust.

Strong market demand led to a heritage brick volume increase of 3.4% over the prior year.

The concrete products business also delivered an improved performance compared with 2002.
Increased demand and order intake across the concrete ooring and precast product business added to the improved performance.
The packed products business had continued growth in 2003 and demand for bagged aggregate products continued to increase.
Outlook Economic outlook in the UK appears mixed.
The government has announced infrastructure and housing initiatives, but to date these have been slow to materialise due to both planning and funding constraints.
Aggregates and ready-mixed concrete demand is expected to remain at whilst we anticipate minor asphalt volume growth.
Brick demand is likely to be at although we expect our volumes to improve as a result of both stock availability and our recent acquisitions.
Recovery of input cost increases through selling price improvements and delivery of rationalisation benets in our Aggregates division remain the key priorities for 2005.
Capital expenditure on margin enhancing and cost saving activities will continue as will the pursuit of bolt-on acquisitions.
