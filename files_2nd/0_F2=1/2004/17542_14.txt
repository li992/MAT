EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by the Groups cash ow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be predictive of our potential future results.
We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortisation, which can vary signicantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions have occurred or non-operating factors.
Accordingly, EBITDA has been disclosed in this document to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies and of our ability to service our debt.
Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA identically, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
See the reconciliation of Group operating profit to EBITDA in the Operating and Financial Review, and the reconciliation of operating profit to net cash inow from operating activities in the note to the Cashow Statement.
EBITDA comprises total Group operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, both being non-cash items.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional one-off items comprising 90.1 million of expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering in July 2003, 15.0 million of expenses incurred in connection with our decision not to proceed with the initial public offering in July 2002, the non-recurring restructuring charges of 3.7 million as part of the integration of our McLeod organisation in the US in the 12 months ended 31 March 2003, and the non-recurring expenses of a terminated management incentive plan of 3.0 million in the 12 months ended 31 March 2002 and 11.6 million in the 12 months ended 31 March 2001. b Capital expenditure represents cash expenditure on tangible xed assets, net of sales proceeds.
c Effective 1 April 2002, the Group prospectively adopted SFAS 142 for US GAAP reporting purposes, which eliminated the requirement to amortise goodwill.
Adjusted net income loss presents the prior periods net income loss after eliminating the effect of goodwill amortisation from 1 April 1999.
