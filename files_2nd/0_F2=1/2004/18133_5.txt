PROPERTY REVIEW Our continuing Group strategy is to focus upon low risk high return properties in our core locations of London, Sweden and France.
We believe that our emphasis on actively managing the portfolio maximises long term capital returns.
The Group now owns 113 properties with a total lettable area of 585,350 sq m 6,300,850 sq ft, of which 45 properties are in the UK, 23 in Sweden, 43 in France, 1 in Germany and 1 in Luxembourg.
We have 506 commercial tenants and 1,291 residential tenants.
16 We target above average returns on equity through acquisition, active management, refurbishment, and selective sales.
Net rent is defined as contracted rent less net service charge costs.
Yields on net rents have been calculated by dividing the net rent by the book value.
Yields on receivable rents and potential rents have been calculated on the assumption that book values at 31 December 2004 will increase by refurbishment expenditure of approximately 14.3 million in respect of projects in the UK.
