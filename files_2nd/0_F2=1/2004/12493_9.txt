We will establish a safety committee for the Americas region, with representation from all Divisions in the region.
Committee members will participate in quarterly conference calls and share information on year-to-date safety performance results and best practice at their Divisions.
A Group safety representative will chair the calls.
The first such conference call took place on 26th January 2004 and included discussion of the lessons that were learned from the incident described later in this report in which a tornado hit the new Akron Brass manufacturing plant.
We intend to achieve OSHA 18001 accreditation at one of our major facilities in the UK.
OSHA 18001 is a recognised standard for health and safety management systems and a good complement for a major facility that already has ISO 14001 accreditation.
The Environment We are committed to reducing the impact of our activities on the environment.
For the past two years, we have collected and refined our data on the amount of energy used, employee business travel, waste disposed, waste recycled, water consumed, and greenhouse gas emitted by Group operations.
The data is presented in this report in two ways: total quantity of usage generation, and unit rates based on sales turnover i. e. quantity per 1,000 of sales.
In order to ensure that we have representative and reliable environmental data, our Group environmental managers reviewed the 2002 and 2003 data that was compiled by Group business units prior to preparation of this years report.
In some instances, we have restated the 2002 data displayed in last years report.
We consider the 2002 and 2003 figures displayed in this years report to be accurate and comparable.
