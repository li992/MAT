Investment Strategy Electras investment strategy was reviewed by the Board in 2004.
Following this review, with input from its advisers and Electra Partners, the Board concluded that, in the short term, Electras strategy should remain unchanged from that approved by shareholders in June 2001 and which concentrated on realisations and capital returns.
Under this strategy the realisation of the portfolio as at June 2001 will continue with at least two-thirds of future cash flow from such realisations being returned to shareholders.
