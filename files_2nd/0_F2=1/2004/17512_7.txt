0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:37 am Page 11 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 | 11 Outlook 1 2005 opened with a continuation of the positive market of 2004.
As many have remarked, the robust economic activity 2 in China and, to a lesser extent, India, underpins these market conditions, and it is expected that this will continue for some 3 time.
Clearly within the overall commodities market, different commodities will be subject to varying market forces and within 4 the cycle exhibit relatively stronger or in some cases weaker behaviour.
Given our range of commodity businesses, we expect 5 that overall 2005 will be another year of strong performance.
In addition, we expect our efficiency programmes to continue 6 to deliver ongoing real cost reductions across our various businesses.
Further, two of our projects will be commissioned this 7 year Rolleston and Black Star and the Group will benefit from the resultant growth in volumes and the lowering of unit 8 cost of production.
9 10 The company is thus well positioned to continue to deliver superior returns to its shareholders.
11 12 I pay tribute to the Board of Xstrata, which has provided immeasurable advice and support to management throughout the 13 year and into 2005.
This has resulted in a coherent and achievable strategy of value and growth maximisation.
The momentum 14 of our management team, guided by a prudent and robust Board, augurs well for Xstrata to further enhance its position along 15 the growth and value axis.
16 17 However, it is the people at the operations who have delivered in 2004.
They have ensured that our product has reached the 18 markets at a lower cost than previous years while at the same time enhancing our potential to extract even more value from 19 our assets going forward.
I congratulate them in the certain knowledge that they will continue to aim high as we continue 20 on our odyssey.

8 9 Summary: consolidated operational results 0 On the back of strong demand-led price increases across all of Xstratas commodities in 2004, Group turnover from continuing 1 operations increased by 47% on a pro forma basis to $6,462 million.
The most significant contributions to the increase came 2 from Xstratas coal and copper businesses, which accounted for approximately two thirds of Group turnover, where higher 3 received prices boosted turnover by 45% and 51% respectively on a pro forma basis.
Turnover from Xstrata Alloys was also 4 exceptionally strong, up by 76% compared to 2003, despite decreased production from the vanadium business following the 5 suspension of production at the Vantech operation in early 2004.
Higher zinc and lead prices increased turnover from Xstrata 6 Zinc by 27%.
7 8 Group EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2004 increased by 117% on a pro forma basis to $2,075 million.
Group EBIT 9 increased by 248% on a pro forma basis to $1,503 million.
The substantial increase in Group EBIT was recorded despite a weak 40 US dollar, with commodity price increases substantially outstripping the impact of stronger local currencies.

As a consequence of the MIM Group acquisition mid-way through 2003, the increase in turnover for Xstratas 9 businesses was 188% for copper, 69% for coal and 53% for zinc.
On a statutory basis, Group EBITDA increased 197% from 0 $700 million to $2,075 million and Group EBIT increased 368% from $321 million to $1,503 million.
1 2 The unfavourable foreign exchange unit cost variance of $468 million was due to the weaker average US dollar in 2004 against 3 all Xstratas local currencies compared to 2003.
During the year, the South African rand strengthened 15%, the Australian 4 dollar strengthened 13%, and the Euro was 10% stronger.
The stronger Australian dollar and South African rand had the 5 greatest impact on Group EBIT, resulting in a negative variance of $274 million and $167 million respectively.
The impact of 6 negative foreign exchange variances was partially offset through currency hedging which contributed an additional gain of 7 $55 million versus the previous year.
3 4 Depreciation and amortisation charges increased due to higher production levels, after allowing for the impact of foreign 5 exchange.
Other income and expenses includes closure costs associated with the Vantech and Windimurra vanadium operations.

Almost half of these real 29 cost savings were delivered from Xstrata Coal.
The significant transformation programme implemented in 2004 to improve 30 efficiency and productivity at the former MIM-owned North Queensland operations had considerable success, stripping out 31 over $52 million of operating costs in real terms during the year.
Throughput at the copper concentrating facilities at Mount 32 Isa increased significantly as a result of the transformation programme, and ore treatment rates also improved at Alumbrera in 33 South America, due to the commissioning of a third flotation circuit.
Higher costs associated with the accelerated underground 34 development work at Mount Isa were more than offset by the productivity and efficiency gains that resulted in the second half.
35 Alumbrera continued to benefit from low operating costs net of gold credits, although costs were impacted during 2004 by 36 budgeted falling head grades together with increased power and freight costs.
37 38 Productivity improvements and cost saving programmes at Xstrata Zinc led to record production at both European zinc smelters 39 during 2004 and further efficiency gains across the operations.
The transformation programme underway at Mount Isa also 40 delivered productivity improvements in 2004 which were partially offset by increased freight and other costs in Australia.
