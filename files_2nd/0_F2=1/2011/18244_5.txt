In accordance with the requirements of accounting standards the care homes have been included in the independent professional valuation at 31 March 2011 on the basis of the information which was available on that date.
We are actively exploring alternative courses of action aimed at sustaining the value of these properties.
However, it is likely that, at least in the short term, the income and the value of our care homes will be adversely affected.
At 31 March 2011 the combined book value of these properties represented 2.5% of the total investment property portfolio.
Development Activity I am pleased to report that work commenced on site at the beginning of January this year on our major scheme of refurbishment and extension of Africa House WC2.
Based on progress to date, the building will become available for occupation in early 2013.
Development projects can take several years to bring to fruition and at any time we have a number of potential projects under consideration.
The developments which we have completed in the last few years at 164 Shaftesbury Avenue WC2, 25 29 Worship Street, EC2 and 49 50 Great Marlborough Street WC1, are now all fully let.
