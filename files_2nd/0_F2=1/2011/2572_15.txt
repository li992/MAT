BUSINESS REVIEW OUR LINES OF BUSINESS Business overview Openreach is responsible for the last mile of the UK access Openreach network the copper wires and bre connecting homes and businesses to their local telephone exchange via xed-line local and During the year we continued to roll out our backhaul connections.
Openreach connects 5,600 exchange areas through approximately 120m kilometres of copper wire.
All super-fast broadband at scale and are on track Openreach customers currently approximately 490 CPs, including to pass 5m homes by spring 2011.

We have nearly 19,000 eld engineers who work on behalf of all CPs, enabling them to provide their customers with growth in our copper line base.

There are a number of CPs currently offering or trialling FTTC and FTTP.
At 31 March 2011 Openreach had identied 12 trial sites for its 11,000 FTTP product and already passed over 12,000 UK premises.
Growth in copper line base in 2011 Operating review 2011 was an extremely busy year for Openreach with high levels of demand across our products.
At 31 March 2011 Openreach was providing 16.9m WLR lines to other BT lines of business, and 6.2m 62% to other CPs.
By the end of the year, 89% of UK premises were served by an Increase in Ethernet connections unbundled exchange and there were 15.7m unbundled lines in the UK, up 6.5% on the previous year.
Of these, 8.1m were for other BT lines of business to support broadband services and 7.6m were for other CPs.
Thirty CPs are providing unbundled services, and Openreach is fullling more than 100,000 LLU orders a week.
This increase in LLU uptake was stimulated by further demand in the broadband market and drove overall engineering provision visits up over 25% year-on-year.
We completed over 65,000 Broadband Boost visits where engineers visit homes to improve broadband services.
