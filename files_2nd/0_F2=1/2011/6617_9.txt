However, with the exception of aluminium, base metals prices were on average 10% 15% lower in H22011 compared to H12011, which reflected increased investor and end user caution on the global growth outlook.
2011 was impacted by various macro events, such as the nuclear accident in Japan, social upheavals in North Africa and the Middle East and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
The pressures on equity and debt markets, driven by the financial uncertainties, had a knock-on effect on commodity markets, where prices decreased and demand weakened.
| Annual Report 2011 | 49 Zinc Copper Lead 2011 markets were particularly characterised by supply disruptions and continuing decline in mine ore grades.
Chile, which produces around one third of the worlds copper, saw its year on year production fall by 3.2%, while production from Indonesia was severely impacted by the more than three month strike at the Grasberg mine.
Production declined on an outright basis and is expected to continue to do so well into 2012 until the production cycle from ore to metal is re-established.
This lack of supply growth explains the relative strength in prices witnessed in the face of weak demand in Europe and USA.
Lack of new production is also relevant for zinc, though with China not being a net importer, zinc metal prices were relatively weaker.
The second half was dominated by reactions to the European financial crisis, in terms of price volatility on the terminal markets and consumer behaviour and purchasing patterns.
Inventories in China had declined from the high levels since the purchases in 2009 and 2010 when prices were lower.
Inventories in the US and Europe, which had seen major drawdowns since 2009, had not been rebuilt amid the uncertainty over Europe and were in fact cut even further throughout 2011 and remain that way.
Chinese buyers on the other hand, have used price weakness in the fourth quarter to purchase large amounts of metal for nearby delivery and rebuild the inventory pipeline to a more normal level, particularly for copper.
We also saw the first signs of demand strength in the US during Q42011, most evident in the automobile sector where production was ramped up, following the supply chain disruptions in Japan and Thailand.
There has been good consumer demand for zinc although purchasing was for current demand with no emphasis on restocking.
Alumina Aluminium The above mentioned market disruptions added complexity to the alumina aluminium business, which created several profitable transaction opportunities that allowed the department to maintain a robust and profitable base in 2011.
The more recent decline in prices has increased producer margin pressure with many no longer able to cover their production cost.
Indications for aluminium premiums for duty unpaid, in-warehouse material at the beginning of 2011 were $110 135 per tonne, with an average 2011 range of approximately $110 130 per tonne and a more recent level of $95 120 per tonne.
Investor demand for physical metal, supported by wide contangos, has kept overall physical markets reasonably balanced.
Ferroalloys Nickel Cobalt Iron Ore The global stainless steel industry experienced a continued slowdown in H22011, due to interalia destocking in all markets across the distribution chain.
Other ferroalloy consuming industries such as aerospace, automotive, oil and gas and plating remained strong throughout the second half.
The 2011 cobalt price was lower 11% compared to 2010.
The main reasons were i overstocking in the Chinese battery market, ii oversupply of producer metal and iii the loss of market share of Japanese battery producers mostly due to a strong Yen.
These factors were especially acute in Q4.
Many producers reduced their inventory over year-end, based on pessimistic forecasts for Q12012 however, we believe activity will be reasonable based on strong demand in the superalloy and battery sectors.
The iron ore price initially kept at a high level due to strong Chinese crude steel production matching the increased availability of material however, this balance started to change around September 2011.
Prices declined due to the postponement of certain European allocations, tighter credit availability and poor steel sales in China.
These concerns led to market prices falling c. $60 per DMT in a six week period to c. $115perDMT at the end of October.
Despite lower Chinese steel production levels, prices then recovered and stabilised in the $135 140 per DMT range, slightly above many marginal-cost producers cost of production.
MARKETINg Highlights Overall the 2011 result was solid albeit lower than the record 2010 performance.
The decline in performance was partly due to lower profits from the ferroalloys and zinc copper departments which performed strongly in 2010 when physical purchasing and restocking in Asia was particularly intensive, offset by higher volumes and profits in the aluminium alumina department.
Adjusted EBIT for 2011 was $1,242million, compared to $1,401million in 2010, a reduction of 11%.

Zinc Copper Lead 2011 zinc volumes were lower at 2.7million tonnes vs. 2.9million tonnes in 2010, while copper and lead volumes were consistent between the two years.
2011 profits were lower than 2010 but remained strong.
The decline was from a high base in 2010 which benefited from strong physical purchases and restocking in Asia.
Alumina Aluminium In 2011, the marketed volumes for alumina aluminium increased to 11.4million tonnes compared to 10.6million tonnes in 2010, representing an increase of 8%.
Arbitrage opportunities in aluminium were more favourable in 2011, with increased opportunities for inventory financing transactions and cash and carry deals.
Ferroalloys Nickel Cobalt Iron Ore Chrome ore output levels from South African producers continued to ramp up during 2011, which ensured a steady increase in monthly volumes.
Overall nickel volumes for all types of products remained strong and were similar to 2010 levels.
Cobalt volumes remained strong for the whole of 2011 compared with 2010 and confirmed existing trends in intermediate products, with a marked increase in exports.
Despite a slow start to the year due to severe supply disruptions in Canada, Brazil and Australia and the loss of supply from India due to the monsoon and the export ban iron ore volumes increased by 1million tonnes in 2011 compared to 2010, mainly due to increased availability of spot cargos in H22011.
Overall profits in 2011 were slightly below 2010 levels with a mixture of positive and negative year-on-year performances within the various individual commodity books.
INduSTRIAL ACTIVITIES Highlights Metals and minerals industrial activities performance continued to improve during 2011, driven by higher average prices in 2011 and increased production volumes at many of our operations.
Total industrial revenues for metals and minerals were $8,667million, up 18% from $7,322million in 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT for 2011 were $2,122million and $1,357million, up 14% and 17%, compared to $ 1,868million and $1,160million in 2010.
Controlled industrial assets only with the exception of Mutanda 40% owned where Glencore has operational control.
Lead metal includes lead contained in lead concentrates.
Copper metal includes copper contained in copper concentrates and blister copper.
4 Cobalt contained in concentrates and hydroxide.
5 Gold Silver conversion ratio of 1 44.53 and 1 60.63 for 2011 and 2010 respectively based on average prices.
| Annual Report 2011 | 53 OPERATIONS Kazzinc Glencore interest: 50.7% Zinc and lead output in 2011 was in line with 2010 production levels.
Processing silver-rich Dukatsky concentrate contributed to a 47% increase in silver production from 6.7million toz in 2010 to 9.9million toz in 2011.
Production of gold was 429,000 toz, a 23% increase compared to 2010 production of 348,000 toz.
Kazzinc is near completion of its New Metallurgy project at an estimated cost of $926million.
The project consisted of the construction of a 70,000tonnes per annum IsaSmelt Copper smelter refinery, a new acid plant, modernisation of the existing lead plant and construction of the necessary auxiliary operations.
The new copper smelter was commissioned in August 2011 with first copper cathode produced in the last few days of August which met all international requirements.
By the end of 2011, nearly 13,000tonnes of copper cathode had been produced at the Ust-Kamenogorsk copper smelter with a gradual ramp up to the 70,000tonnes per annum design capacity expected in 2012.
Ore processing at Altyntau Kokshetau was 5.7million tonnes in 2011, a 61% increase compared to 2010.
The Altyntau mills were each stopped in June and July for 45days to allow work to be completed which is expected to result in processing production capacity increasing to 8.0million tonnes per annum by 2013.
Reinforcement of the foundations underneath the two ball mills went well with both mills coming back into operation by the end of July and end of August respectively.
Some gold recovery issues still exist despite the installation of extra fine grinding capacity during the 45days stoppage period, which is expected to allow the liberation of more gold in the grinding stage and therefore increased recovery.
This challenge predominantly relates to the extremely hard nature of the ore which makes it difficult to grind below the necessary 4microns in order to recover the gold.
As a result, Kazzinc failed to meet its gold production target in 2011, however gold recovery rates have recently been improving.
In April2011, Glencore conditionally agreed to increase its stake in Kazzinc from 50.7% to 93.0% for a total transaction consideration of $3.2billion consisting of the issuance of $1billion of Glencore shares at its IPO price, equating to approximately 117million shares, and $2.2billion in cash.
Glencore and the seller are currently targeting an agreed Q32012 completion date.
As a result of further exploration drilling and technical studies, Kazzinc significantly increased its JORC compliant mineral reserves, at the Vasilkovskoye, Maleevsky and Ridder-Sokolny deposits with gold up 50%, silver up 84%, copper up 136%, lead up 62% and zinc up 67% compared to the JORC compliant reserves outlined in the IPO prospectus adjusted for depletion during 2011 see separate RNS release 5March 2012.
The effect of the higher mineral reserves has been to increase copper production, as compared to the plan outlined in the IPO prospectus, from own mined sources by 76% in 2012 and 230% in 2015.
Katanga Glencore interest: 75.2% Katangas contained copper in ore mined in 2011 amounted to 198,600tonnes, a 51% increase compared to 2010.
Ore mined and hoisted at the KTO underground mine in 2011 was 1.6million tonnes at an average 3.71% copper content, an increase of 23% compared to 2010, whilst ore mined at the KOV Open Pit in 2011 was 2.5million tonnes, 249% above 2010 production levels.
The copper grade of ore mined from the KOV Open Pit for 2011 averaged 4.98% copper content.
Ore milled at the Kamoto concentrator in 2011 amounted to 4.1million tonnes, an increase of 40% compared to 2010.
The current milling capacity at Kamoto of 7.7million tonnes per annum of ore is sufficient to support the life of mine plan through to 2014.
479,900tonnes of total concentrate were produced, representing a 58% increase compared to 2010.
Katanga continued to increase the production of oxide concentrate for sale as a finished product.
The construction of a 120,000tonnes per annum concentrate filtration and bagging facility was commissioned in the third quarter of 2011.
Copper produced in metal and concentrate for 2011 totalled approximately 91,200tonnes, an increase of 57% compared to 2010.
Total cobalt production in 2011 was 2,400tonnes, 29% lower than in 2010 as a result of lower head grades in the current copper ore body.
Katanga experienced certain operational disruptions at the old existing installations during 2011.
During Q42011, Katangas Board announced that it had approved the Updated Phase IV Expansion.
This acceleration of the PhaseIV will address the problems experienced during 2011.
Consistent with the completion of the Phase III Expansion project Katanga commissioned a front end engineering and early works report, which identified the following key items: an additional 100,000tonnes per annum solvent extraction plant, over and above the 200,000tonnes per annum solvent extraction SX plant described in the ITR Independent Technical Report to be constructed in front of the existing Luilu electrowinning EW plant.
The ITR detailed the conversion of the existing copper electrowinning facility at the Luilu refinery to a 200,000tonnes per annum capacity copper electrowinning facility fed by the 200,000tonnes per annum solvent extraction plant: 54 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Katanga reaching higher copper and cobalt production levels sooner than the timelines described in the ITR: an increase in expansionary capital expenditures from approximately $537million as described in the ITR to approximately $635million due primarily to the inclusion of the additional solvent extraction plant and an in-pit crusher at KOV Open Pit: and the increase of copper production to 270,000tonnes per annum of LME Grade A copper and thereafter the expansion of copper production to 310,000tonnes per annum, utilising anticipated cash flows from operating activities.
In order to expedite the commencement of the Updated Phase IV Expansion project, Katanga finalised the execution of a facility of up to $515.5million from Glencore which will fund the portion of the project not already covered by Katangas existing operating cash flow.
A further facility of $120million was drawn in full to fund the redemption on 30December2011 of Katangas outstanding CAD125 million 14% debentures which otherwise would have been due for repayment on 30November2013.

com Mutanda Glencore interest: 40.0% Mutanda is accounted for as an associate under Glencores operational control.
Total copper production in 2011, including both cathodes and copper in concentrate, was 63,700tonnes.
Copper cathodes contributed 44,000tonnes to the years production which was significantly higher than the forecast of 24,000tonnes.
Total copper production in H22011 of 37,900tonnes was 47% higher than the 25,800tonnes in H12011.
Total cobalt production in 2011, including both cobalt in hydroxide and cobalt in concentrate, was 7,900tonnes.
Total cobalt production in both concentrate and hydroxide in H22011 was 4,300tonnes, an 18% increase compared to the 3,600tonnes produced in H12011.
The PhaseI Hydrometallurgical Plant achieved design capacity of 20,000tonnes per annum of annualised copper cathode production in January2011.
Under the Phase II project construction of a 40,000tonnes per annum SX EW plant, EW2 and EW3 tank houses were commissioned ahead of schedule in April and June respectively.
The completion of the front end milling and leaching of the Phase II plant and associated cobalt circuit is expected in Q12012.
This, along with the already commissioned EW2 and EW3 tank houses, will increase overall plant capacity to 60,000tonnes per annum of copper cathodes and 18,000tonnes per annum of cobalt in hydroxide at design feed grades.
The optimisation of the front end of the Phase III plant and the associated cobalt circuit is expected to be completed by the end of Q22012 and Q42012 respectively which, along with the already commissioned EW4 tank house, will result in the overall hydrometallurgical complex being capable of producing 110,000tonnes per annum of copper cathodes and 23,000tonnes per annum of cobalt in hydroxide at design feed grades.
The acid plant, which has a design capacity of 390tonnes per day sulphuric acid and 73tonnes per day SO capacity, is currently 2 being commissioned.
The cost of the sulphuric acid plant and all three Phases of the Hydrometallurgical Plant is expected to be $734million.
Mutanda also continues to assess various other expansion options and is currently considering whether to expand the current plant capacity to 210,000tonnes per annum with an initial cost estimate of $670million or to expand the existing plant capacity to 150,000tonnes per annum in conjunction with the construction of a new 100,000tonnes unit sulphide concentrator.
Mutanda, in conjunction with Katanga and Kansuki, is engaged in a project to secure power for all three operations through the refurbishment of two turbines at the Inga dam which is expected to provide 450megawatts of power.
The project is being executed in partnership with SNEL, the national power operator in the DRC, and EGMF, the project contractor.
The initial cost estimate is $340million, which will be contributed by Mutanda, Katanga and Kansuki.
The amount invested will be recovered via lower electricity tariffs.
Glencore holds a 50% interest in Kansuki Investments Sprl which in turn holds a 75% interest in Kansuki Sprl, the owner of the Kansuki concession, thereby giving Glencore an effective interest of 37.5%.
Kansuki is a 185square kilometre copper and cobalt pre-development project which borders the Mutanda concession.
A total of $135million of capital expenditure for mine and plant development has been committed of which $103million has been spent.
Exploration of the Kansuki concession is ongoing.
Discussions with respect to a potential combination of the Mutanda and Kansuki operations are ongoing with a view to ultimately obtaining a majority stake in the merged entity.
| Annual Report 2011 | 55 Mopani Glencore interest: 73.1% Total contained copper in ore hoisted and mined was 6% higher than in 2010 whilst total contained copper in concentrate for 2011 was 9% higher than 2010 due to the improved ore deliveries from mining.
2011 gross anode production from the smelter of 208,200tonnes was 5% higher than 2010 levels, which was driven by increased concentrate receipts and improved recoveries.
Total finished copper from own sources in 2011 was 7% higher compared to 2010 whilst total finished copper for 2011 at 204,400tonnes, including purchased material and toll, was the highest achieved since Mopanis inception.
Finished cobalt production in 2011 was 18% lower compared to 2010, primarily due to the lower cobalt grades in both Mopani and purchased concentrates.
Cobalt production was further adversely affected by the re-alignment of the Nkana concentrator to maximise copper concentrate production as well as the cobalt roaster being put on care and maintenance.
There are a series of major capital expenditure projects underway to increase mine production and continue to improve and modernise the smelter.
The Synclinorium project is a new shaft development which should provide access to 115million tonnes of copper ore and is expected to yield 4million tonnes per annum of ore by 2018 replacing and improving on production from the current ore bodies in Nkana.
It will be mined for approximately 18years with an average grade of 1.85% copper content and 0.06% cobalt content.
Forecast capital expenditure for the project is $323million.
In metallurgy, the Smelter Phase III project is currently underway and includes the installation of three new converters, gas cleaning equipment and a second acid plant, which will improve sulphur dioxide emissions capture to above 97%.
The project is on schedule and forecast capital expenditure for the project is $145million.
Other Zinc Los Quenuales Glencore interest: 97.5% Los Quenuales, which comprises of the Iscaycruz and Yauliyacu mines, continued its strong production performance in H12011 throughout the whole year.
Total ore processed at Iscaycruz was 43% higher than in 2010 the mine having reopened in April 2010.
Zinc and lead head grades did decline modestly but the higher overall volumes resulted in a 24% increase in the production of zinc concentrates whilst lead concentrate production levels effectively remained unchanged.
Total ore processed at Yauliyacu was 2% lower than in 2010, although zinc concentrate production remained unchanged due to improvements in recovery and head grade.
In late April2011, Los Quenuales ceased production of a single complex bulk concentrate, instead opting for separation into lead and copper concentrates.
These separate concentrates are more readily saleable under current market conditions.
In aggregate, as a result of the slight reduction in volumes treated and lower head grades, Yauliyacu produced 5% less bulk lead copper concentrates in 2011.
Sinchi Wayra Glencore interest: 100% Production at Sinchi Wayra was significantly higher compared to 2010.
Ore treated and zinc concentrate produced was 15% higher whilst lead and tin concentrates produced were 29% and 25% higher respectively.
These improvements were the result of a number of efficiency programs and low value short pay-back capex expansion projects.
These positive factors were slightly offset by a heavier than normal rainy season.
Recovery issues in the Colquiri concentrator, as noted in the Interim Report2011, have been addressed and largely resolved.
Negotiations with the Bolivian government to amend Sinchi Wayras mining contracts in accordance with the new constitution are ongoing and whilst progress has been made, the final outcome and the timing thereof cannot be determined at this stage.
AR Zinc Glencore interest: 100% Production levels were consistent with prior years and in line with expectations, with zinc metal production increasing by 6% year on year.
The Palpala lead smelter had a maintenance shutdown during January and returned to full capacity thereafter however, as a result of the shutdown, lead metal production for the year was 17% lower than 2010 levels.
The Aguilar mine produced 15% more lead in concentrate compared to 2010, with the surplus unable to be treated at Palpala being exported.
Perkoa Glencore interest: 50.1% Construction is currently ongoing, with first production expected later this year.
It is expected that the mine plan will be improved by adding a new opencut source of ore, increasing planned plant capacity.
These planned improvements which should also increase the life of mine and total overall production.
56 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Other Copper Cobar Glencore interest: 100% Total production for 2011 was 44,700tonnes of copper contained, an 11% reduction compared to 2010.
This decrease is largely attributable to a temporary reduction in loader availability and lower head grades.
The main capital expenditure project currently underway is the shaft extension which will reduce operating costs per unit, allow access to more ore and increase production.
The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2013 and total forecast capital expenditure for the project is $175million.
Punitaqui Glencore interest: 100% During 2011 Punitaqui produced 39,000tonnes of copper concentrates, an encouraging first full year of production given operations only started toward the end of 2010, following the mines acquisition in February 2010 and subsequent refurbishment.
Alumina Aluminium Sherwin Alumina Glencore interest: 100% Production in 2011 was 1,460,100tonnes, an increase of 16% compared to 2010, which was primarily due to the restart of the fifth digestor unit at the beginning of 2011.
Key capital expenditure projects include the re-bundling of the vertical heat exchangers which is ongoing and the increase in calciner capacity which is close to completion.
Ferroalloys Nickel Cobalt Iron Ore Murrin Murrin Glencore interest: 100% Production in 2011 was 30,000tonnes of nickel packaged and 2,100tonnes of cobalt packaged, a 6% and 5% increase compared to 2010 production of 28,400tonnes of nickel and 2,000tonnes of cobalt.
This increase was despite production being impacted by various issues including a series of electrical storms, heavy rain and flooding as well as maintenance issues.
The failure of an acid plant heat exchanger in June saw production continuing at a reduced rate before the tie-in of a new temporary unit in July.
In October, the acid plant was shut to facilitate the tie-in of the replacement heat exchanger.
Production subsequently improved in the second half of the year, reflecting increased plant availability and increased processed ore-grade following the ramp-up to full production from the Murrin Murrin East ore body.
Capital expenditure in 2011 was strictly contained and included the development of the Murrin Murrin East mine, commissioning of the high-density slurry project and work on a sixth reduction autoclave and second flash vessel unit in the refinerys nickel circuit, all of which commenced prior to 2011.
In September 2011, Glencore launched an all cash offer to acquire all the remaining Minara shares not already owned by Glencore.
In November, following the successful closure of the offer, Glencore acquired the remaining shares and now owns 100%.
The total consideration in respect of the minority buyout was approximately $265million.
