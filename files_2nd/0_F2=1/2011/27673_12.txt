aresult of enhanced investment performance in a number of key products.
The improved investment performance over 2011 initially reduced outflows and subsequently increased sales: we believe this trend could lead to positive flows in 2012.
In 2012 and beyond, we expect to make investments in our global distribution capabilities to further leverage Group capabilities and distribution platforms.
This will enable USAM to better leverage the affiliates investment expertise for clients around the world.
We remain committed to achieving our financial goals of 25% to 30% operating margin and expect continued improvement in USAMs margin in 2012, particularly if equity markets remain strong throughout the year and NCCF turns positive.
However, we will continue to invest in the business by incurring current expenses which may partially inhibit margin growth in the short term but will achieve important financial and strategic objectives in future years.
