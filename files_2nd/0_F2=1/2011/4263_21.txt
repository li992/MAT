Directors report other information  History and development CSR plc is the holding company of an international group of companies, the principal activities of which are the design and supply of integrated circuits silicon chips and multifunction platforms for a broad range of devices and applications that are used in a variety of consumer electronics products.
CSR is domiciled in England and Wales, and its registered office and principal place of business is at Churchill House, Cambridge Business Park, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WZ.
CSR was established in Cambridge in April 1999 by an engineering and marketing team that previously worked at Cambridge Consultants Limited, a technology and consulting firm based in Cambridge that transferred certain assets, including the assignment and license on a non-exclusive royalty free basis of intellectual property rights, to CSR in exchange for ordinary shares.

In connection with the acquisition of Zoran Corporation in August 2011, ordinary shares issued by CSR in the form of American Depositary Shares ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ Global Select market.
Beginning in 2005, we have sought to broaden our technological base and product range through a series of acquisitions, as follows: In March 2005, we acquired Clarity Technologies, Inc. for $17.1 million, in cash.
In August 2005, we acquired the software business of UbiNetics VPT Limited for $48 million in cash.

In January 2007, we acquired NordNav Technologies AB for an initial consideration of $40 million, in cash.

Through the acquisition, Zoran provided the enlarged CSR group with imaging and video capabilities to further strengthen CSRs core business within its existing markets and to create new growth opportunities within global electronics markets such as internet-enabled, location-aware digital cameras, enhanced video and imaging, capable automotive infotainment platforms and peripherals.
Sales and marketing CSRs sales and marketing function is centered in Cambridge, United Kingdom and San Jose, United States with sales liaison offices in Detroit, Sunnyvale, Burlington and Plano, United States: Haifa, Israel: Hsinchu and Taipei, Taiwan: Seoul and Gumi, South Korea: Tokyo, Japan: Singapore: Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, China.
CSR markets to OEMs and ODMs, principally through its direct sales force and, in North America, through sales representatives.
CSR also markets its products through a global network of distributors.
CSRs marketing efforts are supported by a team of applications engineers who provide technical support and assistance to existing and potential customers in designing, testing and qualifying systems that incorporate its products.
This support is generally provided without charge to customers who have the potential to purchase large volumes of products.
An important part of CSRs marketing effort involves providing technical support to product developers to encourage them to design products using CSRs chips.
For this purpose, CSR provides a range of development kits and tools.

For a discussion of CSRs revenues by geographic area, see Business and Financial Review Financial Performance Geographical Analysis of this Annual Report.
Manufacturing and assembly CSR is a fabless semiconductor company, which means we subcontract all aspects associated with the manufacture and testing of our products prior to shipping to our customers.
TSMC and ASE remain the primary vendors for wafer fabrication, test, assembly and packaging although we have enlarged our supplier base following the acquisitions of SiRF and Zoran.
CSR sources the manufacture and test of its products from a number of locations across the world, comprising Taiwan, United States, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
We do not have long-term contracts with any of these third parties, and thus have no contractual assurance as to their long-term availability or the costs associated with the supply of products and services.
Through all our subcontractors, we work to ensure that the Group is able to maintain sufficient capacity to support the demand for our products.
Such continuity of supply can be affected in the event of a loss of capacity at a supplier due to events affecting their business, or increased demand from our competitors which may mean we are unable to secure the volumes of products we require to meet customer demand.
This is discussed in more detail on pages 42 and 43 in the section which explains risk factors which might affect our business.
Raw materials CSR sources the manufacture of its silicon wafers, and sources the testing of wafers and packaging of its integrated circuits from various subcontractors named above, who have facilities spread across multiple locations, primarily in the Asia Pacific region.
CSR also purchases memory and certain other passive components from other commodity suppliers.
These are standard components capable of being obtained through alternative sources, subject to the conduct of a product qualification process prior to adoption into manufacturing.
Seasonality CSR has historically experienced increased net revenue in its second and third quarters primarily due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and end of calendar year spending patterns in corporate budgets.
Due to continued economic uncertainty and other factors, past historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of CSRs future net revenue or financial performance and historical seasonal patterns may not recur.
Governmental regulation CSR is not aware of any governmental regulations that would have a material effect on its business.
Intellectual property Our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology.
As of 30 December 2011, we had approximately 1,400 patents granted worldwide with expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2031 and approximately 1,100 pending patent applications.
We intend to continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provides significant competitive advantage.
Although we file patents to protect our inventions, our revenue is not dependent on any particular patent.
We do not believe that the expiration or loss of a particular patent would materially harm our business.
CSRs Bluetooth products use the Bluetooth trademark, which is owned by the Bluetooth SIG, or special interest group, a trade association of which CSR is a member.
Any company incorporating Bluetooth wireless technology into products or services, or re-branding a product with Bluetooth technology, must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG.
The Bluetooth trademark is licensed on a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal basis for use by companies that are incorporating qualified Bluetooth wireless technology into their products.
CSR is a licensee of the Bluetooth trademark.

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Companys objects are unrestricted, as set out in clause 4 of the Companys Memorandum of Association.
Directors The business of the Company is conducted under the supervision of the Board.
Conflicts of interest The Companies Act 2006 requires a director of a company who is in any way interested, directly or indirectly, in a contract or proposed contract with the Company to declare the nature and extent of his interest to the other directors of the Company.
The Companies Act 2006 also requires that a director must avoid a situation where a director has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the companys interests.
It allows directors of public companies to authorise such conflicts where appropriate, if a companys articles of association so permit.
CSRs Articles of Association provide that the Board may in specified circumstances authorise any matter that would otherwise involve a director breaching his duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a conflict of interest.
They also provide that, subject to authorisation of such conflict, a director may retain any benefit derived by reason of that interest.

The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends or other moneys payable in respect of CSRs shares from a person with a 0.25% interest if such a person has been served with a restriction notice after failure to provide CSR with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act 2006.

CSR may stop sending cheques, warrants or similar financial instruments in payment of dividends by post in respect of any shares or may cease to employ any other means of payment, including payment by means of a relevant system, for dividends if either i at least two consecutive payments have remained uncashed or are returned undelivered or that means of payment has failed or ii one payment remains uncashed or is returned undelivered or that means of payment has failed and reasonable inquiries have failed to establish any new postal address or account of the holder.
In addition, CSR must resume sending dividend cheques, warrants or similar financial instruments or employing that means of payment if the holder requests such resumption in writing.
Voting rights Members will be entitled to vote at a general meeting or class meeting whether on a show of hands or a poll.
Under the Companies Act 2006: a on a show of hands every member who is present in person is entitled to one vote regardless of the number of shares he or she holds.

Where he appoints more than one proxy, the proxies appointed by him taken together shall not have more extensive voting rights than he could exercise in person.

A demand so withdrawn shall not invalidate the result of a show of hands declared before the demand was made.
Under English law, any shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at a meeting of the company.
Generally under English law, two shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for the purpose of a general meeting, unless the companys articles of association specify otherwise.
The Articles of Association specify that two members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote constitute a quorum for all purposes.
Under the Articles of Association, no member is entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting in respect to any share held by him if any call or other sum then payable by him in respect of that share remains unpaid or if a member has been served with a restriction notice after failure to provide CSR with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act 2006.
Rights to share in profits Other than the provisions outlined above in relation to dividends that have been declared and the provisions below in relation to rights on a liquidation of CSR, shareholders have no rights to share in the profits of CSR.
Pre-emptive rights Subject to the Companies Act 2006, any equity securities issued by CSR for cash must first be offered to CSR shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings of CSR ordinary shares.
The Companies Act 2006 and the listing rules made by the UK Listing Authority, allow for the disapplication of pre-emption rights, which may be waived by a special resolution of CSR shareholders, either generally or specifically, for a maximum period not exceeding five years.
Liquidation rights The rights of shareholders to share in any surplus in the event of liquidation are not expressly dealt with in the Articles of Association.
Under English law, if CSR is wound up whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of the Court, or by the Court, the liquidator is under a duty to collect in and realise the assets of CSR and to distribute them to CSRs creditors, and, if there is a surplus, to CSR shareholders according to their entitlements.
This applies whether the assets consist of property of one kind or of different kinds.
Redemption provisions Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the listing rules, CSR may purchase or contract to purchase any of its ordinary shares on or off-market.
CSR may only purchase its ordinary shares out of distributable reserves or the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose of funding the repurchase.
Sinking fund provisions CSR shares are not subject to any sinking fund provision under its Memorandum or Articles of Association or under English law.
Capital calls Shareholders have no liability for capital calls by the Company except with respect to the unpaid amount, if any, respecting their shares consisting of the nominal value of the shares and any premium which may be payable on those shares.
The directors can call on shareholders to pay such amounts that have not yet been paid to the Company for their shares.
Provisions applicable only to significant shareholders There are no provisions in the Memorandum or Articles of Association discriminating against a shareholder as a result of his or her ownership of a substantial number of shares.
Variation of rights The Articles of Association provide that the rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.
At every such separate general meeting except an adjourned meeting the quorum must be two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares.
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares are not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking equally with them.

An annual general meeting of shareholders must be held once in every year within a period of six months beginning with the day following CSRs accounting reference date.
CSRs Board may convene a general meeting of shareholders whenever they think fit or where they are requisitioned to do so by CSR shareholders in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
General meetings may be held at such time and place as may be determined by CSRs Board.
An annual general meeting must be convened on at least 21 days written notice to shareholders entitled to receive notices.
General meetings must be convened on at least 21 days written notice unless the requisite majority of shareholders has agreed to short notice.
Two shareholders must be present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote to constitute a quorum for all purposes at general meetings of CSR.
Limitation on voting rights Persons who are neither residents in the UK nor UK nationals may freely hold, vote and transfer shares in the same manner as UK residents or nationals.
Any member whose registered address is not within the UK can give the Company a postal address within the UK or an address for electronic communications at which notices may be served on him.
Otherwise, a member whose registered address is not within the UK is not entitled to receive any notice from the Company.
Change of control The Company can issue additional shares with any rights or restrictions attached to them as long as not restricted by any rights attached to existing shares.
These rights or restrictions can be decided by the directors so long as there is no conflict with any resolution passed by the shareholders.
The ability of the directors to issue shares with rights or restrictions that are different than those attached to the currently outstanding ordinary shares could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing change of control of the Company.
Disclosure of interests in shares The UK Financial Services Authority and Disclosure and Transparency Rules impose an obligation upon a person who acquires or ceases to have notifiable interest in the relevant share capital of a public company to notify the company of that fact within two days excluding weekends and bank holidays of his or her knowing of its occurrence.
In addition, the Companies Act 2006 provides that a public company may, by notice in writing, require a person whom the company knows or reasonably believes to be or to have been within the three preceding years, interested in the companys issued voting share capital to 1 confirm whether this is or is not the case, and 2 if this is the case, to give further information that the company requires relating to his interest or any other interest in the companys shares of which he is aware.
The Articles of Association provide that if the holder of any shares or a person who appears to be interested in those shares, fails to comply within the relevant period with any statutory notice in respect of those shares, or makes a statement in response to the notice which is false or inadequate in a material particular, CSR may restrict the rights relating to the identified shares, following a restriction notice.
The restriction notice will state that the identified shares no longer give the shareholder any right to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a shareholders meeting or to exercise any right in relation to the shareholders meetings.
Where the identified shares make up 0.25% or more in amount or in number of the existing shares of a class at the date of delivery of the restriction notice, the restriction notice can also contain the following further restrictions: i the Board can withhold any dividend or part of a dividend or other money otherwise payable in respect of the identified shares without any right to the holder to receive any shares in lieu of dividend: and ii the Board can refuse to register a transfer of any of the identified shares which are certificated shares unless the Board is satisfied that they have been sold outright to an independent third party.
Once a restriction notice has been given, the Board is free to cancel it or exclude any shares from it at any time they think fit.
In addition, it must cancel the restriction notice within seven days of being satisfied that all information requested in the statutory notice has been given.
Also, where any of the identified shares are sold and the Directors are satisfied that they were sold outright to an independent third party, they must cancel the restriction notice within seven days of receipt of the notification of the sale.
The Articles of Association do not restrict in any way the provision of the legislation which apply to failures to comply with notices under the legislation.
The UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers imposes rigorous disclosure requirements affecting parties to a proposed takeover, their associates and persons acting in concert in relation to the shares of a company.
These requirements also extend to dealings by persons who directly or indirectly own or control either before or as a result of the dealing 1% or more of the equity shares in an offeror or offeree company or of any other class of shares relevant to the offer in question.
Rule 13d-1 of the U. S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that a person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 5% of equity securities registered under that Act discloses such information to the SEC within 10 days after the acquisition.
CSR is required by the listing rules of the UK Listing Authority to disclose in its annual report the identity and share interests of its directors and any persons connected with them, as defined in the Companies Act 2006, and of any person with an interest of 3% or more of its CSR ordinary shares.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 152 Full version AR 290898. pdf 156 14 03 2012 17:20:37 Persons discharging managerial responsibilities PDMRs primarily directors and some senior executives, and their connected persons, must notify a public company such as CSR in writing of the occurrence of all transactions conducted on their own account in the shares of the company, or derivatives or any other financial instruments relating to those shares within four business days of the day on which the transaction occurred.
The notification must contain specified information, including the name of the person involved, the type of transaction, the date on which it occurred, and the price and volume of the transaction.
The public company must notify a regulatory news service which will make the information public of any information notified to it in accordance with these provisions.
The notification to a regulatory news service must be made as soon as possible, and in any event by no later than the end of the business day following the receipt of the information by the company.
The Board has recently reassessed which members of the Companys executive should be regarded as PDMRs for the purposes of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
In light of developments in the business and reflecting existing roles and responsibilities, with effect from 1 January 2011, we regard as PDMRs, in addition to the directors, all those who report to the CEO with executive responsibility for each of our three business units, and the General Counsel.
Differences from law in host country With respect to the items described above, applicable UK law is not significantly different from applicable US law.
Changes in share capital CSR may by ordinary resolution increase, consolidate, or consolidate and then subdivide its shares or any of them.
Subject to the Companies Act 2006, CSR, by resolution, may determine that, as between shares resulting from a subdivision, any of them may have a preference or advantage, or may be subject to restrictions as compared with the others.
CSR may, by special resolution, reduce its share capital, share premium account, capital redemption reserve or any other undistributable reserve.
Material contracts Excluding contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, no contracts have been entered into in the two years preceding the date of this document by CSR or any other member of the Group that are considered material to its results or operations, other than the merger agreement with SiRF and the merger agreement with Zoran.
On 21 February 2011, CSR entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Zoran Corporation.
An amended and restated agreement and plan of merger was subsequently entered into by the parties and Zeiss Merger Sub, Inc. on 16 June 2011.
Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, Zeiss Merger Sub, Inc. a subsidiary of CSR was merged with and into Zoran Corporation, with Zeiss Merger Sub, Inc. as the surviving corporation but subsequently renamed Zoran Corporation.
Zoran was acquired by CSR for a consideration of $440.5 million satisfied in cash and the issue by CSR of ordinary shares in the form of ADSs to Zoran shareholders.
The acquisition was completed on 31 August 2011.
This transaction is discussed further in the section entitled Business and Financial Review on page 9.
Exchange controls There are currently no foreign exchange control restrictions on CSRs ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares or on the conduct of its operations imposed by English law.
There are currently no limitations on the right of non-residents or foreign owners to hold or vote CSR ordinary shares imposed by English law or CSRs Articles of Association.
Taxation US Holders US federal income tax matters The following general discussion describes the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares that are generally applicable to US holders as defined below.
However, this discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular US holders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances or to persons that are subject to special tax rules.
In addition, this discussion does not address the tax treatment of special classes of US holders, such as banks, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions, broker-dealers, persons that actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting stock of CSR, persons holding CSR ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or as part of a straddle, US expatriates, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, and non-US holders.
This discussion may not be applicable to holders who acquired CSR ADSs or ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants or otherwise as compensation.
Furthermore, this discussion of US federal income tax matters does not give a detailed discussion of any US federal estate or gift tax considerations, state or local tax considerations or tax considerations with respect to any non-US jurisdiction.
We urge you to consult your own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences of the ownership of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares, including the applicable US federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences to you of the ownership of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
As used in this discussion of US federal income tax consequences, a US holder means a holder of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares who or that holds such ADSs or stock as a capital asset within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, and is for US federal income tax purposes i a citizen or resident of the United States, ii a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, iii an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or iv a trust a if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more US persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a US person.
As used herein, a non-US holder refers to any holder of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares other than a partnership who is not a US holder.
This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code, applicable Department of Treasury regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice, all as of the date of this Annual Report.
This discussion is not binding on the US Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, or the courts.
Future legislative, judicial, or administrative changes or interpretations, which may or may not be retroactive, may adversely affect the accuracy of this discussion.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 153 Full version AR 290898. pdf 157 14 03 2012 17:20:37 Directors report other information Corporate and share information continued Ownership of ADSs For US federal income tax purposes, a US holder of CSR ADSs generally will be treated as the owner of the underlying shares represented by the ADSs.
Accordingly, withdrawals or deposits of ordinary shares in exchange for CSR ADSs generally will not be subject to US federal income taxation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the holder of an ADS and the issuer of the security underlying the ADS may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the beneficial ownership of the underlying shares for example, pre-releasing ADSs to persons who do not have the beneficial ownership of the securities underlying the ADSs.
Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of United Kingdom taxes and the availability of the reduced rate of tax for dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders, as described below, could be affected by actions taken by intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the holder of CSR ADSs and CSR if, as a result of such actions, the holders of CSR ADSs are not properly treated as the beneficial owners of the underlying ordinary shares.
We are not aware of any intention to take any such actions, and accordingly, the remainder of this discussion assumes that holders of CSR ADSs will be properly treated as the beneficial owners of the underlying ordinary shares.
Passive foreign Investment Company Rules Special US federal income tax rules apply to US holders owning stock of a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC.
A foreign corporation generally will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year in which i 75% or more of its gross income is passive income, or ii 50% or more of the average value of its assets are considered passive assets generally, assets that generate passive income.
Based upon an analysis of CSRs holdings during the taxable year ended 30 December 2011 of cash and liquid assets such as bank deposits and marketable securities all of which are passive assets for these purposes and CSRs share price for such period which affects the valuation of certain assets, including goodwill, CSR believes that it did not qualify as a PFIC for its taxable year ended 30 December, 2011.
Moreover, CSR believes that it will not qualify as a PFIC for its taxable year ending 28 December 2012.
However, the determination of whether a company is a PFIC is highly factual, and will depend, among other things, upon CSRs actual holdings of passive assets and share price during such period.
Given CSRs significant holdings of passive assets such as cash and marketable securities, if CSRs share price were to decline for an extended time to levels comparable to its low point during November 2011, it is possible that CSR would be treated as a PFIC in a future taxable year.
CSR will continue to monitor whether it qualifies as a PFIC, and will notify US holders of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares if it determines that it is a PFIC for a given taxable year.
If CSR were classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which US holders hold CSR ADSs or ordinary shares, US holders would be subject to special, adverse rules unless, as described below, they make either a QEF election or a mark-to-market election with respect to their CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
Absent such elections, US holders gain from the sale or other disposition of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares and excess distributions received from CSR would be ordinary income.
Such income would be taxed as if the gain or excess distribution had been realized ratably over the US holders holding period and would be increased by an interest charge with respect to underpayments of tax as if the ratable portion of the gain or excess distribution with respect to a given prior taxable year had been subject to tax in such year.
An excess distribution generally would be any distribution to a US holder with respect to CSR ADSs or ordinary shares during a single taxable year that is greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such US holder with respect to CSR ADSs or ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, during his or her holding period with respect to the CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
For these purposes, gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganizations, and pledges of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares for use as a security for a loan may be treated as taxable dispositions.
US holders who make neither a mark-to-market election nor a QEF election will be required to file an IRS Form 8621 if they own CSR ADSs or ordinary shares in any year in which CSR is a PFIC and they receive a distribution from CSR or dispose of their CSR ADSs or ordinary shares and will also be required to file this form to make certain elections with respect to their CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
In addition, under recently enacted legislation, and subject to future guidance, in any year in which CSR is a PFIC, each US shareholder could be required to file an IRS Form 8621 regardless of whether or not such US shareholder received a distribution from CSR or disposed of his or her CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
Mark-to-market election If CSR ADSs or ordinary shares are considered to be traded on a qualified exchange or other market, US holders would not be subject to the foregoing PFIC taxation rules if they make a mark-to-market election with respect to their CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
Although the determination of whether shares are traded on a qualified exchange or other market is factual and there is no specific authority that designates certain non-US exchanges as qualified exchanges, CSR expects that US holders of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares will be able to make this election because CSR ADSs are currently traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market and CSRs ordinary shares are currently traded on the London Stock Exchange.
However, no assurance can be provided in this regard.
After making such an election, US holders generally would include as ordinary income in each year during which the election is in effect and during which CSR is a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares at the end of the taxable year over their adjusted basis in such CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
US holders also would be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of their adjusted basis in CSR ADSs or ordinary shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year but only to the extent of the net amount of income that was previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election.
US holders tax basis in CSR ADSs or ordinary shares would be adjusted to CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 154 Full version AR 290898. pdf 158 14 03 2012 17:20:37 reflect any income or loss amounts resulting from a mark-to-market election.
If made, a mark-to-market election would be effective for the taxable year for which the election was made and for all subsequent taxable years in which CSR is a PFIC unless the CSR ADSs or ordinary shares were not considered to be traded on a qualified exchange or other market or the IRS consented to the revocation of the election.
For any year for which CSR is not a PFIC, the mark-to-market election is inoperative.
US holders make the mark-to-market election on IRS Form 8621, which must be filed along with their tax return for the taxable year for which the election is to take effect on or before the due date for such return including extensions.
US holders who decide to make the mark-to-market election are advised to make the election for the first taxable year for which CSR is a PFIC.
US holders must report income and loss with respect to the election for each year for which CSR is a PFIC on IRS Form 8621.
QEFelection The PFIC taxation rules outlined above also would not apply to US holders that elect to treat CSR as a qualified electing fund or QEF.
US holders that are eligible for and timely make a QEF election, would include in income each year for which CSR is a PFIC and would be subject to current US federal income tax on their pro rata share of CSRs ordinary earnings, as ordinary income, and net capital gains, as long-term capital gain, for the taxable year that ends with or within their taxable year, regardless of whether such amounts are actually distributed.
Any such ordinary income would not be eligible for the favorable rates applicable to qualified dividend income.
Corporate US holders would not be eligible for a dividends received deduction in respect of such income or gain.
US holders adjusted tax basis in CSR ADSs or ordinary shares would be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits.
Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed would result in a corresponding reduction in US holders adjusted tax basis in CSR ADSs or ordinary shares and would not be taxed again.
US holders would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for their pro rata share of any losses that CSR incurred with respect to any year.
US holders may only make a QEF election if CSR provides them with the information needed to determine CSRs ordinary earnings and net capital gains.
If it is a PFIC, CSR will provide US holders with the information that is necessary in order to make a QEF election and to report their shares of ordinary earnings and net capital gains for each year for which CSR is a PFIC.
CSR has had substantial taxable income in prior years, and may have taxable income in 2011 or any future year in which it is a PFIC.
As CSR historically has not made cash distributions with respect to its CSR ADSs or ordinary shares, US holders may be taxed on significant phantom income if they make a QEF election.
A US holder may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but any taxes deferred would be subject to an interest charge.
For any year for which CSR is not a PFIC, the QEF election would be inoperative.
If US holders make a QEF election, they would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
The QEF election is made by each US holder, and can only be revoked with the consent of the IRS.
US holders make the QEF election on IRS Form 8621, which must be filed along with their tax return for the first taxable year to which the election will apply on or before the due date for such return including extensions.
US holders who decide to make the QEF election are advised to make the election for the first taxable year for which CSR is a PFIC.
A US holder also must file Form 8621 with the IRS for each subsequent year that the election is in effect.
US holders cannot make both a mark-to-market election and a QEF election.
US holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the potential application of the PFIC rules to their ownership and disposition of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares, including the availability and advisability of making a mark-to-market or QEF election.
Taxation of dividends Subject to the PFIC rules described above, for US federal income tax purposes, a US holder will generally include in gross income the amount of any dividend paid by CSR to the extent paid out of CSRs current and or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, as ordinary income when the dividend is actually or constructively received by the depositary, in the case of CSR ADSs, or by the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares.
Individual US holders currently are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% on dividends received from qualified foreign corporations, provided the US holders satisfy certain holding period and other requirements.
In order to be treated as a qualified foreign corporation, CSR must be eligible for benefits of the United States income tax treaty with the United Kingdom.
Although CSR believes that it is currently eligible for such treaty benefits, there can be no assurance that this will be the case for any taxable year.
Further, individual US holders will not be eligible for the reduced rates of dividend taxation if CSR is a PFIC for the taxable year of the dividend payment or the preceding taxable year.
Corporate US holders will be taxed on dividends received from CSR at a 35% tax rate.
Dividends generally will be income from sources outside of the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, and generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction that is allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.
Distributions in excess of CSRs current and or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the US holders tax basis in the CSR ADSs or ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain.
The amount of the dividend includible in the income of a US holder will be the US dollar value of the dividend determined at the spot rate on the date that dividend is includible in the income of the US holder, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at such time.
A US holder will have a basis in any GBP distributed by CSR equal to the US dollar value of the GBP on the date it is actually or constructively received by the US holder.
Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend payment is includible in income to the date that payment is converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 155 Full version AR 290898. pdf 159 14 03 2012 17:20:37 Directors report other information Corporate and share information continued Taxation of capital gains Subject to the PFIC rules described above, upon a sale or other disposition of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares, a US holder will generally recognize gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized and the US holders tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
Gain or loss recognized will be long-term capital gain or loss with respect to CSR ADSs or ordinary shares held for more than 12 months at the time of the sale or other disposition and any gain recognized generally will be income from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.
Backup withholding and information reporting In general, dividend payments with respect to CSR ADSs or ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares made or deemed made within the United States may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and US backup withholding currently at a rate of 28%.
Backup withholding will generally not apply to a holder who: furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on a Form W-9, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules: is a corporation or otherwise exempt from backup withholding and, when required, demonstrates this fact: or provides a certification of foreign status on Form W-8BEN or a successor form.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against a holders US federal income tax liability, provided the holder furnished the required information to the IRS.
In addition, for taxable years beginning after 18 March 2010, new legislation requires certain US holders who are individuals that hold specified foreign financial assets which may include CSR ADSs or ordinary shares to report information relating to such assets, subject to certain exceptions.
US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of CSR ADSs or ordinary shares.
Additional tax on investment income For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, U. S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on unearned income, including, among other things, dividends on, and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of, CSR ADSs or ordinary shares, subject to certain limitations and exceptions.
US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of the additional tax on investment income described above.
UK tax matters The following paragraphs summarise the material UK tax consequences for investors who are not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes including US investors who are not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes regarding ownership and disposal of CSR ordinary shares.
The following paragraphs, which are intended as a general guide only, are based on current UK tax legislation and what is understood to be HM Revenue & Customs the UK tax authority practice which are both subject to change at any time, possibly with retrospective effect.
They summarise certain limited aspects of the UK tax treatment of holders of CSR ordinary shares and apply only to the position of holders of CSR ordinary shares who for UK tax purposes are beneficial owners of their CSR ordinary shares, hold their CSR ordinary shares as an investment and not as assets to be realised in the course of a trade and are not treated as having acquired their CSR ordinary shares by reason of their or anothers employment.
Holders of CSR ordinary shares who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult an appropriate professional adviser immediately.
Taxation of dividends Under current UK tax legislation, no tax will be withheld by CSR from cash dividend payments.
Holders of CSR ordinary shares who are resident outside the UK will generally not receive any payment from HM Revenue & Customs in respect of any tax credit on dividends paid by CSR.
Holders of CSR ordinary shares who are not resident, or, in the case of individuals, ordinarily resident, in the UK and who do not carry on a trade, profession, or vocation in the UK through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in connection with which their CSR ordinary shares are held, used or acquired will not generally be liable to pay any UK tax in respect of any dividends received on their CSR ordinary shares.
Holders of CSR ordinary shares who are resident, or, in the case of individuals, ordinarily resident, in the UK or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in connection with which their CSR ordinary shares are held, used or acquired are encouraged to consult appropriate professional advisers.
The Board will at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting be proposing that a final dividend be paid in respect of the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 of $0.071 per ordinary share.
Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend will be paid on 1 June 2012, to shareholders of record on 11 May 2012.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 156 Full version AR 290898. pdf 160 14 03 2012 17:20:37 Taxation of capital gains A holder of CSR ordinary shares who is not resident, or, in the case of an individual, ordinarily resident, in the UK will not ordinarily be liable to UK tax on capital gains realised on the disposal of CSR ordinary shares, unless, at the time of the disposal, he or she carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency in the case of an individual shareholder or a permanent establishment in the case of a corporate shareholder and those CSR ordinary shares are, or have been, used, held or acquired for the purposes of that trade, profession or vocation or branch or agency or permanent establishment as the case may be.
A holder of CSR ordinary shares who is an individual and who is temporarily resident outside the UK may be liable on his return to the UK to UK tax on capital gains arising during the period of absence, subject to any available exemption or relief.
Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax No UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax UK SDRT will generally be payable on the issue of CSR ordinary shares.
Subject to the paragraph below, where CSR ordinary shares are issued or transferred i to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person whose business is or includes the provision of clearance services a Clearance Service or ii to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts a Depositary Receipt System, UK stamp duty or UK SDRT will generally be payable at the rate of 1.5% of the consideration paid rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5 in the case of UK stamp duty.
The UK stamp duty or UK SDRT will generally be paid by the Clearance Service or the Depositary Receipt System, as the case may be, but will, in practice, generally be required to be reimbursed by CSR or by the ultimate holder of the CSR ordinary shares.
A Clearance Service can elect under section 97A of the Finance Act 1986 Section 97A, provided certain conditions are satisfied, for the normal rate of UK stamp duty or UK SDRT generally no charge on issue and a charge at 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration paid, rounded up to the nearest 5 in the case of UK stamp duty, on transfer to apply to issues or transfers of CSR ordinary shares into, and transactions within, such Clearance Service instead of the higher rate of 1.5% generally applying to an issue or transfer of CSR ordinary shares into the Clearance Service and the ability to transfer CSR ordinary shares while in the Clearance Service without there being UK stamp duty or UK SDRT.
Following a decision of the European Court of Justice in October 2009, HM Revenue & Customs have announced that they will not seek to apply the 1.5% UK SDRT charge where new shares are first issued into an EU Clearance Service or an EU Depositary Receipt System.
In light of that announcement, it would seem that, in the view of HM Revenue & Customs, the 1.5% UK stamp duty or UK SDRT charge will continue to apply to the transfer of existing shares to Clearance Services or Depositary Receipt Systems, in each case whether or not in the EU and that the 1.5% UK SDRT charge will continue to apply to the issue of new shares to non-EU Clearance Services or non-EU Depositary Receipt Systems.
However, a charge to UK SDRT at 1.5% on the issue of new shares to a non-EU Clearance Service or a non-EU Depositary Receipt System is arguably not consistent with the aforementioned decision of the European Court of Justice and the lawfulness of the charge in those circumstances is currently subject to challenge before the UK courts.
No UK stamp duty or UK SDRT will generally be payable on the issue of CSR ordinary shares into CREST the London Stock Exchanges paperless trading system, but, subject to the paragraph above, UK SDRT will be payable to the extent that the CSR ordinary shares are issued to, or into the CREST account of, a Clearance Service or a nominee or agent for a Clearance Service which has not made an election in relation to the CSR ordinary shares under Section 97A or to, or into the CREST account of, a Depositary Receipt System or a nominee or agent for a Depositary Receipt System.
The UK stamp duty or UK SDRT will generally be paid by the Clearance Service or the Depositary Receipt System, as the case may be, but will, in practice, generally be required to be reimbursed by CSR or the ultimate holder of the CSR ordinary shares.
Subject to an exemption for certain low value transactions, the transfer on sale of CSR ordinary shares in certificated form will generally give rise to a liability, usually met by the purchaser, to ad valorem UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5 of the amount or value of the consideration paid.
An agreement to transfer such shares which is or becomes unconditional will generally give rise to UK SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration paid, such UK SDRT generally being payable by the transferee or purchaser.
The liability to UK SDRT will generally be cancelled or any UK SDRT paid will be refunded if the agreement is completed by a duly stamped transfer within six years of either the date of the agreement or, if the agreement was conditional, the date when the agreement became unconditional.
A transfer of CSR ordinary shares on a paperless basis through CREST will generally be subject to UK SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration paid, which will be collected and accounted for to HM Revenue & Customs by CREST such UK SDRT generally being borne by the transferee or purchaser.
No UK stamp duty or UK SDRT will arise on a transfer of CSR ordinary shares into CREST provided that, in the case of UK SDRT, the transfer is not for money or moneys worth.
Generally, a gift of CSR ordinary shares or a transfer of such shares from a nominee to the beneficial owner will give rise to neither UK stamp duty nor UK SDRT.
The above statements are intended only as a general guide to the current UK stamp duty and UK SDRT position.
Transfers to certain categories of person are not liable to UK stamp duty or UK SDRT and transfers to others may be liable at a higher rate.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 157 Full version AR 290898. pdf 161 14 03 2012 17:20:37 Directors report other information Corporate and share information continued Risks Related to owning CSR ordinary shares and ADSs We may be treated as a PFIC.
As a non-US corporation owning substantial cash assets, there is an ongoing risk that we may be treated as a passive foreign investment company PFIC for US federal income tax purposes depending on the ratio of the share price of ordinary shares which affects the valuation of certain assets including goodwill to our holdings of cash and liquid assets such as bank deposits and marketable securities.
A non-US corporation generally will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year in which 75% or more of its gross income is passive income, or 50 %.
or more of the average value of its assets are considered passive assets generally, assets that generate passive income.
This determination is highly factual, and will depend on, among other things, our market valuation and future financial performance.
We believe we were not a PFIC for the taxable year ended in 30 December 2011, but if we were to be classified as a PFIC for any future taxable year, holders of ordinary shares or ADSs who are US taxpayers would be subject to adverse US federal income tax consequences.
Shareholders in countries other than the United Kingdom willsuffer dilution if they are unable to participate in future pre-emptive equity offerings.
Under English law, shareholders usually have pre-emptive rights to subscribe on a pro rata basis in the issuance of new shares for cash.
The exercise of pre-emptive rights by certain shareholders not resident in the United Kingdom may be restricted by applicable law or practice in the United Kingdom and overseas jurisdictions.
In particular, the exercise of pre-emptive rights by US shareholders would be prohibited unless that rights offering is registered under the US Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act applies.
Furthermore, under the Deposit Agreement for the ADSs, the Depositary Bank generally will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the US Securities Act, or exempt from registration under the US Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs.
If no exemption applies and we do not wish to register a rights offering, shareholders in the United States may not be able or permitted to exercise their pre-emptive rights.
We are also permitted under English law to disapply pre-emptive rights subject to the approval of our shareholders by special resolution and investor committee guidance on the limits of any such disapplication and thereby exclude certain shareholders, such as overseas shareholders, from participating in a rights offering usually to avoid a breach of local securities laws.
The rights of our shareholders willbe governed by English law and differ from the rights of stockholders under US law.
Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, the rights of shareholders and, therefore, certain of the rights of holders of ADSs, will be governed by English law and by the Articles.
These rights differ from the typical rights of shareholders in US corporations.
For example, the rights of shareholders to bring proceedings against us or our directors or officers or generally on behalf of a class of shareholders or other claimants may be more limited under English law than under the corporate law and case law of US jurisdictions.
Shareholders in countries other than the United Kingdom may have difficulty in effecting service of process on us or our directors in the US, in enforcing US judgments in the UK or in enforcing US securities laws in the UK courts.
Most of our directors and some of the experts named in this document are residents of countries other than the United States.
As a result, it may not be possible for our shareholders in countries other than the UK to effect service of process within the United States upon all of our directors and executive officers and some of the experts named in this document or on us, or to obtain discovery of relevant documents and or the testimony of witnesses.
Our shareholders in countries other than the UK may have difficulties enforcing, in courts outside the United States, judgments obtained in the US courts against any of our directors and some of the experts named in this document or us including actions under the civil liability provisions of the US securities laws.
Those shareholders may also have difficulty enforcing liabilities under the US securities laws in legal actions originally brought in jurisdictions located outside the United States.
The market value of our ADSs and dividends may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the pound sterling.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the pound sterling will affect the US dollar price of our ADSs and the market value of ordinary shares when expressed in US dollars.
If the relative value of sterling to the US dollar declines, the US dollar price of the ADSs and the US dollar equivalent of the price of ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange will also decline.
We paid, and may in the future pay, cash dividends on the ordinary shares in sterling.
A decline in the relative value of sterling to the US dollar would also result in a decline in the US dollar value of these dividends.
The market price of our ordinary shares and ADSs is volatile.
Stock markets in general have been recently experiencing significant price and volume volatility.
Technology stocks in particular have experienced wide fluctuations in prices, in some cases unrelated to the issuers operating performance.
Our ordinary shares and ADSs are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors, including but not limited to fluctuations in results of operations, acquisitions, litigations, announcements of new products, product enhancements or technological advances by us or our competitors, changes in earnings estimates by market analysts, and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries.
Our share price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations by financial analysts, changes in investors or analysts CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 158 Full version AR 290898. pdf 162 14 03 2012 17:20:37 valuation measures for our stock, changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market trends unrelated to our performance.
The market price of our ordinary shares and ADSs could be adversely affected by these factors and fluctuations.
Liquidity in the market for our securities may be adversely affected by our maintenance of two exchange listings.
Our ADSs are traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market and our ordinary shares are listed on the premium segment of the Official List and trade on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
This dual listing may dilute the liquidity of our securities in one or both markets.
Holders of our ADSs may not have the same voting rights as the holders of ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to be able to exercise their right to vote.
Except as described in the Deposit Agreement, holders of ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights on an individual basis, and must instruct the Depositary Bank on how to vote the shares underlying their ADSs.
Because of this extra procedural step involved, the process for exercising voting rights could take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of ordinary shares and, as a result, holders of ADSs may not be able to effectively exercise voting rights.
