The origin of goods being used in the development ofthe In Salah Gas southern elds in Algeria bear outour wide purchasing scope.
The Sharjah-based procurement team has, for example, bought gas turbine generators from California, structural steel and are fabrication from the UAE, line pipe from Turkey and Argentina, compressor rotors and glycol packages from Italy, substation packages from the UK, vessels from South Korea and chrome line pipe coating fromNorway.
Post purchase, our southern elds logistics teams, based in Sharjah and Algeria, handle the challenging and complex task of ensuring goods arrive securely and on schedule at In Salahs desert location via several Algerian ports.
This exacting task involves thecross-continental integration of information, transportation, material handling, packaging andsecurity.
Petrofac was awarded the US$1.2 billion lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction project to develop the southern elds at the beginning of 2011.
The project is due to deliver first gas in early 2014.
