Despite this the UK economy remains under pressure as government austerity measures take hold.
Trading volumes have remained low over the last year and have returned to levels last seen in 2000.
However, there are tentative signs that the M&A and IPO markets are starting to improve as the corporate sector has gained in con dence and fide-leveraged over the last couple of years.
The landscape however, remains highly competitive.
In South Africa market activity has remained muted over the past 12 months with total JSE activity recording a 12% improvement.
The agency component of this has actually contracted slightly over the period, down 2%.
Competition in the institutional broking space has intensi ed over the past year.
This has been driven by a combination of new entrants to the equity market along with some brokers rebuilding their teams post the financial crisis.
The hedge fund industry has experienced a challenging year as the closure of some high pro le hedge funds resulted in the contraction of assets in the industry.
However, improving visibility on regulatory issues is lifting interest in the industry and while tentative at this point, the industry seems to have stabilised.
For corporate finance in South Africa we expect local and cross-border M&A transactions to continue to drive activity, even though increased 88 regulation and governance effects deal lead time.
The Australian M&A and capital markets remain challenging but are showing signs of improvement.

93 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Divisional review Investment Banking continued Southern Africa Institutional Securities experienced a challenging financial year Agency revenues decreased 9% as some market share growth in the local institutional space was offset by a sharp reduction in revenues from our prime broking activities The closure of two large hedge fund clients necessitated the re-sizing of the Prime Broking business at the end of 2010 Our international agency revenues declined marginally as international ows into the region remained subdued Facilitation losses, experienced when committing capital to capture trade ow, increased sharply Intense broker competition combined with dif cult equity markets saw the loss ratio move higher The SA UK hedge book performed well and revenue from this source increased signi cantly.
Australia New accounts have been opened and the trading activities are going well We are publishing quarterly research which is receiving very positive investor feedback.
Principal Investments Southern Africa The Direct Investments portfolio increased to R2 511 million at 31 March 2011 March 2010: R1 587 million.
The increase in value was primarily due to a good performance from the portfolio The Private Equity portfolio was R3 838 million at 31 March 2011 March 2010: R3 301 million.
We continued to expand the capacity of our private equity investments through the acquisition of two new private equity assets as well as large capital projects and expenditure within the portfolio.
The bene ts of these activities will only be felt in future financial years.
The increase in value in the current year was driven by a good performance of the underlying investments and acquisitions mentioned.
Australia During the year two additional assets were added to the Direct Investments portfolio which co-invests with the private equity funds.
These are both listed equities.
The Direct Investments portfolio increased in value by A$5.1 million during the year.
The increase in value was primarily due to revaluations of listed equities.
Outlook Corporate Finance While market conditions remain uncertain, the pipeline in the UK business is looking positive and includes a number of potential fundraisings The deal pipeline in the South African business remains reasonable The Australian M&A and capital markets remain challenging but are showing signs of improvement.
Continuing economic uncertainty suggests M&A and capital markets will recover slowly.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading Considering the UK businesss investment in sales, trading and research we believe that we are well positioned to gain further market share The outlook for the next 12 months remains challenging in the South African business.
The intensity of competition in the market is unlikely to abate and the resource pool for specialist skills is set to remain tight.
Nevertheless, we forecast a return to pro tability next year on the back of our key strategies to grow market share amongst the foreign client base, reduce loss ratios associated with capital commitment and to better leverage our specialist skills into the broader investment bank.
The Australian business has signi cant potential but is not without a measure of risk.
The team members who have been hired to grow this business have a considerable amount of high quality experience and an extensive client network, however, as this is a new business for Investec Bank Australia the coming 12 months will be critical to ensuring its success.
