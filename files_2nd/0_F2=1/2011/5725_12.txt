22 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Vanadium is predominantly used as an alloying agent to increase the strength of Vanadium Market in 2011 steel.
Nearly 85% of the vanadium used in this process is ferrovanadium, which is used as an alloying agent for iron and steel, while Demand was robust for vanadium pentoxide is used as a catalyst for the production of sulphuric acid.
Vanadium vanadium in the first half of 2011. consumption is heavily aligned with levels of steel production, particularly high-strength steel grades.
Whilst demand was robust for vanadium in the first half of 2011, due to strong growth in steel production, prices for ferrovanadium Share of Vanadium Production and vanadium pentoxide remained at the and Reserves same level as 2010 in the first half of 2011, Total Production: 59.5 kt Total Reserves: 13.6 mt before decreasing towards the end of the year.
World resources of vanadium exceed 63 mt, 2.5 0.3 most of which are in China, Russia and South 25.7 Africa.
However, as vanadium is mainly recovered 33.6 37.4 as a byproduct or coproduct, these resource 38.7 levels are not an indicator of available supplies.
