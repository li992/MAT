forecast, there was an improvement on 2010.
This improvement, in combination with mining efficiencies and scheduling, enabled Cerrejn to exceed its theoretical production capacity of 32 Mtpa for the first time, resulting in a 7% increase in production year-on-year.
Projects The 6.6 Mtpa Zibulo mine in South Africa reached commercial operating levels in the fourth quarter of 2011, ahead of schedule.
01 Also in South Africa, the New Largo project, currently at feasibility stage, has two main elements: a new opencast mine and a conveyor which will run from an existing coal plant to an Eskom power station.
The operation plans to mine domestic thermal coal and Thermal Coal is currently negotiating a coal supply agreement with Eskom for delivery into its Kusile power station.
Initial coal from the mine is expected in 2015.
In Colombia, Phase 1 of the Cerrejn P500 expansion project, to increase production by 8Mtpa, was approved by Cerrejns three shareholders in the third quarter of 2011.
First coal is targeted during the fourth quarter of 2013, with the project expected to achieve full production at the end of 2015.
As at the end of 2011, the project was on schedule and on budget.
Outlook The international seaborne thermal coal 02 market is expected to remain in balance during 2012, as increased supply from the main exporting countries of Australia, Indonesia and Colombia is consumed by the developing Asia-Pacic economies, aided by Japans recovery from the recent natural disasters.
Growth in thermal coal consumption is expected to continue in both China and India, reecting rising energy demand as their economies grow strongly.
In Europe, demand for thermal coal is expected to be consistent with 2011, with minimal demand growth in line with forecast weak GDP growth in the region.
The Atlantic market is expected to continue to see the impact of strong US thermal coal exports in reaction to the increasing supply of US domestic gas and low US gas prices.
