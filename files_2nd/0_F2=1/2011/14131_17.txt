The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and best practice guidelines.
During the year, the Committee undertook a thorough review of the variable arrangements for the executive directors and other members of the Severn Trent Executive Committee.
This review included an examination of both the quantum and structure of the variable pay arrangements and the measures used to assess performance.
The conclusions of this review were as follows: Richard Davey The Committee determined that the structure of awards cash bonus, deferred share Chairman of the Remuneration Committee bonus with matching and long term incentive plan awards remained appropriate and the significant proportion of variable pay delivered in shares provided a strong alignment The Committee assists the board by between the interests of management and shareholders.
focusing on the activities detailed below, reporting to the board on decisions and The quantum of rewards remains competitive and no changes were proposed to current actions taken, and making any award levels.
necessary recommendations: The performance measures and weighting of the targets for the annual bonus plan the remuneration policy and its Severn Trent Water KPIs, personal performance and Severn Trent Services performance application to the Chief Executive for the Chief Executive and Finance Director continue to provide a strong and challenging and executives reporting to the assessment of the financial and operating performance of the business.
The annual Chief Executive: bonus will therefore continue to operate on the same basis for 2011 12, save that Severn Trent Water performance will be measured by reference to 20 rather than 18 KPIs.
the adoption of annual and longer term incentive plans: Relative TSR remains an appropriate measure of performance for the Share Matching Plan, providing alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
In the absence of a determination of levels of reward to the sufficient number of listed utility companies, the current FTSE 51-150 comparator group Chief Executive and approval of is considered the most relevant benchmark for measuring performance.
However, to reward to executives reporting to the address the share price volatility caused by the uncertainty of the five year pricing review, Chief Executive: rather than measuring performance over a single three year period, a multi-point setting the Chairmans fee: and measurement basis will be applied to future grants 20% over 0-18 months, 30% over 0-27 months and 50% over 0-36 months.

RoRCV was chosen as the measure of performance because it directly targets managements delivery of the business plan.
For awards granted in 2011, 0% of the shares will vest if RoRCV equals the Final Determination, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% vesting if RoRCV exceeds the Final Determination by 2% p. a. and 100% vesting for outperformance of 7% p. a. or more.
Performance will be based on the average RoRCV over three financial years, starting in the year in which the award is granted.
Further details on the performance measure for the 2011 award are set out on page 48.
The Committee believes that the new performance measures for the Share Matching Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan will provide a more rounded assessment of the overall financial and operational performance of the business and will provide a clearer line of sight for executives between performance and reward.
