healthinnovation Reducing the number of heart-related deaths Germany is proud of its healthcare system yet still has high mortality rates for coronary heart disease.
Herzbewusst heart conscious is a programme designed to help people help themselves in preventing acute coronary syndromes and, for the first time in Germany, has included a variety of stakeholders from the outset.
In 2004, 150 out of every 100,000 German male coronary patients died, whereas in the Netherlands, it was less than 100.
One in eight of those who survive a heart attack in Germany dies within a year.
Combating this requires better education, encouraging people to make healthier lifestyle choices such as improving diet, taking more exercise and quitting smoking this can help not only prevent the first heart attack but also safeguard patients lives after the event.
We developed the Herzbewusst programme in conjunction with the German Federation of Cardiologists in Private Practice and in cooperation with public and private health insurance funds.
In addition to physicians and healthcare practitioners, the campaign, launched in October 2010, is aimed at the public.
A series of high-profile events and advertising has included installations at a Berlin train station and Regional Heartdays offering free consultations from cardiologists and nutritional guidance.
