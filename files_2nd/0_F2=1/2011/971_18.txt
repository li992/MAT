Chinese stainless steel production negatively impacted demand, and the market was broadly in balance for the full year.
Global ferronickel production increased to 378,000 tonnes in 2011 from 336,000 tonnes in 2010 a 13% increase.
Once again, China dominated global nickel demand, accounting for approximately 42%, a 14% increase when compared with the previous year.

During the first half of of the Barro Alto project and higher output at the year the nickel price was supported by Loma fide Nquel and Codemin.
Barro Alto was demand growth from the stainless steel commissioned in March 2011 and produced industry and a supply gap owing to mine 6,200 tonnes.

The price peaked in February above 1,310c lb.
However, prices softened an increase of 15% over the prior year, mainly due to an additional two months considerably in the second half, reecting ongoing concern around uncertainty over the of production from the electric furnace 2, which was restarted in March 2010.

A range of scenarios is being considered in respect of the conditions for renewal of Loma fide Nquels three remaining concessions, due in November 2012, and for access to the cancelled concessions.
Codemins production of 9,500 tonnes was 12% higher than in 2010, when the operation was impacted by the planned relining of a furnace.
The impact of lower grades in 2011 was more than offset by process improvements that increased throughput capacity.
Projects The Barro Alto project delivered first metal on schedule in March 2011 and is expected to reach full capacity rates at the beginning of 2013.
Our Nickel business promising unapproved projects in Brazil, Jacar and Morro Sem Bon, have the potential to increase production by more than 66,000 tpa, with further upside potential, which would leverage the Groups considerable nickel laterite technical expertise.
Jacar, with mineral resources of 3.9 Mt of which 2.6 Mt are in Inferred Resources of contained nickel, will enter the pre-feasibility study phase in 2012 and has the potential to signicantly strengthen Anglo Americans position in the worldwide nickel market.
Outlook Nickel production from the Nickel business unit is expected to be signicantly higher in 2012 as a result of the ramp-up of Barro Alto.
The nickel market is expected to be in surplus 01 in 2012, with increasing supply coming on line from new projects.
However, there is a possibility that the surplus could be mitigated by supply falling short of expectations, mainly from projects using new technologies, such as high pressure acid leaching.
The nickel price in 2012 is expected to be heavily influenced by the delivery of these new projects and by how the European economic situation develops.
High cost NPI supply will continue to support a price ceiling or oor.
The long term outlook for nickel is positive, underpinned by stainless steel demand driven by economic growth and urbanisation in emerging economies.
