Petrofac 36 Annual report and accounts 2011 Integrated Energy Services continued During the year, we made good progress 2011 oil production exceeding 2010 oil the reactivation of shut-in wells, and a on Integrated Energy Services portfolio production from the elds.
Overall project to achieve automated measurement ofassets, both operational and in production averaged approximately 3,500 on high production wells.
An update on our key bpd of oil equivalent in 2011 of which 93% projects is provided below: was oil production and 7% gas production.
