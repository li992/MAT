com Growth projects We are expanding a number of our mines and smelters and developing a Once commissioned, our approved projects will cement our top-five market 36 number of world-class new operations and we remain on track to commission position in major commodities.
New lower cost production will reduce overall seven major expansion projects during 2012.
Our projects will increase average operating costs by around 20% and our projects will deliver robust copper-equivalent volumes by 50% by the end of 2014 and reduce overall returns, even at conservative long-run commodity prices.
We are also progressing a range of projects at each stage of Commissioned in 2011 the project development cycle.
Our organic pipeline comprises: Since 2002, we have successfully commissioned a total of 22 major projects.
t 20 approved major projects in implementation, comprising a further In 2011, we commissioned 10 projects in total, four of which commissioned $12 billion of capital expenditure: and ahead of schedule.
t 46 projects in feasibility, pre-feasibility or concept stage that will provide future growth options across a range of geographies and commodities.
