com Operating review: Nickel continued Outlook 62 Markets Uncertainty over European sovereign debt and persistently high Global demand for nickel improved during 2011 reecting increased unemployment in the US is likely to impact market sentiment in 2012: production of Chinese stainless steel, particularly austenitic grades, however we expect continued growth in the developing world to continue to which mitigated much of the impact of a weaker macro environment for support global consumption of nickel.
European stainless steel production softened in the second half of 2011, as concerns over sovereign debt and lower order We expect additional supply from the ramp up and commissioning of new intake levels prompted a draw-down of inventory levels.
While the US projects to meet higher demand in 2012.
In the event that projects are again was slow to recover from the traditional summer slowdown, melt rates delayed or ramp up is slower than expected, nickel from nickel pig iron in picked up towards the end of 2011 as industrial demand increased.
China is largely expected to bridge any supply shortfalls.
Although Japans major stainless steel mills were largely undamaged by the earthquake and tsunami that hit the country in March, overall Global nickel demand domestic industrial production remains curtailed and Japanese stainless kt steel melt rates were affected by a slowdown in export orders in part due to the strength of the yen which impacted competitiveness.
1,800 Non-stainless steel demand represents approximately one-third of total nickel consumption and is closely correlated to levels of industrial production.
1,600 A recovery in key industrial sectors such as aerospace, power generation and oil and gas supported higher levels of nickel consumption.
Super-alloy production and nickel plating for automotives were particularly robust market 1,400 segments in 2011.
Global production of nickel during 2011 was impacted by a number of 1,200 planned and unplanned disruptions, including interrupted production at a ferronickel plant in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in March and supply disruptions or planned shutdowns in Australia, Canada and Colombia.

Global nickel stocks During the year, production of nickel pig iron in China continued to provide a kt exible yet typically high cost source of nickel to supply Chinas stainless steel 200,000 industry.
With nickel prices above the higher cost of nickel pig iron production for much of the year, this exible source of supply offset disruptions and delays elsewhere.
150,000 The LME cash settlement nickel price was volatile during 2011, ranging between $7.68 per pound and $13.17 per pound to average $10.36 per 100,000 pound, 5% higher than the average in 2010.
Average LME nickel prices were up 21% in the first half of the year, but prices in the second half were signicantly lower.
LME inventory declined steadily between January and July, 50,000 reecting continued demand growth in China coupled with supply disruptions and the delayed ramp up of a number of new projects.

com Operating review: Nickel continued Sudbury 64 Nickel production from our Sudbury mines increased by 28% to 19,795 tonnes of nickel in concentrate.
Nickel Rim South continued to achieve a strong operating performance and a full years production from the Fraser mine also contributed to the increase.
Total ore mined from these two mines increased by 23% to reach 1.5 million tonnes.
We are building on this solid performance with the extension of Fraser mine in the fourth quarter of 2012 in partnership with Vale, and by delivering the Fraser Morgan project in 2013.
Combined, these projects will extend Frasers life of mine to 2025.
Our agreement with Quadra FNX to lease our Craig mine infrastructure provides us with valuable revenue and cost offsets for unutilised assets, while offering possible future synergistic benets for the development of the Onaping Depth project.
A period of significant copper contained in Nickel Rim South ore and mining at Frasers copper zone led to record mined copper in concentrate production of 50,000 tonnes from our Strathcona Mill, up 38% from our performance in 2010.
Our Sudbury smelter produced 6% less nickel in matte than last year, but production exceeded our plans for the year of 69,000 tonnes.
This result was primarily due to lower planned concentrate grades, a reduction in the custom feed materials processed and a oneweek maintenance shutdown deferred from December 2010 to January 2011.
Record fourth quarter Sudbury, Canada production this year helped to offset these impacts.
We have successfully Nickel production from our Sudbury mine increased by 28% to 19,795 developed innovative technical responses to necessary enhancements of the tonnes of nickel in concentrate.
Nickel Rim South continued to achieve smelter to meet regulatory emissions requirements in order to enable low cost a strong operating performance and a full years production from the and value-accretive capacity enhancements up to 85,000 tonnes of nickel per Fraser mine also contributed to the increase.
Raglan Our Raglan mine treated 1.3 million tonnes of ore, in line with full capacity.
However, because of a planned period of lower nickel head grade, the amount of nickel in concentrate we produced from Raglan fell 3% to 27,274 tonnes.
We expect head grade to decline further in 2012 in accordance with our mine plan, before improving from 2013.
Raglans head grade will improve beyond 2013 with the development of the highergrade Qakimajurq and Mine 2 Lower Zone deposits, and increase production of nickel in concentrate to 40,000 tonnes per year by 2016.
Xstrata Nickel Australia XNA At our Xstrata Nickel Australia XNA mines, we more than offset the impact of mining more disseminated ore bodies with inherent lower nickel head grades by substantially increasing the amount of ore treated by 46% to 778,073 tonnes.
As a result we successfully increased the amount of nickel in concentrate from Xstrata Nickel Australia XNA over 2010 levels to 17,000 tonnes, including an 86% increase in volumes at Sinclair mine.
We are progressing with studies of new exploration areas at XNA to enable us to continue to supply our downstream smelter and renery and reduce xed unit costs.
Nikkelverk, Norway Our Nikkelverk renery achieved an all-time record production of 92,427 Nikkelverk tonnes of rened nickel.
At our Nikkelverk renery we achieved all-time record production of 92,427 tonnes of rened nickel.
Healthy demand for our high-purity nickel product and Nikkelverks reliable operation helped make this record possible, along with a continued focus on low capital cost debottlenecking.
We were successful in treating several different matte feeds while achieving record production levels.
