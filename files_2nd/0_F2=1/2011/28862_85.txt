Asset quality Using the probability of default models described previously, customers are assigned credit grades and scores, which are used for internal management reporting across portfolios, including a Group level asset quality scale, as shown below.
Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit grades.
Customers are assigned credit grades, based on various credit grading models that reflect the key drivers of default for the customer type.
All credit grades across the Group map to both a Group level asset quality scale, used for external financial reporting, and a master grading scale for wholesale exposures, used for internal management reporting across portfolios.
Accordingly, measures of risk exposure may be readily aggregated and reported at increasing levels of granularity depending on stakeholder or business need.
