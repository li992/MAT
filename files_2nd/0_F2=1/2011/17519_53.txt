com Operating review: Coal continued offset by a reduction in higher-margin coking sales.
Price increases and real 58 unit cost savings were partly offset by the costs incurred from extensive ooding in Queensland, an underground re at Blakeeld South and water impacts at Ulan.
We realised real unit cost savings of $271 million as a result of productivity improvements across the open cut operations in New South Wales and the commissioning ahead of schedule of our highly productive, low cost Mangoola operation in the early part of 2011.
Capital-driven productivity improvements were realised in Colombia, while South African unit cost savings resulted from a higher proportion of low cost domestic sales.
Our operating profit was reduced by $584 million due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar during 2011.
Mining and CPI inationary pressures adversely impacted operating profit by $390 million as a result of higher labour costs and increased fuel and steel prices across all geographies, in addition to rail price increases in South Africa and higher material input prices in Colombia.
Increased depreciation and amortisation reduced earnings by $116 million, due primarily to the increased capital base in New South Wales.
In South Africa, higher depreciation reected capital expenditure on the continued Mangoola, New South Wales, Australia ramp up of Goedgevonden and the Impunzi open cut mine during the year.
Mangoola, our greeneld, thermal coal project commissioned under budget and ahead of schedule in March 2011.
Other expenditure related to costs associated with ooding in the Queensland operations, an incursion of water underground at Ulan, and a re in the underground operating area of Blakeeld South, which in total reduced operating profits by $338 million.

In the first half of 2011, we undertook value engineering and option studies in relation to the Zanaga project in the Republic of Congo Brazzaville to maximise the value of the project.
The value engineering studies supported an alternative decision by Xstrata to undertake a pre-feasibility study on a 30 million tonnes per annum pipeline project as an alternative to the 45 million tonnes per annum rail scenario that was scheduled in the previous pre feasibility.
We commenced work on the pipeline prefeasibility study in the third quarter, together with other feasibility work including drilling and environmental studies.
