Director Indemnification and Insurance The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity in favour of each of the Directors.
The deeds cover any liabilities that may arise to a third party, other than the Company, for negligence, default or breach of trust or duty.
The Directors are not indemnified in respect of liabilities to the Company, any regulatory or criminal fines, any costs incurred in connection with criminal proceedings in which the Director is convicted or civil proceedings brought by the Company in which judgement is given against him.
In addition, the indemnity does not apply to any liability to the extent that it is recovered from another person.
The Company maintains Directors and Officers liability insurance.
Management and Administration For the entire year under review the management of the Company was contracted to Herald Investment Management Limited HIML.
HIML is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
The management contract is subject to 12 months notice by either party.
The senior director of HIML with prime responsibility for the management of Herald Investment Trust plc is Katie Potts, who is also a substantial shareholder of HIML.
HIML is remunerated at a monthly rate of 0.08333% of the Companys net asset value calculated using middle market prices.
Compensation fees would only be payable in respect of this 12 month period if termination were to occur sooner.
Careful consideration has been given by the Board as to the basis on which the management fee is charged.
The Board considers that maintaining a relatively low total expense ratio is in the best interest of all shareholders.
The Board is also of the view that calculating the fee with reference to performance would be unlikely to exert a positive influence over the long term performance.
At 31 December 2011, Katie Potts held 305,841 Ordinary shares of Herald Investment Trust plc.
At 31 December 2011, the Company was the beneficial owner of 14.29% of the Ordinary share capital of HIML Holdings Limited, the parent company of HIML.
Administration of the Company and its investments is contracted by HIML to Baillie Gifford & Co, who also act as Company Secretary.
