Tremelimumab is a CTLA-4 MAb and uses certain parts of the immune system to fight diseases, including cancer.
Tumours have mechanisms to evade the immune system, and blockade of CTLA-4 with tremelimumab can reactivate the immune system to help fight the cancer.
AstraZeneca entered into an in-licensing agreement with Pfizer for tremelimumab in October.
Under the terms of this agreement, AstraZeneca will assume global development rights to tremelimumab and Pfizer will retain the rights to use tremelimumab with specified types of combination therapies.
We plan to explore tremelimumab in a number of potential cancer indications.
Our biologics pipeline also includes investigational treatments for cancers of the blood as well as for a variety of solid tumours.
We currently have two investigational drugs in Phase II trials and five investigational drugs in Phase I clinical trials.

Current treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE focuses on controlling disease flares, preventing renal failure and suppressing symptoms to an acceptable level while minimising toxicity.
Although a disease-modifying agent has been launched for SLE, most emerging biologic agents will likely be used initially in combination with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants to provide incremental benefit and or allow reduced doses or numbers of these agents.
