Mark King President Civil Aerospace 18 Business review Civil aerospace Strong programme positions supported further robust order flow in 2011.
A 47 per cent increase in the order intake to 11.0 billion contributed to a record order book of 52 billion, up seven per cent on 2010.
The order book contains over 5,000 engines that will add, over time, around 250 million pounds of installed thrust, or 65 per cent, to our current installed base of 400 million pounds of thrust.
2011 saw a strong performance as revenue increased by 13 per cent.
OE revenue grew 18 per cent, largely as a result of significantly higher deliveries of widebody and corporate and regional engines.
Services 5,572m revenue grew by ten per cent, reflecting the growth in TotalCare revenue during the year, some recovery in time and materials revenue and some benefit from a better achieved USD exchange rate in the period.
