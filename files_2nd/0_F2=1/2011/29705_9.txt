2011 was a year of two disparate halves.
During the first half the investment portfolio reported a total return of 21.3%, as valuations benefited from strong earnings growth, anoverall strengthening of the quoted investments and the positive impact of foreign exchange.
However, the second half saw a significant increase in financial market instability and macroeconomic risks, leading to a contraction in comparable earnings multiples and the unwinding of the positive foreign exchange movements over the first half.
Within this context, the investment portfolio reported a negative total return of 8.5% over the second half, despite continued strengthening of portfolio company earnings.
Private equity funds portfolio 955.9 million 81.8% The private equity funds portfolio is dominated by funds advised by Permira which represent 95.9% of the private equity funds portfolio and 78.4% of the investment portfolio.

Encouragingly, much of the earnings growth has been supported by top-line expansion as management teams continued to drive a number of initiatives, such as geographic expansion and new product launches.
