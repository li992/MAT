simberi projects Completion of the Simberi oxide processing circuit expansion from 2.0 Mtpa to 3.5 Mtpa is expected by the end of 2012.
Major long lead items such the semiautogenous grinding SAG mill and tailings thickener have been fabricated and are on site at Simberi.
A cyanide destruction unit is also being installed.
The Company expects to spend US$26 million in 2012 on such initiatives.
energy Diesel costs at Simberi are approximately US$1.15 per litre, with power generating costs accounting for more than US$120 0z in the December quarter.
To lower Simberis cost profile, diesel fuel generation will be replaced in the second half of 2012 with heavy fuel oil HFO to take advantage of the 30% price differential between the landed cost of diesel and HFO.
The HFO installation will cost approximately US$20 million.
