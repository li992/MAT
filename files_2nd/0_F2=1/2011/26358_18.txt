In 2010 income was reduced by a non-recurring charge of 70 million in respect of the Groups decision to cease writing new payment protection insurance PPI business.
Excluding this charge profit before tax and fair value unwind increased by 2 per cent in 2011.
Total income, net of insurance claims, increased by 2 per cent, reduction of 1 per cent excluding the 70 million charge in 2010.
This is attributable to strong sales of corporate pensions through the intermediary channel and the continued change in new business mix within Life, Pensions and Investments UK LP&I UK towards more profitable protection business reflecting a focus on meeting customer needs in an area where there is a general level of under provision in the UK.
Improved claims experience within General Insurance which has been offset by lower PPI related income is also a significant contributor to this.
Operating expenses and other costs decreased by 5 per cent due mainly to a continued focus on cost management and delivery of integration cost savings, partly offset by an additional charge in relation to an industry wide Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS levy in 2011.
LP&I UK EEV new business margin increased to 4.2 per cent from 3.7 per cent in 2010.
The improvement reflects the growth in protection sales and the business ceasing to write certain low margin products in 2010.
The Internal Rate of Return IRR on new business remains in excess of 16 per cent.
LP&I UK sales of 10,219 million PVNBP reduced by 1 per cent, partly reflecting the continuing change in mix towards protection products to meet customer protection needs, which generate a lower PVNBP compared to investments but generate a higher new business profit.
Sales through our Intermediary channel have increased by 20 per cent to 6,415 million reflecting strong sales of Corporate Pensions.
General Insurance profits increased by 21 per cent to 497 million primarily due to lower freeze and unemployment claims year on year offset by lower income resulting from the Group ceasing to write new PPI business in 2010.
Capital management initiatives in 2011 have resulted in 2.3 billion mitigation of the potential impact of Capital Requirements Directive IV CRD IV.
The capital position of the UK life insurance group under the Insurance Groups Directive IGD remains strong with an estimated capital surplus of 3.7 billion.
Scottish Widows was awarded Defined Contribution Bundled Services Provider of the Year in the Pension and Investment Provider Awards 2011 and Best Group Pension Provider in the Corporate Adviser Awards 2012.
Against its strategic objectives, Insurance has focused on removing duplication to simplify the business and is improving customer insight to support responsiveness to changing customer needs.
LP&I UK has built upon successful sales force integration and single bancassurance proposition launch to deliver a number of further improvements to its operations and capability.
General Insurance has improved customer experience by the introduction of a single telephony and e-commerce platform across all brands.
Strategic focus Insurance is a relationship business focused on helping our customers to protect themselves today whilst preparing for a secure financial future.
Having renewed its strategic vision Insurance confirmed its objective to be the best Insurance business for customers.
Progress against strategic initiatives Reshaping the business In 2012, Insurance is being reshaped to run as one insurance business with a customer focused corporate and management structure.
By operating as one business and actively managing the combined capital, Insurance expects to leverage significant benefits from risk diversification which will give further competitive advantage.
Insurance continues to progress well with the implementation of Solvency II requirements.
The business continues to make good progress in improving the profitability of the customer focused product set.
In 2011, the Life, Pensions and Investments EEV new business margin improved to 4.0 per cent from 3.5 per cent in 2010 and the focus on value over volume will continue as Insurance grows a business that is focused on developing long term relationships with customers.
The General Insurance business also focuses on generating value with a targeted participation and underwriting strategy in attractive market segments and efficient and effective management of claims.
This value is demonstrated by a combined ratio of 69 per cent in 2011.
Capital management initiatives in 2011 have resulted in 2.3 billion mitigation of the potential impact of CRD IV.
This includes capital restructuring within the business that occurred in July 2011 which reduced the Groups estimated total core tier 1 impact of CRD IV by over 2 billion.
Since 1 January 2010, the mitigation of the potential impact of CRD IV is estimated to be 4.6 billion in total.
In 2011 LP&I UK built upon the successful sales force integration and proposition launch to deliver a number of further improvements to its operational capability and cost effectiveness.
These include in-sourcing life and pensions policies from a third party, the further consolidation of locations, delivery of new eCommerce capability for intermediaries and enhanced investment accounting capabilities through a single outsourced arrangement.
Within General Insurance significant improvements have been delivered in improving the customer experience through the delivery of combined claims and administration platforms.
Overview r Business review Governance r Financial statements r Other information r Lloyds Banking Group 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 DIVISIONAL RESULTS INSURANCE Simplification Insurance continues to focus on cost reduction with costs decreasing by 5 per cent in 2011.
Efficiencies have been achieved without compromising the quality of customer service and customer satisfaction ratings have remained robust across the division.
The Simplification programme will deliver further improvements through the provision of simpler systems and processes.
Investing in growth There is a focus on growth across the Insurance business to support our multi-brand strategy and to deliver sustainable growth in key markets.
A Group Strategic Initiative is investing in building lasting relationships with our bancassurance customers through the introduction of new advice models, enhanced products and access to new direct channels.
Selective participation in the important Intermediary and Direct channels will be supported by investment in new and enhanced product propositions and improved channels to market.
In General Insurance, the strategy is focused around protecting and growing home insurance business whilst seeking to expand its role in other markets.
Strong and enduring relationships with distributors are essential to the success of the business.
The business is working collaboratively with our colleagues across the Group to design and deliver value adding propositions aligned to channel customers insurance needs.
In the intermediary channel, it continues to support Independent Financial Advisers IFAs in their preparation for the Retail Distribution Review RDR.
Inevitably, as a result of RDR, some IFAs will choose to exit markets and therefore some customers will no longer receive advice from their IFAs.
The business is committed to providing a direct proposition to maintain a high quality of service to these customers.

2 As required under IFRS, products are split between insurance and investment contracts depending on the level of insurance risk contained.
For insurance contracts, the new business profit includes the net present value of profits expected to emerge over the lifetime of the contract, including profits anticipated in periods after the year of sale: for investment contracts the figure reflects the profit in the year of sale only, after allowing for the deferral of income and expenses.
Consequently the recognition of profit from investment contracts is deferred relative to insurance contracts.
Life, Pensions and Investments LP&I UK delivered profit growth, before tax and fair value unwind, of 56 million, or 7 per cent.
In 2010 income was reduced by a non-recurring charge of 70 million in respect of the Groups decision to cease writing new payment protection insurance PPI business which, although a General Insurance product, impacted LP&I as a result of the life cover contained within PPI contracts.
Excluding this charge profit before tax and fair value unwind decreased by 2 per cent in 2011.
Total new business profit increased by 64 million, or 24 per cent, to 331 million.
The increase is primarily attributable to strong sales of corporate pensions through the intermediary channel, the continued growth of our protection business in the bancassurance channel as we help more customers and address the sizeable protection gap that exists in the UK and reduction in lower margin business following the launch of the integrated bancassurance proposition in June 2010.
LP&I UK margin on an EEV basis increased to 4.2 per cent in 2011 from 3.7 per cent in 2010.
The improved margin reflects the strategic choices made in respect of product and channel propositions.
Existing business profit has decreased by 72 million, or 12 per cent, to 539 million.
The decrease predominantly reflects higher interest payments following capital restructuring initiatives, a reduction in the assumed rate of return, and lower levels of shareholder net assets following capital repatriation initiatives in 2010.

The benefit mainly reflects the absence of the 70 million charge taken in 2010 from the Groups decision to cease writing new PPI business.
The capital position of the UK life insurance companies remains robust.
Following the legal entity reorganisation of the Insurance division in July 2011, there is now one insurance group reporting under the Insurance Groups Directive IGD with an estimated capital surplus of 3.7 billion.
This compares with 1.3 billion and 1.6 billion for the Scottish Widows and HBOS Insurance groups, respectively, at the end of 2010.
European business Profit before tax decreased by 45 million, 35 per cent, to 82 million.
The reduction is driven largely by a non-recurring charge following clarification by the German regulator BaFin surrounding the deduction of tax and policy-holder distributions and experience and assumption charges.
The strategy is to secure value in the existing business, building on the relationship with its key distributor.
New business An analysis of the present value of new business premiums for business written by the Insurance division, split between the UK and European Life, Pensions and Investments Businesses is given below: Present value of new business premiums PVNBP 2011 2010 UK Europe Total UK Europe Total Change m m m m m m % Analysis by product Protection 708 53 761 574 56 630 21 Payment protection 21 21 70 70 70 Savings and investments 1,133 246 1,379 1,617 315 1,932 29 Individual pensions 1,480 144 1,624 1,606 141 1,747 7 Corporate and other pensions 4,423 4,423 2,750 2,750 61 Retirement income 747 747 889 889 16 Managed fund business 116 116 177 177 34 Life and pensions 8,628 443 9,071 7,683 512 8,195 11 OEICs 1,591 1,591 2,633 2,633 40 Total 10,219 443 10,662 10,316 512 10,828 2 Analysis by channel Intermediary 6,415 443 6,858 5,365 512 5,877 17 Bancassurance 3,216 3,216 4,432 4,432 27 Direct 588 588 519 519 13 Total 10,219 443 10,662 10,316 512 10,828 2 Total sales PVNBP have reduced by 2 per cent to 10,662 million.
New business margins have improved to 4.0 per cent in 2011 from 3.5 per cent in 2010.
This partly reflects the launch of the integrated bancassurance proposition in June 2010 which has resulted in a change in mix away from higher single premium savings products towards lower premium, higher margin, protection business.
Despite the reduction in sales total new business profit within LP&I UK increased by 64 million, or 24 per cent, to 331 million.
Sales PVNBP, excluding OEICs have increased by 11 per cent, and although OEIC sales have decreased by 40 per cent the new business margin on these sales has increased, reflecting the focus on value over volume.
Within the intermediary channel the increase in sales of 981 million, or 17 per cent, mainly reflects strong sales of corporate pensions in LP&I UK.
The increase in sales has been achieved whilst maintaining the new business margin on corporate pension business.
In the bancassurance channel the reduction in sales reflects a change in mix away from savings products which generate a higher PVNBP towards protection business, which although more profitable, generates lower PVNBP.
Sales of savings products have been particularly affected by recent stock market turbulence and lower consumer confidence, particularly in the second half of the year.
Despite the reduction in PVNBP there was an increase in new business profit largely as a result of the increase in protection sales reflecting success in helping customers address their protection needs.
As previously communicated in the Group Strategic review the business will continue to focus on meeting the insurance and investment needs of the Groups existing customers.
The direct channel, although relatively small at this time, is performing well and is being developed for future growth.
This channel will become even more important following the introduction of RDR.
Overview r Business review Governance r Financial statements r Other information r Lloyds Banking Group 82 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 DIVISIONAL RESULTS INSURANCE Funds under management The table below shows the funds of the Life, Pensions and Investment companies within the Insurance division.
These funds are predominantly managed within the Group by the Wealth and International division.
2011 2010 bn bn Opening funds under management 133.1 122.1 UK business Premiums 10.1 11.2 Claims and surrenders 14.6 14.9 Net outflow of business 4.5 3.7 Investment return, expenses and commission 0.2 10.5 1 Other movements 4.3 Net movement 4.7 11.1 European business Net movement 0.5 0.4 Dividends and capital repatriation 0.3 0.5 Closing funds under management 127.6 133.1 Managed by the Group 103.4 109.3 Managed by third parties 24.2 23.8 Closing funds under management 127.6 133.1 1 Other movements in funds under management incorporates alignment changes and the inclusion of managed pension funds.
The net outflow of business is primarily a result of the move in sales away from savings products which generate large single premiums, caused in part by more difficult economic conditions for long-term savings and the run-off of the in-force book.
The key drivers of investment return are equity and gilt movements.
In the year UK equity markets fell 3 per cent and European markets fell 15 per cent while gilt markets increased by 16 per cent.
In 2010 both equities and gilts performed strongly, creating large investment gains.
Maturity profile of in-force business The table below shows the profile of the Value of In-Force VIF asset recognised on the IFRS balance sheet based on the date when the profit is expected to emerge.
The increase in VIF from new business has been more than offset by a combination of the expected run-off in VIF on in-force business, the reduction in VIF from market volatility particularly on equities and the change in assumptions used in the calculation of the VIF over the year.
The profile of the emergence of VIF in future years show that almost 40 per cent of the VIF is expected to be released within 5 years, with nearly 80 per cent expected to be released within 15 years.

Profit before tax and fair value unwind from General Insurance increased by 21 per cent to 497 million.
The increase was primarily due to improved PPI claims experience from the run off of this business line, the absence of severe weather related claims as experienced in 2010 and lower expenses.
As a result of these factors the combined ratio has improved to 69 per cent.
Total income for home insurance was broadly unchanged from 2010 at 857 million and reflects the maturity and competitiveness of the market.
Claims of 343 million were 37 per cent lower than in 2010, mainly due to improved claims experience as a result of the run off of the PPI business and lower unemployment claims and lower property claims following the freeze events that impacted January and December 2010.
Operating expenses decreased by 26 million, or 12 per cent, to 195 million primarily as a result of further delivery of integration savings and a continued focus on cost management.
