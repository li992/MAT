A major infill drilling campaign is planned with a rig secured to start operations in July 2013.
The results of the 4D seismic, shot in 2011, have been used to support the drilling campaigns in both fields.
com Operations review continued Uganda East African exploration acreage Tullow has worked in Uganda since 2004 when the Group acquired Energy Africa.
Tullow increased its interests in Uganda through the acquisitions of Hardman Resources in 2007 and Heritage Oil and Gas Ltds Ugandan interests in 2010.
Since Ethiopia entering the basin, Tullow has drilled 46 wells, completed a pioneering Full Tensor Gradiometry FTG Gravity Survey and has discovered 1.1 billion barrels of P50 resources in the 1 Lake Albert Rift Basin with only two dry holes.
East African Uganda Ugan Ug Ug Rift Basin 2 Following the completion of the acquisition of Heritages Kenya interests in Uganda in July 2010, Tullow signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU with the Government of Uganda on 15 March 2011.
As a result, Tullow signed Share Purchase Tanzania Agreements SPAs with CNOOC and Total for the farm-down of two thirds of Tullows interests in Uganda on 30 March 2011.
East African Transform On 3 February 2012, Tullow signed two Production Sharing Margin Agreements PSAs relating to the Lake Albert Rift Basin with the Government of Uganda.
This enabled Tullow and its new partners to complete the farm-down on 21 February 2012 for a consideration of $2.9 billion.
Pursuant to the completion of the deal, operatorship responsibilities within the Basin will be divided between the Partners.

The case is expected to be heard in early 2013 after other cases involving Heritage in London and Kampala have been concluded.
Tullow then drilled the Gunya-1 well in July 2011, which made a discovery in an undrilled fault block downdip of the Mpyo field.
The Partnership expects to submit options for the development Appraisal drilling on the Jobi-East discovery commenced with of the Lake Albert Rift Basin later this year and these options Jobi-East-5 in August 2011 and Jobi-East-2 in September 2011. will include a refinery and an export pipeline.
Some small scale Jobi-East-5 provided valuable data for regional reservoir production is envisaged starting late 2012 but substantial mapping but was drilled just outside the closure of the field.

Based on this timetable, ramp-up identified in EA-1 in a play that extends to the west of the river of major production should commence in 2016.
The Omuka well will test this new play and will spud in the fourth quarter of 2012.
A large number of appraisal wells and Drilling operations in the Lake Albert Rift Basin continued in well tests are also planned in the block in 2012.
In EA-1, Tullow made an important discovery with the Jobi-East 1 well in June 2011 which encountered 20 metres of In EA-2, three successful appraisal wells, Nsoga-2, Kigogole-6 hydrocarbon bearing reservoir.
Following this discovery, Tullow and Ngege-2, were drilled and an extensive 3D seismic drilled the Jobi-2 appraisal well in the north of the Jobi-Rii field campaign covering the Kasamene, Ngiri, Nsoga and Kigogole in July 2011 and confirmed the northward extension of this discoveries was completed.
The data recovered is of high quality exciting discovery.
Elsewhere in EA-1, Tullow drilled the Mpyo-3 and is currently being interpreted.
