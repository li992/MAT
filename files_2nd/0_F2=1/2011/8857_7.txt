Group Key Performance Indicators Business Review Johnson Matthey uses a range of key performance indicators KPIs to monitor the groups performance over time in line with its strategy.
These principal KPIs, together with the groups performance against them in 2010 11, are described below: Sales Excluding Precious Metals million Monitoring sales provides a measure of the growth of the business.
In measuring the 2,280 2,500 growth of the group, we focus on sales excluding the value of precious metals because 1,886 1,797 1,750 2,000 total revenue can be heavily distorted by year on year fluctuations in precious metal 1,454 prices.
Not only that, in many cases variations in the value of the precious metal 1,500 contained within our products are passed directly on to our customers.
1,000 In 2010 11 sales excluding precious metals grew by 21% reflecting good growth in our 500 markets as described in the Operations Review on pages 19 to 31.
0 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Underlying Earnings per Share Underlying earnings per share is the principal measure used by the board to assess the Pence overall profitability of the group.
The following items are excluded from underlying 119.0 earnings because they can distort the trend in measuring results: 125 89.6 89.5 Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on acquisition of businesses 100 86.4 82.2 acquired intangibles.
75 Major impairment or restructuring charges.
50 Profit or loss on disposal of businesses.
Tax on the above and major tax items arising from changes in legislation.
25 0 This year underlying earnings per share rose by 38% to 119.0 pence supported by a 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 strong performance across the group.
Further details are provided in the Operations Review on pages 19 to 31.
Return on Invested Capital % In a business as capital intensive as Johnson Mattheys, profitability alone is a poor 22 Target 20 measure of performance: it is possible to generate good operating margins but poor 18 value for shareholders if assets are not used efficiently.
Return on invested capital 16 ROIC is therefore used alongside profit measures to ensure focus upon the efficient 14 use of the groups assets.
ROIC is defined for the group as underlying operating profit 12 divided by average capital employed equity plus net debt.
ROIC for individual divisions 10 is calculated using average segmental net assets as the denominator.
Capital Expenditure million To enable the group to continue to grow, Johnson Matthey invests significant amounts 203.5 210 in maintaining and improving our existing plants and in adding new facilities to provide 180 145.0 additional capacity where necessary.
All new capital expenditure is subject to detailed 137.9 134.4 150 119.8 review to ensure that its investment case passes internal hurdles.
Annual capital 120 expenditure is measured as the cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible 90 assets purchased during the year.
The ratio of capital expenditure to depreciation gives 60 an indication of the relative level of investment.
16 Gross Research and Development Expenditure million Johnson Matthey is fundamentally a technology company.
To maintain our competitive 109.8 120 position, we need to keep investing in research and development.
Whilst absolute levels 91.7 87.6 100 of research and development expenditure do not necessarily indicate how successful 73.0 68.0 80 we are, that success rapidly feeds through to higher sales as lead times in our business 60 can be quite short.
40 In 2010 11 the group increased its research and development expenditure by 20% to 20 109.8 million.
Further details are given in the Research and Development section on 0 pages 42 and 43.
2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Sustainability Global Warming Potential Tonnes CO equivalent 000 2 We measure our progress towards achieving carbon neutrality by looking at the groups 415 2 2 450 393 390 2 2 377 372 total global warming potential GWP.
Total GWP is based on our direct and indirect 360 energy usage and CO equivalence which provide a strong platform for monitoring the 2 impacts associated with energy use in our operations.
We are working to broaden the 270 scope of our GWP measurement to include all aspects of our business and to consider 180 the beneficial impacts of our products and services.
90 This year the groups GWP increased from 377,000 to 415,000 tonnes CO equivalent 2 0 as a result of increased production and the addition of new manufacturing facilities.
1 1 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 Further information on the groups GWP is given in the Sustainability section on pages 1 2 Calendar year.
Safety Annual Rate of 3 Day Accidents per 1,000 Employees 8 Johnson Matthey is a manufacturing business and a significant proportion of our employees 7 work in production environments with chemicals and process machinery.
Rigorous safety 6 5 systems apply across all facilities and are essential if the group is to avoid accidents which 4 could cause injury to people or damage to our property, both of which can impact the 3 groups performance.
We actively manage our safety performance through monitoring 2 the incidence and causes of accidents that result in more than three days lost time.
1 0 The groups annual accident rate of greater than three day accidents increased slightly March March March March March March 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 during the year to 2.88 per 1,000 employees.
Actions taken to improve our safety performance are described in more detail in the Sustainability section on pages 53 to 55.
Occupational Health Annual Incidence of Occupational Illness Cases per 1,000 Employees 5.8 5.5 6 The health and wellbeing of our employees is a priority for Johnson Matthey and we 5.2 4.6 are committed to minimising workplace related negative health effects.
We manage our 5 3.5 performance in this area by measuring the number of occupational illness cases arising 4 as a result of exposure to workplace health hazards.
3 2 The annual incidence of occupational illness cases fell this year to 3.5 per 1,000 1 employees as a result of initiatives underway to promote employee wellbeing across the group.
Further details are provided in the Sustainability section on pages 54 and 55.
Voluntary Employee Turnover % The success of Johnson Matthey is partly dependent upon the extent that we are able 15 13.0 to attract and retain talented employees.
This means that being an attractive employer 12 is a prerequisite in a competitive environment.
We monitor our success in retaining our 9 staff using voluntary employee turnover statistics.
5.6 4.8 4.7 6 4.2 In 2010 11 the groups voluntary employee turnover increased very slightly to 5.6% 3 from 5.4% in 2009 10.
This remains low compared to industry standards.
0 Europe North Asia Rest of Group America World Johnson Matthey 17 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS BUSINESS REVIEW STRATEGY IN ACTION Opportunities in Fuel Cells We believe that fuel cells are central to the development of a low carbon economy.
They generate electricity cleanly and efficiently and the science and technology involved fit well with Johnson Mattheys core skills in catalysis, materials science and precious metals.
Johnson Matthey has targeted the key catalytic components of the fuel cell the membrane electrode assembly MEA as our primary product and has invested in fuel cell technology for a number of years, developing the catalyst technology which will be critical to success.
Our development and manufacturing centre in Swindon, UK has enabled us to participate in early fuel cell markets.
By 2020 we anticipate that the market for MEAs could be around 1 billion p. a. in sales excluding precious metals and whilst cars represent the largest potential market, stationary and direct methanol fuel cell markets also provide attractive opportunities.
With good growth potential across all fuel cell markets supported by global trends and advancing technology, Johnson Matthey is well placed to participate in them all.
