We continue to review the market for potential acquisitions which meet our rigorous criteria and it is possible that in the coming year more property will come onto the market as a consequence of owners seeking to reduce gearing and increase liquidity.
We have seen some easing in the general availability and pricing of finance in the UK but we take a long term approach to the ownership of property and there are still too few financial institutions who take a similarly long view.
During the year we have continued our programme of acquisitions in the USA with the purchase of a number of residential properties in Bronx, New York at a total cost of $35.4 million.
