ORDINARY SHARES Managers Report Ordinary Share Class Chris Turner MRICS Fund Manager 10 June 2011 Performance and Background The Ordinary share class NAV total return of 15.40% was a whisker ahead of the benchmark total return of 15.17%.
As the Chairman has noted, the year to the end of March 2011 was another volatile one for stock markets.
At times it is possible to feel overwhelmed by the rapid changes in sentiment caused by events or fears which have almost nothing to do with the day to day business of most of the companies in which we invest.
Active short term trading is not something I have ever been any good at, so I dont try, instead relying on picking stocks and managements I think will outperform over the medium and longer term.
In most years this approach has resulted in decent outperformance, but not last year.
Eighteen months ago there was much discussion regarding the shape of the recession, with a V camp, a U camp and an L camp.
Right now, in the UK and across much of Europe, the L camp looks closest to the mark, though Germany and Sweden seem to have enjoyed a V shaped recovery, while the economies with sovereign debt problems may have further to regress.
Meanwhile, commercial property markets have to do battle with green issues, the increasing impact of the internet on retail sales, rising oil prices and with the potential growth, often the unwilling growth, of the population of major cities.
Investment Activity I believe Warren Buffett once remarked that idleness bordering on lethargy was the cornerstone of his investment philosophy.
Last year my investment turnover sales and purchases together divided by two was 74m or 13.6% of the average total assets over the year.
On the whole, where I made changes I think they were beneficial, though I have not run the test on this.
