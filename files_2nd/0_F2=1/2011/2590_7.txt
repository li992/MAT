Bumi plc | Introduction 14 Annual Report 2011 Delivering profitable Growth A major expansion programme across the Wider Group is underway over the next few years.
The Wider Group, on a 100% basis, has one of the The Wider Group has an unrivalled suite of low strongest thermal coal growth pipelines in the world.

is now commencing one of its most active phases in expanding production.
With a strong pricing outlook PT Berau for thermal coal, driven in particular by higher levels PTBeraus coal mined in 2011 amounted to 19.4m of electricity demand from Asia and other emerging tonnes, an increase of 12% over 2010.
PTBeraus markets, the organic growth prole will help meet level of production is set to increase signicantly this increased level of thermal coal demand.
A number of expansion projects are underway including the construction of a 42km Indonesia: a key producer overland conveyor at Binungan and the upgrading Indonesia is uniquely positioned to meet the of existing coal handling facilities, such as its barge burgeoning demand for seaborne thermal coal, loaders and crushers at the Lati coal handling particularly for Asia.
The country has emerged facilities.
Construction of a new crushing line and as the worlds largest exporter of thermal coal, stockpile was completed in May 2011.
PTBerau supplying around one third of the seaborne market.
is forecast to increase coal mined by 50% to 30m Indonesia has been a natural source of coal for India, tonnes per annum by 2014.
Coal mined in 2012 is as well as Japan and China, due to its location and forecast to be around 23mtonnes.
In China the low sulphur, low ash Indonesian coals are ideal for blending with PT Bumi local coals and in India, the new coal red electricity PTBumi is set to increase production signicantly over generating plants will be optimised around the the near term.
In 2011, KPC and Arutmin between use of Indonesian coal.
In 2010, India sourced them produced 65.7m tonnes of thermal coal.

largest portion of the higher output will come from PT Beraus production is set to increase signicantly in the near term.
A number of expansion projects have commenced, including a new overland conveyor at PT Beraus Binungan mine and the upgrading of existing coal handling facilities.
Introduction 15 Above: The new overland conveyor left at KPCs Sangatta mine runs parallel to the existing conveyor right.
Both conveyors transport coal to the Tanjung Bara Coal Terminal from where it is shipped to key Asian destinations.
KPC, where coal mined is expected to increase coal mined is forecast to increase by 10% in 2012, over the near term from 41m tonnes to 70m tonnes, from 41mtonnes in 2011 to 45m tonnes in2012.
The increase will be achieved by stepping up both owner operated and contractor At Arutmin, three expansion projects involving mining activities as well as the construction of a construction of port facilities, overland belt conveyors new coal crusher.
A second overland conveyor has and coal processing plants will see coal mined been successfully installed at Sangatta which will increasing from 25m tonnes to 40mtonnes per increase capacity by 32mtonnes per annum.
As a annum in the near future.
Coal mined is expected result of the second conveyor, as well as the new coal to increase from the current rate of 25mtonnes per crusher and additional conveyors between pits, KPCs annum to 30mtonnes in 2012, an increase of20%.
