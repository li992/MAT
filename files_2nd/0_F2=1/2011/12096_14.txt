Our Asse ts : Malomir Contribution to the Groups 2011 gold production 14% The commissioning of Malomir drew on our past experience and equipped us for our future expansion: our experience at Pioneer had enabled us to implement large-scale Location mining works and the additional Malomir is located in the north-east of the Amur region, c. 670km east practical knowledge we subsequently of Pokrovskiy by road and acquired during construction at c. 120km north-east of Fevralsk, on the Baikal Amur Railway.
Malomir greatly helped when we started to develop Albyn, which is also located in a remote area.
