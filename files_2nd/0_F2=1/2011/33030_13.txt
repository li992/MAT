BP is one of the largest producers of hydrocarbons in the region.
Natural gas prices Natural gas prices diverged globally in 2011, reecting different regional dynamics.
The average US Henry Hub First of Month Index fell to $4.04 mmBtu, 8% lower than the prices in 2010, while in Europe prices increased.
After a record increase in 2010, global gas consumption growth moderated in 2011.
In the US, economic momentum supported gas use in the first half of the year and a hot summer raised demand.
Yet domestic production outpaced consumption growth due to further increases in the availability of shale gas.
Henry Hub gas prices fell and traded below coal parity in US power generation throughout the year, leading to the displacement of coal by gas.
Unusually mild winter weather weakened prices at the end of year.
The differentials of production area prices to Henry Hub prices continued to narrow as pipeline bottlenecks were reduced.
In Europe, spot gas prices at the UK National Balancing Point increased by 33% to an average of 56.33 pence per therm for 2011 the highest level since 2008.
The loss of Libyan gas supply raised continental European demand for Russian gas in early 2011, but LNG supply and weak general demand kept spot gas prices below oil-indexed contract levels.
Competition between spot and contract pipeline supplies continued.
High volumes of LNG were available to Europe, despite the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, which caused major nuclear outages and signicantly increased LNG purchases in Japan.
This contributed to a tightening global LNG market over the year.
The economic rebound had led the average Henry Hub First of Month Index to recover in 2010 from eight-year lows, rising by 10% to $4.39 mmBtu.
In the UK, National Balancing Point prices averaged 42.45 pence per therm in 2010 38% above the depressed prices in 2009.
In 2012, we expect gas markets to continue to be driven by the economy, weather, domestic production, LNG supply and reductions in nuclear power generation following the Fukushima disaster in Japan in March 2011.
