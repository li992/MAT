Dilution limits Existing obligations under legacy dened benefit schemes in the UK will continue to be honoured.
All awards are made under plans which incorporate dilution limits consistent with the guidelines provided by the Association of British Insurers.
Current estimated dilution from existing awards made over the last 10 years is set out in the table below: % of issued share capital ABI dilution At 31 December At 31 December Share plans limit 2010 2011 All GSK employee share plans 10% 4.87% 3.96% Executive share plans only 5% 4.50% 3.58% GSK Annual Report 2011 117 Overview 02 Strategic review 10 Financial review & risk 51 Governance & remuneration 78 Financial statements 134 Shareholder information 222 UK pension arrangements The company currently operates a dened contribution plan and legacy final salary plans, which are closed to new entrants.
Executives participating in the dened contribution plan receive a company contribution of 20% of base salary.
They will also have the opportunity to receive up to a further 5% in matched contributions in line with the policy for all other members of the pension plan.
During 2010, the UK Government announced a series of changes to the taxation of pensions which continue to impact the pensions of employees within GSK.
The taxation changes will have significant negative consequences and the effectiveness of pensions will be much reduced.
Pensions have been, and continue to be, an important tool for creating a long-term culture and promoting employee retention.
Therefore, the Committee decided that existing pension promises would be honoured and employees with pensions impacted by the changes would have the opportunity for their pension above the new limit to be delivered via GSKs existing unfunded scheme.
The legacy final salary plans provide for up to two-thirds of final salary at age 60.
For employees subject to the cap, benets in excess of the cap are currently provided through unfunded arrangements.
Under the legacy final salary plans, actuarial reduction factors apply where a participant leaves employment of his or her own accord before the age of 60.
US pension arrangements In the USA, GSK operates a US Cash Balance Plan, which provides for an annual contribution and interest on the sum accumulated in the cash balance plan, but with no contractual promise to provide specic levels of retirement income.
The plan incorporates an Executive Pension Credit for senior US executives.
Contribution rates under the plan range from 15% to 38% of base salary depending on grade.
All current senior US executives are eligible for the Executive Pension Credit.
For capped employees in the USA, benets above the cap are provided through an unfunded non-qualied plan.
Update on performance of ongoing awards The Committee undertook to provide an update on performance for outstanding LTI awards.
It should be noted that the actual vesting levels will only be determined based on performance over the full three and four year performance periods.
The interim positions provided below should only be regarded as an indication of how management has performed to date and should not be regarded as predictions of the final vesting levels.
2010 awards with performance periods to 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 The Committee reviewed the performance criteria of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan awards granted to the Executive Directors in 2010.
The performance achieved in the two years from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011 was as follows the 2010 DABP award is subject only to the performance of relative TSR over three years : Estimate of likely vesting based on performance to date % of % of maximum % of total Performance measures award Performance achieved to date vesting award Adjusted free cash ow 40% The target for the three year period to 31 December 2012 is 17.3 billion for threshold vesting and 20.5 billion for maximum vesting.

If the above levels of performance under each measure are maintained until the ends of the performance periods on 31 December 2012 and 2013, vesting of the 2010 awards would be as shown.
However, performance is only measured at the ends of the performance periods and performance to date is not necessarily an indication of the final vesting level.

The performance achieved in the year to 31 December 2011 was as follows: Estimate of likely vesting based on performance to date % of Performance % of maximum % of total measures award Performance achieved to date vesting award Business 25% Vaccines diversication The lack of u pandemic vaccine sales in the year resulted in a decline in reported vaccines performance sales of 19% to 3,497 million u pandemic vaccine sales were 18 million in the year, compared with 1,192 million in 2010.
Cervarix sales more than doubled to 506 million, primarily reecting the national HPV vaccination programme in Japan, which started at the end of 2010.
Synorix grew 57% to 350 million in 2011, reecting continued growth related to tenders in Emerging Markets.
The strong reported growth of Rotarix up 31% to 300 million primarily reected the impact of the product being off the market during part of 2010.
Excluding pandemic vaccines sales, CER growth was 11%.
Estimated market growth, excluding pandemic vaccines sales, was 9%.
Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare sales grew 5% in the year to 5,195 million.
Sales in the USA and Europe declined slightly, largely as a result of reductions in sales of alli, but these declines were more than offset by strong growth in the Rest of the World.
Oral healthcare and Nutritional healthcare sales grew strongly, but Over-the-counter sales were at.
Estimated market growth for markets where GSK competes was 4%.
Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic and Japan excluding Vaccines and Dermatology The Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic and Japan Pharmaceuticals businesses excluding Vaccines and Dermatology reported combined sales of 5,051 million in the year, representing growth of 8% compared with 2010.
In all three regions, Respiratory products provided strong growth, supported by Anti-bacterial products in Emerging Markets and Avodart and Lamictal in Japan.
Dermatology Dermatology sales grew 1% in the year to 1,087 million, as growth in Emerging Markets, which is benefiting from ongoing launches of Stiefel products in new markets, offset the impact of price cuts in Europe and generic competition to Evoclin in the USA.
Reported growth in the full year benefited from the addition of sales from businesses acquired in late 2010 and early 2011, but this was offset by the effect of the disposal of Zovirax in North America in the first quarter of 2011.
Estimated market growth for markets where 55% 14% GSK competes was 6%.
R&D new 25% New product sales product Sales of products launched since 2009 totalled 985 million in the year and grew performance 60%.

100% 25% Potential total vesting for 2011 award 71% The vesting schedules for each of the performance criteria are given on pages 129 and 131 of this report.
If the above levels of performance under each measure are maintained until the end of the performance period on 31 December 2013, vesting of the 2011 awards would be as shown.
However, performance is only measured at the end of the three year period and performance to date is not necessarily an indication of the final vesting level.
The Committee, having reviewed performance for the year, remains of the view that the targets for the 2011 awards under both new measures remain suitably robust and stretching.
The actual targets, together with details of the extent to which they have been met, will be disclosed in full at the time of vesting.
