David Weston Group Director of Business Performance and Projects A DETERMINED TEAM SETTING NEW STANDARDS The $1.9 billion Barro Alto nickel project in Brazil delivered its first metal on schedule in March 2011.
The project is the first of our four major strategic growth projects to be commissioned and will be a key contributor to Anglo Americans 35% volume growth by 2014.
Barro Alto will average 41 ktpa of nickel over its first five years of full production and has a highly competitive cost position in the lower half of the cost curve.
It will more than double production from our Nickel business, and increase Anglo Americans total nickel volumes by 180%.
Barro Alto will have a long life from its extensive resource base, while Anglo American has the potential to increase nickel production by an additional 66 ktpa, with further upside potential from its unapproved projects at Jacar and Morro Sem Bon, also in Brazil, leveraging the Groups considerable nickel laterite technical expertise.

As part of enabling this strategy, it has developed a pipeline of underground longwall projects in the Moranbah region in Australia.
To achieve this growth, we will need to increase cutting hours and productivity of existing longwalls to world best practice and beyond, and establish new longwalls at this enhanced level.
Metallurgical Coal and Joy Mining Machinery, the world leader in the development and manufacture of underground mining machinery, have formed a collaborative partnership to improve the performance of the existing longwall at Moranbah and to develop and implement the Longwall of the future, with a focus on zero harm and reducing costs per tonne.
This new longwall design and implementation will become the standard for all Metallurgical Coals longwall developments in the future.
In the initial phase of the work, Joy has played a key role in the Longwall100 project to improve longwall cutting hours and is bringing into operation its first Smart Services Centre in Australia in Metallurgical Coals Brisbane Ofce.
As we move forward, we will leverage the know how of both organisations and, by taking a complete mining system approach, the next level of technology, automation, design for reliability, and remote equipment performance prognostics Smart Services will be delivered.

It has been used to guide the development of new site-based bottom-up energy and greenhouse gas GHG emissions savings targets.
Technology As energy use accounts for roughly 85% of our GHG emissions, we are primarily focusing existing activities on identifying and implementing innovative technologies aimed at using energy more efficiently.
These include technological solutions to optimise processes and machinery at our operations, such as air compressors, ventilation fans, pumps, draglines, conveyors and electric motors.
In addition to focusing on energy efficiency technologies, we are investing in developing and deploying technologies that may enable us to run cost efficient, carbon neutral mines by 2030.
Engagement and partnerships We continue to work with governments and our business peers to inform the development and implementation of efficient, effective and equitable climate change policies, including carbon taxes and other pricing mechanisms.
In 2011, we were particularly active in engaging with the South African and Australian governments, in relation to the UNFCCC COP-17 negotiations in Durban as well as 01 commenting on proposed carbon pricing schemes.
