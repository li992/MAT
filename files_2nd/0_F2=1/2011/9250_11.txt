Board of Directors Case Study Laird: A Preferred Supplier During the year Laird was awarded a new long-term programme with a major North American truck supplier, delivering specialist GPS modules containing integrated antennae, receiver, vehicle bus interface and added software.
Like many Original Equipment Manufacturers, the customer was looking to consolidate their supply base to a smaller number of preferred suppliers and selected Laird because of our excellent execution and supply track record.
We were able to design a technical solution that met their aggressive cost and timescale objectives, as well as working with them in component and systems integration, via onsite engineering and programme support.
