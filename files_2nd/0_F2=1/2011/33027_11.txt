Strategy and Performance Our performance in 2011 Our performance Within AstraZeneca, each business function is subject to an annual budget and target-setting process that includes developing financial and business forecasts, conducting sensitivity and risk analyses, and setting relevant objectives.
In setting our objectives we ensure that they are aligned with our medium-term planning assumptions and strategic priorities.
Regular reviews are undertaken in order to monitor and assess progress against business and budget targets.
During the year we also seek to manage the business appropriately, both to optimise our opportunities and to assess key risks and mitigating actions.
Quarterly reports provide the SET and the Board with insight into progress against current year objectives and milestones for longer-term strategic goals.
We assess performance using quantitative, comparative market, operational and financial measures, and qualitative analysis.
We have developed KPIs by which we measure our success in delivering our strategy.
A description of our KPIs and how we performed against them in 2011 is shown below and overleaf.
