the Group has spent a total of 03 07 Mineralogical analysis US$195.7 million on exploration Group laboratories use a wide range at its gold projects.
As a result, of analytical methods, including: Proven and Probable Ore fire assay, atomic absorption Reserves increased by 51% to spectroscopy and mineralogical analysis, x-ray crystallography and 10.2Moz and the Groups total 02 physical property determinations.
Mineral Resources more than doubled to 24.6Moz 04 Pit shell of NE Bakhmut pit designed notwithstanding depletion.

The Group at existing mines: Proven and discovered a further high-grade pay shoot in 2011 on the ore bodys Probable Ore Reserves at Pioneer, north-east extension and the area Pokrovskiy and Malomir increased remains prospective.
36% to 7.1Moz compared with the estimate as of 1 January 2010 notwithstanding depletion of 1.14Moz at these projects.
The Group anticipates a further increase in its gold reserves and 03 resources due to further exploration of the discoveries made and targets identified in 2011.
The Groups team of approximately 1,550 geologists is headed by Nikolai Vlasov, a former Head of the Soviet Unions programme for evaluating gold reserves in the Russian Far East.
The Group has been able to capitalise on his experience and detailed knowledge of the Amur regions geology to identify new exploration targets and to pass his insight on to the next generation of Group geologists.
The Groups geological team is supported by a network of six state-accredited laboratories which conduct assaying, metallurgical testing and sample analysis to establish the gold grade, mineralogical composition and geological properties of the ore and the most suitable method and parameters for cost-efficient extraction and processing.

The Groups laboratories analysed c. 700,000 gold samples in 2011.
06 Channel sampling and mapping a pre-strip at Malomir Since acquiring the Malomir deposit as a greenfield site in 2003, the Groups exploration team has defined 3.94Moz of Ore Reserves and 4.96Moz of Mineral Resources.
The mine is now in production.

02 03 Autoclave equipment and research into extraction methods at Gidrometallurgiya The R&D centre is developing and testing high-pressure and temperature autoclave technologies to process refractory ores.
04 Pilot test plant Built in 2009, the plant enables the Group to test all major modern technological methods of gold extraction and is used for metallurgical tests.
07 06 05 05 Test facilities at Irgiredmet 140 years of experience in gold metallurgy have established Irgiredmet as one of the leading research institutes in Russia.
The centre has been part of the Group since 2006.
06 PHM Engineering, Moscow The Group subsidiary conducts strategic mine planning, detailed technical design, feasibility studies and facilitates technical permitting.
07 Assay lab technician at work Over 1,030 technicians, engineers and scientists work across the Groups laboratory network and R&D centres.
18 Petropavlovsk Annual Report 2011 About us Operations and performance Exploration review Governance Financial statements and information Investment in research, 03 scientific development and innovations has long been seen by management as essential for the future of the Group.
The Group began to build a technical and scientific support base simultaneously with the launch in 1999 of its first mine, Pokrovskiy, when the Groups first testing and analysis laboratory was commissioned.
With the subsequent growth of the Group, its technological support base has expanded in line with the Groups 04 needs and strategy.
Today the Group has a network of state-accredited laboratories, R&D centres and engineering institutions.
Its facilities can conduct a spectrum of work including metallurgical tests, bulk sampling, numerous types of analysis, project design and evaluation, feasibility study preparation and mine planning.
With modern equipment and leading industry specialists, the Group is in a strong position to implement the most advanced, cost-effective and low environmental impact processing technologies, taking advantage of the latest technological developments in the Russian and global mining industries.
Group specialists are regularly called upon as leading industry experts at various projects around Russia.
In 2009, the Group launched a metallurgical test plant, the only one of its kind in Russia.
The plant gives Petropavlovsk the flexibility to test various processing methods for gold extraction in an environment approximating real production and enables the Group to introduce innovative processes and set the most cost-effective parameters at its operations.
This research has been instrumental in preparing the design of the new processing hub at Pokrovskiy, reducing the projects risks and defining the processing parameters.
