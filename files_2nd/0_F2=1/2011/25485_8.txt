Investors are becoming increasingly wary of recent global events, particularly the spectre of a European country debt default.
Economic recovery in most developed markets is evidently slower than originally expected and this, together with recent volatility in commodity prices and an imminent slowdown in government stimulus related spending, is causing a shift in investment behavior towards a more cautious bias.
This, more recent rise of investor anxiety has led to a decline in private client risk appetite and a consequent reduction in equity turnover for our core target market.
In addition to this, our industry is experiencing some pressure in equity trading margins as competitors seek to protect market share.

The variance in operating profi t over the year can be explained as follows: The merger with the Private Bank Wealth Management business became effective on 1 April 2010.
The South African business has bene ted from higher assets under management.
Results as reported in Rands have, however, been negatively impacted by increased personnel costs resulting from the merger, higher IT costs and lower earnings on deal driven and asset swap activities On 30 March 2010, it was announced that Investec and Rensburg Sheppards plc had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all share offer under which Investec would acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Rensburg Sheppards plc not already owned by it.
Following shareholder and regulatory approvals the acquisition became effective on 25 June 2010.
Prior to this date Investecs 47.1% interest in Rensburg Sheppards plc was accounted for as an associate.
As a result of requirements under new accounting rules, the group was required to fair value its existing 47.1% holding in Rensburg Sheppards plc at the point it acquired the remaining 52.9%.
This has resulted in an exceptional gain of 73.5 million net of acquisition costs.
The group issued 37.9 million shares to acquire the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc for a consideration of 180.4 million.
This consideration combined with the existing fair valued holding resulted in the recognition of goodwill and intangibles of 198.5 million and 133.4 million, respectively Further detail is provided below.
The Rensburg Sheppards group comprised two principal trading subsidiaries, Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management Limited RSIM and Rensburg Fund Management RFM.

2011 Investec integrated annual report | Divisional review Wealth and Investment continued Developments UK and Europe Rensburg Sheppards Equity markets declined during the first quarter of the financial year, before beginning a gradual recovery during the remainder of the year and ending the year in positive territory the FTSE 100 index ended the year 5% higher than it started.
The level of the equity markets is a key factor in uencing the value of client portfolios and funds under management the others being investment performance and net organic growth in clients and hence the level of investment management fee income The Edinburgh of ce, which was opened two years ago, continued to deliver its planned growth The sale of RFM, the Rensburg Sheppards groups unit trust management business which accounted for approximately 10% of the Rensburg Sheppards group, was successfully completed in January 2011.
The company was sold to Franklin Templeton Global Investors Limited UK for a cash consideration of 45 million The Financial Services Compensation Scheme levied an exceptional contribution from investment management businesses to meet the cost of compensating investors who suffered losses following the failure of investment rm Keydata.
Rensburg Sheppards Investment Management incurred a levy of 2.45 million during the year in respect of Keydata which was accounted for as a pre-acquisition cost.
South Africa The merger process is progressing reasonably well with a new operational team and management structures in place.
In line with our mediumterm strategy, the next few months will be dedicated to entrenching a common aspiration throughout the business to acquire new advisory and discretionary assets in an endeavour to drive future annuity income growth supported by good investment management performance.
Outlook UK and Europe Rensburg Sheppards While equity markets have improved during the year, the economic outlook remains uncertain.
Future performance will be in uenced signi cantly by the level of the equity markets Rensburg Sheppards will continue to seek to achieve net organic growth in funds under management of 5% per annum Market expectations are for an increase in the UK base rate during the second half of the financial year from its historic low level.
This would have a positive impact on performance as it will increase the margin on interest earned on client money deposits Conversely, the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Standards ILAS regulations, which are beginning to affect the way that banks categorise certain deposits, including those made by RSIM, may put downward pressure on the rates which can be negotiated on deposits in the future.
The full effect of these regulations is yet to emerge and the company is continuing to monitor developments and seek to mitigate the risk that the margin earned on clients and rms deposits going forward may reduce The conclusions and proposals of the retail distribution review RDR continue to be debated.
This review is seeking to change professional quali cation requirements, increase the transparency of charging structures, and tighten the rules governing rms rights to promote themselves as independent advisers.
A signi cant recommendation of the review is that unit trust trail commission be phased out.
The full impact that the RDR will have on the industry remains unclear and the progress of the review and its potential consequences are being monitored by a speci c committee within RSIM.
70 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Divisional review South Africa While equity markets have improved during the year, the economic outlook remains uncertain.
Future performance will be in uenced signi cantly by the level of the equity markets and the direction of the Rand Cost growth in the new financial year will be lower than the year under review and the newly merged business is well positioned to leverage off a more streamlined cost and operational base The turnover line will be in uenced by the success of the business in increasing the value of managed assets, both by attracting new assets and converting non-discretionary assets to discretionary assets, with the addition of new managed mandates funds.
With a relatively stable xed cost base, there is a high level of operating leverage to an increase in turnover Potential further relaxation of exchange controls provides both risk and opportunity.
While asset swap revenues could come under additional pressure, our international fund of funds should help offset this source of revenue with a higher quality annuity revenue stream.
