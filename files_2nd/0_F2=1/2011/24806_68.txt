Authority to Purchase the Companys ordinary shares At the Companys Annual General Meeting held on 19 April 2011 the Company was authorised to purchase up to 11,979,001 of the Companys Ordinary shares 14.99% of its Ordinary share capital in issue at that time.

Between 1 January 2012 and the date of this report, no further shares have been bought back.
The Board continues to believe that the ability of the Company to purchase its own Ordinary shares in the market will potentially benefit all shareholders of the Company.
The repurchase of Ordinary shares at a discount to the underlying net asset value NAV should enhance the NAV per Ordinary share of the remaining shares and may also enable the Company to address more effectively any imbalance between supply and demand for the Companys Ordinary shares.
