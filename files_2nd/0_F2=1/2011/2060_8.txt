In Brazil, we continued to make good progress during the year on development, with unit costs falling for the most recent FPSOs and substantially shorter drilling durations nowachieved.
Since sanctioning the QCLNG project in 2010, we have invested more than $5 billion and we are on track to deliver our first LNG in 2014, just sixyears after entry into the initial joint venture.
