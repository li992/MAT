Policy on directors service contracts, notice periods, termination payments and external appointments The Companys policy is that contracts should be on a rolling basis and will not include either a fixed term or liquidated damages provisions.
Sir Martin Sorrells service contract may be terminated by the Company or by Sir Martin without, in either case, notice needing to be given a so-called contract at will.
This means that the Company may terminate Sir Martins service contract without the need to pay compensation for any notice period.
