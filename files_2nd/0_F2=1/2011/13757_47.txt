Additional shareholder value created is the amount by which the growth in the companys market capitalisation after taking account of net equity cash flows exceeds the median growth of a weighted peer group index over the three to five-year performance period.
The payout under the value share award for the executive directors and members of the executive committee in the aggregate is capped at circa 0.40% of additional shareholder value created over and above the median of the comparator group for any one cycle.
This is the maximum theoretical percentage that can be earned in aggregate by the executive directors and the members of the executive committee, with 99.6% of the extra value created accruing to shareholders.
No awards will be released if the growth in the companys market capitalisation after taking account of net equity cash flows is only at the median of the comparator group.
