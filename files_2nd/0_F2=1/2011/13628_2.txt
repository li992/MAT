about Rotork... We are a flow control company.
Our products are operated worldwide and in markets where the flow of gasses, liquids or powders needs to be controlled across the industrial landscape.
When you turn on a tap or switch on a light, turn on a kettle or put fuel in your car, a flow control product is being used somewhere in the process of delivering that service.
We are the only UK listed company with a global presence that is dedicated to this and nothing else.
