Pay and performance for the 2012 financial year The Remuneration Committee considers the remuneration increases for the different groups of employees across all of our local markets and other relevant factors when assessing the pay of the executive directors.
During its regular review of total compensation in March 2011, the Remuneration Committee decided that due to an improvement in business performance, with a return to revenue growth, and continued focus on profit and strong cash flow, that modest salary increases for the executive directors would be appropriate.
Individual increases will become effective from 1 July 2011 and are set out in the table on page 67.
When determining these increases the Remuneration Committee took into account the general increases in each of the major markets.
It should be noted that the average increase for the executive directors is 2.8% and for the whole of the Executive Committee it is 3% which is in line with increases in the rest of the Group based in the UK.
Details of the GSTIP The short-term incentive plan rewards performance over the one year operating cycle.
This plan consists of four performance measures, three of which are financial measures with the fourth being an assessment of our competitive performance including market share performance relative to our competitors measured by revenue and profit, as well as customer endorsement and satisfaction measured by net promoter score.
Each performance measure has an individual weighting which is reviewed each year to ensure alignment with our strategy.
In the table below we describe our achievement against each of the performance measures and the resulting total incentive payout level for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Performance achievement Between Between threshold target and Above Performance measure Weighting Below threshold and target maximum maximum Service revenue 30% Profit 20% Cash flow 20% Competitive performance assessment 30% Total incentive payout level 124.2% Changes to the GSTIP in 2012 For the 2012 financial year the framework for our annual incentive plan will remain the same as in 2011.
However, to emphasise our focus on profitable growth we have rebalanced the weightings for service revenue and profit so the two measures are equally weighted.
As a result, the split of weightings for our performance measures for the 2012 financial year will be: Service revenue 25%: Profit earnings before interest tax depreciation amortisation 25%: Free cash flow 20%: and Competitive performance assessment 30%.
We believe these measures continue to support our strategy by capturing our underlying operational performance, and our performance as viewed by our customers and in relation to our competition.
