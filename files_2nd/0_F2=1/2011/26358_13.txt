Lloyds Banking Group 44 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 SUMMARY OF GROUP RESULTS Performance in line with our expectations The Group delivered a combined businesses profit of 2,685 million in 2011 broadly in line with our expectations despite the challenging external environment, with the core business delivering a resilient performance, and non-core results reflecting the substantial reductions in non-core assets achieved in the year.
In line with our strategy, we continued to further reduce the risk in our balance sheet, strengthening our core tier 1 capital ratio, significantly reducing non-core assets and improving our funding position.
Group income and margin reductions partially offset by lower costs and impairments The Groups 2011 results, which are analysed below on a combined businesses basis except where stated, were impacted by liability management, volatile items and asset sales when compared to 2010 see page 45.
Excluding these, income declined by 10 per cent, reflecting a smaller balance sheet average interest earning assets are down 6 per cent primarily driven by substantial reductions of non-core assets, and a net interest margin which was 14 basis points lower than in 2010.
The change in margin reflected continued high funding costs, including the costs of refinancing of a significant amount of government and central bank facilities.
Costs reduced 4 per cent, driven by Integration and Simplification related savings and lower bonus accruals, partially offset by inflationary pressures, the new UK bank levy and FSCS costs.
The impairment charge reduced by 26 per cent, with lower charges seen across all divisions.
These lower charges were principally supported by the continued application of our prudent risk appetite and strong risk management controls resulting in improved portfolio and new business quality, continued low interest rates, and broadly stable UK property prices, partly offset by weakening UK economic growth and rising unemployment.
Profit before tax increased by 21 per cent.
Excluding the effects of liability management, volatile items and asset sales, the combined businesses profit before tax increased by 22 per cent to 2,022 million.
A significant improvement in impairment was partly offset by reductions in income, principally as a result of non-core asset reductions to further strengthen the balance sheet, as well as higher funding costs.
Profit before tax included the unwind of 1,943 million of acquisition-related fair value adjustments, around 250 million lower than previously anticipated as a more cautious outlook for certain US securities resulted in the deferral of positive fair value unwind.
Going forward, over the medium-term, and in line with previous guidance, declining fair value unwind benefits are expected to accrue, with the benefit expected to be approximately 0.5 billion in 2012.
The statutory loss before tax was 3,542 million in 2011 included the 3,200 million PPI provision, which is excluded from the combined businesses results, and which was taken in the first half of 2011.
The statutory result also includes, amongst other things, negative insurance volatility of 838 million 2010: positive volatility of 306 million, and charges totalling 1,452 million 2010: 1,653 million, of which 1,097 million related to integration, 185 million to simplification and 170 million to the EC mandated retail business disposal costs.
After a tax credit of 828 million, and after taking into account the profit attributable to non-controlling interests of 73 million, the loss attributable to equity shareholders was 2,787 million and the loss per share amounted to 4.1 pence.
Further progress in reducing the Groups risk We continued to further reduce risk in our balance sheet, by increasing customer deposits, and by making excellent progress against our funding objectives and on the continued reduction of non-core assets, thereby achieving a substantial reduction in wholesale funding requirements.
We strengthened our core tier 1 capital ratio to 10.8 per cent 31 December 2010: 10.2 per cent, largely as a result of a reduction in risk-weighted assets of 54 billion principally from the run down of higher risk non-core assets.
This was partially offset by the implementation of CRD III 20 basis points and the negative impact of the PPI provision 60 basis points.
Our loan to deposit ratio, excluding repos, improved to 135 per cent 31 December 2010: 154 per cent, and to 109 per cent in our core business 31 December 2010: 120 per cent.
Customer deposits excluding repos increased by 6 per cent, reflecting good growth in relationship deposits.
Wholesale funding requirements reduced by 47 billion to 251 billion, of which 138 billion 55 per cent including bank deposits had a maturity date of more than one year 31 December 2010: 149 billion, 50 per cent.
Primary liquid assets at the year-end were 94.8 billion 31 December 2010: 97.5 billion.
We also continue to closely monitor, control and reduce our exposures to selected European countries.
The Groups aggregate exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain totalled 25 billion, of which 16 billion relates to Ireland.
Total exposure has reduced by 9 billion since 31 December 2010.
Further information on our exposures to these countries, including to banking groups, asset backed securities, and corporate, retail and other exposures, is given on pages 156 to 161.
The Group made good progress against its balance sheet reduction plans in the year despite challenging market conditions.
In 2011, we achieved a substantial reduction in the non-core portfolio of 53 billion, resulting in the residual portfolio at 31 December 2011 amounting to 141 billion.
Notable progress was made through treasury asset reductions of 26 billion, UK commercial real estate reductions of 4.5 billion and Irish portfolio reductions of 4.9 billion.
Approximately half of the reduction arose from disposals, primarily treasury assets but pleasingly we also saw gross sales of 0.9 billion in Ireland and around 1.8 billion in Australia.
Asset sales overall were made broadly in line with the net book value at a Group level.
Core and non-core business performance Detailed financial information on core and non-core business performance, including non-core asset reductions, is given on pages 86 to 93.
Our core business delivered a resilient performance given the challenging external environment.
The 6 per cent decline in core income excluding liability management, volatile items and asset sales reflected subdued new lending demand and continued customer deleveraging.
The effect on net interest margin of higher wholesale funding costs was mitigated by improved funding mix in the core business as a result of increased customer deposits, resulting in a small decline in net interest margin of 6 basis points.

The core impairment charge reduced by 20 per cent, reflecting the general stabilisation of our portfolios, and our continued prudent risk appetite applied to new business.
The 2011 core impairment charge as a percentage of average loans and advances to customers improved to 0.64 per cent.
Core loans and advances to customers generated just 24 per cent of the Groups impaired loans, with a coverage ratio of 39 per cent at 31 December 2011.
Core business profit before tax was 6,349 million compared to 6,152 million in 2010.
Excluding liability management, volatile items and asset sales, core business profit before tax decreased by 6 per cent, principally reflecting higher funding costs and a decline in average interest-earning assets as a result of subdued market conditions.
In the non-core business, the 54 per cent fall in income reflected the loss of income from the significant reductions achieved in the non-core portfolio, and losses on asset disposals of 677 million, including losses on treasury assets of 758 million which were largely offset by a related fair value unwind of 737 million included elsewhere in the income statement.
Excluding the losses on disposals of assets, non-core income decreased by 36 per cent.
Net interest margin fell 45 basis points to 1.01 per cent, principally reflecting higher wholesale funding costs, and higher levels of impaired assets.
Non-core operating expenses and other costs reduced by 21 per cent, reflecting the elimination of certain costs of supporting the non-core portfolios.
The non-core impairment charge reduced, principally as a result of material reductions in the Wholesale and International impairment charges.
Non-core loans and advances to customers generated 76 per cent of the Groups impaired loans reflecting their higher risk profile, with a coverage ratio of 48 per cent at 31 December 2011.
Non-core loss before tax was 3,664 million 2010: loss before tax 3,940 million, with the improvement principally driven by reductions in impairment and costs, partly offset by lower income, and lower fair value unwind.
Income Total income, net of insurance claims, decreased by 10 per cent to 21,123 million.
The decrease includes the effect of non-core asset reductions, a number of volatile items including banking volatility, changes in the fair valuation of the equity conversion feature of the Groups Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs, net derivative valuation adjustments and the effect of liability management gains in 2010 and 2011 together effects of liability management, volatile items and asset sales.

The asset reductions, which resulted in losses of 649 million, were primarily non-core asset sales including losses on treasury assets of 758 million, which were largely offset by a related fair value unwind, included elsewhere in the income statement.

This fall primarily reflects the fall of 6 per cent in average interest-earning banking assets in the year, along with the 14 basis points reduction in net interest margin.
The net interest margin in our banking businesses was 2.07 per cent, with the decline from 2.21 per cent in 2010 principally reflecting higher wholesale funding costs, higher deposit rates and the effect of refinancing a significant amount of government and central bank facilities, partially offset by an improvement in customer margins and funding mix.
This fully incorporates the methodology changes outlined in our October 2011 announcement New Allocation Methodologies for Funding Costs and Capital.
Other operating income 2011 2010 Change m m % Other operating income 9,307 9,936 6 Other operating income decreased by 6 per cent to 9,307 million.
The decrease of 6 per cent reflected the targeted reduction in non-core assets, lower core new lending volumes and lower income in Treasury and Trading as a result of market conditions.
Liability management gains Liability management gains of 1,295 million arose in 2011 on transactions undertaken as part of the Groups management of capital, primarily on the exchange of certain debt securities for other debt instruments.
The gain comprises 696 million recognised in statutory net interest income, reflecting a reduction in the carrying value of certain debt securities as a result of changes in expected cash flows, and 599 million recognised in statutory other operating income relating to the debt securities exchange.
The comparable gain in 2010 was 423 million and was recognised in statutory other operating income.

Excluding effects of liability management, volatile items and asset sales, income increased by 4 per cent, with a fall in net interest income more than offset by an increase in other operating income.

This principally reflected a 2 per cent reduction in average interest-earning banking assets in the quarter, mainly driven by non-core asset reductions, and an 8 basis point fall in net interest margin to 1.97 per cent.
Other operating income increased by 19 per cent when compared to the third quarter of 2011, reflecting a recovery from poor trading conditions seen in the third quarter, to a level of other income more comparable with that seen in the first half of the year.
Operating expenses During 2011, operating expenses reduced by 6 per cent to 10,253 million.
Total costs decreased by 4 per cent to 10,621 million, mainly as a result of further integration-related savings and a lower bonus accrual, partially offset by increased employers National Insurance contributions, the bank levy, and Financial Services Compensation Scheme costs.
The bank levy of 189 million was accrued in the final quarter and was lower than initially anticipated due to the improvement in the Groups funding profile.
In the fourth quarter we recognised a charge relating to Financial Services Compensation Scheme costs of 115 million.

A major part of the integration from an IT perspective was the migration of Halifax and Bank of Scotland customer accounts and data to the scaled Lloyds TSB platforms and this was successfully completed in the third quarter.
This was an immense exercise involving the migration of approximately 30 million customer accounts and these platforms will now provide the foundation for the Groups transformation plans.
On 30 June 2011, we announced, as part of our strategy to deliver for customers and shareholders, that we would simplify the Group to improve service and are now targeting the delivery of 1.7 billion of annual savings in 2014 1.9 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2014.
By the end of 2011, after the first six months of this programme, we had achieved run-rate cost savings of 242 million.
Comparison of fourth quarter 2011 costs with third quarter 2011 costs Total costs increased by 5 per cent to 2,712 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2011 as we recognised costs of the bank levy and Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
These were partially offset by a reduction in bonus accruals in the quarter.
Further reductions in the impairment charge The Group continued to see reductions in the impairment charge in 2011.
The impairment charge of 9,787 million in 2011 was 26 per cent lower than the 13,181 million charge in 2010, with lower charges seen across all divisions.
These lower charges were principally supported by the continued application of our prudent risk appetite and strong risk management controls resulting in improved portfolio and new business quality, continued low interest rates, and broadly stable UK retail and commercial property prices, partly offset by weakening UK economic growth and rising unemployment.
Impaired loans decreased by 7 per cent compared to December 2010 to 60.3 billion, representing 10.1 per cent of closing advances, driven by a decrease in Retail and Wholesale as a result of asset sales, repayments, and write-offs, partially offset by an increase in impaired loans in Ireland.
The Groups overall coverage ratio was little changed at 46.0 per cent.
Further detail on impaired asset trends and coverage ratios is given in the Credit Risk review commencing on page 129.

As a percentage of average loans and advances to customers, the impairment charge decreased to 0.54 per cent, from 0.74 per cent in 2010. Credit performance remained strong with fewer assets entering arrears compared to 2010, in both the secured and unsecured portfolios.
Retails coverage ratio fell from 31.8 per cent to 30.8 per cent as a result of the smaller unsecured collections portfolio.
During 2011, Retails secured impairment charge was 463 million, in line with expectations, with the increase on 2010 largely reflecting a less certain outlook for house prices, and provisioning against existing credit risks which have longer emergence periods due to current low interest rates.
These factors were partially offset by an improvement in the quality of the secured portfolio.
This resulted in provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increasing from 23.5 per cent at 31 December 2010 to 25.6 per cent at 31 December 2011.
Secured asset quality remained good and the number of customers entering arrears reduced through 2011 compared to 2010.
The stock of properties in repossession remained stable and the sales prices of repossessed properties continued to be at expected values.
The proportion of the mortgage portfolio with an indexed loan-to-value of greater than 100 per cent has decreased to 12 per cent benefitting from the regional mix of lending.
The value of the portfolio with an indexed loan-to-value of greater than 100 per cent and more than three months in arrears has been stable at just over 3 billion.
Retails unsecured impairment charge for 2011 was 1,507 million, a decrease of 39 per cent, compared to the same period in 2010.
This reflected continued improving new business quality and portfolio trends as a result of our conservative risk appetite, with a focus on lending to existing customers.
This focus on improving business quality has resulted in the level of early arrears for accounts acquired since 2009 being at pre-recession levels.
Unsecured impaired loans decreased to 2.4 billion from 3.0 billion at 31 December 2010 as a result of tighter credit policy across the lifecycle, including stronger controls on customer affordability.
Impairment provisions as a percentage of impaired loans in collections increased to 86.5 per cent at 31 December 2011 from 82.5 per cent at 31 December 2010.
The Wholesale impairment charge decreased from 4,064 million in 2010 to 2,901 million in 2011.
The reduction was primarily driven by lower impairment from the corporate real estate and real estate related asset portfolios partly offset by higher impairment on leveraged acquisition finance exposures.
The continued low interest rate environment helped to maintain defaults at a reduced level.
In addition, newly impaired assets, being generally of better quality, are requiring a lower level of provisions once impaired than previously impaired assets.
The impairment charge as a percentage of average loans and advances to customers improved significantly to 1.95 per cent in 2011 compared to 2.23 per cent in 2010.
Impaired loans as a percentage of lending increased slightly to 20.5 per cent from 20.0 per cent but the coverage ratio fell to 41.6 per cent from 46.9 per cent reflecting write-offs of impaired assets with a higher impairment rate, the substantial reductions of poorer quality non-core assets and lower required impairment rates on newly impaired assets.
In Commercial, the impairment charge decreased by 79 million, or 21 per cent, to 303 million in 2011 reflecting the benefits of the low interest rate environment, which has helped maintain defaults at a lower level, and the continued application of our prudent credit risk appetite.
Portfolio metrics including delinquencies and assets under close monitoring remain above benign environment levels.
The impairment charge as a percentage of average loans and advances to customers improved to 1.06 per cent in 2011 compared to 1.24 per cent in 2010 and impairment provisions as a percentage of impaired loans reduced from 34.7 per cent to 30.2 per cent.
In Wealth and International, impairment charges totalled 4,610 million, a decrease of 23 per cent from 5,988 million in 2010.
The reduction predominantly reflects lower impairment charges in our Irish portfolio where the rate of impaired loan migration has slowed.
The impairment charge as a percentage of average loans and advances to customers improved to 7.37 per cent from 8.90 per cent.
Impaired loans increased by 0.4 billion with an increase of 1.9 billion in Ireland partly offset by a reduction in the Australasian book as a result of write-offs and disposals, resulting in 42.8 per cent of the International portfolios 66.0 per cent of the Irish portfolio being classified as impaired compared with 35.1 per cent in 2010.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans in the International portfolios were 61.0 per cent at the end of 2011 31 December 2010: 52.9 per cent.
Impairment coverage has increased in Ireland to 62.1 per cent from 53.7 per cent, primarily reflecting further falls in the commercial real estate market during 2011, and further vulnerability exists.
Impaired loans accounted for 84.3 per cent of the Irish wholesale portfolio, with a coverage ratio of 61.1 per cent.
Further provisioning has been necessary in the Groups Australasian portfolio primarily reflecting geographical real estate concentrations where market conditions and asset valuations have remained weak in 2011.

Balance sheet Improving capital ratios Change 2011 2010 % Risk-weighted assets 352.3bn 406.4bn 13 Core tier 1 capital ratio 10.8% 10.2% Tier 1 capital ratio 12.5% 11.6% Total capital ratio 15.6% 15.2% Our core tier 1 capital ratio improved significantly to 10.8 per cent at 31 December 2011 31 December 2010: 10.2 per cent.
The impact of the statutory loss, and an increase in risk-weighted assets of approximately 7 billion from the implementation of CRD III which reduced core tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 20 basis points, were more than offset by a reduction in risk-weighted assets of 54.1 billion, principally from disposals of higher risk non-core assets.
The total capital ratio improved to 15.6 per cent 31 December 2010: 15.2 per cent.
Risk-weighted assets reduced 13 per cent to 352.3 billion in 2011, driven by the run-down of our non-core asset portfolio, which accounted for 65 per cent of the reduction, and weak demand for new lending.
Modelling changes had no material effect on risk-weighted assets.
In line with our strategy, the capital intensity of the balance sheet continues to reduce, with new lending being of better quality than existing portfolios, and thus having a lower average risk-weighting.

We are pleased with the progress made on our balance sheet reduction plans in the period, given challenging market conditions.
In 2011, we achieved a substantial reduction in the non-core portfolio of 53 billion, resulting in the portfolio at 31 December 2011 amounting to 141 billion.
This reduction includes more than A2 billion of cash generated from repayments and disposals from the Irish portfolio.

2 Excluding repos and reverse repos.
The Group made excellent progress against its funding objectives in 2011 and further enhanced its general funding and liquidity position which is supported by a robust and stable customer deposit base.
Customer deposits excluding repos increased by 6 per cent, reflecting good growth in relationship deposits, and now represent 62 per cent of our deposit and wholesale funding.
By the end of 2011, our loan to deposit ratio, excluding repos and reverse repos, had improved to 135 per cent and we expect this will continue to improve as we reduce our non-core lending balances further.
Our core loan to deposit ratio also improved to 109 per cent from 120 per cent at the end of 2010.
Strong term issuance in 2011 also allowed the Group to further reduce its short-term wholesale funding and extend its maturity profile of wholesale funding with 55 per cent of wholesale funding having a maturity date greater than one year at 31 December 2011 50 per cent as at 31 December 2010.
Of the funding with maturity less than one year of 113 billion, 24 billion is secured and 24 billion relates to the UK Credit Guarantee Scheme, leaving 65 billion of other unsecured wholesale funding.
Though funding markets remain challenging, we exceeded our 2011 term funding issuance plans with 35 billion of wholesale term issuance.
We announced in our Q3 2011 Interim Management Statement that we had completed our 2011 term funding programme at the end of October.
The wholesale term issuance of 2 billion in November and December was therefore pre-funding for 2012.
As previously outlined we have a 20 billion to 25 billion term funding requirement during 2012 across all public and private issuance programmes.
Given the pre-funding of 2012 requirements achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011, the benefits of the liability management exercise in December 2011, and issuance of 8 billion in January and February 2012, we have already achieved over 50 per cent of this target by the end of February 2012.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had 24 billion of issuance remaining under the UK Credit Guarantee Scheme.
As previously outlined, we expect to repay the remaining facilities in line with their contractual maturity dates, 19 billion in the first half of 2012 and 5 billion in the second half of 2012.
The Group also continues to maintain a strong liquidity position, considerably in excess of current regulatory requirements.
Our primary liquidity portfolio at the end of the year was 94.8 billion, in line with the level at December 2010.
This represents approximately 133 per cent of our money market funding positions as at the end of December 2011 and is approximately 84 per cent of all wholesale funding with a maturity of less than a year, providing a substantial buffer in the event of continued market dislocation.
In addition to this primary liquidity, the Group continues to hold more than 100 billion of secondary liquidity.

The Integration programme has now delivered run-rate recurring savings of 2,054 million per annum as at the end of 2011, at an aggregate expensed cost of 3,846 million.
The Simplification programme is well underway and achieved annual run-rate savings of 242 million in 2011.
Further details on the Integration and Simplification programmes are given on page 96.
Verde The Verde business comprises a network of 632 branches, and the TSB and Intelligent Finance brands, and serves approximately 5.5 million customers.
Our preferred option for the disposal of the Verde business is a direct sale and the preferred bidder for the business is The Co-operative Group.
Any final transaction will be subject to regulatory approval and certain other conditions.
We continue to expect to be in a position to update shareholders on progress towards the end of March 2012 at which time, and if appropriate, we will provide further details on the proposed transaction.
We will continue to progress an IPO as an alternative to a direct sale.
Volatility arising in insurance businesses A large proportion of the funds held by the Groups insurance businesses are invested in assets which are expected to be held on a long-term basis and which are inherently subject to short-term investment market fluctuations.
Whilst it is expected that these investments will provide enhanced returns compared with less volatile assets over the longer term, the short-term effect of investment market volatility can be significant.
The negative insurance and policyholder interests volatility of 838 million in 2011 reflects lower equity and cash returns compared to longterm expectations.
Provision in relation to German insurance business litigation As previously disclosed, Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited CMIG has received a number of claims in the German courts, relating to policies issued by CMIG but sold by independent intermediaries in Germany.
The Group has recognised a provision of 175 million in 2011 and management believes this represents the most appropriate estimate of the financial impact, based upon a series of assumptions, including the number of claims received, the proportion upheld, and resulting legal and administration costs.
Payment protection insurance Our review of the compliance with applicable sales standards in respect of PPI continues to make good progress and we continue to believe that the provision of 3.2 billion we took in the first half of 2011 in respect of the anticipated costs of contact and or redress, including administration expenses, is adequate and that we are appropriately provided.
Costs incurred in 2011 against this provision amounted to 1,045 million.
Taxation The tax credit for 2011 was 828 million.
This reflects a lower effective tax rate than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the effect on deferred tax of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 26 per cent with effect from 1 April 2011 and to 25 per cent with effect from 1 April 2012, offset by the net movement in deferred tax recognised for losses.
Summary of financial progress During 2011, the Group has continued to make very significant progress in divesting non-core assets and refocusing customer balances loans and deposits to meet our prudent risk appetite and to enable reduced wholesale funding with a strong liquidity position.
We have the appropriate momentum that will allow that journey to continue in the medium-term in line with our strategic objectives.
Our customer propositions are now better aligned to our income generating opportunities and, while headline progress is reflective of economic conditions, we are well positioned to continue to respond to customer needs by building income through both lending and advice products.
Both our derisking and customer focus are underpinned by the ongoing reshaping of our cost base, exploiting the experience of delivering the complex integration, with significant investment spend to deliver our strategic priorities.
2 The net credit in 2011 of 1,943 million is mainly attributable to a reduction in the impairment charge of 1,693 million as losses reflected in the acquisition balance sheet valuations of the lending and securities portfolios have been incurred.
3 The calculation basis for banking net interest margins is set out on page 97.
4 Impairment on loans and advances to customers divided by average loans and advances to customers, excluding reverse repurchase transactions, gross of allowance for impairment losses.
5 Operating expenses excluding impairment of tangible fixed assets divided by total income net of insurance claims.
