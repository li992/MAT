Management supported us and we got the money to do what we had to do.
We worked together as a team.
Any one person could have slowed down the process.
We had a challenge and together we were able to deal with it.
We achieved this with no associated safety incidents, on time, on budget and on scope.

com Operating review: Zinc continued 68 Zinc Global zinc consumption The growing market for zinc-coated galvanized steels supported a 4% kt increase in global demand for rened zinc to 12.5 million tonnes.
Demand 15,000 growth from the construction sector in emerging economies more than offset weaker demand from developed economies.
Global automobile production was 2% higher than in 2010 in line with a small growth in consumer demand.
China continued to be the worlds largest consumer of 13,000 zinc for its construction and infrastructure sectors, despite the dampening effect of the governments ination control measures on business investment and consumer spending.
11,000 In 2011, global supply of mined zinc increased by 3% and smelter production grew by just over 2%.
China was the main contributor to production growth and the worlds largest producing country, despite reports that some mines and smelters were operating at a loss during much of the year.

Q Global zinc consumption Production increased substantially at Indian, South Korean and Peruvian Source: Brook Hunt smelters, while the earthquake and tsunami in Japan reduced output from domestic smelters.
Lead Chinas smelters imported nearly 3 million tonnes of zinc concentrate during Global lead consumption in 2011 was more than 9.8 million tonnes, a 4% 2011 to meet domestic zinc consumption needs.
Continuing over-capacity increase on the previous year.
Demand from Chinas automobile and in the global smelting market and resultant low capacity utilisation rates, electric-powered bicycle sectors continued to be the driving force behind especially in China, ensured strong competition for concentrates and put global growth, with Chinese lead consumption increasing by 8%, or an pressure on treatment and rening charge settlements.

US demand for lead continued to rebound, treatment charges for 2011 settled at $229 per tonne of concentrate on a increasing by 5%, while a buoyant German automotive market helped offset $2,500 per tonne zinc price basis against $273 per tonne of concentrate on weakness elsewhere in Europe.
Demand was stable from end-use sectors, the same basis in 2010.
Spot treatment charges started the year around including mobile power applications such as forklift machinery and standby $120 per tonne of concentrate and declined to $60 per tonne of concentrate power applications such as telecommunication networks.
In 2011, global rened lead production increased by 5% to 10 million tonnes LME zinc prices ranged between $2,400 and $2,800 per tonne during the as Chinas output rose 7%, an additional 300,000 tonnes, and production of first half of the year, but weakened signicantly during the second half to rened metal increased in South Korea, the US and India.
Despite reduced end the year at $1,827 per tonne.
By year-end, rened zinc stocks at London production at its high cost operations and insufficient domestic concentrate Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses had increased supply for its smelters, China continues to be the largest supplier of both by a total of 172,326 tonnes to 1,184,486 tonnes.

Imports of lead concentrate into China were of $2,190 per tonne for 2011 was marginally higher than the average of 1.3 million tonnes in 2011, 10% lower than in 2010.
Rened metal premia were relatively steady in most A moderate surplus of rened lead in 2011 resulted in an increase in stocks regions, but increased in the US where local reneries do not produce enough at London Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses of to meet demand.

Outlook LME lead prices ranged between $2,400 and $2,800 per tonne during the In 2012 we expect demand for zinc to grow at similar levels to 2011 at first half of 2011 and then declined in response to the deteriorating global around 4% to 5%, reecting ongoing demand from urbanisation and outlook.
The lead price averaged $2,399 per tonne during 2011, compared industrialisation in Asia.
While we anticipate that supply will remain to an average of $2,148 per tonne in 2010. moderately ahead of demand in 2012, a number of pending mine closures, the potential for disruptions to mined production and a more vigorous recovery in the global economy could rapidly deplete existing metal inventories in the medium term.

com Operating review: Zinc continued Our zinc business achieved real unit cost savings of $85 million as a result of 70 efficiency improvements and improved by-product recoveries.
While higher sales prices added $99 million to operating profit, overall operating profit decreased by 11% to $814 million due to reduced overall sales volumes as a result of lower production and sales volumes at Antamina, adverse exchange rates and ongoing CPI and mining ination.
A weaker US dollar against all of our operating currencies reduced our operating profit by $93 million, coupled with an impact of $128 million from CPI and mining ination, particularly for consumables and energy.
Our initiatives to achieve sustainable cost savings at our operations delivered $85 million, net of a $17 million impact from lower head grades.
Mining C1 cash costs fell by 18% from 40.50 per pound in 2010 to 33.19 per pound in 2011 through cost savings initiatives and improved by-product credits.
We are a fully integrated zinc producer and on an integrated mine and smelter basis, we continued to reduce C1 costs by 17% from 30.64 per pound in 2010 to 25.43 per pound in 2011.

Despite the impact of adverse weather at McArthur River Mine and the Mount Isa operations in the first quarter of the year and electricity supply issues at Mount Isa in the final quarter, our Australian operations Mined volumes at the Mount Isa operations rose by 6% over 2010 levels to achieved a 2% improvement in zinc in concentrate volumes during 2011.
9.1 million tonnes, including a production record of 5.3 million tonnes of ore at Black Star open cut mine.
Throughput at the Mount Isa zinc-lead concentrator also achieved record levels, up 8% to 9.2 million tonnes.
However lower head grades meant that zinc in concentrate production rose only slightly while lead bullion volumes recorded a small decrease year-on-year.
Zinc Lead Europe Operating profit for our European operations fell by 3% to $254 million as cost saving initiatives were offset by the negative impact of adverse foreign exchange rates and ination.
The San Juan fide Nieva Plant achieved a new production record of 489,000 tonnes of zinc metal.
Operational improvements initiated last year to treat zinc concentrates with high copper content led to record copper production at the plant of 4,640 tonnes, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year.
Zinc metal production at our Nordenham plant in Germany rose by 6% to 154,000 tonnes, while a change in the operations inventory levels led to sales volumes decreasing by 2% to 148,000 tonnes compared to 2010.
We achieved increased volumes through the successful commissioning in January 2011 of the new 20,000 tonnes per year direct leaching stage that uses our proprietary hydrometallurgy technology plant.
The Northeet renery in the UK produced 130,000 tonnes of rened lead Bracemac-McLeod, Canada and 5.4 million ounces of silver during the year.
Volumes were lower than the At full production, the Bracemac-McLeod mine will produce 80,000 previous year, largely due to delayed crude lead shipments from Mount Isa tonnes of zinc and 10,000 tonnes of copper annually.

Silver production was tonnes are expected in early 2012, ramping up to reach full production also lower than the previous year, for the same reasons.
Zinc Lead Americas Operating profit increased to $455 million up 18% from $386 million in 2010, as higher realised prices and cost reduction initiatives offset lower volumes at Antamina, where the mine plan is producing a greater proportion of copper-only ores and lower zinc grades.
