39 New World Resources Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Business Review Corporate Governance Financials Additional Information Case study Mining controllers have access to new real time monitoring systems We will deliver greater economies with the implementation of our new logistics system.
Logistics is fundamental to safe and efficient deep-mining operations and the new system is focused on increasing the efficiency of materials handling, from surface loading all the way through to underground deployment, dramatically reducing the physical effort involved in such processes, and importantly, increasing the safety of our operations.
By transmitting information at each stage of the process over an underground online network, the new system enables the controller to monitor progress in real time, eliminating bottlenecks and the unnecessary stacking up of material.
With the pilot phase launched at our Darkov Mine in 2011, the new system will gradually be rolled out across all our mines with full implementation by 2014.
SM Mine in Karvin region produced 2,862,000 tonnes in 2011 which is record volume in its more than forty years history.
The key determinants of the success were investment in mining technology and installation of new belt coal haulage.
The greatest credit for reaching of production level and increasing the safety belongs SM Mine employees.
By investing in modern technologies employees often exchanged paper and pencil for a computer connected online to surface and underground operations.
