The GSCI Energy Index increased by 25% from December 2010 to December 2011.
Coal During H12011 demand for coal was strongly supported by cold weather related demand, combined with supply shortages due to Australian flooding and adverse weather conditions in Colombia, which left the traded market relatively tight.
The effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on nuclear generation also played a role in increasing demand for coal, especially in the environmentally sensitive Atlantic markets.
Thereafter, the global financial crisis and uncertainty surrounding consumption patterns led to many players taking a cautious approach towards longer term commitments and a move to a more spot price oriented market.
This resulted in lower demand and prices.
Prices fell further towards the end of the year, impacted by mild weather and robust coal supplies, especially from the US, which affected the Atlantic markets, whereas the Asian markets remained more robust and resilient, although the general trend was also lower.
Oil Brent front month prices started the year at $95 per barrel and ended at $107 per barrel, ranging between $93 per barrel and $127 per barrel, with most of the volatility seen during the first half of the year.
During 2010, the range was between $70 per barrel to $95 per barrel.
The increased volatility in H12011, driven by events in the Middle East and North Africa, the Japanese Tsunami and nuclear accident, European sovereign debt concerns and the IEAs decision to release strategic reserves in June, provided numerous marketing opportunities.
For example, the removal of Libyas light sweet crude caused a sharp tightening of supplies of this grade.
During H22011, oil prices trended downwards, and oil markets became dominated by bank and sovereign credit developments.
The resulting unpredictability during this period resulted in more challenging trading conditions.
WTI became further dislocated from international grades in the second half of the year due to the domestic US crude benchmarks captive delivery location.
The differential between Brent-WTI started the year at $2 per barrel differential, reaching a peak of $28 per barrel in mid-October before narrowing to $ 9 per barrel at the end of December 2011.
The market ended with Brent and gasoil in backwardation but with gasoline showing the expected contango into the driving season.
| Annual Report 2011 | 59 MARKETINg Highlights 2011 saw a strong year-on-year improvement, however this reflects, to a large extent, the weak base comparable period for oil marketing in 2010.
2011 continued to be negatively impacted by the weak freight environment in both the dry and wet market segments.
Adjusted EBIT for 2011 was $697million, compared to $450million in 2010, an increase of 55%.

The reduced volatility and lower overall freight rates resulted in fewer arbitrage opportunities between the various origins, with smaller volumes of cross market arbitrage being available.
The reduction in volumes of generally higher margin specialised products resulted in a negative variance compared to 2010, although overall profitability remained solid.
The outlook for 2012 remains positive, although some market weakness can be expected during the early part of the year due to the uncertainty surrounding the European sovereign debt crisis.
Thereafter, we expect demand to pick up and remain stable on the back of lower inventories and reduced nuclear capacity.
The availability of good quality coal is likely to remain constrained with most of the growth in production centred on lower quality products, which is therefore likely to allow good quality coal to enjoy solid premiums over the rest of the market.
Glencores focus remains committed to continue a growth strategy around strengthening of global partnerships with key players in the Pacific and Atlantic markets and to build up arbitrage and multi sourcing capabilities beyond equity investments.
Glencore is well placed in this respect with most of its production and equity partnerships covering premium quality coal.
Oil On an overall barrels per day basis, volumes decreased by 5% to 2.3million barrels per day in 2011 from 2.5million barrels per day in 2010.
Despite this modest decline in volume, there was no material impact to the departments overall business coverage in support of profit opportunities and future growth potential.
Whilst high volatility and favourable physical supply demand conditions provided more opportunities in H12011, the market during H22011 proved more challenging, with weaker expectations for developed market economic growth, poor refining margins and weak freight rates, resulting in fewer arbitrage opportunities.
Despite a general improvement in freight in the months leading up to May 2011, challenging conditions returned for the remainder of the year with the renewed sovereign debt crisis, evidenced by market oversupply particularly of larger vessels, continuing high bunker fuel prices and lower back-haul.
60 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN INduSTRIAL ACTIVITIES Highlights The energy industrial segment delivered a substantially improved performance during 2011 on the back of production increases at our coal operations in Colombia.
Industrial revenues in 2011 were $2,309million versus $1,499million in 2010, an increase of 54%.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT for 2011 was $571million and $375million respectively, up 59% and 60% compared to $359million and $235million in 2010.
Our coal mining and infrastructure expansion in Colombia is progressing well with Puerto Nuevo more than 50% complete and expected to be commissioned in Q12013.
The Aseng oil field in Block I started production in November 2011, well ahead of its initial estimated timeline, with a total production of 2.8million barrels by year-end, in excess of 50,000 barrels per day.
2 Shanduka production for 2010 restated to a saleable basis, previously reported on a ROM Run of Mine basis.
2011 2010 thousand bbls Total Total Change Oil Block I 2785 n. m. Total 2785 n. m. On a 100% basis.
Glencores ownership interest in the Aseng field is 23.75% OPERATIONS Prodeco Glencore interest: 100% Total own coal production in 2011 was 14.6million tonnes, an increase of 46% compared to 10.0million tonnes in 2010.
This substantial increase is largely attributable to the broad expansion project underway, which is forecast to increase production to 21million tonnes by Q42013.
At the Calenturitas mine, Sector A has been opened contributing 4.3million tonnes of the 7.6million tonnes produced in 2011, a 46% increase from 5.2million tonnes in 2010.
Production at the La Jagua mine was 7.0million tonnes, a 46% increase compared to 4.8million tonnes in 2010.
The increased production across Prodecos mines was somewhat constrained by the previously communicated delays in delivery of mining equipment from Japan in the aftermath of the Tsunami as well as the downtime of 21 rain days in excess of budget, primarily due to exceptionally heavy rains in October and November.
The largest capital expenditure project currently underway is the construction of the new direct loading port Puerto Nuevo in Cienaga, which will provide Prodeco with higher annual throughput capacity and a lower operating cost, compared with the current port at Puerto Prodeco Zuiga.
The project is on schedule and expected to be commissioned in Q12013.
The remaining capital expenditure projects relate to ongoing mine fleet expansion and mine-based infrastructure support, which is substantially complete.
Shanduka Glencore interest: 70.0% Total saleable own coal production for 2011 was 5.9million tonnes, a 20% decrease compared to 2010 production of 7.4million tonnes.
This decrease was primarily due to the Kendal operations being placed on care and maintenance, which had the effect of reducing lower-margin domestic sales.
A pre-feasibility study related to the Springboklaagte project is progressing well and is showing positive results.
62 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Umcebo Glencore interest: 43.7% Glencore completed the acquisition of a 43.7% stake in Umcebo in December 2011.
The transaction secures access to long-life resources from South Africas principal coal field in Mpumalanga, which has established infrastructure for the transport of export quality thermal coal.
In addition, it also secures an eventual 1.5million tonnes of export allocation in PhaseV of the Richards Bay Coal Terminal expansion.
Umcebo currently has three thermal coal mines in operation Middelkraal, Kleinfontein and Klippan and a standalone wash plant, with an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 6.0million tonnes of saleable coal.
Furthermore, the Wonderfontein mine is scheduled to commence production in late 2012, with an annual saleable production capacity of 2.7million tonnes.
Oil Exploration & Production Glencore interest: Block I: 23.8% Block O: 25.0% First production from the Aseng field Block I Equatorial Guinea was achieved on 6November2011, ahead of the planned startup of Q12012.
Gross oil production achieved to the end of December2011 was 2.8million barrels, an average daily rate of over 50,000barrels per day.
Gross oil production since the start of 2012 has averaged 55,000barrels per day.
Subsea development drilling and well completion work on the Alen gas condensate field Block O Equatorial Guinea remains ongoing, whilst the shallow water wellhead platform arrived and was installed in H22011.
The project remains on schedule for first production in late 2013 with a target flow rate of 37,500barrels per day.
