underlying operating 183.9 profit was 79.3 million, an increase of 0.6%.
Average profit per pub increased by 2.1%.
2011 183.9 The estate is comprised of two categories of pub: around 1,000 pubs that will remain on traditional tenanted agreements, and at least 600 2010 170.8 pubs that we are converting to Retail Agreements.
In the traditional estate the performance has been stable, with revenue 2009 175.8 up 0.7%, and operating profit up 0.8% on last year.
Rent increased by 2008 186.4 1.6%, supporting our long-held view that our rent setting process is fair with the clear objective of establishing sustainable rent levels.
Tenant 2007 200.9 turnover is also low at around 10%, demonstrating that good tenanted and leased pubs operated by skilled licensees are capable of meeting the challenges of the current economic environment.
Operating margins in these pubs are similar to last year.
operating profit m Performance in the 600 pubs remaining has improved significantly as we have steadily converted this group of pubs to Retail Agreement.
At 79.3 the year-end, Retail Agreements operated in 337 pubs.
These conversions contributed 1.3 million of profit growth this year, offset by 2011 79.3 continued profit decline in the pubs yet to be converted.
As highlighted earlier, the rollout of the agreement represents a significant growth 2010 78.8 opportunity and over the next two years we expect to address this decline by converting the remainder of the 600 pubs.
2009 81.8 Operating margin for the division was 3.0% lower at 43.1%, primarily 2008 88.0 due to the Retail Agreement.
These franchise agreements generate increased profit but the operating margin percentage is reduced.
Capital 2007 90.8 investment in the period was 33 million including around 14 million in Retail Agreement pubs and 13 million in maintenance capital, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a high quality estate.
Stability in the traditional estate average profit per pub k Our objective for pubs operating under the traditional tenanted model is to operate a stable, well-invested estate that can achieve sustainable 48 modest growth.
In the past year we have introduced a series of measures to support this strategy: 2011 48 zz enhanced licensee support.
We have integrated Group commercial functions those supporting our managed pubs and our 2010 47 tenanted and leased pubs into one team to ensure that we 2009 48 maximise the benefits of our managed pub expertise and greater buying power across all of our pubs, and thus increase the level of 2008 51 support we are able to offer to our licensees.

The benefit of this support is reflected in our low licensee turnover and the fact that we have very few closed pubs.

Development of the retail agreement There are several features of the agreement that contribute to improved performance: zz reduced risk for the franchisee.
The franchisee earns around 20% of total revenue, and is responsible for staff costs.
Marstons retains responsibility for other operating costs and stock.
The franchisee is required to provide a 5,000 returnable deposit.
Marstons invests around 50,000 to improve the consumer appeal of the pub.
The retail offer, including food menus and entertainment, is developed by the same team that is responsible for our managed pubs.
A key attraction for franchisees is that negotiations over rent and beer prices play no part in this business model, helping to ensure that all stakeholders are focused on maximising consumer satisfaction, and thus revenue.
zz Wider pool of retailers.
The Retail Agreement attracts nearly three times more applicants than the traditional tenanted model.
Following franchise accreditation with the British Franchise Association we are able to promote the agreement to a wider pool of entrepreneurs, with nearly 30% of Retail Agreement licensees having come from outside the industry.
This high demand helps to ensure that the quality of our licensees remains high.
During the year we undertook a survey of 132 franchisees to establish their views of the agreement.
The response was extremely positive 85% of franchisees commented that they were making an acceptable living or better, and 93% would recommend the agreement to others.
This is reflected in high franchisee stability levels.
