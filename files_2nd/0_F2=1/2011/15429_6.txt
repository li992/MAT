We aim to make buying, moving into and living in a Taylor Wimpey home as easy as possible for our customers.
Sales and marketing Sales strategy continues to be a key element of delivering value.
We set prices locally and make use of a range of targeted customer incentives to deliver competitive offers in each local market.
Financing remains a key consideration for many of our customers, as mortgage availability remains restricted.
We support the governments FirstBuy initiative and have completed 173 homes under this scheme in 2011.
Our remaining funding allocation will allow us to deliver approximately 1,100 further completions under the scheme.
We remain sparing in our use of other shared equity incentives and welcome the development of the government and housebuilder-backed NewBuy mortgage indemnity guarantee scheme and MI New Home scheme in Scotland.
Although details have yet to be nalised, these schemes have the potential to have a significant positive impact on the level of new home sales if sufficient funds are made available at competitive interest rates.
We continue to offer a wide range of other products to assist first time buyers, such as our Friends & Family Advantage product and Deposit Match scheme.
The ongoing success of our approach is reected in the consistently high proportion of our sales that are made to first time buyers, with a further increase to 30% in 2011 2010: 29%.
