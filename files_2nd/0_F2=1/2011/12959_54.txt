Kibali Mine Development continued 2 The Kibali project is a gold development property which covers an area of 1 836km on the Moto Goldfields in the north east of the DRC.
It is located some 560 kilometres north east of the city of Kisangani and 150 kilometres west of the Ugandan border town of Arua.
Kibali is a joint venture between Randgold 45%, AngloGold Ashanti 45% and a Congolese parastatal, Sokimo 10%.
The project development is being managed by Randgold which Feasibility study and mine development will also operate the mine.
It is envisaged that the Kibali mine will PROgRess comprise an integrated open pit and underground operation with The project successfully completed a critical year with the optimised the core capital programme scheduled to run over the next four feasibility study having been finalised by year end, as scheduled.

Mineral resources were generated by Mr Ernest Doh, an officer of the company and competent person.
Open pit mineral reserves were reported at a gold price of US$1 000 oz and an average cut-off of 0.9g t and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Onno ten Brinke and Mr Nicholas Coomson, both officers of the company and competent persons.
