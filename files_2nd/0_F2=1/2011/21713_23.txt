Report on AllBlue Limited AllBlue by BlueCrest Capital Management LLP for the year ended 31 December 2011 Markets were dominated in 2011 by developments in the Eurozone, combined with increasing concerns on the US deficit and the negative impact on global growth.
Unlike 2008, where the crisis had a clear catalytic event in the failure of Lehman and the US government was willing and able to act: 2011 saw the slow unravelling of a widespread European sovereign crisis, with a collection of measures agreed upon precarious consensus across many countries.
The lack of remedial action has resulted in stalled growth and an environment where markets have been driven by political moves.
In addition, regime changes in the Middle East and the tragic natural disaster in Japan all contributed to a challenging year for investors.
The hedge fund industry as a whole has posted disappointing results in 2011, with the Dow Jones Credit Suisse Core Index down -7.4% on the year and the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index down -8.9%.
Risky asset classes delivered negative returns with the MSCI World -7.6%.
Conversely, government bonds rallied, with the BarCap Global Aggregate Bond Index 5.4%.
Commodities in general were modestly positive, with S&P GSCI 2.1%.
AllBlue Class A USD made 1.88% in the period under review, calendar year 2011, with 12 month annualised volatility of 3.17%.
The main performance contributors were BlueCrest Capital International and BlueCrest Mercantile, with BlueTrend adding marginally to returns.
Other strategies made minor negative contributions for the year.
