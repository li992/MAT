Auditor A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting The Board has decided, in line with best practice, to move to voting on a poll at the Annual General Meeting, rather than a show of hands.
The Board believes that this will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised, including the votes of all shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting but who appoint a proxy for the meeting.
On a poll, each shareholder has one vote for every share held.
The Notice of Meeting on pages 116 and 117 sets out the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting and gives details of the voting record date and proxy appointment deadline for that meeting.
Resolutions 1 to 12 comprise ordinary business and resolutions 13 to 16 special business.
Authority to allot shares and grant rights At the Annual General Meeting held on 8 July 2010, shareholders authorised the directors, under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot ordinary shares without the prior consent of shareholders for a period expiring at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2011 or, if earlier, on 1 October 2011.
Resolution 13 will seek to renew this authority and to authorise the directors under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into shares for a period expiring no later than 1 October 2012.
Paragraph a i of resolution 13 will allow the directors to allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 13,028,172 representing approximately one-third of the Companys existing issued share capital and calculated as at 23 May 2011 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Report.
In accordance with the latest institutional guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers, paragraph a ii of resolution 13 will allow directors to allot, including the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph a i of resolution 13, further of the Companys ordinary shares in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a Rights Issue to ordinary shareholders up to a maximum nominal amount of 26,056,344, representing approximately two-thirds of the Companys existing issued share capital and calculated as at 23 May 2011 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report.
The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
However, if they do exercise the authority, the directors intend to follow best practice as regards its use including as regards the directors standing for re-election in certain cases, as recommended by the ABI.
Resolution 13 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to renew this authority until the conclusion of the next AGM or, if earlier, the close of business on 1 October 2012.
91 Annual review Financials Governance Disapplication of pre-emption rights Also at last years meeting, a special resolution was passed, under sections 570 to 573 of the Companies Act 2006, empowering the directors to allot equity securities for cash without first being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders.
Resolution 14 will seek to renew this authority.
If approved, the resolution will authorise directors in accordance with the Articles of Association to issue shares in connection with a Rights Issue and otherwise to issue shares for cash up to a maximum nominal amount of 1,954,225 which includes the sale on a non pre-emptive basis of any shares held in treasury.
The maximum nominal amount of equity securities to which this authority relates represents approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 23 May 2011 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Report.
The directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company for cash on a non pre-emptive basis in any rolling three year period without prior consultation with the shareholders and the Investment Committees of the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds.
Resolution 14 will be proposed as a special resolution to renew this authority until the conclusion of the next AGM or, if earlier, the close of business on 1 October 2012.
Authority to purchase own shares A special resolution was also passed at last years meeting enabling the Company to purchase its own shares in the market.
Resolution 15 will seek to renew this authority.
The maximum number of shares to which the authority relates is 46,870,154.
This represents 14.99% of the share capital of the Company in issue as at 23 May 2011.
The directors intend only to exercise this authority if to do so would, in their opinion, enhance shareholder value.
If Resolution 15 is passed at the Annual General Meeting, the Company will have the option of holding as treasury shares any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution.
This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares, providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
No dividends will be paid on shares whilst held in treasury and no voting rights will attach to the treasury shares.
Any shares purchased by the Company under this authority would be cancelled unless the shares are being purchased by the Company to hold and resell as treasury shares.
The price paid for ordinary shares will not be less than the nominal value of 12.5 pence per share and not more than the higher of 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of the Companys ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days preceding the day on which the ordinary shares are purchased and the amount stipulated by Article 5 1 of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003.
There were no purchases of shares by the Company during the year.
At 31 March 2011, the number of shares which may be purchased under the shareholders authority given at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, following the Rights Issue was 46,870,154 based on shares in issue of 312,676,149.
At 23 May 2011, the Company held no shares in treasury.
Resolution 15 will be proposed as a special resolution to renew this authority until the conclusion of the next AGM or, if earlier, the close of business on 1 October 2012.
Notice of general meetings The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days.
Annual General Meetings must always be held on at least 21 clear days notice.
At last years Annual General Meeting, shareholders authorised the calling of general meetings other than an Annual General Meeting on not less than 14 clear days notice and Resolution 16 seeks to renew this authority.
The authority granted by this resolution, if passed will be effective until the Companys next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
Note that in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days notice, the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.
The flexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the directors consider this appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting and in the interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation The directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
Your Board will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommends that you do so as well.
By order of the Board Desna Martin Company Secretary 24 May 2011
