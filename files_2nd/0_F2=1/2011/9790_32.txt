For the Deferred Share Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan the vesting date is three years from the date of grant.
For the Restricted Share Plan, the vesting date will vary by each award.
To provide executives with greater exibility in their financial planning, the awards were restructured as nil cost options on 1 November 2010 to permit exercise of the options at any point between the vesting date and tenth anniversary of grant.
There has been no amendment to the original performance conditions or performance, deferred or restricted period, as a result of this change.
Awards under these plans that vested or lapsed before 1 November 2010 are shown in the previous Share Schemes table.
2 The number of options shown under the Performance Share Plan is the maximum 100% number that could be receivable by the executive director if the EPS performance conditions are fully met as outlined on page 59.
The award made in 2008 will lapse on 5 June 2011 as it has not met the minimum EPS target of RPI 3%.
The interim measurement for the 2009 and 2010 awards indicates a current vesting of 100% and 98.9% respectively, based on latest reported results.
3 The Executive Share Options have all been held for three years and have met their performance targets and can therefore be exercised under the scheme rules: The option price for grants made in July 2004 was above the market value on 2 April 2011: The option price for grants made in November 2004 was below the market value on 2 April 2011.
4 As described in last years Remuneration report, this award was made in connection with Marc Bollands appointment to Chief Executive officer, to compensate him for incentive awards that were forefeited on cessation with his previous employer.
5 John Dixon was awarded these Restricted Share Plan options before he was appointed executive director 6 As described in the Board Appointments section of this report, this award was made in connection with Alan Stewarts appointment to Chief Finance officer, to compensate him for incentive awards that were forfeited on cessation from his previous employer.
The market price of the shares at the end of the financial year was 338.9p: the highest and lowest share price during the financial year were 427.5p and 326.4p respectively.
The explanation of the performance criteria attached to the Performance Share Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme is set out under Long-Term Incentive Schemes on page 59 have been audited.

The Listing Rules require this to be disclosed excluding ination.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the current Transfer Values Regulations.
Thetransfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of the assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benets.
They do not represent sums payable to the director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in transfer value is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benets during the year.
No other executive director participates in the scheme.
Instead they receive a salary supplement in lieu of membership of the Group Pension Scheme as described on page 56. b Payments to former directors Details of payments made to former directors during the year are: 2011 2010 Unfunded pensions 000 000 Clinton Silver 111 108 The pension entitlement for Clinton Silver is supplemented by an additional unfunded pension paid by the Company.
