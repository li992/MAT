The overall impact in the current year is not significant but this may not always be the case.
The Group is exposed to general valuation movements in the UK and USA property markets.
Outlook In today's uncertain economic conditions it is particularly pleasing to have been able to report another year of progress with encouraging growth in the value of our properties.
It is more than usually difficult at present to form a clear view of what the immediate future may hold for us.
Nevertheless, our property portfolio is diverse and our finances are sound and this gives us the confidence that your Group will sustain its progress through the continued application of the prudent, long term business approach which has served us so well over the years.
Loyal and hardworking staff are essential to our continued success: to them must go our sincere thanks.
