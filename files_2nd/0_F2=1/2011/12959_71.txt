During 2011 a strategic decision was made to restructure KCD and Gorumbwa returned encouraging results which the exploration department to create dedicated brownfields and indicated the possibility of extending the 9000 lode mineralisation greenfields exploration teams, ensuring that while the feasibility towards the Gorumbwa deposit: DDD456 - 7.5 metres at 1.64g t work and testing of extensions to known deposits continues, the from 504 metres: 7.75 metres at 4.34g t including 2.2 metres prospectivity of the greater permit area is also being evaluated, at 13.25g t from 529 metres and 3.8 metres at 1.16g t from thus providing the opportunity for the discovery of further world- 549.7 metres: DDD457 - 4 metres at 4.75g t from 450 metres class gold deposits in the region.
