2.4 | Agricultural products we fully expect 2012 results to recover, with a return Adjusted EBIT to profitability in cotton, coupled with continued strong 800 performance in grains, oilseeds and sugar.
Investments in 600 oil seed crushing capacity and the expansion of our stor- 400 age and handling infrastructure has laid a foundation for growth.
The recently announced acquisition of Viterras tier 200 one grain storage, handling and port assets, subject to share- 0 holder and regulatory approval, is complementary from a 200 2009 2010 2011 product and geographic perspective and will transform our 2009 2010 2011 business.
Marketing activities 304 659 8 Industrial activities 41 58 39 Chris Mahoney Marketing activities Highlights Grain and oilseeds marketing reported solid results for 2011.
Overall agricultural prod- 40000 ucts marketing results were significantly impacted by the unprecedented cotton mar- 35000 ket environment.
The extreme volatility produced an outcome of ineffective hedging 30000 and high levels of physical contractual non-performance by suppliers and customers.
25000 Events in the cotton market accounted for the majority of the year-on-year reduction 20000 in agricultural products marketing Adjusted EBIT.
15000 Our asset portfolio is currently in a phase of substantial targeted expansion and fide- 10000 velopment, which is expected to translate into enhanced scale and profitability going 0 forward.
The 2011 performance, in large part, reflects the current negative biodiesel 2009 2010 2011 production margin environment in Europe.

The proposed acquisition of Viterra, subject to various approvals, Industrial activities represents a tremendous opportunity to secure significant grain handling, storage and port infrastructure at origin.
Viterra is, geographically highly complementary, broaden- 7000 ing our reach into North America, providing the opportunity to leverage Glencores existing and extensive global network.
The acquisition is consistent with Glencores 6000 stated strategy of strengthening its position as one of the global leaders in the grain 5000 and oil seed markets.

The GSCI Agriculture Index was on average 35% higher in 2011 compared to 2010.
A substantial Russian wheat production recovery, a record Australian wheat crop and reduced US feed demand due to high prices provided some relief to the tight supply demand situation.
South American production was however impacted by drought and global supplies are still not burdensome.
With demand underpinned by growth in Asia, good crops will be required in 2012 to match expected demand.
Russian and Ukrainian export restrictions were lifted mid-2011, in response to good crops in both countries, but following near record exports from Russia, domestic prices again strengthened in late 2011.
The cotton market began to normalise by late 2011 after a period of unprecedented volatility.
In H22011 prices ranged between US90 and US110 per pound, having been as high as US 214 per pound early in the year.
As noted earlier, contract performance issues and the disconnect between futures prices and physical markets at various times during the year, created a very challenging environment.
MARKETINg Highlights Grain, oil seed, sugar and freight volumes all trended higher in 2011, which is a positive development in an otherwise difficult year.
Marketing Adjusted EBIT EBITDA in 2011 was $8million compared to 2010s record $659million.
A number of factors, as described below, had an impact on the results, however cotton was far and away, the key negative.
Grain and oil seeds performed reasonably well but not on a par with 2010, which was a particularly strong year.
Export restrictions in H12011 proved challenging, as did the European debt crisis induced volatility and uncertainty.
When restrictions in Russia and the Ukraine were lifted, our up country infrastructure, elevator network and port ownership proved valuable in enabling the swift export of goods.
| Annual Report 2011 | 65 As noted before, in the cotton business, non and or delayed contract performance by suppliers in a rising market, non-performance of customer contracts in the subsequent declining market and, by historical standards, the unprecedented disconnect imperfect correlation between the futures market and the physical markets, created enormous challenges.
These factors caused significant loss opportunity cost to numerous market participants and the industry, in general, is now undergoing a review in respect of pricing and performance enhancing mechanisms, length of contacts etc.

The significant increase in wheat milling production was due to an acquisition.
The asset portfolio is in a phase of targeted expansion with a focus on storage, handling and oilseed processing facilities.
Two new oilseed processing plants were acquired in 2011 and our new build projects remain on budget and time schedule.

Production was however below expectations, due to severe frosts which affected the region in June and August, and consequently lowered agricultural yields.
Rio Vermelho farmed 68% of its sugarcane feedstock in 2011, the balance of which was supplied by independent farmers.
The share of own-farmed sugarcane is expected to increase over subsequent crop cycles as Rio Vermelho expands its own plantations.
A five year expansion plan is underway to increase crushing capacity from 1.0million tonnes to 2.6million tonnes, construct a Very High Pol VHP sugar plant with a capacity of 260,000tonnes and an anhydrous ethanol production capability of up to 80,000 cubic metres as well as the construction of a cogeneration plant capable of supplying 200,000 megawatt hours of surplus electricity to the grid.
The first phase of the project, namely the construction of the VHP sugar plant, is expected to be completed by mid-2012.
The total estimated project cost is $322million.
Other Agricultural Products Oilseed crushing Processed volumes increased in 2011 versus 2010, however soybean crush margins, particularly in South American in H22011, were subdued.
In December2011, we acquired two soft seed processing facilities at st in the Czech Republic and at Bodaczw in Poland, production of which will only be realised in 2012.
Our Hungarian plant construction completed and commenced commissioning in December.
The Timbues soya bean facility in Argentina is scheduled for completion by the end of H12012.
These four facilities will add 3.6milliontonnes of processing capacity to our portfolio, including Glencores share of Timbues of 2.0milliontonnes.
Biodiesel Poor biodiesel esterification margins negatively impacted the 2011 results.
Overcapacity in the EU and legislative changes that effectively diminished biodiesel demand were the main underlying causes.
In response, we reduced our production volume by 32% compared to 2010 and took the unfortunate, but necessary measure of mothballing the Schwarzheide plant.
The outlook in Europe remains challenging.
In Argentina, our Renova joint venture performed well and the outlook is more positive, supported by the governments efforts to boost local biodiesel consumption.
Rice and wheat milling Rice milled volumes rose by 43% in 2011, with better Argentine and Uruguayan rice crops.
Wheat milling volume rose substantially due to our late 2010 acquisition of 50% of the Brazilian milling company Predilito.
Both rice and wheat milling performed satisfactorily.
In Brazil, the business is supported by strong brand recognition.
Farming Overall farm production rose 41% and the business performed reasonably well due to favourable weather conditions and large crops.
