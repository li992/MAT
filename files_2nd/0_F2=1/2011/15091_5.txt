06 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 4 Chief Executive Officers Review I am pleased to say that we have had a successful year, delivering strong financial results in a challenging retail environment and have made significant progress across a number of key areas.
Our international franchise operation goes from strength to strength, and following our acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA in February we are accelerating our European roll-out.
Our UK store roll-out is firmly on track with the addition of a number of prime locations, including one of Londons most iconic and prestigious stores in Regent Street.
We remain confident in our strategy and I am excited about the ongoing potential for the Superdry brand, at home, internationally and on-line.
