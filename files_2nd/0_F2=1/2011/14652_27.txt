overview business review governance financial statements Systems-Aerial work platform Our Access system controls the entire functionality of aerial work platforms, including traction speed and direction and lift lower speeds.
Description of our business Systems comprises PG Drives Technology, a leading supplier of sophisticated electronic control systems for electrically powered vehicles in the medical mobility and industrial markets.
These include vehicles such as powered wheelchairs and mobility scooters as well as industrial vehicles such as floor cleaning vehicles, fork-lift trucks, aerial access platforms and golf carts.
Market conditions Sales of high volume commercial wheelchair control systems were severely impacted by the introduction of new US Medicare reimbursement rules in January 2011.
Although there was significant growth in premium rehabilitation wheelchair and industrial systems during the year, this was still not enough to fully offset the decline in consumer wheelchair systems.
The cost structure of the business was improved during the year through design improvements, supply chain management and moving more production offshore.
Revenue and profitability Revenue declined 3 per cent from $59.4 million to $57.7 million.
This fall was due to a change in US Medicare reimbursement rules that reduced volumes of consumer wheelchair controllers.
Operating profit improved by 2 per cent compared to 2010 despite the lower volumes due to a reduction in costs.
Product development During the year we launched an enhanced version of our C3 AC pallet truck controller to address stacker vehicles.
This addresses a new market area for us and provides an opportunity for future growth.
A totally new design of the S-Drive scooter controller was also launched, an innovative, low cost controller designed to replace one of the older product lines.
