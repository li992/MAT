Exploration review continued WEST AFRICAN LOCALITY While this work continues, the exploration team has not neglected Mali the base of the resource triangle and generative work to the north LOULO of Gara and south of Yalea has defined targets for follow-up work.
Work at loulo continues to define satellite ounces in proximity to the plant.
Modelling of the main mineralised structures has Loulo 3 been completed following extensive drill programmes executed the most significant satellite deposit on the permit is loulo 3. in 2011 which totalled 68 diamond drill holes for 15 182 metres During 2011, the deeper potential of the deposit was targeted and 236 Reverse Circulation RC holes for 19 099 metres.
this by 10 diamond drillholes probing the deposit at both 180 and work resulted in the remaining in pit indicated resource Us$1 500 300 vertical metres below the surface over a strike length of at loulo 3 being estimated at 184 000 ounces at 3.45g t. An 1.9 kilometres.
All drillholes confirmed the geological model and additional potential underground inventory of 1 million ounces at intersected the mineralised structure.
Gold assay results returned very encouraging intersections from At Baboto, a geological estimate of all three zones of mineralisation the 180 vertical metre level: l3DH32 - 7.10 metres at 9.89g t from north, Centre and south returned a global resource potential of 270.4 metres: l3DH34 - 2.00 metres at 10.17g t from 244 metres 350 000 ounces at 2g t. in the southern Zone there is a higher and 3 metres at 13.16g t from 252 metres, l3DH37 - 12 metres grade zone, down to 50 metres vertical depth which returns at 4.63g t from 185 metres: l3DH40 - 4 metres at 5.53g t from 154 000 ounces at 3.41g t. the combined geological open pit 300 metres: and l3DH43 - 12.65 metres at 4.34g t. potential from all satellite deposits has been calculated at 2 million ounces at 3g t. Very encouraging results were also returned from the 300 vertical metre level: l3DH42 - 6.9 metres at 4.65g t from 339 metres: Randgold completed a preliminary analysis of the resource l3DH43 - 11.6 metres at 4.34g t from 403 metres: and l3DH47 - inventory outside of the current life of Mine loM budget.

Randgold has since concentrated on conventional Carbon in leach Cil which has returned positive results with recoveries of Loulo underground approximately 90%.
