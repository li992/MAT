Board evaluation Composition and independence As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors has nine members comprising the Non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, three other Executive Directors and four Non-executive Directors.
The names of the Directors together with their biographical details are set out on page 32.
The size of the Board allows individuals to communicate openly and to make a personal contribution through the exercise of their individual skills and experience.
The Non-executive Directors have been appointed for their specific experience and expertise and are all considered to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Mr Harvey is a non-executive director of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Plc, which acts as insurance broker to the Company.
Mr Lewis is a former partner of Addleshaw Goddard LLP, which acts as legal adviser to the Company.
Mr Heale is a non-executive director of Panmure Gordon & Co, which acts as joint broker to the Company.
None of them participated in any way in the provision of services by the relevant supplier to the Company.
In addition, in order that his independence is not compromised, if at any time the Board or a Committee of the Board is considering any matter concerning one of the suppliers, it has been agreed that the relevant individual will withdraw from that meeting until such matters have been dealt with.
Mr Lewis is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and in this capacity he is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Non-executive Directors may serve on the boards of other companies provided that this does not involve a conflict of interest and that the appointment does not restrict their ability to discharge their duties to the Company in any way.
As set out in the Report of the Directors, the Board has resolved to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and, with effect from the 2011 Annual General Meeting, each Director will retire and seek re-election annually.
The Executive Directors service contracts and the letters setting out the terms of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting.
Gender diversity The Board is cognisant of the recommendations arising out of Lord Davies February 2011 Review into Women on Boards and is committed to ensuring gender diversity at Board level and also across the Companys senior management team, not least because it believes that business benefits from the widest range of perspectives and backgrounds.
The Board and the Nomination Committee will take into account Lord Davies recommendations when reviewing the composition of the Board and identifying and recommending appropriate candidates for membership of the Board.
Performance evaluation Effectiveness reviews of the Board and its committees are carried out annually.
The results are reviewed by the Chairman of the Board or Board committee, discussed in a formal meeting and any appropriate recommendations are recorded and acted upon.
Taking into account the introduction of the June 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code and the code provision that Board evaluation for FSTE 350 companies should be externally facilitated at least every three years, during the year the Board engaged Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review to undertake an independent external Board effectiveness review.
The review was designed to be forward looking, assessing the quality of the Boards decision-making and debate, its overall contribution to and impact upon the long-term health and success of the Company and its preparedness for future challenges.
The review which was conducted between October 2010 and January 2011 covered a variety of aspects associated with Board effectiveness through the use of: confidential interviews with each of the Directors and the Company Secretary: attendance and observation at a Board meeting: and a review of selected papers including Board and Committee meeting papers, minutes and corporate governance documentation including the Companys Corporate Governance Compliance Statement.
43 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Report on corporate governance continued The review recommended a number of actions to further enhance the effectiveness of the Board and its members and the Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary, has taken responsibility for implementing these, in which respect he reports to the Board on an ongoing basis.
Neither Dr Long nor Boardroom Review has any other connection with the Company or any member of the Board.
The review process which was undertaken during the year concluded that all Directors continue to contribute effectively and with proper commitment, devoting adequate time to carry out their duties.
