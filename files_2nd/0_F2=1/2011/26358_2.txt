355 Key highlights continued Resilient underlying trading performance in 2011, in line with expectations Growth initiatives, cost and impairment reductions, and funding mix improvements mitigated the effects of a subdued UK economy, risk and asset reductions, and higher wholesale funding costs Combined businesses profit before tax increased 21 per cent to 2,685 million in 2011 Core combined businesses profit before tax increased 3 per cent to 6,349 million Statutory loss before tax was 3,542 million 2010: profit of 281 million, and includes a 3.2 billion non-recurring provision for Payment Protection Insurance PPI contact and redress costs Income decreased 10 per cent to 21,123 million, reflecting subdued lending demand and continued customer deleveraging in the core, a smaller non-core portfolio, and a lower margin Banking net interest margin reduced by 14 basis points to 2.07 per cent, in line with expectations, with increased funding costs partially offset by the benefits of asset repricing and funding mix: core net interest margin declined only 6 basis points to 2.42 per cent given the better funding mix in the core business Total costs fell 4 per cent, primarily driven by Integration and Simplification related savings and lower bonus accruals, partially offset by inflationary pressures and UK bank levy and FSCS costs The impairment charge reduced significantly, by 26 per cent to 9,787 million, with improvements seen across all divisions, reflecting improving portfolio credit quality Outlook and financial guidance Expect the external environment to remain challenging in 2012 Remain confident that our medium-term financial targets, as set out in our June 2011 Strategic Review are achievable over time As anticipated in our Q3 2011 Interim Management Statement, now expect the attainment of income related targets, including for other operating income, to be delayed beyond 2014 as a result of the weaker than expected economic outlook As a consequence, also expect the attainment of our return on equity target to be delayed beyond 2014 Continue to expect to deliver our balance sheet, cost and impairment targets in 2014, and in some cases sooner In-year cost savings target for 2014 increased by 200 million to 1.7 billion: end 2014 run-rate target increased to 1.9 billion Given expectation of further deposit growth, expect to reach medium-term Group loan-to-deposit ratio target of 130 per cent or below by the end of 2012, two years ahead of plan In 2012, on a combined businesses basis, we expect: Income to be lower than in 2011 given the economic outlook, further non-core asset reductions, subdued demand in the core loan book, higher wholesale funding costs, and interest rates likely to remain at low levels for longer Full year banking net interest margin to be below 2 per cent in 2012, falling year-on-year by approximately the same amount in 2012 as in 2011, primarily driven by continuing high wholesale funding costs A further reduction in costs, and a similar percentage reduction in Group impairment as seen in 2011, with the largest improvement coming from International The benefit from fair value unwind to reduce to approximately 0.5 billion To continue to strengthen our balance sheet through: non-core asset reduction of approximately 25 billion, further deposit growth, at least in line with the market, and strengthening our funding position and our core tier 1 ratio Overview Business review r Governance r Financial statements r Other information r Lloyds Banking Group 4 Annual Report and

The key principles adopted in the preparation of the combined businesses basis of reporting are described below.
In order to reflect the impact of the acquisition of HBOS, the amortisation of purchased intangible assets has been excluded: and the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments is shown as one line in the combined businesses income statement.
In order to better present business performance the effects of liability management, volatile items and asset sales are shown on a separate line in the combined businesses income statement and the following items, not related to acquisition accounting, have also been excluded: integration, simplification and EC mandated retail business disposal costs: volatility arising in insurance businesses: insurance gross up: provision in relation to German insurance business litigation: payment protection insurance provision: customer goodwill payments provision: curtailment gains and losses in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes: and loss on disposal of businesses.
To enable a better understanding of the Groups core business trends and outlook, certain income statement, balance sheet and regulatory capital information is analysed between core and non-core portfolios.
The non-core portfolios consist of businesses which deliver below-hurdle returns, which are outside the Groups risk appetite or may be distressed, are subscale or have an unclear value proposition, or have a poor fit with the Groups customer strategy.
The EC mandated retail business disposal Project Verde is included in core portfolios.
A full reconciliation of the combined businesses basis to the statutory basis is given in note 4 on pages 231 to 236.
Unless otherwise stated, the commentaries on pages 21 to 97 are on a combined businesses basis.
