Excluding the impacts of asset sales and derivative valuation adjustments, profit before tax reduced 649 million or 30 per cent, in the context of a challenging economic and market environment.
Total income decreased 38 per cent 20 per cent excluding losses on asset sales and derivative valuation adjustments Net interest income decreased by 25 per cent, principally reflecting the substantial reductions in non-core assets, which fell 34 per cent.
Net interest margin fell by three basis points, with the impact of higher funding costs almost fully offset by re-pricing activity and increased deposit margins and volumes.
Other income decreased by 16 per cent principally reflecting reduced trading income and a lower level of operating lease asset income in Asset Finance.
Operating expenses decreased by 9 per cent, with further integration cost savings, reduced operating lease depreciation and lower bonus accruals, partially offset by continued investment in core customer facing resource and systems, in line with the priorities set out in June in the Groups Strategic review.
The impairment charge decreased by 29 per cent, reflecting continued strong risk management and the low interest rate environment.
Fair value unwind decreased by 29 per cent, mainly driven by decreased impairments in the loan book, lower release from the reduced treasury asset portfolio and reduced general release given a more cautious outlook for the value of certain assets, partially offset by favourable exchange rate movements.
Assets decreased by 18 per cent, 25 per cent excluding reverse repos, reflecting the targeted reduction in the non-core balance sheet by 35 billion.
Although net lending to core customers excluding reverse repos reduced by 9 billion as a result of weak demand and continued customer deleveraging as credit facilities matured and were not renewed by customers, gross new committed lending to customers continues to meet our lending commitments.
Risk-weighted assets reduced by 16 per cent, in line with the reduction in the balance sheet.
Customer deposits excluding repos were 2 per cent higher, in line with the Group Strategy to increase customer deposits.
Against its strategic objectives, Wholesale continued to deepen its customer relationships through a measured build out of products and capabilities in support of the needs of the existing customer base.
With the majority of integration now completed, a new, simpler organisational structure was implemented.
Alongside enhanced product capabilities in areas including debt capital markets, money markets, interest rate management and foreign exchange, a transaction banking transformation programme was initiated in the year, to build an enhanced cash management, payments and trade customer offering.
Strategic focus Wholesales strategic goal is to be recognised as the UKs leading, through-the-cycle, partner to UK companies and institutions, with the clear objective of supporting our customers success.
We will strengthen the franchise by retaining and deepening our recurring, multi-product customer relationships, building on deep insight into our customers needs and by offering a broad range of lending, deposit, risk management, debt capital market and transaction banking products.
This strategy will enable us to grow our capital light revenues and continue to be a significant provider of financial support to the UK economy.
Progress against strategic initiatives Reshaping the business Against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment, in 2011 Wholesale made significant progress in serving more fully the wider needs of the core customer franchise in a capital and funding efficient way.
Whilst maintaining the through-the-cycle commitment to making lending available, Wholesale is rebalancing the business towards customers known fee based banking and financing needs.
This growth path for the core business is complemented by a clear mandate to limit or reduce the consumption of capital and funding in non-core areas.
In 2011 Wholesale reduced non-core assets by 35 billion significantly contributing towards the reduction of the Groups wholesale funding requirement.
Whilst this has meant the loss of associated income, it has resulted in a material improvement in the profile of the Groups balance sheet, both in terms of risk and absolute size.
Further, in total, these asset sales were in line with the net book value.
In 2012, the focus will be on strengthening the franchise in those businesses that generate sustainable, predictable returns on equity at the level targeted by the Group Strategic Review while continuing to reduce non core assets in a capital efficient way.
Simplifying the Bank To deliver the strategy, a new, simplified, business model has been implemented to ensure more effective co-ordination of Coverage, Product and Support.
Coverage and Product are now more closely integrated to create a single team offering to allow seamless access to the banking and financial markets expertise our customers demand.
The Support functions have been reconfigured and delayered to provide centralised, efficient and client focused processes and activities to inform and drive better business decisions and performance.
This simpler approach will enable easier co-ordination of multi-product solutions on behalf of Wholesales customers and improve the way we meet their on-going needs.
Overview r Business review Governance r Financial statements r Other information r Lloyds Banking Group 62 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 DIVISIONAL RESULTS WHOLESALE Investing in customer franchise The Strategic Review in June confirmed Wholesales commitment to meet more fully the range of needs of Wholesales customer base.
In 2011, product capability has been enhanced through the further development of our debt capital markets business and the implementation of Bloomberg e-trading to support trading of bonds and gilts with financial institution clients.
In addition Arena, a scalable online portal for foreign exchange, interest rate management and money market deposits, is now fully operational, and providing efficient, cost effective, market access for customers.
Lloyds TSB also achieved Gilt-Edged Market Maker status, becoming a primary dealer in UK government bonds, creating opportunities to further service a wider group of Financial Institutions.
In 2011, Wholesale initiated a Transaction Banking Transformation Programme, to build an improved, cash management, payments and trade customer offering.
This programme will deliver improved customer services in stages, with the banks Faster Payments scheme already successfully extended and a service allowing customers to obtain more easily settlement from their European customers introduced.
Lloyds Banking Group partnership with London 2012 saw the successful processing of card settlements for Olympic and Paralympic Games ticketing and Transaction Banking also launched the UKs first contactless prepaid cards for corporate use, with a special range of Visa London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games themed Cards.
Awards In 2011, Wholesales focus on deepening customer relationships and continued commitment to core businesses was once again recognised by Finance Directors of commercial and corporate companies who voted Lloyds TSB as Bank of the Year in the CBI Real FD awards for the seventh year running.
Wholesale also achieved double success at Euroweeks Syndicated Loan and Leveraged Finance Awards 2011 winning the Best Arranger of UK Loans and Best Arranger of Mid-Cap Loans awards.
This was the second consecutive year that the Group has won these awards, reinforcing the markets recognition of Wholesales expertise in arranging these transactions, as well as the ongoing commitment that the Group have made to our customers.
Further notable successes include the Leveraged Finance House of the Year in the Private Equity News Awards for Excellence in Private Equity, three awards at the Project Finance International Awards 2011 and in debt capital markets where the bank ranked first in 2011 for sterling corporate UK parent bond issuance Dealogic.
Financial performance Profit before tax was 828 million compared to a profit before tax of 2,514 million in 2010.
Income reduced by 2,467 million and fair value unwind fell, partially offset by lower costs and a significant decrease in the impairment charge, and the elimination of losses in joint venture businesses.
The profit performance was significantly impacted by the impact of net derivative valuation adjustments and asset disposals net of associated fair value.
Excluding these effects profit before tax was 1,506 million.
Core profit before tax decreased to 682 million compared to profit before tax of 2,052 million in 2010, largely due to reduced income from a reduced balance sheet as customers deleverage, a challenging trading environment and as a result of net derivative valuation adjustments.
Impairments increased due to certain specific large cases.
Excluding net derivative valuation adjustments core profit before tax was 1,400 million, down 33 per cent on 2010.
Non-core profit before tax was 146 million compared to a profit of 462 million in 2010, reflecting the effect of lower income from the continued downward management of the balance sheet, partially offset by lower costs, a continued significant decrease in impairments net of fair value unwind and elimination of losses in the joint venture businesses.
Income Wholesales income performance was significantly impacted by lower asset balances, losses on asset disposals in the year to strengthen the balance sheet and net derivative valuation adjustments.
Net derivative valuation adjustments of 718 million were driven primarily by a large fall in long term sterling interest rates and significantly higher market credit spreads.
Losses on disposal of 697 million were realised from the disposal of assets and were offset by a related fair value unwind.
Net of these effects, income reduced by 1,347 million or 20 per cent, primarily as a consequence of economic and market conditions, which resulted in customer deleveraging, higher funding costs, and lower trading revenues.
2011 2010 Change m m % Total income 4,059 6,526 38 Adjustments to exclude: Net derivative valuation adjustments 718 42 Gains and losses on asset sales 697 253 Total income net of volatile items and asset sales 5,474 6,821 20 Net interest income decreased by 708 million, or 25 per cent, to 2,139 million.
The decrease reflects lower interest-earning asset balances in line with the Groups targeted balance sheet reduction of loans and advances to customers and banks, debt securities and available-for-sale positions.
Net interest income was also adversely affected by higher funding costs.
This was partially offset by an increase in the liability margin resulting from the increased market value of deposits.
The net banking margin decreased by three basis points to 1.56 per cent.
This principally reflects increased wholesale funding costs, partly offset by customer re-pricing and increased deposit margins and volumes.
Asset margins decreased as the benefit of higher customer rates was more than offset by funding costs, whilst liability margins improved.

The effect of losses on asset disposals from the continued focus on balance sheet reductions and net derivative valuations adjustments due to the increased market implied credit risk associated with customer derivative balances resulted in losses of 1,415 million, compared to 295 million in 2010.
Core income was 3,559 million compared to 4,793 million in 2010, reflecting the effects of net derivative valuation adjustments and as a consequence of difficult market and economic conditions, reduced lending balances to corporate customers, and higher wholesale funding costs.
Excluding derivative valuation adjustments income decreased 12 per cent showing resilience in the challenging environment.
Non-core income decreased to 500 million compared to 1,733 million in 2010, due to losses on asset disposals offset by a related fair value unwind included elsewhere in the income statement, a significantly lower balance sheet from the continuing successful asset reduction programme, lower margin due to higher wholesale funding costs and reduced income as the non-core Asset Finance businesses were run down or sold.
The core banking net interest margin saw a significant increase of 21 basis points to 1.80 per cent, driven primarily by a lower reliance on wholesale funding as asset balances reduced and deposit balances increased.
The non-core banking margin, which is predominantly asset based, decreased by 32 basis points to 1.28 per cent, largely from increased wholesale funding costs.
Costs Operating expenses decreased by 234 million, or 9 per cent, to 2,518 million from further savings from the Integration programme, lower operating lease depreciation, lower bonus accruals and other ongoing cost management actions to mitigate the impact of inflationary increases.
This was partially offset by continued investment in customer facing resources and systems.
Impairment and fair value unwind The impairment charge decreased by 1,163 million, or 29 per cent, to 2,901 million reflecting a sustained decrease since the peak in 2009.
As a percentage of average loans and advances to customers, the impairment charge improved to 1.95 per cent from 2.23 per cent in 2010.
This reflected robust and proactive risk management and lower defaults from continued low interest rates despite a subdued economic environment.
The core impairment charge was 741 million, compared to 576 million in 2010.
The increase is attributable to a few specific large cases reflecting the nature of impairments in a Wholesale portfolio.
The non-core impairment charge decreased by 1,328 million, or 38 per cent, to 2,160 million in 2011.
This was primarily due to lower impairment from non-core corporate real estate and real estate related asset portfolios, reflecting a stabilisation of commercial property prices in 2011.
Non-core impairments in 2010 were significant as a result of the scale and pace of deterioration in the property sector and poorer quality heritage HBOS lending.
The share of results from joint ventures and associates, which are all non-core, comprised a small profit of 14 million, an improvement of 109 million, due to the non-recurrence of losses and impairments taken in 2010.
Fair value unwind decreased 875 million to 2,174 million, reflecting the lower impairments in the loan book, reduced release on the smaller non-core treasury asset book and a risk based approach to release on certain treasury assets given market conditions, partially offset by favourable exchange rate movements.
The fair value unwind predominantly relates to non-core portfolios.
Balance sheet progress In 2011 Wholesale continued to focus on strengthening the balance sheet by reducing non-core assets.
Assets comprising loans and advances to customers and banks, debt securities and available-for-sale financial assets reduced by 38.7 billion, or 18 per cent, to 173.6 billion, primarily reflecting deleveraging by customers and continued active fide-risking of the non-core balance sheet by either selling down or reducing holdings in debt securities and available-for-sale assets, as well as disposal of 4.8 billion of non-core commercial real estate customer balances.
The non-core reduction was 35.2 billion, primarily driven by a reduction in treasury assets of 26 billion.
This overall balance sheet reduction was net of an increase in reverse repo balances as liquidity was invested in high quality primary liquid assets on a secured basis.
Loans and advances to customers excluding reverse repos reduced by 18.2 billion, or 13 per cent, to 123.3 billion as demand for new corporate lending and refinancing of existing facilities was more than offset by maturities, reflecting a continued trend of subdued corporate demand for lending, customer deleveraging and asset sales in non-core sectors.
Non-core lending accounted for 51 per cent, of this reduction.
Available-for-sale financial assets balances reduced by 16.9 billion, or 57 per cent, to 12.6 billion and debt securities by 13.3 billion, or 52 per cent, to 12.5 billion.
This was driven by the reduction in the non-core balance sheet through treasury and other asset sales or not replenishing holdings after amortisations and maturities.
The non-core proportion of these reductions was 12.7 billion, or 75 per cent, in the case of available-for-sale assets, and 13.1 billion, or 98 per cent, in the case of debt securities.
Loans and advances to banks reduced by 4.0 billion, or 32 per cent, to 8.4 billion.
Customer deposits excluding repos increased by 2 per cent to 84.3 billion, due to an increase in deposits in line with the Groups funding strategy.
Customer deposits on the core book increased by 3 per cent to 81.5 billion.
Risk-weighted assets decreased by 32.3 billion, or 16 per cent, to 163.8 billion, primarily reflecting balance sheet reductions and run down in other non-core asset portfolios, as well as the impact of changes in the risk profile, partially offset by Basel regulatory changes to market risk.
Non-core risk-weighted assets represent 24.7 billion, or 76 per cent, of this reduction.

2 Of which repos represent 7.1 billion 31 December 2010: 10.2 billion.
Total income decreased by 2,165 million to 2,601 million, mainly driven by a decrease in other operating income.
This principally reflects losses of 676 million on the disposal of assets in 2011, offset by a related fair value unwind of 737 million, reflected elsewhere in the income statement, net derivative valuation adjustments of 718 million and the effect of a reduced balance sheet.
Excluding asset sales and temporary volatility, income decreased by 1,066 million or 21 per cent, broadly in line with the balance sheet movement.
Net interest income decreased by 647 million, or 27 per cent, to 1,783 million.
The decrease reflects lower interest-earning asset balances in line with the continued focus on balance sheet reduction and strengthening, mainly in loans and advances to customers, debt securities and available-for-sale positions.
Net interest income was also adversely affected by higher wholesale funding costs, which was partially offset by an increase in the liability margin resulting from the increased market value of deposits.
Other income decreased by 419 million, or 16 per cent, to 2,212 million, primarily reflecting the lower trading revenue and reduced fees and commissions.
Operating expenses decreased by 102 million, or 6 per cent, to 1,534 million.
The reduction in operating expenses from integration savings, lower bonus accruals and the continued focus on cost management have been offset by reinvestment into customer facing resources and systems The impairment charge decreased by 1,099 million to 2,701 million in 2011, reflecting a sustained decrease since the peak in 2009.
As a percentage of average loans and advances to customers, the impairment charge improved to 1.93 per cent in 2011 compared to 2.22 per cent in 2010.
This reflected robust and proactive risk management and lower defaults from continued low interest rates despite a subdued economic environment The share of results from joint ventures and associates comprised a small profit of 13 million, an improvement of 108 million, due to the non-recurrence of losses and impairments taken in 2010.

The 105 million reduction was largely due to a decrease in income.
Total income decreased by 302 million, or 17 per cent, to 1,458 million as a result of lower business volumes, including assets held under operating leases, the non-recurrence of VAT claims settled in the prior year and a 21 million loss on disposal of Hill Hire plc.
The lower business volumes are in-line with the targeted reduction in this asset class and were partly offset by improved margins.
Operating expenses decreased by 132 million, or 12 per cent, to 984 million.
This reflected an 88 million, or 11 per cent, decrease in depreciation charges on assets held under operating leases largely from a lower fleet size.
Other costs decreased by 44 million, or 13 per cent, reflecting strong cost management and savings achieved from integration.
The impairment charge decreased by 64 million to 200 million, reflecting an improvement in market conditions for both the retail and non-retail consumer finance businesses.
The lower impairment charge has been driven by a reduction in new cases entering arrears, the reduced book size and the improved credit quality of new business.
