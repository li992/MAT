Performance Key market drivers As previously reported, we completed our exit from our Gibraltar &RQWLQXLQJ RYHUVXSSO RI SURSHUWLHV RQ business in 2010, with no home completions from this market in 2011.
PDLQODQG 6SDLQ Market conditions remained tough throughout 2011, with mortgage 2QJRLQJ UHVWULFWLRQV RQ PRUWJDJH DYDLODELOLW availability remaining restricted.
This was of greater signicance for local FRQRPLF XQFHUWDLQW UHVXOWLQJ LQ UHGXFHG purchasers, as overseas purchasers looking to buy a second home FRQVXPHU FRQGHQFH typically require lower levels of mortgage finance.
QFUHDVHG QXPEHU RI WRXULVWV YLVLWLQJ 6SDLQ LQ We completed 109 homes in Spain in 2011 2010: 136 at an average selling price of 238k 2010: 214k.
The increase in our average selling price reects the exit from the Gibraltar market, where our final completions had been lower priced apartments.
Revenue in 2011 was 28.6 million 2010: 31.1 million, primarily driven by the reduced number of completions.
However, despite the tough market conditions, we delivered an operating profit of 0.2 million, in comparison to an operating loss of 3.6 million in 2010.
We remain very cautious in our approach to new land purchases and have reduced the number of plots in our land portfolio further in 2011 to 1,668 2010: 1,783.
The Spanish business made a positive contribution to the cash ows of the Group in 2011.
Our year end order book was 10.4 million 2010: 10.8 million.
In addition to the improved financial performance during the year, we delivered improvements in both customer satisfaction and our health Los Altos del Golf, Camp fide Mar, Mallorca and safety performance.
Current trading Given the ongoing economic uncertainty in Spain and the wider Euro zone, we expect 2012 to be another year of challenging market conditions.
However, 2011 saw an increase in the number of tourists visiting Spain and this has the potential to benefit second home sales.
