ALLIED GOLD MINING PLC exploration The focus of drilling activity for 2011 was in-pit grade control and resource extension.
Core drilling was conducted along the strike extensions of the Namachamata and Valehaichichi deposits.
With Gold Ridge now operating, greater access is possible in and around the existing pits to explore for extensions on the pit margin, and along strike and at depth.
Allied Gold is also looking to the longer term with a regional program.
In late 2011 preliminary discussions were held with landowner groups in the 122 sq.
km Avu Avu Prospecting Licence area on the central southern coast of Guadalcanal.
This is an initial step towards negotiating a Surface Access Agreement with local landowners, a prerequisite to the granting of full exploration rights.
A review of historical records highlights Avu Avu as having anomalous copper.
Once access is granted, Allied will develop a grass roots surface exploration campaign.
