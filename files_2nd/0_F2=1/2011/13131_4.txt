Redrow plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review 4 Our markets a year in review Overview Mortgage availability The availability of mortgage finance is arguably the single most important demand side factor influencing the fortunes of the UK housing market.
During the last twelve months, the average seasonally adjusted number of monthly mortgage approvals has been c. 47,000.
This is significantly lower than the c. 89,000 per month 10 year average.
Approvals have been relatively stable around 45,000 to 47,000 per month this calendar year to date.
Redrow is proactively engaged, both directly and via the Home Builders Federation, with Government, lenders and insurers to encourage a return to normal market conditions, particularly for first time buyers.
Planning environment The significant planning changes announced by the Coalition Government in the past 12 months have had a negative impact on land supply.
The initial hiatus created by the abolition of RSS Regional Spacial Strategy has reduced the delivery of planning consents and this together with the arrival of the localism agenda has slowed the delivery of outlets across the market.
More recently the progress of the Localism Bill and the publication in July 2011 of the consultation draft of the National Planning Policy Framework have brought some clarity and these together with other planning policy announcements, are intended to speed up the planning process and therefore the supply of land for development, an objective we welcome.
