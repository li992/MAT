BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER OF ALLBLUE LIMITED continued For the calendar year 2011, the strategy contributions and detail are as follows: BlueCrest Capital International Global Macro BlueCrest Capital International contributed 1.77% to AllBlue Limited during 2011, with the fund returning 5.89% Class F, USD for the calendar year.
The Rates and Relative Value teams were the largest drivers of return, as they benefited from the continued uncertainty and volatility caused by the European sovereign debt concerns.
The teams gains came from several strategies including: long-biased volatility strategies which gained from both an appreciation in implied volatility and from gamma trading, curve trading driven by both macro views and identification of mis-pricings between different currencies and across different maturities, and finally increased concerns on European bank funding were captured through basis trading strategies.
The other trading desks within the fund all provided smaller contributions to the funds returns, with the sole detractor being the Equity Derivatives desk, which provided a -0.04% contribution to the fund, as profits from volatility trading were offset by losses from dividend trading.
BlueCrest has continued to strengthen the teams supporting this fund with a number of new additions through the year, including expansion of the Rates teams presence in the US.
BlueTrend Systematic Trend Following BlueTrend contributed 0.01% to AllBlue Limited during 2011, with the fund returning 0.12% Class B, USD for the calendar year.
The performance in the first half of the year was driven by the returns from BlueTrends fixed income and energy trading: the bond and short term interest rate sectors benefitted as investors sought safe-haven assets whilst the energy sector saw profits as prices rose on the back of civil unrest in the Middle East.
The equity and metal sectors were the main detractors during the first half of the year.
This underperformance from the equity sector continued and increased over the second half of the year, during which time the energy sector also provided a negative contribution.
As with the first half of the year the fixed income markets remained the strongest contributors over the remainder of the year.
Looking over the full calendar year the most influential sectors were fixed income gaining approximately 18% gross and equity losing approximately 11% gross.
Metals delivered a modest positive gain and FX, energies and crops incurred modest losses.
