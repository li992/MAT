Risks and uncertainties As described on page 15, the board, Chief Executive and his leadership team regularly review the above principal risks and the specific actions and activities that the group has taken to mitigate the risks.
In order to ensure that actions are taken at the most appropriate level, these risks have been further disaggregated and mapped against the groups five strategic thrusts.
This analysis is shown on pages 16 and 17.
A schedule of assurance risks, which relate to activities that the group must undertake in order to meet legal, fiscal and governance obligations, is also shown.
Note that it must be recognised that although the risks and activities are regularly reviewed, the activities identified to manage and or reduce the risks identified may not be sufficient by themselves to fully mitigate the risks, should they materialise.
Financial risks Full details of the companys financial risks can be found in Note 21 on pages 89 to 92.
Other risks The group is exposed to other risks and uncertainties related to environmental, political, social, economic and employment factors in the territories in which we operate.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or deemed to be of lower materiality may, if they materialise, have an adverse impact on the groups revenue, profitability, cash flow and or net assets.
