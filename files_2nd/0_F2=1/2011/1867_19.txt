2010 revenues have been restated above accordingly.
Performance Legacy Supports revenue grew by 52% to $130.1 million 2010: $85.6 million with 11% of the growth coming from organic progression, largely relating to complex landing gear sales to the US Government and the first deliveries of environmental control units for the F-15 weapons guidance systems.
The remaining revenue growth is related to eight months of contribution from the GE Aviation Systems fuel measurement business acquired in May 2011, and represents an outperformance relative to our original expectations.
The integration of the fuel measurement business is progressing well and the establishment of the Cheltenham facility, together with the existing Slough facility, strengthens the foundation for expansion of the Legacy Support licensing proposition into the United Kingdom.
Ontic obtained two new licences in the year, and the order book continued to grow to a record $103 million 2010: $65 million including orders for the fuel measurement business which has parts on the growing Boeing 777 and Airbus A320 fleets.
