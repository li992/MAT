This will of increased copper prices and benefit be reviewed as part of a potential Boss Mining was acquired in from reduced costs arising from further expansion.
2009 and at that time produced economies of scale.
A feasibility study was approximately 10,000 tpa of grade B undertaken which identified a capital cost copper cathode via a heap leach and of US$83 million and utilised five additional electro-winning facility.
heap leach pads and three additional electro-winning bays.
The project was approved in 2010 and was completed in December 2011: it is now operational.

com Unlocking Value through Capital Expenditure Projects The estimated cost of the Groups main projects totals US$11 billion which is comprised of projects at execution, planning and design, and pre-feasibility stages.
The Group classifies its projects under four categories: Execution: Full approval by the Board, ordering of Pre-feasibility: Projects at the stage of pre-feasibility equipment and construction in progress: study that have not been approved by the Board: or Planning and design: Initial approval by the Board for Deferred: Previously identified projects that have been feasibility studies: put on hold.
