S The Group has a 100% equity interest in these licences, which cover over 6,000 sq km.
The B8 38 licence contains the Bualuang oil field and a Salamander has a proven number of step-out exploration prospects.
G4 50 track record of creating value surrounds the B8 38 licence and the Group believes it to be highly prospective exploration acreage with in the Greater Bualuang area.

With an expanded acreage The Group has delivered consistent reserves growth position in this area, Salamander on the Bualuang field with ultimately recoverable proven has the opportunity to apply and probable reserves growing from initial estimates its technical knowledge and of 15 MMbo to 43.5 MMbo as at 31 December 2011.
This includes 8 MMbo from the East Terrace discovery create material value through made during 2011.
The Group can also see additional the discovery and exploitation resources in reservoirs above and below the main of new oil fields.
2012 will see further investment in the Bualuang field with the installation of the Bravo Wellhead Platform that will provide a further 16 drilling slots.
The Group has signed a twelve month contract for the Atwood Mako rig with the rig expected on location in 3Q 2012.
The Atwood Mako will drill sixteen development wells, commencing in 3Q 2012, that will see production grow to approximately 15,000 boepd in 2013.

In G4 50, the Group completed an extensive 3D seismic survey in 1Q 2012 and it will be processing and interpreting this data in 1H 2012 before starting to Greater Bualuang, Thailand drill exploration wells with the Atwood Mako rig starting Oil production, development and exploration in 2H 2012 and running through 2013.
