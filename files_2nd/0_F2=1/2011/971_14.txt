Operating performance Kumba Iron Ore The total material mined at Sishen mine increased by 8% from 153.2 Mt in 2010 to 165.0 Mt, of which waste mined was 119.0Mt, an increase of 17% from 2010.
This planned increase in mining activity was negatively affected by wet pit conditions resulting from excessive rainfall during the first half of 2011.
As a consequence, the availability of run-of-mine material supplied to the dense 01 media separation DMS plant reduced, causing total production at Sishen mine to decrease by 6% from 41.3 Mt in 2010 to 38.9 Mt.
The jig plant achieved a run rate in excess of design capacity, producing 13.5 Mt for the year 2010: 13.3Mt as a result of an improved yield brought about by moderating the quality of the ore produced by the plant.
Kolomela was brought into production ahead of schedule.
Waste material stripped in the year amounted to 30.3 Mt 2010: 18.6 Mt as two open pits were developed at a cost of $131 million 2010: $108 million, all of which was capitalised.

Export sales volumes to China increased to 68% of total export volumes for the year, compared with 61% in 2010.
The companys traditional markets accounted for about 22% of export sales, while Kumba sold a small portion of its total exports into the Middle East and North Africa, and South America.
Approximately 73% of exports were sold to long term and annual contractual customers and 27% at prices derived from index.

The Amap operation contributed an operating profit of $120 million for the year, compared with an operating profit of $16million in 2010, reecting a strong production performance and continued cost containment during a period of elevated prices.

21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mine mineral rights After ArcelorMittal failed to convert its old order rights, SIOC applied for the residual 21.4% mining right previously held by ArcelorMittal and its application was accepted by the Department of Mineral Resources DMR on 4 May 2009.
A competing application for a prospecting right over the same area was also accepted by the DMR.
SIOC objected to this acceptance.
Notwithstanding this objection, a prospecting right over the 21.4% interest was granted by the DMR to Imperial Crown Trading 289 Pty Limited ICT.
SIOC initiated a review application in the North Gauteng High Court on 21 May 2010 in relation to the decision of the DMR to grant a prospecting right to ICT.
The High Court Review, in which SIOC challenged the award of the 21.4% prospecting right over Sishen mine by the DMR to ICT, was presided over by Judge Raymond Zondo in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, from 15 to 18 August 2011.
On 21 December 2011, judgement was delivered in the High Court regarding the status of the mining rights at Sishen mine.
The High Court held that, upon the conversion of SIOCs old order mining right relating to the Sishen mine properties in 2008, SIOC became the exclusive holder of a converted mining right for iron ore and quartzite in respect of the Sishen mine properties.
The High Court held further that as a consequence, any decision taken by the 01 DMR after such conversion in 2008 to accept or grant any further rights to iron ore at the Sishen mine properties was void.
Finally, the High Court reviewed and set aside the decision of the Minister of Mineral Resources or her delegate to grant a prospecting right to ICT relating to iron ore as to a 21.4% share in respect of the Sishen mine properties.
On 3 February 2012, both the DMR and ICT submitted applications for leave to appeal against the High Court judgment.
The High Court order does not affect the interim supply agreement between ArcelorMittal and SIOC, which will endure until 31 July 2012 as indicated above.
SIOC will continue to take the necessary steps to protect its shareholders interests in this regard.
