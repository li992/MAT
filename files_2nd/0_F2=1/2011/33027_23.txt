Business Review healthcollaboration Raising breast cancer awareness and improving treatment Named after the Zulu word for rise or uplifting, our Phakamisa partnership brings together different organisations to help raise breast cancer awareness, increase early diagnosis, and improve access to treatment and effective support networks in communities across South Africa.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in South Africa and is on the increase.
Every year, 1 in 29 women will be diagnosed with the disease.
Many more go undiagnosed and a lot of women are unable to afford or access treatment.
Phakamisa helps in three ways.
First, we are ensuring that our hormonal treatments are made available to the health service cost effectively.
Secondly, in collaboration with South Africas Foundation for Professional Development, we are providing accredited courses in cancer diagnosis, treatment and care to doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.
Finally, with the help of the Cancer Association of South Africa and the Breast Health Foundation, we are training teams of volunteers and counsellors to raise awareness and support patients.
In 2011, 100 doctors and nurses and 400 volunteers and counsellors were trained.
