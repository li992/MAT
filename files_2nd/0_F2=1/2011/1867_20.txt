Notwithstanding the reduction in activity in 2011, APPH made good progress on OEM orders for the Agusta Westland AW159 military helicopter and the BAE Systems Hawk trainer aircraft, which are due for delivery in 2012.
The recent Government defence platform rationalisation has had only a limited impact on the order book and our portfolio is well balanced across civil, military and regional programmes and also from an OEM versus aftermarket perspective.
APPH also moved forward with development of the landing gear for the new Saab Gripen NG fighter aircraft.
APPH remains focused on driving operational improvement, together with optimising its footprint and cost base.
Accordingly, it has recently announced the possible closure of its Basingstoke facility and transfer to Runcorn of the component repair and overhaul capability required to support its in-house needs.
