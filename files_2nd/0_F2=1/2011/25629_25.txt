Overall it achieved organic revenue growth of 3% whilst its trading margin improved from 21% to 22%.
2011 is estimated to be the worst year on record in terms of insured natural catastrophe losses at $105 billion against the previous high of $100 billion in 2005.
As losses mounted throughout the year, reinsurance rates in loss-affected areas experienced significant upward adjustments.
The current profile of JLT Res book of business, with its still relatively small international treaty book, means it did not benefit from the uplift in reinsurance rates in loss affected areas such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
JLT Re initiatives executed during the year included opening operations in Miami, Basel and Sydney, adding to its treaty reinsurance capabilities in Singapore and entering the life reinsurance sector through its acquisition of a new Swiss-based team, each designed to enhance its distribution channels and facilitate further revenue growth.
JLT Advisory completed its first full year of operation having closed its first meaningful corporate sale and generating a number of opportunities for its core reinsurance business.
