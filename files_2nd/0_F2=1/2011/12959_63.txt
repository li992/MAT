GENERATING NEW TARGETS AT MASSAWA Batch testwork completed has shown pressure oxidation to Senegal, Guinea, The Gambia and Guinea Bissau who are charged be very effective in releasing the gold from the sulphides.
The with developing two hydroelectric schemes in the region, including process requires flotation of the sulphides to a concentrate which the Sambangalou project 60 kilometres south east of Massawa.
is then treated through a high pressure and temperature chamber Subsequent meetings have been held with the Senegalese to oxidise the sulphides, following which the oxidised ore is put Minister of Energy and the World Bank to explore possible power through a normal Carbon in Leach CIL train to release the gold.
The results of bondwork tests confirm the abnormal hardness of the ore due to silica flooding.
Exploration and development This combined with the pressure oxidation process will make the The exploration team has focused its efforts in 2011 on the Massawa project a high energy user and thus a power strategy has evaluation of a large number of satellite targets to discover been developed to review alternative options to diesel generation.
additional non-refractory mineralisation that could add value to Meetings have been held with Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur the project.
This work is detailed in the Exploration Review on du Fleuve Gambie involving government representatives from pages 56 to 70 of this Annual Report.
