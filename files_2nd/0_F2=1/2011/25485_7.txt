Review of operating environment During the year under review, our business has bene ted from the continued recovery of financial asset prices, supported by monetary accommodation from central banks in many developed economies as well as higher savings rates in the western world.
The current economic environment is supportive of asset management businesses.
Of concern is the relentless regulatory change impacting on the asset management industry.
Our portfolio of investment capabilities is well positioned to serve current and future investor demand and our global client reach and focus on the institutional market have acted as stabilising factors in a world subject to dramatic changes in regulatory agendas, demography and relative risk perceptions.
Financial analysis Operating pro t increased by 52.6% to 127.3 million, contributing 29.3% to group pro t The increase in pro tability was supported by both record net in ows and higher market levels over the financial year.
These net in ows were from all of the distribution channels and across the range of investment capabilities Assets under management increased by 26.7% to a record level of 58.8 billion.

Accordingly a deeper understanding of sustainability is fundamental to our reputation and track record, and as such we have developed a stewardship policy that re ects our philosophy and approach.
We have committed our business to engendering this approach and integrating sustainability considerations, as appropriate, into our internal research and investment processes.
High quality relationships with our employees, clients and communities in which we operate are at the core of our business.
This is illustrated through: Integrating the assessment of relationships into the performance development review process, thus making it part of the remuneration procedure Providing leadership training to every person responsible for managing a team staff member Embedding the relationship dimension alongside the results dimension in everything we do.
In order to build on previous employment equity initiatives in South Africa and to ensure ongoing momentum, Investec Asset Management in South Africa established an employee and management selected employment equity forum in 2008.
Feedback from this forum is raised with the management team in order to ensure follow through and ongoing transformation within our business.
Given our African roots, we are conscious of the needs of broader communities.
We have committed ourselves to using our skills, experience and resources to make a sustainable, positive impact on society.
Our corporate social investment approach focuses on education and partnering initiatives that support local communities.
The environment matters to us.
Ongoing staff involvement in environmental activities takes place primarily through our locally based Investec Green Teams.
They represent groups of employees who seek to raise staff awareness of how to become more environmentally responsible.
