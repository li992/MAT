Interest rates remain low but are forecast to rise steadily over the next two years.
Credit spreads are tightening and the securitisation market has reopened.
There is a wall of money chasing yield and we have positioned our business to take advantage of this.
We have expanded our product and service capability over the last few years and our platform businesses are now all well established.
We believe that these factors have positioned us to grow market share and to take advantage of slowly increasing levels of market activity through the next reporting period.
South Africa has emerged from recession, however, corporates remain long cash, exports are weak owing to the strong currency and overall activity levels are low.
The business has positioned itself for a recovery in activity levels.
Activity levels in Australia have continued to pick up and the economy is well supported by interest in resources.
We are continuing to invest on the business and should bene t from the increased activity.

The cost to income ratio has been calculated by subtracting the depreciation on operating leased assets from operating income.
The variance in operating profi t over the year can be explained as follows: The increase in net interest income is largely due to the investment in higher yielding trading assets and the growth in the loan portfolio in the UK and Europe.
This has been somewhat offset by an increase in surplus cash held and a decline in the size of the Kensington portfolio of assets The increase in net fee and commission income is largely attributable to a strong performance from the Structured Equity Finance business given a larger client base, and increased levels of activity within the Structured Finance business in the UK Principal transaction income declined marginally during the year.
The division bene ted from a sound performance from its xed income and Principal Finance business.
This was offset by less customer ow activity in some of the businesses and negative fair value adjustments on some of the divisions equity investments held Other operating income re ects income earned on operating leases acquired during the year The improvement in impairments largely re ects recoveries in the South African business Expenses have increased largely due to acquisitions made and an increase in headcount and related expenses.

Southern Africa The corporate market continues to remain weak with low levels of activity leading to depressed lending activity and consequently, lower hedging activity.
We have however, seen an increase in pipeline in our lending businesses Signi cant surplus liquidity levels were maintained during the year and we continue to be a provider of liquidity to the South African interbank market.
Our surplus liquidity has had a negative effect on our margin for the period We grew our portfolio of highly rated yield enhancing xed income investments as opportunities presented themselves.

Sustainability considerations Capital Markets focus is on the financial aspect of the triple bottom line by helping to protect the sustainability of the group.
Our speci c role is to ensure that current credit exposures are monitored and that our balance sheet remains strong.
At the same time, we are aware of the need to embrace sustainability issues more, with the advent of societal changes and, through them, government policy and legislative changes.
We have to keep abreast of these changes to align ourselves accordingly and finance appropriate transactions, counterparties and industries, as part of our corporate social responsibility.
Sustainability is therefore being increasingly addressed through nancing appropriate business transactions.
104 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Divisional review Nonfinancial considerations are taken into account in all our business plans as these are considered from both a risk and opportunity perspective, and can at times render the economics unviable.
We do not pursue opportunities that do not stack up from an economic perspective.
We recognise that In the UK and Australia, where pressure to conform to international environmental practice norms and employees are agreements is much more intense, environmental concerns are taken into account on a transaction by transaction basis at the credit forums.
At the same time, however, we are cautious about subscribing fundamental to to international norms such as the Equator principles.
We support the key provisions of these by: our success as an Requiring that all projects comply with applicable environmental, planning, labour and procurement operation and we law therefore prioritise Not funding or investing in projects which do not have acceptable environmental impact the retention of assessments, do not comply with procurement and labour laws, and either do or could reasonably key staff and be expected to breach acceptable behavioural, ethical or moral standards.
the creation of a We are not, however, a signatory to the Equator principles for the following reasons: work environment The principles contain some excessively bureaucratic requirements which we feel are not within conducive to the remit of a bank and are contrary to shareholders interests but are within the natural ambit performance.
of a government In the case of a number of large infrastructure and energy projects, there is inevitable con ict between larger, nationwide developmental imperatives e. g. additional power generation or road transportation to enhance the socio-economic welfare of the region, and locally affected parties whose quality of life stands to be adversely affected by re-location or job loss, for example.
These trade-offs are a matter for local parties and their representatives.
While we should not be unaware of them, it is not our responsibility to make the call on such trade-offs.
Key to this, however, is that we deal in countries where rule of law and due process applies more or less effectively and civil rights are not abused There is a concern that accession is used to cover the avoidance of exercising fundamental moral judgement.
NGOs, for example, are not universally supportive of the principles and have therefore been accused of tokenism.
The principles do not stop business or projects in countries where, notwithstanding written legal code, opponents and critics may be extra-judicially detained or worse.
We recognise that employees are fundamental to our success as an operation and we therefore prioritise the retention of key staff and the creation of a work environment conducive to performance.
We are also aware that the younger generation entering the industry want to align themselves with rms that have a social conscience.
In South Africa, we strive to meet the requirements of representation within our team, but black representation at the top and middle management levels remains dif cult.
We are striving to address this through our transformation employment equity strategy focused on various pillars including recruitment, retention and communication.
On 7 September 2010 the project and infrastructure team hosted a Power Summit in South Africa.
The key note speaker was the minister of energy, Dipuo Peters, and an expert panel elded questions from attendees.
