Capital resources The following table analyses the Group's regulatory capital resources on a fully consolidated basis at 31 December as monitored by the FSA for regulatory purposes.
It is the Group's policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the business.
In carrying out this policy, the Group has regard to the supervisory requirements of the Financial Services Authority FSA.
The FSA uses Risk Asset Ratio RAR as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are 'weighted' to reflect the inherent credit and other risks : by international agreement, the RAR should be not less than 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%.
For further information refer to Balance sheet management: Capital management on pages 110 to 115.
