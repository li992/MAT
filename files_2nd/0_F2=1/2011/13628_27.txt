KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FINANCIAL KPIs Growth of the business, market penetration and quality of earnings are crucial target areas for Rotork and we have a number of measures of performance used throughout Rotork aimed at monitoring this.
The increased level of acquisitions this year affects a number of the KPIs as previously reported.
To better reflect trading performance those affected by the higher intangible amortisation charge have been revised to reflect adjusted profits, stated before intangible amortisation.
The KPIs used to monitor the financial performance of the business are set out below: n SALES REVENUE n RETURN ON SALES n RETURN ON CAPITAL n CASH GENERATION GROWTH % % EMPLOYED % % 40 28 120 100 26.0 89.6 74.1 30 21 90 75 17.7 20 14 60 50 10 7 30 25 0 0 0 0 07 08 09 10 11 07 08 09 10 11 07 08 09 10 11 07 08 09 10 11 17.7% 26.0% 89.6% 74.1% REASON FOR CHOICE REASON FOR CHOICE REASON FOR CHOICE REASON FOR CHOICE This is reported in detail for This measure brings together This is used as a measure of Rotork has an asset-light operating segments and is a key the combined effects of performance where a target business model by design and driver in the business.
