OVERVIEW OUR STRATEGIC GROWTH PROJECTS BARRO ALTO What it takes: What we said wed do We would meet our scheduled production DELIVERING ON date for first metal from our $1.9 billion Barro Alto nickel project in Brazil by the end of the first quarter of 2011.
The project OUR PROMISES would use proven metallurgical processing technology to ensure that we both met that date and experienced a relatively trouble free In 2011, we delivered three of our ramp-up process thereafter.
We planned that four strategic growth projects.
Barro Alto would more than double our Nickel businesss ferronickel production.
Our successful delivery of three major What we did and what it means to the business mining projects on or ahead of schedule We delivered first metal in March 2011, during the year is a great achievement, on schedule.
Barro Alto was the first of our four major strategic growth projects and will contribute significant new volumes to begin production and will be a key of iron ore, copper and nickel as the new contributor to Anglo Americans 35% organic volume growth by 2014.
The new operations continue to ramp up during 2012. nickel plant will reach its full production capacity at the beginning of 2013 and will For more information turn to page 18 average 41,000 tonnes per year of nickel over its first five years of full production, making use of our low risk and proven technology and rotary kiln electric furnace process.
02 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2011 Overview We were determined that safe delivery would be a hallmark of the commissioning and ramp-up phases at Barro Alto: there have been no fatal incidents to date, and we had an unbroken period of 13.2 million man hours without a lost time injury.
