Total income decreased by 10 per cent: Net interest income was 13 per cent lower, largely as a result of higher funding costs, muted demand for credit, the continued impact from previous derisking of the lending portfolio with a corresponding reduction in impairments and increased competition for deposits as we continued to reduce our funding gap.
Other income increased by 3 per cent, principally as a result of higher bancassurance income.
Income also includes the gain on the disposal of VISA Inc. shares.
Operating expenses and other costs reduced by 4 per cent, benefiting from cost savings from both our integration and simplification programmes partially offset by inflation.
We continue to invest in the Retail business to improve products and services for our customers including in both our digital platforms and our branches.
The impairment charge reduced by 28 per cent, primarily driven by a reduced unsecured charge which reflected our continued conservative approach to risk, effective portfolio management, and continued focus on existing customers.
Fair value unwind decreased by 24 per cent, driven largely by the maturing balances of the preacquisition portfolio.
Loans and advances to customers decreased by 3 per cent as customers continued to reduce their personal indebtedness particularly in unsecured lending, as noncore balances reduced and as we maintained a conservative risk appetite.
Riskweighted assets fell 6 per cent, principally reflecting reductions in unsecured balances.
Customer deposit growth was 5 per cent, against a market that experienced minimal growth.
This strong performance reflected the compelling customer proposition Retail has developed, and was driven by strong taxfree cash ISA balance growth.
This strong deposit growth, in addition to the issuance of debt securities backed by Retail assets, provided ongoing support to the Group funding position.
Against its strategic objectives, Retails strategy remains focused on building deeper customer relationships, driven by superior customer insight, and investment in its multibrand strategy, new products, multiple channels, and in colleagues.
Retail was notably successful in developing new products to address customer needs, such as the Halifax savers prize draw and ISA promise, and developing new digital technologies, such as mobile banking, to allow customers multichannel access.
The majority of integration activity is now complete and Retail has made good progress on products, sourcing, systems and processes.
Strategic focus Retails goal is to be the UKs best bank for customers.
This will be achieved by building deep and enduring relationships with our customers which will deliver real value to them, and, by continuing to support the UK economy.
Developing our customer insight and having a deeper understanding of customers and their needs will enable us to better invest in products and services that customers will most value.
In addition by simplifying the business and developing highly efficient and effective processes we will deliver an improved customer experience and increase the flexibility with which the business can respond to changes in the operating environment.
Success for Retail will be reflected in an enhanced customer experience resulting in strong customer advocacy which in turn, we believe, will lead to lower customer acquisition costs, increased share of wallet and improved customer retention.
Retail believes this strategy will drive sustainable longterm value for all stakeholders.
Progress against strategic initiatives Reshaping the business Retail is reshaping the business in a way that is driven by our customers needs and refocusing our efforts on building deeper customer relationships.
As part of this we have continued to make good progress at strengthening the balance sheet through strong customer deposit growth and by managing down balances outside our risk appetite.
Retail has also progressed with plans to divest retail assets and liabilities in line with state aid obligations Project Verde.
Retail is committed to understanding more fully what individual customers want from our products and services.
Retail has a significant asset in the customer information it manages and we are investing to further develop our insight into customer needs.
This will ensure we continue to do more to anticipate and meet customers financial needs, and help us develop relationships with customers so that they trust us to meet more of their needs, and stay with us for longer, thereby creating more profitability for the Group.
Retail is committed to a multibrand strategy operating relationship brands for Lloyds TSB and Bank of Scotland with a challenger brand for Halifax and other tactical brands in the portfolio.
Through our strategy, Retail can reach more customers with more distinct and considered proposals and product offerings.
Retail has been successful at developing new challenger propositions that appeal to customers like the savers prize draw in Halifax.
The prize draw offers customers the opportunity to win up to 100,000 and has achieved strong enrolment with over 450,000 customers registered for the first draw and improved customer advocacy.
Retail also developed the Halifax ISA promise which delivers a clear service promise that resonates with customers and helped support record new ISA business performance in 2011.
The mortgage offering has also been developed, including the rollout of a new mortgage sales platform that has improved the processing of mortgage applications and significantly simplified the mortgage application process for both customers and advisors.

Retail has already made good progress with the recent integration which delivered a common banking platform across the majority of customers and accounts, additional details are provided on page 96.
We are now investing in our infrastructure to ensure our systems support future simplification of the business and improve our capabilities.
This includes the further development of Risk and Finance systems to make decisionmaking more agile and enable us to compete more effectively in our chosen markets.
Retail continues to simplify its sourcing arrangements and flatten its management structure.
Retail is making good progress at reducing the number of suppliers and improving its demand management.
Reducing the layers of management is delivering stronger and more effective functions and empowering managers and colleagues.
Retail is also working to introduce simpler products, systems and processes for customers.
This includes developing new digital technologies to simplify our customers interactions with the Group and make banking with us more convenient in particular services like our award winning internet banking, mobile banking apps which have achieved over 1.5 million downloads and Money Manager.
Retail has seen strong improvement in customer advocacy with those customers who use these services.
Investing to be the best bank for customers Changing our business to be simpler and more customercentric will help us to achieve our vision, but we also need to invest in growth to be the best bank for customers.
That means deepening our customer relationships, growing the capabilities and skills of our colleagues, and helping our communities to grow and prosper.
We are committed to support and build stronger relationships with all customers and as part of this are developing the products and services we provide to mass affluent and business connected customers so that we can better meet their needs and form deep and enduring relationships.
This includes investing in training for our advisors and more automated systems, ensuring we help address the more complex financial needs of these customers and improve customer experience.
Retail recognises the importance of the branch for many customers and has made a commitment to maintain the same number of branches for the next three years, including pledging that it will not close a branch if its the last in a community.
Retail has also commenced a significant investment programme across the Lloyds TSB branch network.
The programme targets upgrading branch interiors, increasing the opening hours in branches, simplifying the advisor role structure and improving the queuing experience.
Pilots of the revised branch design and roles have delivered strong improvements in customer advocacy and new product sales.
We believe investing in our colleagues and deepening the pool of talent in the Group will ensure we continue to be an employer of choice.
This includes investing in training Academies and professional qualifications to support colleagues development.
Our support for households is vital to the strength of the UK economy.
Through our community investment agenda we aim to make a lasting difference to the country, focusing on key themes such as financial capability and inclusion, and environmental responsibility.
Financial performance Despite the difficult operating environment Retail delivered a profit before tax in 2011 of 3,636 million which was 350 million, or 9 per cent, lower than 2010.
Profit before tax and fair value unwind decreased to 2,797 million, a reduction of 3 per cent compared to 2010, driven by higher funding costs and the muted demand for credit.
Total income decreased by 1,061 million, or 10 per cent, to 9,194 million.
This was driven by a reduction in net interest income of 1,151 million, while other income increased by 42 million.
Core income trends were consistent with total income performance described below.
Net interest income reduced by 13 per cent compared to 2010.
One of the main drivers was the increase in wholesale funding costs which were not matched by average customer rates.
Net interest margin in 2011 decreased by 22 basis points to 2.09 per cent.
Income growth was also constrained by muted demand for credit.
Previous derisking of the lending portfolio, with a resulting reduction in unsecured balances, also contributed to the reduction in income albeit with a proportionately greater reduction in impairment.
Net interest margin, minus impairment rate, remained stable reflecting progress in derisking the balance sheet.
Finally, increased competition for deposits and strong balance growth resulted in an increase in the average rate paid on customer deposits.
Other income increased by 3 per cent in 2011 to 1,649 million from 1,607 million largely as a result of higher bancassurance income, driven by an increase in the value of protection products sold through the branch network.
Income also includes the gain on the disposal of VISA Inc shares.
Operating expenses and other costs fell by 4 per cent compared to 2010 and the costincome ratio was 48.3 per cent.
Operating expenses benefited from our integration activities, the start of our simplification programme, and other daytoday cost management activities to offset inflation.
We continue to invest in the Retail business to improve products and services for our customers including our digital platforms and our branches.
During 2011 Retail successfully completed a major milestone in the Integration programme, the consolidation of its main Retail product systems, which is discussed in greater detail on page 96.
This now creates a solid platform to deliver the simplification programme.
Overview r Business review Governance r Financial statements r Other information r Lloyds Banking Group 58 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 DIVISIONAL RESULTS RETAIL Credit performance across the business continued to be supported by our conservative approach to risk, a continued focus on existing customers and low interest rates.
The impairment charge on loans and advances decreased by 777 million, or 28 per cent, to 1,970 million driven by reductions in the unsecured charge.
The unsecured impairment charge reduced to 1,507 million from 2,455 million in 2010, reflecting the impact of our continued conservative approach to risk resulting in improved new business quality, effective portfolio management and a reduction in unsecured balances.
The secured impairment charge increased to 463 million from 292 million in 2010 largely reflecting a less certain outlook on house prices and appropriate provisioning against existing credit risks which have longer emergence periods due to current low interest rates.
These factors were partially offset by underlying improvement in the quality of the secured portfolio.
The fair value unwind net credit was 839 million compared with 1,105 million in 2010.
This reduction was driven largely by the maturing balances of the preacquisition portfolio.
Balance sheet progress Total customer balances remained stable at 599.9 billion as Retail continued to maintain its relationships with customers.
The mix of these balances continued to move towards customer deposits as customers continued to reduce their personal indebtedness and Retail continued to make strong progress in attracting savings balances.
This change in customer balance composition has additionally supported the Groups funding although it has also contributed to a reduction in income and profit.
Loans and advances to customers decreased by 10.9 billion, or 3 per cent, to 352.8 billion, compared to 31 December 2010.
This was driven by reduced customer demand for new credit, existing customers continuing to reduce their personal indebtedness, noncore lending run off and Retail maintaining a conservative approach to risk.
The reduction in lending to customers was in part due to the repayment of unsecured debt where balances reduced by 2.7 billion, or 10 per cent.
Secured balances reduced by 8.2 billion, or 2 per cent, of which 1.9 billion was a reduction in noncore mortgage balances.
The proportion of mortgages on standard variable rate, or equivalent products, now stands at 56 per cent and is expected to remain broadly stable in 2012.
Retails gross mortgage lending was 28.0 billion in 2011 which was equivalent to a market share of 20 per cent.
Retails new mortgage lending continued to be focused on home purchase with 70 per cent of lending being for house purchase rather than remortgaging.
Retail remains the UKs largest lender to first time buyers, helping over 52,000 customers buy their first home in 2011.
Riskweighted assets decreased by 6.1 billion to 103.2 billion compared to 31 December 2010.
This reflected the impact of lower lending balances and the reducing mix of unsecured lending.
Total customer deposits increased by 11.5 billion, or 5 per cent, to 247.1 billion in 2011.
This increase was largely driven by strong growth in tax free cash ISA balances.
Retail continues to perform well in the savings market despite the high levels of competition, with a strong stable of savings brands providing customers with an award winning range of products to meet their savings needs.
Retail continues to make a significant contribution to Group funding both through customer deposit growth and the supply of assets supporting over 64.0 billion of debt securities in external issue.
During the year Retail contributed to 16.4 billion of new issuance.
The majority of these securitisations are backed by mortgages and have a fixed repayment schedule and as such provide a stable source of funding for the Group.
