16 GSK Annual Report 2011 Our strategy for growth Strategic review Grow a diversied 1 global business Overview We are creating a more balanced business and product portfolio capable of delivering sustainable sales growth.
This is centred on our three business areas of Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.
We have substantially increased our investment in higher-growth areas such as our operations in Emerging Markets and Japan and in our global Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses.
As well as accessing these newer markets, the broadly-based business we are creating is less vulnerable to volatility, including generic pressures.
We also see significant competitive advantage and synergy through our ability to distribute pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer healthcare products particularly in rapidly growing emerging economies.
Progress Our record demonstrates the success of this approach.
Although reported turnover fell 3% in 2011, we have delivered underlying sales growth of 4% in each of the past two years.
We anticipate that underlying sales growth will translate into reported sales growth in 2012.
For details of underlying growth see page 27.
In addition, 38% of Group turnover is now generated outside the USA and Europe.
The shift in sales away from a reliance on white pills in Western markets to a broader base including Emerging Markets, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare is clear.
