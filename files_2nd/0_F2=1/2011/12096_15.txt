Our A ssets: Albyn RUSSIA KAZAKHSTAN CHINA Albyn is the newest addition to our Gold mine City town gold mining portfolio, and is especially Railway Albyn exciting because it is located in one of the key gold producing areas of the BAM Railway Amur region, where gold has been extracted by alluvial miners for over Trans-Siberian 120 years.
The combination of our Railway existing mining infrastructure and our CHINA Blagoveschensk three prospective licence areas being located near to the plant gives us a Location Albyn lies c. 190km by road from strong base on which to signi cantly Malomir and 70km by road from increase the gold output from the Tokur deposit in the Selemdja district in the north-east of the this project in the near future.
