The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained on page 56.

Products and services revenue Our products and services include telecommunications services Outlook provided in the UK and also a wide range of products and services We are focusing on long-term profitable revenue growth.
These are designed to meet the demand for IT Underlying revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange infrastructure and solutions and satisfy the expansion of broadband.
movements, acquisitions and disposals and specic items.
As transit trafc is low-margin and signicantly impacted by regulatory reductions in mobile termination rates, with no impact on the groups profitability, we have excluded transit from our key measure of the underlying revenue performance of the group.
Transit revenue declined by 214m in 2011, and we expect it to decline by around a further 400m in 2012 and 200m in 2013, largely due to mobile termination rate reductions.
Underlying revenue, excluding transit was down 3% in 2011 and we expect it to be in the range down 2% to at in 2012 and to grow by up to 2% in 2013.
An analysis of In 2011 transit revenue decreased by 14% 2010: 12%.
The revenue by major product and service category is set out below: decrease in both years is due to the impact of regulatory mobile termination rate reductions and the continued decline in low 2011 2010 2009 margin transit volumes.

ICT and managed networks Other operating income In 2011 ICT and managed networks revenue increased by 1% Other operating income was 373m in 2011, broadly at 2010: 3% increase.
This growth was mainly due to a continuation compared with 2010 2010: 7% increase.
The increase in 2010 of the trends from 2010 with an increase in MNS revenue in BT was principally due to an increase in the profit on sales of scrap and Wholesale and growth in networked IT services revenue in BT cable recoveries due to increased copper market prices and supplier Global Services.
Broadband and convergence Transforming our cost base In 2011 broadband and convergence revenue increased by 3% In 2011 we have continued our programme of cost transformation 2010: 2% increase due to the continued growth in broadband and delivered cost savings of 1,087m, a 7% reduction 2010: 5% revenue in BT Retail and the increase in LLU revenue in Openreach.
The key drivers of this reduction have been vendor This was offset by a decline in broadband revenue in BT Wholesale, negotiations and price reductions and the transformation and rereecting the trend of CPs continuing to switch to LLU provided by engineering of our business activities, delivering improvements in the Openreach and due to BT Wholesale securing volumes under long efficiency and effectiveness across the group.
Calls and lines In 2011 calls and lines revenue decreased by 10% 2010: 8% decrease.
The continuing decline reects the challenging market conditions, particularly in the business sector, and the migration from xed-line calls to broadband, data and IP services.
