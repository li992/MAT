Employee engagement We use a Group-wide employee survey to measure engagement and to receive feedback on how we can create a positive and challenging work environment.
In 2011, we did not conduct a Group-wide survey but took the opportunity to undertake a strategic review of how we measure employee engagement as a tool to drive business performance.
The outputs of this review are being used to inform how we continue to measure engagement in 2012 and beyond, including the delivery of a survey in 2012.
Employee engagement features in the nonfinancial KPI dashboard and is a measure of performance over successive three-year periods in the Long Term Incentive Scheme, outlined on pages 55 and 61.
We aim to have employee engagement scores in the top quartile of the external benchmark of similar companies.
