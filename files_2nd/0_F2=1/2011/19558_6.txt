Our strength in certain core markets enabled Savills to increase market share despite lower volumes.
UK Residential The Prime Residential market, where Savills is a market leader, continued to perform strongly, particularly in Prime Central London which has increasingly come to be seen by international investors as a store of value in turbulent economic conditions.
The Residential Transaction Advisory business increased revenue by 9% to 95.0m 2010: 86.8m, primarily as a result of a Property: Prime London Residential strong performance from the London market which, being more A Belgravia house in London valued in excess of 40 million.

The best addresses in the availability of mortgage finance remained a significant obstacle best locations have been elevated to international asset class for buyers and transaction volumes reflected this.

see significant movement from London to the Home Counties.
In the fourth quarter, we started to see signs that owners were beginning to consider such a move again, prompted by the relative purchasing power they now enjoy thanks to Londons strength over the last two years.
At the beginning of 2012, the prime Central London postcodes continue to be in strong demand with multiple cash buyers for each home.
Assuming there is no significant adjustment to property taxation, we do not currently see any particular reason for this to change.
During the year we opened new offices in Mayfair, St Johnss Wood and Chelsea and we have a number of new offices scheduled to open in London in 2012 and 2013.
Our New Homes business had another very strong year with significant Central London developments such as One Hyde Park performing well.
The Residential Transaction Advisory business, as a whole, recorded an 11% increase in underlying profit to 14.8m 2010: 13.3m.
UK Commercial Revenue from UK Commercial transactions remained broadly level at 47.9m 2010: 48.2m.
This performance was in line with the market which saw volumes marginally down year on year.
Trading conditions in the first part of the year remained strong, but deteriorated through the second half, with market volumes in the fourth quarter down 26% year on year.
London continued to be the focal point driven by overseas investment interest in both Property: Chiswick Park Unit Trust prime retail and office properties.
However, the market slowed The Chiswick Park Unit Trust CHISPUT, which owns Chiswick substantially at the end of the year prompted by the Euro crisis Park in West London, was sold to The Blackstone Group for and the lack of demand in the City occupier market.

the existing vacant space and the two remaining sites.
Taking advantage of variable market conditions and potential distress among some of its competitors, the UK Commercial business made some significant hires of sector specialists together with some small acquisitions.
This had a short term impact on profitability which resulted in Transaction Advisory profits falling to 4.6m 2010: 7.7m.
The benefit of this investment in new teams, including the post year end acquisition of Gresham Down, will be felt in future periods.
Savills plc Savills plc Report and Accounts 2011 Report and Accounts 2011 11 11 Our business Our governance Our results Asia Pacific Commercial Against a backdrop of falling market volumes in Hong Kong and Singapore, the Asia Pacific Transaction Advisory business had a somewhat stronger year than we anticipated.
Revenue fell by 6%, in comparison to the record revenue earned in 2010, to 80.2m 2010: 85.5m.
On a constant currency basis, this represented a reduction of 7% year on year.
The Hong Kong market saw a decline in volume in line with our expectations.
However, our business successfully increased its leading market share.
At the start of 2012 we have seen some significant deal activity.
However, we still expect transaction volumes in Hong Kong to decline during the first half as the lack of debt availability for commercial investment continues to have an adverse effect on demand.
In mainland China, our business continued to grow strongly with Transaction Advisory revenues increasing by over 36% year on year thanks in part to the ongoing investment in our Retail and Office Leasing teams.
Our businesses in Australia, Singapore, Property: SOHO Zhongshan Plaza Vietnam and South Korea all showed revenue growth over the SOHO China Limited, represented by Savills Shanghai, acquired previous year.
Overall, the Asia Pacific Commercial Transaction Shanghai New World Changning Commercial Center for Advisory business recorded a 16% decline in underlying profit US$500 million RMB3.2 billion.
The deal represented SOHO to 11.2m 2010: 13.4m reflecting the decline in revenue.

prime properties in the region.
It excludes mixed use developments, which represent a significant proportion of the regions development and are accounted for within the Commercial Transaction Advisory business.
Overall the Asia Pacific residential business grew revenues by 18% to 19.9m 2010: 16.9m which reflected a strong first half followed by the anticipated reduction in transaction volumes in Hong Kong and Singapore due in part to fiscal measures imposed by their respective Governments.
The Groups Global Residential initiative necessitated expansion and start up costs in Australia which, together with initial losses in the new Kowloon Tong office, caused a short term decrease of 12% in underlying profit for the region to 3.8m 2010: 4.3m.
Continental European Commercial The Continental European Commercial business saw revenue decline by 14% to 26.0m 2010: 30.2m.
In constant currency the underlying decrease was 15%.
This reflected the lack of confidence which emerged in most European markets in the second half of 2011.
In France, Transaction Advisory revenue was up year on year, boosted by significant investment particularly in our leasing teams.
Germany and Ireland were relatively flat in comparison to 2010 and other territories saw declines of between 10% and 50%.
In the fourth quarter, Germanys performance, which had been strong in the first half, swiftly declined prompted by economic Property: Shanghai World Finance Center uncertainty and the fact that the German banks had materially Savills represented state owned Bao Steel the largest steel reduced lending into the sector.

It is illustrative of its importance to us that one of the largest transactions undertaken in New York in 2011 was on behalf of a Spanish client.
As capital flows increasingly into real estate from many different parts of the world we expect to see more of this type of activity over time.
12 12 Savills plc Savills plc Report and Accounts 2011 Report and Accounts 2011 Group Chief Executives review Segmental reviews continued At the start of 2012, it is difficult to see any improvement in Continental European markets, which we anticipate will remain tough throughout the year until more certainty emerges at a macroeconomic level.
However, we do expect to reduce losses in the region in 2012.
US Commercial The revenue of our New York based Investment Advisory business increased by 103% constant currency: 113% to 6.3m 2010: 3.1m.
US transaction markets continued to show recovery through the first half as the CMBS financing market became more active.
The second half was more muted as the Euro crisis caused the debt markets to stall.
There was, however, an increased interest in Prime East Coast opportunities from international investors, a trend we expect to continue in 2012.
We have continued to invest in the business, making some significant hires in cross border advisory and the hospitality sector, and opening offices in Washington and on the West Coast.
This investment resulted in the underlying loss of 1.4m which nevertheless represented a significant improvement on the prior year 2010: 3.6m loss.
Property: 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan Representing Spanish retail group Inditex, Savills acquired the Consultancy $324 million high-value retail venue at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2011 2010 Manhattan.

UK Consultancy Revenue from UK consultancy services increased by 10% to 107.4m 2010: 97.5m.
Our Valuations team grew revenue despite continued fee pressure and profitability was improved through a marginal reduction in new insurance provisions year on year.
Our Housing Investment Consultancy and Building Consultancy teams performed in line with our expectations despite cuts in public sector expenditure.
Our Planning business benefited from the acquisition of the London Planning Practice in the summer and had a much improved pipeline going into 2012.
Overall, underlying profit from the UK Consultancy business increased by 20% to 10.9m 2010: 9.1m.
Asia Pacific Consultancy Revenue in the Asia Pacific Consultancy business declined by 5% to 24.9m 2010: 26.3m primarily relating to the discontinuation of unprofitable business.
