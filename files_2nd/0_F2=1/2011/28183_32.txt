Report on Corporate Governance The Directors are accountable to shareholders for the governance of the Companys affairs.
The UK Listing Rules require all listed companies to disclose how they have applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 2008 Combined Code as published by the Financial Reporting Council Combined Code.
As an investment company most of the day to day responsibilities are delegated to outside parties as the Company has no employees and all the Directors are non-executive.
Many of the provisions of the Combined Code are not directly applicable to the Company and the Board has determined that reporting against the AIC Code of Corporate Governance AIC Code which incorporates the Combined Code, provides the most appropriate information to shareholders.
The Financial Reporting Council confirmed in 2009 that by following the AIC Code and the Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies produced by the AIC, boards of investment companies should fully meet their obligations in relation to the Combined Code and the UK Listing Rules.
