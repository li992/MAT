Providing a peaceful place to remember for generations We are the largest single operator of crematoria in the UK with a growing portfolio of well established and modern, state of the art crematoria.

As an industry leader, we continue to raise standards of service and facilities, ensuring we are well positioned to meet the needs of our local communities for generations to come.
Some of our new initiatives include: extended service times, more accessible facilities and providing greater choice for families.
We continue to develop our crematoria and grounds which are open 365 days of the year for visitors, and our dedicated team of gardeners take great care and pride in maintaining them to the very highest standards.
