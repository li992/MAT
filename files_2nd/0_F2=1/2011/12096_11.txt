Our Asse ts : Pokrovskiy Contribution to the Groups 2011 gold production 15% The Pokrovskiy mine is much more than just a producing asset for us.
It was our first gold mine and the place where our success story started.
From a small, green eld Location exploration site, it has today become Pokrovskiy is located in the western part of the Amur region one of the largest and most advanced in the Russian Far East and gold producing mines in the Russian approximately 10km from the Trans-Siberian Railway.
It remains a solid base for the Groups expanding network of producing mines.
