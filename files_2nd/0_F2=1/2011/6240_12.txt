It is a disseminated gold deposit being developed as an open pit heap leach operation, Location: Sonora, 23 km from Herradura similar to the existing Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos mines.
Facilities: Open pit mine, heap leach and Merrill-Crowe plant Thebudgeted production at this mine is 376,000 ounces of gold overthe initial five year mine life, although we expect to extend Production forecast thatgure.
The average ore grade will be 0.5 g t. Our unaudited Commercial production: 1Q 2012 reserves estimate of 460,000 ounces of gold was deemed Anticipated annual average production: 42,000 attributable conservative by an independent mining consultancy.

The Noche Buena mine will be supported by the same communitiesas Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos.
As with all our development projects, safety risk is increased due tothe extensive reliance on contractors, some of whom are new and not accustomed to the Groups safety policies and procedures.
All contractors are subject to strict training and monitoring as part ofour risk mitigation.

Given the encouraging exploration results that indicate potential forlonger mine life 460,000 total ounces of gold in reserves and 1.3million total ounces in resources at year end 2011, the Executive Committee approved construction of a second leaching pad which will require an additional US$13.8 million investment and is expected to be completed in 2H 2012.
