As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.

Share Repurchases No shares have been bought back in the year.
The latest authority to purchase ordinary shares for cancellation was granted to the Directors on 26 July 2010 and expires on the date of the next Annual General Meeting.
The Directors are proposing that their authority to buy back shares be renewed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Treasury Shares Section 315 of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 allows companies to hold shares acquired by market purchase as treasury shares, rather than having to cancel them.
Up to 10% of the issued shares may be held in treasury and may be subsequently cancelled or sold for cash in the market.
This would give the Company the ability to reissue shares quickly and cost efficiently, thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
The Board currently intends only to authorise the sale of shares from treasury at prices at or above the prevailing net asset value per share plus costs of the relevant sale.
This should result in a positive overall effect on shareholders if shares are bought back at a discount and then sold at price at or above the net asset value per share plus costs of the relevant sale.
In the interests of all shareholders, the Board will keep the matter of treasury shares under review.
