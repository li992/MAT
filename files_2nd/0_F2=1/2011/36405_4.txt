Buying well InMay2009, we raised 166 million through a rights issue to take advantage of a market where real capital values were at their lowest for 30 years and in many at the right point casesbelow their replacement cost.
Since then we haveinvested these proceeds twice over, generating in the cycle anungeared IRR of 37% in the process and, as at 31March 2011, these new investments represented almost a quarter of the property portfolio.
Replacement cost per sq ft: A key investment criteria we apply when considering Estimated replacement cost by location per sq ft a purchase is whether we can buy a property at a 1,400 price beneath replacement cost.
Replacement cost is the theoretical cost of buying a similar site and building an equivalent quality property from 1,194 scratch.
Providing the building is of sufficient quality 1,200 and the cost of buying plus refurbishment costs is below the replacement cost, it can be a cost-effective way of acquiring high quality real estate at a discount.
