For example, the price of copper fell 21.3% during improvement in price in the coming years without taking on the risk of 2011 but for the year as a whole the average price of copper was up this being lost to high costs in the smelting production process.
The strength in copper during the year was driven Indirect exposure to assets that have these characteristics has been by robust emerging market demand, higher than expected supply maintained via the large holding in Rio Tinto but a physical position in disruptions due to industrial action and disappointing operational aluminium futures might be the solution.
In the medium to long term, the constraints holding back supply notably falling grades at existing mines and a lack of Nickel, after the strong performance of last year, finally succumbed to exploration success mean prices could remain well above the the pressures of reduced demand as the stainless steel industry marginal cost of supply and the high margins witnessed in recent closed capacity.
In addition, supply of nickel from low grade directyears could be sustained.

Many of the holdings were impacted by labour unrest with Freeports Grasberg mine the most significant.
Production at Grasberg was halted for many months as a combination of labour demands and onsite violence disrupted supply.
However, by year end, terms had been agreed to allow for the restart of the mine but it will be some time before production is back to full capacity.
In Peru, Cerro Verde also had to contend with labour unrest although their operations were not as badly impacted as those at Grasberg.
