As effective in large land-based turbines as they are in their relatively lightweight aero-engine cousins, our systems detect incipient failure conditions, cut the cost of unscheduled maintenance and optimise performance to conserve energy and minimise emissions.
Our strength lies in the integration of powerful sensors, sophisticated control algorithms and process electronics.
With boots on the ground in key power generation markets, we are developing highly responsive relationships with customers, exploiting our know-how and innovating quickly in response to their requirements.
With dedicated sales and support facilities in India and China running as smoothly as the industrial, land-based and hydro turbines we look after there, Meggitt Sensing Systems is now poised to capitalise on the energy markets in South America, directly engaging with customers through our new base in Brazil, which opened at the end of 2011.
