Work at loulo continues to define satellite ounces in proximity to the plant.
Modelling of the main mineralised structures has Loulo 3 been completed following extensive drill programmes executed the most significant satellite deposit on the permit is loulo 3. in 2011 which totalled 68 diamond drill holes for 15 182 metres During 2011, the deeper potential of the deposit was targeted and 236 Reverse Circulation RC holes for 19 099 metres.
