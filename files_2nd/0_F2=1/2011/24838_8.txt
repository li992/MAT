This increase is a product of the 60m Return from the portfolio which was driven by robust project performance supported by actual inflation above the 2.75% valuation assumption, contributions from new investments and a positive mark to market movement on the Kemble Water junior loan.
Fair value for each investment is derived from the present value of the investments expected future cash flows, using reasonable assumptions and forecasts, and an appropriate discount rate.
We exercise our judgment in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the detailed concession life financial models produced by each Project Company.
H ICL A N N U A L R E P O R T & A C COU N T S 2011 13 Investment Advisers Report continued Discount Rates The discount rates used for valuing each PFI PPP P3 investment are based on the appropriate risk free rate derived from the relevant government bond or gilt and a risk premium.
The risk premium takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings e. g. predictability and covenant of the concession income, all of which may be differentiated by project phase, and market participants appetite for these risks.
The discount rates used for valuing the projects in the portfolio are as follows: PFI PPP P3 portfolio Whole portfolio including Kemble Water Junior Loan Period ending Range Weighted average Range Weighted average 31 March 2010 8.4% to 11.0% 8.7% 8.4% to 13.2% 8.8% 30 September 2010 8.4% to 10.0% 8.7% 8.4% to 10.3% 8.7% 31 March 2011 8.4% to 10.0% 8.7% 7.8% to 10.0% 8.7% We use our judgement in arriving at the appropriate discount rate.
This is based on our knowledge of the market, taking into account intelligence gained from bidding activities, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of our markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.
An analysis of the movements in the weighted average risk free rate and risk premium for the PFI PPP P3 assets excluding the Kemble Water Junior Loan is shown below: PFI PPP P3 portfolio 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Movement Risk free rate 4.2% 4.4% 0.2% Risk premium 4.5% 4.3% 0.2% Discount Rate 8.7% 8.7% 0.0% Government bonds have seen some volatility over the year driven by a combination of fiscal concerns and the effects of quantative easing.
This has not translated into volatile pricing of PFI PPP P3 assets as the market has tried to look through this near term volatility.
As outlined in the Market commentary, the increased flow of PFI PPP P3 assets for sale has been broadly matched by increased demand for the assets with little impact on pricing or the discount rates used to value these assets.
An analysis of the movements in the weighted average discount rates analysed between operational and construction phase PFI PPP P3 projects is shown below: Discount rate 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Movement Operational phase 8.6% 8.6% 0.0% Construction phase 9.3% 11.0% 1.7% PFI PPP P3 Portfolio 8.7% 8.7% 0.0% The discount rate to reflect market pricing for an operational asset has been judged as 8.6% unchanged from the prior year.
The average discount rate applied to value construction assets has reduced by 1.7% reflecting a combination of lower risk free rates in Canada and the lower risks in the construction assets as compared to the previous year.
An analysis of the weighted average discount rates for the PFI PPP P3 portfolio analysed by territory is shown below: 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Movement Country Risk free rate Risk premium Discount rate UK 4.3% 4.3% 8.6% 8.6% 0.0% Eurozone 3.9%5.0% 8.9% 8.8% 0.1% Canada 3.7%5.1% 8.8% n a n a PFI PPP P3 Portfolio 4.2% 4.5% 8.7% 8.7% 0.0% The risk premiums and discount rates applied to value the overseas assets are higher than those used for the UK PFI portfolio because they include a premium for the foreign exchange risk, the less mature PFI PPP P3 market and the nature and phase of the underlying assets which include a rail asset and an asset in construction.

These assumptions and the Current Portfolio Value may vary over time.

The chart shows the steady long-term nature of the cashflows from the portfolio, coupled with a stable portfolio valuation to 2028.
From 2029, based on current forecasts, the portfolio will move into a capital repayment phase whereby capital is repaid and the portfolio valuation reduces as projects reach the end of their concession term, assuming that the proceeds are not invested in new investments, until in 2042 when all capital is repaid.
