Report and Accounts 2011 otheR finAnciAl infoRmAtion Volatility arising in insurance businesses the Groups statutory result before tax is affected by insurance volatility, caused by movements in financial markets, and policyholder interests volatility, which primarily reflects the gross up of policyholder tax included in the Group tax charge.
in 2011 the Groups statutory result before tax included negative insurance and policyholder interests volatility totalling 838 million compared to positive volatility of 306 million in 2010.
Volatility comprises the following: 2011 2010 m m insurance volatility 557 100 1 Policyholder interests volatility 283 216 total volatility 840 316 insurance hedging arrangements 2 10 Total 838 306 1 includes volatility relating to the Groups interest in St Jamess Place.
Insurance volatility the Groups insurance business has liability products that are supported by substantial holdings of investments, including equities, property and fixed interest investments, all of which are subject to variations in their value.
the value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments, yet ifRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments be reflected within the income statement.
As these investments are substantial and movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group, management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition to results based on the actual return.
the expected sterling investment returns used to determine the normalised profit of the business, which are based on prevailing market rates and published research into historical investment return differentials, are set out below: 2012 2011 2010 United Kingdom Sterling % % % Gilt yields gross 2.48 3.99 4.45 equity returns gross 5.48 6.99 7.45 Dividend yield 3.00 3.00 3.00 Property return gross 5.48 6.99 7.45 corporate bonds in unit-linked and With Profit funds gross 3.08 4.59 5.05 fixed interest investments backing annuity liabilities gross 3.89 4.78 5.30 the impact on the results due to the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return based upon economic assumptions made at the beginning of the year is included within insurance volatility.
changes in market variables also affect the realistic valuation of the guarantees and options embedded within the With Profits funds, the value of the in-force business and the value of shareholders funds.
the negative insurance volatility during the period ended 31 December 2011 in the insurance division was 557 million, primarily reflecting the underperformance of equity markets in the second half of 2011 and lower cash returns compared to long-term expectations.
Group hedging arrangements to protect against further deterioration in equity market conditions, and the consequent negative impact on the value of in-force business on the Group balance sheet, the Group purchased put option contracts in 2010, financed by selling some upside potential from equity market movements.
these expired in 2011 and the charge booked in 2011 on these options was 3 million.
new protection against significant market falls was acquired in 2011 to replace the expired contracts.
there was no initial cost associated with these hedging arrangements.
on a mark-tomarket valuation basis a gain of 5 million was recognised in relation to the new contracts in 2011. marketplace trends 21 Lloyds Banking Group Business model and strategy 24 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 95 Delivering our action plan 26 Relationships and responsibility 30 our london 2012 partnership 42 Summary of Group results 44 Divisional results 54 Other financial information 86 five year financial summary 98 1 Risk management 99 171 205 355 Volatility arising in insurance businesses continued Policyholder interests volatility the application of accounting standards results in the introduction of other sources of significant volatility into the pre-tax profits of the life, pensions and investments business.
in order to provide a clearer representation of the performance of the business, and consistent with the way in which it is managed, adjustments are made to remove this volatility from underlying profits.
the effect of these adjustments is separately disclosed as policyholder interests volatility: there is no impact upon profit attributable to equity shareholders over the long term.
the most significant of these additional sources of volatility is policyholder tax.
Accounting standards require that tax on policyholder investment returns should be included in the Groups tax charge rather than being offset against the related income.
the impact is, therefore, to either increase or decrease profit before tax with a corresponding change in the tax charge.
over the longer term the charges levied to policyholders to cover policyholder tax on investment returns and the related tax provisions are expected to offset.
in practice timing and measurement differences exist between provisions for tax and charges made to policyholders.
consistent with the normalised approach taken in respect of insurance volatility, differences in the expected levels of the policyholder tax provision and policyholder charges are adjusted through policyholder interests volatility.
other sources of volatility include the minorities share of the profits earned by investment vehicles which are not wholly owned by the long-term assurance funds.
in the year to 31 December 2011, the statutory results before tax in both the insurance and Wealth and international divisions included a charge to other income which relates to policyholder interests volatility totalling 283 million 2010: 216 million credit.
this charge included the impact of deferred tax asset impairments due to less optimistic economic forecasts and changes in expected policyholder tax provisions.
Policyholder tax liabilities increased during 2011 and led to a tax charge during the period.
Liability management gains liability management gains arose on transactions undertaken in both 2010 and 2011.
As a result of transactions in 2011 the Group has recognised gains of 1,295 million 2010: gain of 423 million.
in December 2011, the Group carried out an exercise allowing the holders of certain lloyds tSB Bank and hBoS securities to exchange their securities exchange Securities for other securities issued by lloyds tSB Bank.
the gain relating to the 2011 transaction consists of 599 million recognised in other operating income relating to the extinguishment of the existing liability in respect of the exchange Securities for which new securities were issued and 570 million recognised in net interest income, principally relating to the change in carrying value, arising as a result of a change in the estimated maturities of the remaining exchange Securities.
the gain recognised in net interest income will reverse as the securities accrete to par over the remaining life.
in December 2011, the Group decided to defer payment of non-mandatory coupons on certain securities and, instead, settle them using an Alternative coupon Satisfaction mechanism on their contractual terms.
this change in expected cashflows resulted in a gain of 126 million in net interest income from the recalculation of the carrying value of these securities.

the table below analyses the run-rate synergies as at 31 December 2011 by division.

these synergies have arisen through procurement: property with 83 head office sites vacated: it cost savings and job reductions.
integration costs of 1,097 million were incurred in the year and have been excluded from the combined businesses results.
this brings the total integration costs since the hBoS acquisition to 3,846 million.
Migrating our business systems to a single platform 2011 saw the single biggest event of the integration programme with the successful migration of our core business systems to a single it platform.
the Group has moved 30 million customer accounts and transferred 35 billion pieces of data between systems successfully.
this has been the largest ever financial services it integration, and at its peak it involved many thousands of colleagues across the organisation.
there were three major components to the system migrations: the lloyds tSB Branch counter System icS was introduced to all halifax and Bank of Scotland branches and 3,800 hBoS Automated teller machines Atms and 667 intelligent Deposit machines iDms were moved across to the lloyds Banking Group it network the market leading mortgage Sales Platform, already in use in halifax and Bank of Scotland branches, was successfully rolled out to 800 lloyds tSB mortgage advisors in england and Wales in September 2011 30 million hBoS current accounts and savings accounts and commercial and UK Private Banking accounts, were migrated onto the lloyds Banking Group it system.
this customer data migration was successfully achieved after five proving cycles, 11 dress rehearsals including two full trial account migrations, over 250,000 business tests and 27,000 colleagues trained totalling 1.5 million hours the vast majority of integration activity is now complete, with a handful of peripheral migrations to be completed in 2012.
Simplification costs and benefits the successful delivery of the integration programme has provided a platform and single set of processes that now enables the Group to commence its next transformational journey.
A core element of this transformational agenda is the Simplification programme.
the programme is structured around four key initiatives: operations & Processes getting our processes right end-to-end, with the right it in the right places.
Sourcing better understanding what we need across the Group and getting the right deals from our suppliers.
organisation focusing on how the Group is structured and the way we work.
