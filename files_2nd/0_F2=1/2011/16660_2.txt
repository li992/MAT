Our products constitute a small fraction of our customers costs and add significant value to our customers.
In both cases, the business model is based on being recognised by our customers worldwide for technology leadership, outstanding technical support services and reliable just in time supply capabilities.

Approximately 23% of Group sales are to customers in NAFTA, 35% in Europe, 32% in Asia-Pacific and 10% in the rest of the world, which is principally Brazil and South Africa.
GROUP TARGETS On 26 January 2011, we set out our targets for performance improvement to the year ended 31 December 2013 and our strategy for achieving those targets.
The following table sets out those targets and the strong progress achieved in 2011.
Targets 2011 Performance Average annual revenue growth to exceed 1.5 times global 2011 revenue growth: 11% as reported: 9% underlying 2011 global GDP growth GDP: c. 3% Return on sales margin of 12% by 2013 assuming constant metals 2011 margin restated at average 2010 metals prices: 10.9% versus 9.9% prices in 2010 Double digit average annual headline earnings growth 2011 headline earnings growth: 14% Dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth 2011 final dividend 14.50p: 26% on 2010: total dividend 21.75p: 89% on 2010 Return on investment ROI increasingly ahead of Group WACC 2011 ROI: 10.3% versus 9.6% in 2010 Maintaining a strong financial position with net debt to EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA ratio at 31 December 2011 of 1.1 times leverage ratio not more than 1.5 times at year end and 1.75 times 1.3x at June 2011 at mid-year In setting these targets we are not assuming any significant acquisitions, but some selected bolt-on acquisitions may continue to be made.
The significant improvement in the Groups portfolio of businesses means that achievement of the 12% margin target does not require any division to deliver higher margins than they have previously achieved note: pro forma for Foseco acquired in April 2008.
We see achievement of these targets being underpinned by: leading global market positions, supplying consumables to essential industries steel, foundry and electronics: track record of market share gains with new, enhanced technology, higher margin products increased R&D capability and spending: significant developing market exposure c. 50% of revenue: c. 60% of trading profit : considerable further recovery potential in mature markets where cost base significantly reduced: opportunities to leverage further organic growth through bolt-on acquisitions: and maintaining strong cash flow momentum.
