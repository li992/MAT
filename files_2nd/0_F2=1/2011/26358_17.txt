Within the core business, profit before tax and fair value unwind increased by 20 per cent, primarily due to a 22 per cent growth in customer core balances and improvement in customer net interest margins partially offset by increased operating expenses reflecting the continued investment in deposit activity in line with our strategy of strengthening the balance sheet and growing our share of the Wealth market.
Total income decreased by 8 per cent: Net interest income was 21 per cent lower, reflecting lower lending volumes and increased impaired assets, partly offset by the favourable impact of foreign currency movements, particularly the Australian Dollar.
We saw higher deposit balances and margins in our core business where net interest income has increased by 20 per cent.
Banking net interest margin reduced by 20 basis points reflecting the increased strains of lost earnings on higher impaired asset balances and higher funding costs.
This was offset by stronger deposit margins in the Wealth businesses and higher deposit balances and margins in our International on-line deposit business, which drove the banking net interest margin in our core business up by 85 basis points to 4.16 per cent.
Other income increased by 7 per cent, with foreign exchange benefits in International, partly offset by the impact of lower funds under management in the Wealth businesses driven by market conditions together with a shift in customer investments from funds under management to deposits.
Operating expenses increased by 1 per cent, due to higher regulatory costs, investment in growth initiatives and the effect of stronger foreign currency rates, partly offset by benefits from cost saving initiatives across all businesses.
The impairment charge reduced by 23 per cent.
Following higher charges in 2010, especially in the fourth quarter as the economic environment in Ireland deteriorated, the rate of impaired loan migration has slowed.
The coverage ratio increased from 53 per cent to 61 per cent reflecting further provisions in the year, particularly in Ireland.
Fair value unwind decreased by 48 per cent, reflecting accelerated unwind of fair value adjustments in 2010 in line with actual levels of impairment losses experienced, particularly in Ireland and Australia.
Net loans and advances to customers decreased by 21 per cent, largely driven by fide-risking of the balance sheet through reducing non-core assets across both Wealth & International.
Risk-weighted assets decreased by 19 per cent, reflecting lower asset balances and additional impairment provisions, particularly in International.
Customer deposits grew by 28 per cent, primarily due to continued strong inflows in the on-line deposit business.
The funding gap has reduced by 20.7 billion to 1.8 billion reflecting continued focus within International on fide-risking and right-sizing the balance sheet together with continued strong deposit inflows.
Against its strategic objectives, Wealth demonstrated continued strength in client acquisition through the UK franchise with an 8 per cent increase in customer numbers.
To date the division has announced the exit from seven countries, and corporate lending has been refocused around selected customers aligned to UK product and sector plans and the Groups international risk appetite.
International is contributing to a strengthening of the Groups balance sheet through a significant and managed run-down of non-core assets together with diversification of sources of funding through international deposits.
Strategic focus Wealth provides strong growth opportunities for the Group and, through deepening the relationships with existing Group clients alongside targeted customer acquisition, the goal is to be recognised as the primary Wealth advisor to the UK mass affluent, affluent and high net worth customers together with UK expatriates and others with UK connections.
In the International businesses, the priority is to maximise value in the medium term.
The immediate focus is on close management of the lending portfolios, particularly in Ireland, and reducing assets where appropriate.
At the same time, International is delivering operational efficiencies and rightsizing the cost base to fit the reshaped business models.
Progress against strategic initiatives As with the wider Group, Wealth and Internationals strategic focus has been on: Reshaping the business to better fit the Groups risk appetite Focus remains on maximising value and aligning with the Groups risk appetite through close management of the lending portfolio, continuing disciplined reduction of non-core assets, diversifying sources of funding and rationalisation of our international presence.
Wealth and International have reduced non-core loans and advances to customers by 11.3 billion in 2011 through a mixture of repayments and selected asset disposals in addition to foreign exchange and impairments as outlined below, including the sale of 1 billion gross of commercial real estate assets in Australia and New Zealand.
Our International on-line deposit business continued to grow strongly with customer balances as at December 2011 of 13.8 billion.
The division has also made good progress towards reducing its International presence.

Wealth & International is in the process of realising additional efficiencies and cost savings through its initiatives to develop a single customer platform across all International Wealth businesses, streamlining of operating models and creation of a shared support infrastructure.
In 2011, the UK Private Banking and High Net Worth businesses have been successfully integrated to form One Private Bank, with a simplified management structure and aligned business models across the heritage brands.
During the second half of the year, around 60,000 UK Wealth accounts have been migrated onto a single operating platform.
Developing a more focused business and investing in growth The division will focus on serving customers both within the UK and also those with UK connections.
In International, corporate lending has been refocused around selected customers aligned to UK product and sector plans and the Groups international risk appetite.
In Wealth, the focus of propositions will be within the existing UK customer franchise in addition to customers with UK connections in Commonwealth countries, Europe, Middle East, and on the Indian Subcontinent.
Significant investment is being made towards growing market share in what is viewed as a key growth opportunity for the Group UK and International Wealth.
The investment is geared towards developing compelling propositions for mass affluent, affluent and high net worth customers: this will address a key gap for the Group in the mass affluent market and will enhance our investment management offering in the affluent and high net worth segments.
Underpinning this, we are consolidating our platforms and simplifying the operating model to deliver a better customer experience in a more efficient manner, thereby improving customer onboarding, retention and value capture through cross sales.
Financial performance Loss before tax and fair value unwind reduced by 22 per cent to 4,130 million due to a lower impairment charge, predominantly in Ireland, more than offset by lower income and higher costs.
Total income decreased by 8 per cent to 2,025 million.
Net interest income decreased by 21 per cent, or 25 per cent in constant currency terms.
Higher funding costs and the increased strain of impaired assets, reflected in a 33 per cent reduction in net lending margins together with lower lending volumes impacting net interest income are partially offset by the impact of the stronger Australian dollar in International.
Deposit margins increased by 14 per cent reflecting changing product mix predominantly as a result of continued deposit inflows in the on-line deposit business at higher margins together with improving margins across the Wealth businesses.
Other income increased by 7 per cent, mainly due to foreign exchange benefits in International.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, other income decreased by 1 per cent.
Operating expenses and other costs increased by 1 per cent, due to increased investment in the International deposit business, the impact of the stronger Australian dollar and Swiss franc and additional regulatory costs in Wealth.
On a constant currency basis, operating expenses reduced by 1 per cent.
Despite increased investment in International deposit gathering, the cost: income ratio overall improved by 3 per cent in our core business.
The impairment charge reduced by 23 per cent to 4,610 million.
Following increased charges in the last quarter of 2010, driven by the significant deterioration in the economic environment in Ireland, the rate of impaired loan migration has slowed in 2011.
Balance sheet progress Net loans and advances to customers decreased by 11.5 billion to 43.8 billion, as we continued to focus management action on fide-risking the balance sheet.
The reduction of 11.5 billion reflects net repayments including asset sales of 6.0 billion, additional impairment provisions of 4.6 billion mainly within the International businesses and foreign exchange movements of 0.9 billion.
Risk-weighted assets decreased by 11.4 billion to 47.3 billion, reflecting lower asset balances and increased impairment provisions, particularly in the non-core portfolios.
Customer deposits increased by 9.2 billion to 42.0 billion mainly due to continued strong deposit inflows in the on-line deposit businesses.

Although funds under management within Private and International Banking decreased by 5 per cent to 12.8 billion, this primarily reflected market movements and a consequent shift of customer appetite away from investment products.
Profit before tax and fair value unwind decreased by 14 per cent to 189 million mainly due to increased impairment losses partly offset by higher income.
Excluding non-recurring gains on sale of non-core businesses of 36 million which were recognised in the first half of 2010, profit before tax and fair value unwind increased by 3 per cent.
Total income increased by 2 per cent to 1,344 million.
Excluding non-recurring gains on sale, which were recognised in the first half of 2010, income increased by 5 per cent.
Net interest income increased by 20 per cent, reflecting improving deposit margins across the Wealth business.
Operating expenses and other costs increased by 1 per cent to 1,055 million.
Benefits from cost saving initiatives across the Wealth businesses have been offset by increased regulatory and one-off costs and the impact of the stronger Swiss Franc in the International Wealth business.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and one-off costs, operating expenses reduced by 3 per cent.
The impairment charge increased to 100 million primarily due to increased charges in the Groups Spanish mortgage book reflecting deterioration in the local property markets and economic outlook in Spain.
Balance sheet progress Net loans and advances to customers decreased by 0.6 billion or 7 per cent, to 8.5 billion due to net repayments of 0.7 billion and increased impairment provisions across the non-core portfolios and foreign exchange movements of 0.1 billion.
Risk-weighted assets decreased by 2.6 billion or 25 per cent, to 7.8 billion reflecting lower lending volumes and improved use of collateral.
Customer deposits increased by 0.4 billion, or 1 per cent, to 27.2 billion.

Net outflows of 19.9 billion reflect expected attrition on insurance funds within SWIP, the market backdrop in the second half of 2011 and fund outflows within Invista Real Estate reflecting both transfers to SWIP during the year and the wind down of Invista Real Estate business.
SWIPs inflows include 2.4 billion of funds previously managed by Invista Real Estate.
Reductions in global equity values contributed towards investment return, expenses and commission of funds under management by 2.8 billion.
This together with the general market backdrop contributed to a shift in customer investments in our Wealth businesses away from funds towards Wealth and Retail deposits.

Loans and advances to customers reduced by 24 per cent including 5.2 billion of net repayments and asset sales and customer deposits increased by 147 per cent to 14.8 billion.
Loss before tax and fair value unwind reduced by 1,223 million to 4,319 million mainly as a result of a lower impairment charge, reflecting a reduction of 1,077 million in Ireland and 328 million in Australia.
Total income decreased by 24 per cent, but was 38 per cent lower in constant currency, reflecting lower interest-earning assets and the increased strain of lost earnings on higher impaired assets.
Operating expenses increased by 1 per cent.
On constant currency terms, operating expenses reduced by 4 per cent reflecting cost saving initiatives across the International business, partly offset by the continued investment in Internationals on-line deposit business.
The impairment charge and loans and advances to customers are summarised by key geography in the following table.

Balance sheet progress Net loans and advances to customers decreased by 10.9 billion or 24 per cent, to 35.3 billion due to net repayments of 5.2 billion across all businesses including the sale of 1 billion of commercial real estate assets in Australia and New Zealand, further impairment provisions and foreign exchange movements of 0.8 billion.
The division is focused on fide-risking and right-sizing the balance sheet, focusing on key Group relationships, as well as reducing concentrations in Commercial Real Estate.
Risk weighted assets decreased by 8.8 billion or 18 per cent, to 39.5 billion reflecting lower asset balances and further impairment provisions and foreign exchange rate movements.
This is partly offset by an increase in risk weighted assets to cover further deterioration in the Irish housing market and other credit risk model changes which impact risk weighted assets.
Customer deposits increased by 8.8 billion to 14.8 billion driven by continued strong performance within our International on-line deposit business.
