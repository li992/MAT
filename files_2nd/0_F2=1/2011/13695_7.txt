Report of the Directors The Directors present their report together with the audited financial statements of RPS Group Plc and its subsidiary undertakings the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Results and dividend The Consolidated Income Statement is set out on page 37 and shows the profit for the year.
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 2.9p 2010: 2.52p per share.
This together with the interim dividend of 2.66 p 2010: 2.31p per share paid on 21 October 2011 gives a total dividend of 5.56p 2010: 4.83p per share for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Principal activities and business review The Groups principal activities and performance during the year and future prospects as well as its business model and strategy are described on pages 2 to 14.
Financial key performance indicators can be found on page 2.
The Board does not use non-financial key performance indicators to assess the Group as a whole, but parts of the Group do use non-financial key performance indicators from time to time.
Consistent with its size and complexity, the Group has a large number of contractual relationships with clients and suppliers.
In the Directors view, however, there is no single contract or client relationship, which is essential to the Groups business.
The principal operating subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 5 to the Parent Company Financial Statements.
The Business Review contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of RPS.
These statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon circumstances that may occur in the future.
There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements.
The current uncertainty in global economic outlook inevitably increases the risks to which the Group is exposed.
Nothing in the Business Review should be construed as a profit forecast.
Principal risks and uncertainties The principal risks and uncertainties are reported on pages 9 and 10 in the Risk Management section of the Business Review.
Corporate Governance The Directors report on corporate governance can be found on pages 21 to 26 and incorporates other parts of the Report and Accounts as detailed therein.

Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements sets out the borrowings of the Group and considers liquidity risk, whilst note 29 describes the Groups approach to capital management, and financial risk management in general.
The Group has had good cash flow for a number of years, has a modest amount of net bank debt at the year end and operates well within the financial covenants applying to the main bank facility that expires in July 2013.
The Group is confident that it will renew or replace this facility this year.
The Group has a diverse range of businesses in a spread of geographies and as a consequence the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
