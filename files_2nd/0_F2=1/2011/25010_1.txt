The Group does not have material exposures to market risk or long duration credit risk.
ICAP is primarily commission earning and its financial performance was largely unaffected by the credit crunch which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008 because the Group does not carry credit sensitive assets on its balance sheet and does not leverage its capital.
The Group continues to classify its risk exposures into eight broad risk categories, of which we consider liquidity, operational and legal and compliance to be our three principal risk categories.
