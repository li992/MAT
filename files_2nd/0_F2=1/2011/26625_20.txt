Man Group plc Report and accounts 107 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 1.
Financial reporting governance Statement of directors responsibilities The directors are responsible for preparing this report, the Remuneration Report, and the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent Company financial statements respectively: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business for the foreseeable future.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge: the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the parent company financial statements as prepared under UK GAAP give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group: the management report contained on pages 1 to 47 includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of Man, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces: and there is no relevant audit information of which Mans auditors are unaware, and that they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that Mans auditors are aware of that information.

The new standards and amendments to existing standards effective for the nine months to 31 December 2011 that have had an impact, and have been adopted by Man, related only to disclosure enhancements arising from the 2010 Annual Improvements.
The estimated impact of the changes to IAS 19, effective from 1 January 2013, using period end data indicates a reduction in net pension assets recognised in the balance sheet of around $97 million.
The impact on the income statement is currently not expected to be significant.
The majority of the impact will be reflected as an adjustment to equity on transition in accordance with IAS 8.

Funds under management FUM unaudited An investor subscribes capital to fund products based on the funds prospectus which defines the relationship between the investor and the fund entity.
The fund entity is controlled by an independent fund board which represents the interests of the investors.
Mans relationship with the fund entity is typically defined by the investment management agreement IMA.
The IMA specifies the duties and obligations the Man entity owes to the fund entity, and the fee arrangements.
Investors are charged management fees based on asset exposure and in most cases incentive fees based on investment performance.
The asset exposure, or FUM, is supported by the investors capital and any financing provided to the fund entities by banks and prime brokers, referred to as leverage.
Funds under management is the basis on which we earn gross management fee revenue.
The investment performance earned on FUM generates gross performance fee revenue.
FUM grows through new investor subscriptions, increased leverage, positive investment performance and foreign currency movements: and reduces by redemptions, reduced leverage, negative investment performance and foreign currency movements.
The guaranteed products have borrowings in addition to investors capital leverage and changes in leverage affect FUM.
We report FUM in US dollars, which is our functional currency and therefore changes in currency exchange rates can change FUM balances.
Foreign exchange movements, primarily in relation to the Euro, reduced reported FUM by $1.7 billion.
This has no effect on the investors who have selected the currency of their individual product, but it does impact our management fee revenue.
A 5% movement in exchange rates of all currencies in which FUM is denominated would change FUM by $1.6 billion.
As FUM can change through net sales and performance there is no effective way to systematically reduce the foreign exchange risk.
However, we do factor in the revenue from FUM when we hedge our non US dollar expense base.
FUM is shown by product groupings that have similar margin and investor characteristics.
Details of the movements in FUM for the period can be found in the Finance Directors Review on page 13.
The details of FUM by dealing date and currency are shown in the tables below.

Taxation continued The tax on Mans total profit before tax is lower 12 months to 31 March 2011: lower than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective UK tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated companies, as follows: 9 months to 12 months to 31 December 31 March $m 2011 2011 Profit before tax 193 324 Theoretical tax charge at UK rate 26% 31 March 2011: 28% 50 91 Effect of: Overseas rates compared to UK 32 51 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 10 18 Impairment of goodwill and other investments 114 BlueCrest disposal and partnership profits 74 Share-based payments 15 7 Other 11 18 16 40 Total tax charge 34 51 Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates expected to be applied when the asset or liability is realised.
The deferred tax closing balance of $94 million 31 March 2011: $100 million relates mostly to the tax arising on intangible assets of $120 million 31 March 2011: $129 million.

Geographical disclosure Disclosure of revenue by geographic location is required by IFRS based on the registered domicile of the fund entity paying Man fees.
This geographic analysis is therefore not necessarily representative of the spread of our global business.
The geographic analysis of funds under management based on the location of the intermediary or institutional investor is given on page 31 and may be more relevant to an understanding of the geographic spread of our business.
In addition, the table below includes an analysis of revenue by geographic location of the legal entity recognising the revenue, as this is considered more meaningful than revenue by fund location.

Foreign currencies The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and funding are denominated in US dollars USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
The assets and liabilities of consolidated entities that have a functional currency other than USD are translated into USD at the balance sheet date rate.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the period in which the transactions occur.
Exchange differences which arise are recorded in other comprehensive income.
In consolidated entities with the same USD functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balance sheet date rate.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at the spot rate at the date of the transaction or if appropriate the average rate for the month in which the transaction occurs.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the income statement.
The following US dollar rates of exchange have been used in preparing these financial statements: Period-end rates Average rates 31 December 31 March 31 December 31 March 2011 2011 2011 2011 Euro 0.7725 0.7057 0.7141 0.7559 Sterling 0.6435 0.6235 0.6233 0.6427 Swiss Franc 0.9384 0.9183 0.8695 1.0139 11.
Fair value hierarchy of financial assets liabilities Man uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosure, as follows: Level 1.
Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2011 can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2011 31 March 2011 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products FR 14 20 94 183 297 27 75 264 366 Other investments FR 14 and other receivables 5 8 339 352 4 15 7 26 25 102 522 649 31 90 271 392 Financial liabilities held at fair value: 15 15 1 1 Other payables FR 16 15 15 1 1 Man Group plc Report and accounts 11 114 4 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 Additional financial information continued 11.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life as follows: leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement: and equipment over 3 10 years.
In the prior period, certain technology assets were reclassified during the period from other intangible assets.
Assets in the course of construction, included within leasehold improvements, totalled $35 million at period end 31 March 2011: $94 million, mostly relating to the Data Centre Facility.
Total capital commitments at period end were around $18 million, mostly relating to the fit out of the New York office.
From a capital perspective, leasehold improvements and equipment are supported by a combination of shareholders equity and subordinated debt for both economic and regulatory capital purposes.

Capital management 13.1 Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held through an ESOP trust are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Ordinary shares 3 3 Ordinary shares have a par value of 3 7 US cents per share 31 March 2011: 3 7 US cents per share and represent 99.9% of issued share capital.
All issued shares are fully paid.
The shares have attached to them full voting, dividend and capital distribution including on wind up rights.
They do not confer any rights of redemption.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at general meetings.
A holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote per ordinary share held when a vote is taken on a poll and one vote only when a vote is taken on a show of hands.
There are restrictions in place on the transfer of some ordinary shares and further information on this can be found within the Directors Report on page 103.
During the nine month period to 31 December 2011, the Company repurchased 66,176,820 31 March 2011: nil ordinary shares, equivalent to 3.51% of the issued share capital for a total consideration of $143 million.
A further 3,332,756 ordinary shares have been purchased since the period end for a total consideration of $7 million.
All of the shares repurchased to date have been cancelled.
As at 1 March 2012, the Company had an unexpired authority from the 2011 Annual General Meeting AGM, to purchase further shares up to a maximum amount of 119,027,239 ordinary shares.
A resolution to allow the purchase of 181,808,638 ordinary shares, representing 10% of the issued share capital will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Deferred sterling shares Unlisted deferred sterling shares, representing 0.1% of the Companys issued share capital of 50,000, with a par value of 1 per share were issued following the redenomination of the ordinary share capital into ordinary shares of 18 US cents each.
These shares are necessary to continue to comply with Section 763 of the Companies Act 2006.
The deferred sterling shares are freely transferable and have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting and no right to participate in any distribution in a winding up except for a return of the nominal value in certain circumstances.
Authorised share capital The Companies Act 2006 abolished the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital, subject to the company having removed references to authorised capital from the articles of association.
