com Operating review: Copper continued 48 Market Rened copper production Copper prices rose to record highs of $4.60 per pound in February kt due to robust demand before growing uncertainty and weakening 20,000 macroeconomic conditions led to softer prices later in the year.
Prices fell to a low point of $3.08 per pound in early October before steadily regaining ground into early 2012.
Market volatility persisted throughout 17,500 the year as investor reaction to economic developments increased price uctuations.
The average LME cash copper price rose by 17% or 58 per pound to an average of $4.00 per pound over the period.

Global copper exchange stocks reached a high of 684,000 tonnes in March.
However, severe disruptions to mine supply in the second half, along with renewed Chinese 10,000 buying caused a sharp decline in stocks.

In Western markets, copper demand held rm on 2010 levels despite the Global copper demand continued to grow despite uncertain macroeconomic combined impact of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the weak US conditions in 2011 and rose by around 3%.
China accounted for more than economy and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.

Domestic Chinese consumption grew throughout the supply chain helped to limit any decline in demand and rm strongly in spite of weakening export markets and government efforts to demand from the power sector in the US and Germany partly countered control high ination.
Demand was largely met from inventory during the first universally weak construction markets.
Southern Europe was worst affected half of the year, limiting spot cathode purchases.
However, as inventories were by the sovereign debt crisis and demand from the region weakened exhausted and copper prices softened, Chinese buyers re-entered the market considerably, particularly during the second half.
and rened cathode imports surged during the fourth quarter to an average Global copper mine supply endured another year of extreme disruption and of 340,000 tonnes per month, compared with an average of 198,000 tonnes underperformance, resulting in an estimated one million tonnes of lost output.

In total, China imported 2.65 million Many of the worlds largest copper mines suffered heavy losses due to a tonnes of rened copper in 2011, 8% less than in 2010, with the shortfall combination of low grades, lengthy labour disputes, technical difficulties and offset by increased domestic rened production as well as inventory weather-related disruptions, while new projects experienced lengthy ramp-up drawdowns.
End-use demand in China softened somewhat during the final periods, further constraining output.
Overall, global mine supply recorded its months of the year as a result of government policies to control ination.
weakest performance since 2002, growing by less than 1% year-on-year.
Some of the shortfall in mine supply was offset by stronger secondary copper Rened copper consumption production during the first half of the year, as high copper prices encouraged kt copper scrap generation and usage.
However, the scrap market tightened 20,000 later in the year as economic conditions weakened, limiting secondary output during the fourth quarter.
17,500 In the first half of the year, the spot concentrates market was dominated by the impact of the Japanese tsunami on smelter production, which drove spot treatment and rening charges to high levels and resulted in a mid-year 15,000 benchmark settlement of $85 per tonne and 8.5 per pound.
However, growing rates of mine supply disruption during the second half tightened the market and generated a sharp decline in spot treatment and rening charges 12,500 below $20 per tonne and 2 per pound.
In the 2012 annual concentrate contract negotiations, multiple settlements have been agreed for annual contracts within a range of $60-65 per tonne and 6-6.5 per pound rather 10,000 than a single benchmark level as in previous years.
The range of settlements 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 represents a modest increase on the 2011 benchmark of $56 per tonne and Q Global copper consumption 5.6 per pound.
Outlook While the global macroeconomic outlook for 2012 remains uncertain and demand in Western markets is likely to continue to be influenced by concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis and lower growth, China is again likely to drive consumption growth.
We expect Chinese demand to grow strongly as the government relaxes its policies aimed at cooling the economy and controlling ination.
Copper mine supply is likely to recover from 2011 levels, as a number of new mine projects and expansions are commissioned, although the potential for disruption, underperformance and project delays remains high.

com Operating review: Copper continued North Queensland copper mining operations, comprising the Mount Isa and 50 Ernest Henry mines, produced 249,100 tonnes of copper in concentrate, a 7% improvement over 2010.
At Ernest Henry, mining operations reached the final high grade ore zone of the open pit and copper in concentrate production increased by 34%.
We successfully commissioned the magnetite plant at Ernest Henry in the first quarter of 2011 and sold a total of 258,700 tonnes of contained magnetite metal between June and December.
This was partially offset by lower production at Mount Isa operations, where output decreased by 6% to 148,800 tonnes, as a result of restricted access to some areas due to localised geotechnical issues and planned major maintenance activities.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, we successfully commenced initial underground mine production at Ernest Henry, marking the sites transition from the open pit to underground mining.
Our Mount Isa smelter produced a record 237,700 tonnes of anode, an improvement of 11% on 2010.
The Townsville renery produced 276,500 tonnes of cathode from a mixture of North Queensland mined production and Altonorte anode, a 4% decrease compared to 2010, primarily due to a temporary plant shutdown after a severe tropical cyclone in North Queensland in February.
Ernest Henry mine, Australia Canada We successfully commissioned the magnetite plant at Ernest Henry mine We achieved $438 million operating profit at our Canadian operations, a 55% in the first quarter of 2011. improvement over the previous year.
Our profitability in Canada continued to benefit from the decision in 2010 to close the Kidd metallurgical site, along with stronger commodity prices, improved treatment charges, higher metal recoveries and lower unit energy costs and cost savings across all sites.
This improvement was partially offset by reduced production at Kidd mine, Operations lower output from the Horne smelter, and a stronger Canadian dollar relative Argentina to the US dollar.
Minera Alumbreras operating profit decreased by 18% to $546 million compared to the previous year, largely due to lower sales volumes as a result of declining head grades.
Higher commodity prices, real unit cost savings, favourable exchange rates, lower depreciation and lower export tax payments partially offset the impact of reduced volumes and inationary pressures.
Copper in concentrate production decreased by 17% to 116,700 tonnes compared to the previous year, primarily as a result of lower head grades and associated reduced recoveries.
Geotechnical issues experienced in 2010 restricted access to the pits high grade zones and resulted in lower grade stockpiled ore being processed and reduced mined ore volumes.
We partially offset this by increasing throughput with improvements to the grinding and pebbles circuit.
Total gold production decreased by 12% compared to 2010 to 356,000 ounces for the same reasons.
Australia Operating profit for the North Queensland copper division increased by 17% to $842 million, due to higher commodity prices and increased gold and copper volumes, offset by unfavourable exchange rates and depreciation impacts.
Horne smelter, Canada We achieved $438 million operating profit at our Canadian operations, a 55% improvement over the previous year.
com Strategic review Performance review Governance Financial statements Our share of copper production decreased by 10% to 199,400 tonnes 51 compared to 2010 mainly due to planned lower mill head grades and associated lower recoveries, together with decreased throughput caused by abnormally high rainfall in the first quarter, heavy snow in July and a conveyor belt failure that impacted feed to the plant for 18 days in September.
Lomas Bayas Our Lomas Bayas open pit mine generated an operating profit of $205 million, a 3% decrease on the previous year, despite higher realised copper prices and improved volumes.
Fuel and energy price ination, combined with adverse currency movements, outweighed a positive operational performance.
The first stage of the Fortuna pit development Lomas II project enabled us to increase cathode production by 3% to 73,600 tonnes.
Improved water and acid supply and equipment availability also contributed to the increase in cathode production and offset slightly lower heap leach grades.
Altonorte Altonortes operating profit of $81 million was a significant turnaround on the previous years operating loss of $15 million, driven by a strong operating performance, increased recoveries, higher acid prices and improved treatment and rening charges.
This was partially offset by inationary pressures, driven Cathode storage yard at our Lomas Bayas mine in Chile principally by increased fuel, oxygen and energy costs.
The expansion at Lomas Bayas will extend the mine life by more than 10 years to 2024 and is on track to commission in the second half We achieved a record level of concentrate throughput at our Altonorte of 2012. custom smelter of over 1 million tonnes, a 5% improvement on 2010, primarily achieved by improving equipment availability.
Copper anode production rose by 12% to 311,000 tonnes.
We produced 42,300 tonnes of copper in concentrate production at our Kidd mine, 19% less than the previous year as a result of lower copper head grades and lower mined volumes due to restricted access caused by two seismic events in the second half of the year.
Zinc in concentrate production at 71,500 tonnes was 17% lower than the previous year for the same reasons.
The Horne smelter produced 187,400 tonnes of copper anodes, a 4% decrease compared to the previous year due to operational issues as the smelter adapted to a change to the feed stream and a scheduled shutdown.
The volume of recycled material processed by the Horne smelter rose by 5% to 113,000 tonnes.
Our CCR renery produced 264,000 tonnes of copper cathodes, a 4% decrease compared to the previous year due to lower anode supply from the Horne smelter.
Chile Collahuasi Our 44% share in Collahuasi generated an operating profit of $814 million, 23% lower than in 2010 mainly as a result of reduced sales volumes and additional freight costs.
The successful implementation of a contingency plan that included shipping copper concentrate via the Arica, Iquique and Antofagasta ports ensured the December 2010 Patache Port shiploader failure did not impact sales volumes, but increased freight costs compared to 2010.
