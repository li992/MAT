In the case of Options or Performance Share Awards, such Awards will become exercisable or immediately vest as the case may be based on the extent to which the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met or are likely to be met.
The number of shares subject to all relevant Awards shall be pro-rated down to re ect the reduced service period.
