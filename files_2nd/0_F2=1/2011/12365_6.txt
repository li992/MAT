On the other hand, the worlds gold and silver resources are characterised by declining grades, with increased complexity in mining and processing of ores as the higher quality resources are depleted worldwide.
Success in this environment therefore depends, to a large extent, on our ability to increase the resource base and production volumes, whilst simultaneously maintaining tight control of capital spending and operating costs.
We have developed a business model that enables us to achieve these objectives, and which has demonstrated its effectiveness as the Group has evolved.
We are strongly committed to this model, and are confident that it will enable us to continue delivering growth and value.

All these core elements are supported by exemplary governance.
Read more on page 14 Focusing on high-grade assets We also have a preference for open-pit mining unless higher grades justify underground development.
Grades and mining conditions are the key cost factors that drive return on invested capital in the precious metals industry.
By setting appropriate thresholds on head grades and focusing on open-pit mines we are achieving better returns from our project portfolio.

It comprises an open-pit converted into a hub processing ore mine and a new flotation from four operating mines.
We believe this model provides us with several key advantages, including: allowing the Group to bring small and medium-size deposits into production by sharing processing plants and other infrastructure.
The development of standalone operations at such deposits is typically uneconomic: providing the Group with benefits in terms of capital expenditure and operating costs, with larger processing plants enjoying higher productivity and energy efficiency, as well as a smaller footprint per unit of capacity: and allowing the Group to use high calibre staff from its existing processing plants.
The Groups processing plant employees are generally better qualified and are therefore typically more difficult to recruit, train and retain than mining personnel.
We intend to create additional processing hubs in the future.
We will also review acquisition opportunities near our existing hubs and standalone mines, with a view to creating additional synergies through leveraging the existing processing facilities.
