References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to both IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
No reconciliation to US GAAP is included in the financial statements in accordance with a rule adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission accepting financial statements from foreign private issuers prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB without that reconciliation.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except that biological assets and certain financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The critical accounting policies, which the directors consider are of greater complexity and or particularly subject to the exercise of judgement, are set out under Critical accounting policies in the Business review section of this Annual Report.
Basis for preparation of financial statements on a going concern basis Information on the business environment that the group operates in, the groups strategy and the principal risk factors that the group faces is contained in the Business review.
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, borrowings, borrowing facilities, commitments and the groups policies to manage its financial risk are described in the Business review under Liquidity and capital resources, Contractual obligations and Risk management.
Further information is disclosed in notes 21, 22 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
At 30 June 2011 the group has cash and cash equivalents of 1,584 million and committed bank facilities of 2,174 million, with borrowings and bank overdrafts due within one year of 1,447 million.
The group owns a diverse portfolio of beverage alcohol assets and operates in numerous countries around the world.
The group also has a wide diversity of customers and suppliers.
The directors believe that the group is well positioned to manage its business and financial risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Business combination The consolidated financial statements include the results of the company and its subsidiaries together with the groups attributable share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the income statement up to, or from, the date that control passes.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by Diageo plc.
Control is the power to govern the operating and financial policies of the subsidiary so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On the acquisition of a business, or of an interest in an associate or joint venture, fair values, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition, are attributed to the net assets including identifiable intangible assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
Adjustments to fair values include those made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the group.
Sales Sales comprise revenue from the sale of goods, royalties receivable and rents receivable.
Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise and other duties which the group pays as principal but excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as value added tax.
Sales are recognised depending upon individual customer terms at the time of despatch, delivery or some other specified point when the risk of loss transfers.
Provision is made for returns where appropriate.
Sales are stated net of price discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and certain promotional activities and similar items.
Advertising and promotion costs Advertising costs, point of sale materials and sponsorship payments are charged to operating profit when the company has a right of access to the goods or services acquired.
Research and development Research expenditure in respect of new drinks products and package design is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Any subsequent development expenditure in the period leading up to product launch that meets the recognition criteria set out in the relevant standard is capitalised.
If capitalised, any intangible asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit.
Share-based payments employee benefits The fair value of equity settled share options and share grants is initially measured at grant date based on the binomial or Monte Carlo models and is charged in the income statement over the vesting period.
For equity settled shares the credit is included in retained earnings in equity whereas for cash settled share-based payments a liability is recognised in the balance sheet, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
For cash settled share options and share grants, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, with any changes in the fair value recognised in the income statement.
Cancellations of share options are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised Diageo Annual Report 2011 118 Financial statements in operating profit immediately.
Shares of Diageo plc held by the company for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share plans around the group are deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Any surplus or deficit arising on the sale of the Diageo plc shares held by the group is included as a movement in equity.
Pensions and other post employment benefits The groups principal pension funds are defined benefit plans.
In addition, the group has defined contribution plans, unfunded post employment medical benefit liabilities and other unfunded defined benefit post employment liabilities.
For defined benefit plans, the amount charged in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus any fully vested benefit improvements granted to members by the group during the year.
The income statement also includes a credit equivalent to the groups expected return on the pension plans assets over the year, offset by a charge equal to the expected increase in the plans liabilities over the year.
The difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the present value of the plans liabilities is disclosed as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
Any differences between the expected return on assets and those Financial statements actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are 111 recognised in other comprehensive income.
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised on the balance sheet is limited to any Auditors report in future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan.

Government grants Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the group will comply with the conditions pursuant to which they have been granted and that the grants will be received.
Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the asset that they relate to and reduce the depreciation expense charged to the income statement.
Leases Where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in other financial liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Lease payments are apportioned between interest expense and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Other leases are treated as operating leases, with payments and receipts taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Biological assets Grape cultivation by the groups wine business is accounted for as an agricultural activity.
Accordingly, the groups biological assets grape vines and grapes on the vine are carried at fair value which, in the absence of third party valuations, is computed on the basis of a discounted cash flow calculation.
Agricultural produce harvested grapes is valued at market value on transfer into inventory.
Associates and joint ventures An associate is an undertaking in which the group has a long term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence.
The groups interest in the net assets of associates is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the consolidated income statement below the groups operating profit.
Investments in associates are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The impairment review compares the net carrying value with the recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is the value in use calculated as the present value of the groups share of the associates future cash flows or its fair market value.
Joint ventures, where there is contractual joint control over the entity, are accounted for by including on a line-by-line basis the attributable share of the results, assets and liabilities.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and expenses, an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads, but not borrowing costs.
Cost is calculated on an actual usage basis for maturing inventories and on a first in, first out basis for other inventories.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their net book value is expected to be recovered through sale rather than continuing use.
This condition is only met when the sale is highly probable and the non-current asset, or disposal group, is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the fair value less selling costs and net book value.
Financial assets Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal amount which is usually the original invoiced amount less any provisions made for bad and doubtful receivables.
Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience.
Individual trade receivables are provided against when management deems them not to be fully collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less at acquisition, including money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Financial liabilities Borrowings are initially measured at cost, which is equal to fair value at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the settlement or redemption amount is recognised over the term of the borrowing using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value adjustments for all loans designated as hedged items in a fair value hedge are disclosed, as a net figure, separately.
The fair value adjustment is calculated using a discounted cash flow technique based on market data applied consistently for similar types of instruments.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Diageo Annual Report 2011 120 Financial statements Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value that is calculated using a discounted cash flow technique based on market data applied consistently for similar types of instruments.
Gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are taken to the income statement as they arise.
The purpose of hedge accounting is to mitigate the impact of potential volatility in the income statement due to changes in exchange or interest rates, by matching the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the income statement.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
At the inception of the transaction, the group documents the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions.
The group also documents its assessment, at hedge inception and at least on a quarterly basis, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been, and are likely to continue to be, effective in Financial statements offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
111 The group designates derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting as either: a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset Auditors report in or liability fair value hedge : b a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash flow risk from a change in exchange or interest rates cash respect of the Group flow hedge : or c a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
112 The method of recognising the resulting gains or losses from movements in fair values is dependent on whether the derivative Consolidated contract is designated to hedge a specific risk and qualifies for hedge accounting.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, along with any statement of changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.
If such a hedge relationship is fide-designated, fair value comprehensive movements on the derivative continue to be taken to the income statement while any fair value adjustments made to the underlying income hedged item to that date are amortised through the income statement over its remaining life using the effective interest rate method.
114 Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable future foreign currency cash flows, as well as the Consolidated balance sheet cash flow risk from changes in exchange or interest rates.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedges is recognised in other 115 comprehensive income, while any ineffective part is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in other comprehensive Consolidated income are recycled to the income statement in the same period in which the underlying foreign exchange or interest exposure affects statement of the income statement.
