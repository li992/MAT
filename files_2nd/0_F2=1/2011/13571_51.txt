Andrew Heath President Energy 24 Business review Energy Significant demand for our products and services in offshore oil and gas applications drove a 57 per cent increase in the order intake to 1.5 billion, as the order book increased 28 per cent.
Revenue declined by three per cent, largely due to the phasing of OE delivery in the power generation business.
Demand for aftermarket products and services continued to grow strongly, with an increase of 1,199m ten per cent over 2010.
Underlying revenue 2011 Profit fell by 11 per cent to 24 million as a result of a change in revenue mix and the additional charges incurred to develop the civil nuclear business and our options in tidal and fuel cells.
This was despite the benefit of the non-recurring industrial Trent retrofit charges incurred in 2010.

Power generation The power generation sector remains suppressed in the developed world, the traditional market for the Trent gas turbine, which resulted in three new Trent unit orders.
Demand for Bergen reciprocating engines remains strong, reflected by an order intake of 50 units, of which 30 are for Bangladesh to help address the countrys power shortfalls, bringing total Bergen engines orders in Bangladesh to 82.
Services Demand for aftermarket products and services again grew strongly, delivering revenue of 597 million, an increase of ten per cent over 2010.
Including the land-based reciprocating engines, there are now a total of 701 units, or 35 per cent of the engine fleet, under long-term service agreements.
In 2012, we will launch the RB211 Gzero, an aftermarket upgrade product for the RB211-G gas generator that increases power by a nominal ten per cent.
Six RB211 gas turbine sets provide 100MW for this floating production, storage and offloading unit.
