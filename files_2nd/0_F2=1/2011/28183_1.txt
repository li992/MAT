About Your Company Highlights 01 The shift to cloud computing represents nothing less than the industry transitioning to a mass production model.
Standardisation is making it possible to deliver a more monolithic, easily automated form of IT that should dramatically reduce the cost of computing.
Just as Henry Fords production line drove mass adoption of the automobile, vastly cheaper computing and unprecedented flexibility associated with public clouds should significantly expand the reach of the IT industry.
However, this dynamic is likely to take its toll on incumbents as they are forced to contend with lower prices and greater competition.
With 10% of IT workloads already running in the cloud, we believe we are at or approaching an inflection point.
Just as the skyscraper changed the skyline so we expect the cloud and the mass production model it delivers to change the IT industry beyond recognition over the coming years.
