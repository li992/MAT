The investment universe is defined at the time of purchase by the countries and market capitalisation range of the constituents of the benchmark index, the HSBC Smaller European Companies ex UK Index.
At the end of March 2011 the index consisted of 1,000 companies with a market value of between 54 million and 3 billion across 15 countries.
This universe of potential investments is screened using a proprietary multi-factor model, to the results of which we apply fundamental analysis.
The Jim Campbell investment process is focussed on identifying growth companies with strong operational momentum and value companies with a catalyst for re-rating which have the potential to outperform the market on a sustainable basis.
The portfolio is constructed within a framework where risk is managed, in terms of investment style factors, relative to the benchmark index.
Investments are sold when there is a fundamental negative change in business prospects, the valuation is regarded as excessive or the market capitalisation has outgrown significantly the benchmark index.
The policy is not to hedge the currency exposure of the portfolios assets.
The Board has established a liquidity range of 20% cash to 20% gearing within which the Investment Managers may operate.
Market Review Francesco Conte The financial year to 31st March 2011 started poorly for financial markets, as the European periphery deficit crisis reached a climax.
The Euro, which had traded as high as 1.51 US$ in November 2009, reached 1.19 US$ by June 2010, with some even questioning its future viability.
While periphery problems would continue to afflict markets, a realisation that the weak Euro was making core Europe, namely Germany and its surrounding neighbours which account for the vast majority of European GDP, even more competitive, in conjunction with Germanys willingness to provide financial support to the afflicted countries, improved sentiment on European stockmarkets and towards the Euro.
Strong exports from European companies into robust demand from emerging markets and, to a lesser extent, the US led to very strong reporting quarters in June and September of 2010.
This, coupled with the US Federal Reserve announcing that it would undertake a second round of quantitative easing, saw markets rally strongly for much of the remainder of the financial year, despite Greece, Ireland and then Portugal asking for economic support from the EU and the IMF.
In the twelve months to 31st March 2011 the large company MSCI Europe ex UK Index returned 7.1% in sterling.
Sustained appetite for risk led to another year of outperformance by the HSBC Smaller European Companies Index which rose by 14.8%.
Portfolio Performance The net asset value of the Company increased by 21.7% over the year, somewhat ahead of returns from both the benchmark smaller company HSBC Index and the large company MSCI Index.
The decision to maintain a geared position in a rising market was again one of the key positive contributors to performance.

Portfolio Positioning Industrial engineering became the portfolios largest overweight sector relative to the benchmark index thanks to a strong performance from such holdings as Austrian process engineer Andritz and the addition of new holdings in French logistics vehicle producer Manitou and Swiss industrial products manufacturer Georg Fischer.
The key sector shift in the portfolio was a move from a significant underweight to significant overweight position in the recovering financial services and life insurance sectors with new investments in asset managers Azimut in Italy and GAM Holding, Helvetia Holding and Swiss Life in Switzerland.
A view that best of the early cycle recovery had already been seen in media and retail led to the disposal of holdings in TV operators ProSiebenSat.

As illustrated below, it is clear that revisions to earnings forecasts, shown on the left hand scale, are typically negative as analysts start the year overly optimistic then have to downgrade as the year unfolds.
Nevertheless, for the index to make progress, as indicated on the right hand scale, it is normally sufficient that the rate of downgrade should be less than around 8%.
Following a sharp improvement in the momentum of earnings revisions in the last two years, we are currently in the unusual position where analysts are not, on average, downgrading their estimates for corporate profitability.

Smaller companies in Europe have enjoyed a period of strong performance over the last two years and, on a price to book basis, now trade at a comparable valuation to that of large companies.
As shown below, this is towards the top end of the range in which they have traded over the last twenty years.
Nevertheless, as can also be seen below, smaller companies are cheap on an absolute basis, currently being valued towards the bottom end of the historic range of 1.5 2.5x book value.

Many of the concerns which typically arise midway through a cycle are present.
As we write, commodity prices have gone into sharp reversal, raising questions over the speed of the global recovery.
Published inflation numbers are higher than estimated but it is still not certain whether it is structural or whether it is temporary with important implications on the outlook for interest rates.
A key question remains as to whether the peripheral crisis is over, with Portugal being the last country to require funding, or whether it will spread to Spain and ultimately Italy.
While global growth may be moderating, it is still healthy: the US economy is performing well, core Europe is recovering adequately, even with Eurozone countries making a concerted effort to cut budget deficits, and growth in emerging markets remains robust.
Corporate earnings are recovering well and order intakes during the first quarter of 2011 have been strong, with the result that consensus earnings revisions remain positive.
While inflation is undoubtedly rising, the perceived fragility of the recovery is likely to ensure continued relaxed monetary policies.
As far as the periphery is concerned, we believe that Spain, and with a higher conviction Italy, are decoupling from the other members of the periphery, as bond yield spreads seem to be suggesting.
At this stage of the cycle it is normal to have a pause in the markets coupled with substantial sector rotation, typically for a period of three to six months.
Therefore, the level of gearing in the portfolio has been significantly reduced in order to have the investment capacity to redeploy it once this process has run its course.
As always our challenge is to pick the most appropriate stocks given the prevailing economic environment.
