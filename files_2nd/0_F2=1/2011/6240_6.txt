Of the estimated 1,064.4 million ounces of silver produced 2010: 2,709 tonnes globally in 2011, the bulk was derived as a by-product from base metals and gold mining 69%, and less than 31% from primary silver mines.
Total mine production has risen notably in recent yearsfollowing significant investment made earlier in the cycle andstrong prices that encourage producers to maximise production.
The Silver Institutes Survey prepared by Thomson Silver mine production Reuters Gold Fields Mineral Services indicates silver mine output increased from 736moz in 2010 to 784moz in 2011, with production 784.1moz 7% expected to continue to climb in 2012 by a similar magnitude.

In 2011 gold mine production increased by 3.8% over 2010, and central banks were net buyers of the metal.
Global gold production million ounces While investment in exploration has increased to meet the 2,800 continued rise in demand, there have been no new large-scale discoveries of silver or gold and exploration has become increasingly 2,600 dependent on junior companies.
Furthermore, the discovery process has grown more challenging because of regulatory requirements 2,400 and the need to go farther and search harder every year, often in remote, unstable or insecure areas of the world.

Silver price Global silver production tonnes The price of silver started 2011 at US$30.7 per ounce and soared as high as US$50 per ounce before experiencing a correction that took 1,000 it back below $30.
The average price in the year was US$35.1 per 900 ounce, 74.4% higher than in 2010, attributable to inflationary pressures, 800 a weakening dollar and emerging market demand.
Continued uncertainty about economic growth in the United States and Europe 700 and a potential deceleration in China, combined with geopolitical 600 tensions, is likely to provide continued price support for silver.

In Mexico, that shortage extends to exploration activities and 800 miningoperations and to the availability of competent and reliable contractors.
Global capital expenditure on mining has also resulted 400 in shortages of equipment and consumables, generating additional 07 08 09 10 11 industry-wide cost pressures to those discussed below.
Other cost pressures Global silver price US$ oz 35 As extraction and production have accelerated to meet demand, 30 mineral deposit grades are declining, requiring a higher volume 25 ofore to be processed in order to meet and exceed production 20 targets.
At the same time energy costs, a key component of the 15 cost structure, have risen, as have treatment and rening charges.
10 5 Governmental actions 07 08 09 10 11 Global mining companies have been subject to a range of new Source: LBMA taxes, royalties, laws and regulations by the governments of the countries where they operate.
Mining taxes have recently been implemented in several Latin American countries including Chile and Peru, and some Mexican legislators have proposed similar initiatives, although to date not successfully.
The Mexican mining industry, through the Mining Chamber, will continue to petition against any mining tax as it affects employment creation, direct foreign and local investment, and the industrys ability to compete.
Country environment: Mexico Mexico provides a favourable environment for mining: exible and well-structured mining and environmental legislation: a favourable political climate: strong mining tradition and expertise: a skilled workforce, currently in high demand due to increased mining andexploration activity in the sector: and solid infrastructure.
The geological potential remains strong, and more than 300 mining companies and private exploration groups have projects and facilities in Mexico, with operations concentrated in the northern states of Durango, Sonora, Zacatecas and Chihuahua.
Mining is an important contributor to the countrys economy, accounting for approximately 1.6% of GDP, and 286,000 direct jobs.
As such the industry benets from a well-structured and supportive regulatory and scal framework.
Security in Mexico has continued to deteriorate as drug cartels seekto control access routes to the United States, abetted by weak control in the ow of weapons across the border.
While we believe media reporting has exaggerated the extent of the security threat, we recognise the potential risk to our business and have put in place policies and procedures to protect our personnel, operations andassets.
The security situation has had no significant impact onthe Groups performance or production, although the measures we have taken do influence the way we operate and explore SeeOurRisk Management Framework pages 3643.
