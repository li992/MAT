Contributions cannot be added together, as they are geometric: for example, to calculate how a return of 4.1% against a comparative index return of 11.2% translates into a relative return of 8.0%, divide the portfolio return of 95.9 by the comparative index return of 88.8 and subtract one.
Asset allocation includes the contribution attributable to currency movements.
Equities includes convertibles and warrants.
