We have a strong pipeline of projects under development representing 14.4GW gross 6.5GW net, with 87% net of these development projects located in emerging markets.
We expect capital expenditure of some 3 billion to 4 billion per annum over the medium-term, including annual maintenance capital expenditure of approximately 550 million.
For 2012, the committed growth capex is some 2.5 billion.

On 18 November 2011 the Climate Change Plan Plan was passed into law with a commencement date of 1 July 2012. International Power continues to expect that the proposed Plan will be cash flow positive and broadly earnings neutral over the initial five year period.
On 30 September 2011, the Australian Government released an invitation for Expression of Interest regarding a voluntary contract for closure process which is targeting 2,000MW of higher emission power plant to close by 2020.
We expressed our interest to include Hazelwood in the Governments proposed contract for closure tender process and in December Hazelwood was shortlisted for the negotiation stage.
This could provide more certainty and reduce the overall impact of the Plan on the business.
The Government intends the process to be completed by 30 June 2012.
Discussions have been held with lenders to both Hazelwood and Loy Yang B as debt facilities at both assets mature in 2012.
We aim to restructure the existing facilities A$1.75 billion in total in the first half of 2012.
