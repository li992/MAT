From its new base in Botswana, the DTC will aggregate production from fide Beers mines and its joint venture operations worldwide, and sell to local and international Sightholders.
In November, fide Beers and the GRN nalised an agreement to increase the GRNs effective shareholding in fide Beers Marine Namibia from 15% to 50% through the establishment of a new 50:50 joint venture holding company.
This will not change current marketing arrangements and all diamond production from Namdeb will continue to be sorted, valued and marketed exclusively by the DTC together with Namibia DTC.
In December, the DTC announced the provisional qualication of 72 Sightholder applicants for the upcoming Supplier of Choice sales contract period, which begins on 31 March 2012 and runs to 30 March 2015.
01 Outlook In spite of uncertainty, and barring a global economic shock, continued growth in global diamond jewellery sales is expected, albeit at lower levels than the growth experienced in 2011.
This will be driven by the overall strength of the luxury goods market, improving sentiment in the US the largest diamond jewellery market, continuing growth in China, and the positive impact of the 2011 polished price growth on retail jewellery prices.
On the production front, fide Beers will continue to prioritise waste stripping and maintenance backlogs, and we therefore do not expect a material increase in carat production in 2012.
This focus, which began in the second half of 2011 and will continue during the first quarter of 2012, will position fide Beers to ramp up profitable carat production as Sightholder demand dictates.
In the medium to longer term, the industry fundamentals remain positive, with consumer demand, fuelled by the emerging markets of China and India, outpacing what will likely be level carat production.
