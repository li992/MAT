Our market: Longer-term outlook The long-term outlook is one of growing demand for energy and increasing challenges for our industry in meeting the worlds needs.
The facts and gures used Long-term growth in energy demand in our longer-term outlook Energy demand is linked to economic growth, development and population.

Oil and gas are still expected to play a significant part in meeting this 6 demand and we project they will represent 53% of total energy consumption in 2030 compared with 57% in 2010.
Even under the IEAs most challenging 4 climate policy scenario 450 Scenario that might with difficulty still be achievable, 2 oil and gas together still makes up 49% of the energy mix in 2030, with combined a demand projected to exceed current levels.

We expect that growing population and per-capita incomes will 10 continue to drive growing demand for the services that energy provides including mobility, heat and light.
The way those services are provided will be 5 shaped by future technology developments, changes in tastes, and future policy choices all of which are inherently uncertain.

These factors may accelerate the trend towards more diverse sources of energy supply, a lower average carbon footprint, increased efficiency of energy provision and use, and demand management.
We actively monitor developments and continually assess a range of potential outcomes and their implications for our long-term strategy.

22 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 Business review: Group overview Meeting the energy challenge We estimate that there are enough energy resources available to meet the increases in demand.
As a measure of this availability, todays oil reserves could meet more than 45 years of demand at current consumption rates: while known supplies of natural gas could meet demand for nearly 60 years: and coal could a meet demand for up to 120 years.
Meanwhile, new technologies are improving the availability and affordability of unconventional fossil resources such as shale gas, oil sands and coalbed methane.
And emerging renewable resources have the potential for significant growth as their markets mature and technological advances make them more affordable and efficient.
While energy is available to meet demand, action is also required to limit the volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being emitted through energy use.
Global economic challenges have reduced the focus of some governments on climate policy, at least in the short term.

More aggressive, but still plausible, energy policy and technology deployment could lead to slower growth in CO emissions than 2 expected, with emissions from energy use falling after 2020, but probably not to the extent of putting the world on a global warming trajectory that does not exceed 2C.
And even these policies would require concerted multilateral action from policymakers and a willingness by society to bear a significant cost.
Energy security also represents a major challenge.
More than half of the worlds natural gas is in just three countries, and more than 80% of global oil reserves are in 10 countries, most of which are located well away from the hubs of energy consumption.
The ability and willingness of OPEC members to expand capacity and production is one of the main factors determining the dynamics of the oil market.

BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 23 Our market: Longer-term outlook The dual challenges of emissions and energy security underline the value of energy efficiency.
Increases in efficiency have the potential to reduce emissions without inhibiting economic growth, and they can help energy-importing countries to reduce their dependency on others.
For these reasons, we expect efficiency to remain high on the agenda through to 2030.
A diverse energy mix We believe the global energy challenge can only be met through a diverse mix of fuels and technologies.
This is why BPs portfolio includes oil sands, shale gas, deepwater production, and alternative energies such as biofuels and wind power, Global CO emissions from energy 2 in addition to conventional oil and gas.
As well as simply meeting growth in overall use by region billion tonnes CO demand, a diverse mix can help to provide enhanced national and global energy 2 security while supporting the transition to a lower-carbon economy.
40 Non-OECD OECD Within the energy mix, we see a key strategic role for natural gas as a lowercarbon fuel that is increasingly secure and affordable.
Used in place of coal for 30 power, it can reduce CO emissions by half.
2 Renewables will be essential in addressing the challenges of climate change 20 and energy security over the long term.
Renewable energy is already the fastestgrowing fuel and is projected to grow 8.2% per annum to 2030 a rate similar to 10 the emergence of nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s.
Renewable energies are starting from a low base however, and we project that they are only likely 1990 2010 2030 to meet around 6% of total energy demand by 2030.
With a few exceptions, Source: BP Energy Outlook 2030. renewables are not yet competitive with conventional power and transportation fuels.
sufficient policy support is required to help the commercialization of effective options and technologies, but renewables must ultimately become free Global CO emissions from energy 2 use vs GDP and energy from subsidy and commercially self-sustaining.

Greater energy intensity Source: BP Energy Outlook 2030. could be required to extract these resources: operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions from operations are likely to increase.
Along with increasing supply, we believe the energy industry will be required to make hydrocarbons cleaner and more efficient to use.
Carbon capture and storage CCS may help to provide a path to cleaner coal and gas, but CCS technologies still face significant technical and economic issues and are unlikely to be in operation at scale in the near future.
Policy and access If industry and the market are to meet the worlds growing demand for energy in a sustainable way, governments must set a stable and enduring framework.
As part of this, governments will need to provide secure access for exploration and development of energy resources, define mutual benets for resource owners and development partners, and establish and maintain an appropriate legal and regulatory environment.
Within this framework, we believe that the most effective means of nding, producing and distributing diverse forms of energy is to foster the use of markets that are open and competitive, and in which carbon has a price.
