08 Westgate Centre, Oxford Some might question why we have acquired 50% of the Westgate Centre in Oxford.
Although the city is relatively small, its one of the most af uent locations in the UK and hosts thousands of students and visitors.
Its also signi cantly under-served in terms of great retail.
So we see all sorts of opportunities to create a shopping destination thats as smart as its surroundings.
