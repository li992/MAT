Pensions The Group operates both a defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new entrants, and an occupational defined contribution arrangement.
The deficit under International Accounting Standard IAS 19 Retirement Benefits of the defined benefit scheme has decreased from 133.1 million, at 31 March 2010, to 46.0 million at 31 March 2011.
This is due to a reduction in the liabilities of the scheme 37.2 million and an increase in the value of scheme assets 49.9 million.
The valuation of the scheme liabilities has taken account of legislative changes which mean that future statutory deferred revaluations and statutory pension increases will be linked to the Consumer Price Index CPI.
As a consequence, CPI increases have been applied for deferred pensions in all sections of the scheme and to those sections where the scheme rules link increases to the Governments pension increase orders.
This has given rise to a reduction in the scheme liabilities of around 36.0 million.
