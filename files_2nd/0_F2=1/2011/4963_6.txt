In 2010 the latest gures available, the generating capacity of the UKs major power producers was some 83,200MW.
The final consumption of electricity in 2010 was approximately 330TWh.
The six large vertically integrated players have control, either through ownership or long-term contracts, of some 64% of the total generation capacity and have a combined interest of over 91% in the supply market, and over 99.5% in the domestic gas and electricity sector.
Drax has a 5% share in the generation capacity market and typically meets 7% of the UKs electricity needs.
Through our retail arm, Haven Power, we serve over 40,000 business sites, together accounting for sales of 3.3TWh Our role in the supply chain of power in 2011.
Our interests in the electricity supply chain cover the generation, wholesale and retail markets.
Generation Drax Power Station meets 7% of the UKs electricity needs and is the largest single source of renewable power in the UK.

The wholesale market operates on price and the relative prices of the fuel sources, for example, gas and coal will determine which plant, gas-red generation or coal-red generation, becomes the marginal plant.
If gas prices are high then gas-red plant operates at the margin.
With excellent reliability and availability, Drax Power Station is at the top of the merit order for UK coal-red plant and so even when coal-red plant is at the margin we will be the first of the coalred plants to be called on to generate.

However, the US has significant reserves that could enable it to become relatively self sufficient.
This could reduce its LNG requirements, freeing up more volume for the Asian and European markets depending on their relative market price.
In the longer term, other countries such as China may also exploit potentially large shale gas reserves.
