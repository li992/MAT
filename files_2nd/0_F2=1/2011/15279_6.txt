Business review Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report 2011 20 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Introduction The UK Chemical Industries Association CIA, in common with 2011 was a year which saw very significant changes for the other national associations, set the industry sustainable development Yule Catto Group with the integration of PolymerLatex from targets for its 2010 performance.

Reportable environmental incidents The use of imaginative, environmentally friendly disposal routes 30 has been so successful that for a number of Synthomers sites, the net production of waste is now zero all their waste is recovered, 40 recycled or reused.
The lessons learned by these sites are being shared with other sites in the Yule Catto Group, to reduce the 30 quantity of waste requiring final disposal still further.

The key measures suggested were energy use, emissions to air, waste disposal and water consumption, on an absolute and a per tonne basis.
Yule Catto has reported on these indicators for a number of years, and to aid transparency in environmental performance reporting Yule Catto adopted DEFRAs preferred format in 2008 for the report on our 2007 performance.
This format is used in the table below which gives the data for the period 2009 2011.
Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport.
E missions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel: and therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity.

The 2011 figures in this table are for the continuing operations.
As noted in the text 29,599 tonnes of waste transferred from a landfill on the Kluang site to a secure off-site landfill are not included in the figures.
The production of this waste was included in the figures for previous years waste arising see entries: Hazardous waste disposed on-site Disposed to on-site landfill and Non-hazardous waste disposed on-site Disposed by landfill.
