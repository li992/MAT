R E P O R T O F T H E R E M U N E R AT I O N C O M M I T T E E CONTINUED OTHER BENEFITS The Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with private medical insurance, life insurance and school fees for dependents but no other benefits in kind which would be typical in the UK, such as a company car.
In addition, both Executive Directors are entitled to housing allowances of 100,000 Anthony Buckingham and 77,500 Paul Atherton.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES At present the Committee has not established formal Executive Director shareholding guidelines as, in the opinion of the Committee, these would be superfluous at this time.
The Executive Directors hold a substantial number of shares in the Company and have interests in shares under various share incentive arrangements as shown in the table below as at 17 April 2012: Anthony Paul Buckingham Atherton Shares held 85,040,340 2,390,000 Shares vested under the 2008 Replacement Scheme yet to be exercised 9,629,510 1,625,000 Interest in shares under the LTIP schemes 915,913 678,454 Total number of shares 95,585,763 4,693,454 1 Notional value of shares at year end, 184,002,594 9,034,899 Total value as a multiple of base package 259.6 times 17.2 times 1 The full vesting of 2011 LTIP awards issued in 2011 and share options is assumed.
Cost of exercise is 14,280,199 for Anthony Buckingham and 2,833,750 for Paul Atherton, before payment of the 2010 special dividend of 100 pence per share.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS The Executive Directors service agreements with the Company are for no fixed term.
In normal circumstances, the agreements may be terminated by the Company giving no less than 24 months notice and the Director giving six months notice.
These arrangements were in place during their time as Executive Directors of HOC and were inherited by the Company.
The Board feels that these notice periods were appropriate to recruit and retain the Executive Directors although it recognises that they are not in line with current UK market practice.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Executive Director employment contracts as part of the extensive review of executive remuneration arrangements which it undertook during 2010.
After taking into account the view received from its external advisers, Hay Group, the external commercial environment, the importance of the Executive Directors to the business and the other changes proposed to the executive remuneration package including an effective reduction in cash and total remuneration levels available, the Committee has decided, for commercial reasons, to retain the existing Executive Director notice period structure.
We believe that this policy protects the interests of our shareholders in the current environment but we are committed to keeping this issue under review.
Notice period Notice period Executive Director Date of contract Unexpired term by Company by Director 1 Anthony Buckingham 28 March 2008 Rolling contract 24 months 6 months 1 Paul Atherton 28 March 2008 Rolling contract 24 months 6 months 1 The Executive Director was appointed previously as indicated on page 10 and this became effective on the Companys listing on the LSE on 28 March 2008.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, if the Executive Directors resign or the Company terminates their appointment within 24 months of such an event, they will each be entitled to an immediate payment in lieu of notice of a sum equivalent to three times their annual base package.
In addition, they will be entitled to a payment of Cdn$75,000 in the event they are asked to resign from the Board of HOC in any event other than as a result of a change of control.
The Company also may terminate the agreements and make payments in lieu of notice.
Currently the Executive Directors service contracts do not provide for mitigation in the event of early termination.
The Remuneration Committee has a duty to ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
The Executive Directors do not have service contracts with any Group subsidiary.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment.
Their terms of appointment may be terminated by each party giving three months notice in writing.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive members of the Board.
The Companys policy is to set levels for Non-Executive Directors remuneration so as to ensure that they are sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-quality Directors.
As disclosed in the 2009 Remuneration Report, fees for Non-Executive Directors were equalised at 80,000 per annum including any fees paid by HOC to those Non-Executive Directors who are also Directors of that company, excluding the fees of the Chairman of 120,000 per annum.
