Business review Operating review Voro Our lowest cost and highest margin mine Russia, Sverdlovsk Region Managing Directors: Andrey Novikov Employees: 889 Voro is one of Polymetals key assets, contributing consistent cash returns.
Located in the Sverdlovsk Region, 553 it comprises two open-pit mines Cash cost per gold equivalent ounce Voro and the smaller Degtyarskoye, in 2011, US$ oz and a newly developed mine at Fevralskoye.
This asset also has a sizeable brownfield exploration area consisting of the South Voro and 62.5% Volchansky projects.
Primary and oxidised ores are processed Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2011 at the 900 Ktpa CIP and 1 Mtpa heap leach plants.
