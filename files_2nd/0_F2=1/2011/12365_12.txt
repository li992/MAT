Business review Operating review Khakanja A key asset with underground potential Russia, Khabarovsk Territory Managing Directors: Alexander Akamov Employees: 1,071 Located in the Russian Far East, Khakanja is one of Polymetals principal assets, comprising a 128 Koz standalone gold silver open-pit Gold equivalent produced in 2011 mine and a 600 Ktpa Merrill-Crowe processing plant.
Contributing mines include the main Khakanja pit, the small Yurievskoye satellite deposit 8.3 g t and a trial mine at the AK Project see page 50 Standalone exploration Average gold equivalent grade projects for more information.
in ore mined in 2011 Ore from Sopka part of the Omolon hub was also processed at Khakanja prior to completion of refurbishmentof the Kubaka 1.3 Moz processing plant.
Gold equivalent reserves and Yurievskoye is accessible only resources by a winter road from January to April, and underground mining commenced in 2010, following the completion of open-pit operations.
7.1 g t Average gold equivalent reserve and resource grade The year ahead In 2012 we expect to deliver mining at the new satellite Ozerny production growth at Khakanja operation towards the end of as ore from higher grade mines 2012, with ore to be processed will constitute an increasing at Khakanja in 2013.
Ozerny is share of the overall supply of considerable importance to to the processing plant.
the Group, given the relatively short life of the Khakanja mine We expect to expand open-pit 2018 and the resulting potential mining at Khakanjas pit 3, to under-utilisation of the plant from commence underground mining 2015 unless new reserves are at Khakanja and to begin open-pit discovered and mined.

Gold production declined grade in ore mined declined as new port facilities at Kiran which by around one third to 84 Moz expected from 10.6 g t to 6.2 g t as will be used for transportation principally as a result of lower grades a result of the depletion of the higher of Avlayakan ore going forward.
