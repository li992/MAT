28 Cape plc Annual Report 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Performance Share Awards audited Details of the awards made under the Employee Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan are set out below.
Details of the performance conditions that have applied to PSP awards are shown on page 25.
The share price at 31 December 2011 was 328p, with the maximum and minimum share price during the financial year being 591.5p and 295p respectively.
Under the rules of the Old Cape Performance Share Plan awards can be structured as conditional awards of shares or as nil or nominal cost options.
On 28 February 2012 the Committee agreed that all existing conditional awards granted under that plan be converted to nil cost options, so as to provide participants with greater flexibility to decide when to exercise their award and acquire the shares subject to the award.
In the normal course of events, the vested option can be exercised at any time up until the day before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
Retaining awards as unexercised options was considered to, potentially, provide greater ongoing alignment with shareholders than the immediate transfer of shares to an Executive Director on vesting and places them in the same position as if the award was originally structured as a nil cost option which was within the gift of the plan.
On 8 March 2011, Martin K May exercised options over 200,000 Ordinary Shares under the EIP at a price of 269 pence per Ordinary Share and, on 8 and 9 March 2011, sold these shares for personal reasons at an average price of 496.1 pence per Ordinary Share.
