Dan Korte President Defence Aerospace 20 Business review Defence aerospace A broad and diverse base of customers and products underpinned a resilient performance in 2011.
Demand for our products and services, particularly in the military transport sector, held up well.
Revenue increased five per cent as a result of an eight per cent increase in OE revenue and a three per cent increase in services revenue.
A seven per cent decline in the order book reflects the cautious budgetary environment in many nations.
However, new orders of 1.8 billion provides continued confidence that opportunities remain, both in 2,235m traditional and in developing markets.
Underlying revenue 2011 Profit grew 22 per cent as a result of increased revenue, cost reduction and the 60 million benefit of termination settlements as a result of the UK MoDs SDSR.

The Typhoon is a contender for the KF-X programme in South Korea.
We continue to make good progress on the US Air Force Adaptive Versatile Engine Technology ADVENT demonstrator programme.
It is designed to significantly reduce fuel consumption, enabling extended mission ranges and loiter times for future generations of military aircraft.
We are a major partner in the TP400 engine for the new Airbus A400M large military transport aircraft.
