Tony Wood President Marine 22 Business review Marine Despite the uncertain market and macro-economic conditions, a resilient performance was achieved in 2011, as demand for our products and services gradually returns.
New order intake during the year was strong, up 15 per cent to 2.1 billion, although the order book decreased largely due to the slower than expected conversion of OE bid activity to new orders.
Revenue decreased 12 per cent, impacted mainly by slow second half OE revenue that resulted in OE revenue for the full year down 23 per cent.
This slower than expected recovery of OE revenue was partially offset by a 2,271m nine per cent increase in underlying service revenue.

Profit declined by three per cent relative to a fall in revenue of 12 per cent, reflecting an improved revenue mix and an increased focus on costs and operational performance.

com marine Rolls-Royce has a world-leading range of capabilities in the marine market, encompassing vessel design, the integration of complex systems and the supply and support of power and propulsion equipment.
We are leaders in mission-critical systems for offshore oil and gas, merchant and naval vessels.
Offshore Marine performed strongly in the offshore oil and gas sector.
This was largely based on the proven success of our specialist UT vessel design capabilities and our proficiency at integrating sophisticated systems into complex ships.
As the industry continues to explore ever deeper waters, like those in the South Atlantic off the coast of Brazil, we will continue to be a strong partner for our customers for offshore oil and gas exploration, production, service and support.
Merchant We continue to invest in technology that addresses the need for more efficient and environmentally sustainable power and propulsion systems.
We are a world leader in vessel design and the integration of complex Our successful design and systems integration approach was validated in systems for offshore support vessels in the oil and gas industry.
