ABI Guidelines relating to directors power to allot share capital and disapply pre-emption rights are reflected in Resolution 19 the Section 551 Authority and Resolution 20 respectively, in the Notice of Meeting.
The directors propose Paragraph A of Resolution 19 in the Notice of Meeting to renew the authority granted at the 2011 Annual General Meeting to authorise the directors to allot equity or grant rights in respect of equity shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 66,560 representing approximately one-third of the ordinary shares issued as at the latest practicable date.

This authority, if renewed, will represent in total an aggregate nominal value of 133,120.
This Section 551 Authority, if approved, will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2013 or 23 August 2013, whichever is the earlier.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 77 Full version AR 290898. pdf 81 14 03 2012 17:20:33 Directors report Other statutory information continued In 2011, management performed a working capital report for the Group in anticipation of the acquisition of Zoran Corporation.
This exercise did not identify any liquidity issues.
The directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook and challenging macro economic conditions.
After considering the above factors, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors Deloitte LLP are the Companys auditors and have expressed their willingness to continue in the office of auditors and therefore, in accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for their re-appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
