2011 Operations Governance Financial statements Cape plc Annual Report 2011 11 We were delighted to bring two landmark regional projects Gulf Middle East region to a successful conclusion in 2011.
In Qatar we completed our three-year involvement on the pioneering Shell Pearl GTL plant having expended nearly 3 million man hours over the project life with peak manpower of 500 men.
In Saudi Territory Arabia we brought Saudi Kayan, the worlds largest ethylene plant, to a successful conclusion in 2011 expending over 3.7 million man hours on the project and with peak manpower of around 1,000.
Number of The most active market for E&C bidding activities in the countries: region is the UAE where packages were secured on the ADCO SAS development project, Borouge III, Habshan 5, 7 Ruwais 4th NGL train, IGD project and the Fertil 2 Ammonia Urea expansion project.

Cape maintained its maintenance portfolio to 75 sites 36.2% 2010: 72 sites with existing relationships across the region with clients including BAPCO, SABIC, SIPCHEM, Saudi Aramco, Qatargas and Rasgas.
Cape was awarded new term maintenance contracts in Bahrain for the BAPCO refinery, to undertake painting and blasting services, and in Qatar with the renewal of a five-year multi-discipline maintenance contract with Rasgas and QVC.

12 Cape plc Annual Report 2011 Regional review continued In the CIS, our activities last year were largely centred in CIS, Mediterranean & North Africa region Kazakhstan and Sakhalin.
In Kazakhstan, our main activities were concentrated on the Island D offshore hook-up and at Karabatan the offshore and onshore parts of the Kashagan project.
Our contracts at the Karachaganak 4th Train Territory Development and the Facilities Construction in Atyrau River Port were successfully completed in the second half.
With demand for our services in Kazakhstan reducing as major activities on the current development phase of Number of Kashagan and Karachaganak complete, the focus will switch countries: to opportunities in Azerbaijan.
Our JV with SOCAR State Oil Company of Azerbaijan allowed us to enter the Azerbaijan 8 market last year and, whilst initial set-up and establishment costs have resulted in a loss of 0.6 million 2010: nil, an early success was achieved with the award of the access 2011 revenue contract for the West Chirag Platform topsides.
We expect 60 18.0 further material bidding opportunities to arise in 2012.

We also established an industrial cleaning division within the region.
10.5% 2012 preview We expect stronger revenue growth in 2012, driven by increased activity in Algeria.
Whilst activity levels across the CIS countries should remain stable our short-term emphasis will move more to Azerbaijan as current work scopes complete in Kazakhstan later this year.
Revenues in our smallest region increased by 6.9% CER: 9.6% to 54.5 million 2010: 51.0 million representing 7.5% of Group revenue.
Adjusted EBITA generation was strong with growth of 23.1% CER: 26.9% to 9.6 million 2010: 7.8 million.
Some 93% 2010: 91% of the regions revenues were derived from construction support activities, with growth driven by the commencement of works at the GL3-Z LNG project in Arzew, Algeria and, to a lesser extent, increased activity in Kazakhstan.
As commented at the interim stage, the timing of the work releases on the Arzew LNG project has been considerably slower than expected, with revenues in the year less than one-third of planned levels.
With the mechanical completion date being held, it has been necessary to increase our manpower on the project considerably.
At the year end, Cape had over 900 men on this project.
In the final quarter Cape workers in Arzew, Algeria of 2011, we moved our operational, commercial and financial management staff to Oran in Algeria and we continue to tender and win additional work in Algeria, whilst investing in local recruitment and training.

Territory In August 2011, we successfully completed the acquisition of York Linings, which provides refractory installation and maintenance services and complements Capes existing service offering in the UK.
A strong performance in the five months post acquisition contributed EBITA of 1.7 million from revenues of 8.7 million.
Number of Revenues are largely derived from one-off project works and countries: significant projects undertaken in 2011 included the furnace and stoves overhaul at the Redcar steel works for SSI and the FCCU 5 fluidized catalytic cracking unit outage at the Lindsey Oil Refinery.
Offshore revenues reduced by 5% to 93.1 million 2010: 97.6 2011 revenue million with the operational highlights being the successful 400 12 commencement of work on: 299.1m 300 9 four new BP assets part of the BP UKCS Federal 200 6 contract award : 100 3 the Netherlands Continental Shelf with Total E&P 0 09 10 11 0 contract: and a number of unmanned platforms for BHP in Liverpool Bay.

activity levels remained broadly neutral across the petrochemical, refining and heavy industrial sectors.
The positive impact of the regions strong revenue performance, with growth of 9.4%, was entirely offset by the reduction in Contract awards and renewals during 2011 included the the operating margin to 8.9% 2010: 10.2% resulting from the three-year call-off contract from Shell for offshore platform 4.1 million charge in relation to a one-off rig refurbishment separator cleaning announced in February and term contracts contract which completed in the first week of January 2012. with Dow Chemicals at Grangemouth, Scotland and Dow Excluding this contract, the regions EBITA margin remained Corning at Barry, South Wales.
2012 preview Onshore revenues increased by 14% to 171.1 million 2010: 149.7 We expect to see a continued modest increase in activity levels million, driven by higher levels of activity in the power generation in 2012 over those seen last year.
