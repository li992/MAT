Nigel George Executive Director In the first half of 2011, the investment market saw a marginal Valuation performance % tightening of valuation yields and an improving rental growth trend.
However, with the increased economic uncertainty in the Eurozone 20 in the second half, sentiment was moderated and this stabilised yields and limited rental growth.

The valuation surplus was 181.7m for the year, before lease incentive adjustments of 9.6m, 0 giving a total movement of 172.1m.
This valuation movement was below the 301.7m in 2010, a year when yield compression 10 across the portfolio was more widespread.
The underlying valuation increase over the year was 7.6%, or 8.8% 20 if property sales completed during the year had been retained and valued at their disposal level.
