42 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2011 Operating results continued Other Europe Service revenue decreased by 6.0% with declines in all countries except the Netherlands and Turkey, which returned to growth in the second half of the year, as all markets were impacted by the economic downturn.
In the Netherlands service revenue increased 3.0% benefiting from strong growth in visitor revenue.
Service revenue in Turkey increased by 31.3% in the fourth quarter driven by an improving trend in outgoing mobile revenue.
The quality and mix of customers continued to improve, with Vodafone remaining the market leader in mobile number portability in Turkey.
In Romania service revenue declined by 19.9% due to intense competition throughout the year, mobile termination rate cuts and the continued impact on ARPU resulting from local currency devaluation against the euro, as tariffs are quoted in euros while household incomes are earned in local currency.
In the Czech Republic and Hungary the decline in service revenue was driven by mobile termination rate cuts which became effective during the year, impacting incoming mobile voice revenue and challenging economic conditions.
Vodafone launched its 3G network services in the Czech Republic during the fourth quarter.
Service revenue in Greece declined by 14.5% primarily due to a mobile termination rate cut effective from January 2009, tariff changes and a particularly tough economic and competitive climate.
Service revenue in Ireland declined due to a combination of recessionary and competitive factors.
In Portugal there was a termination rate reduction effective from April 2009 which contributed to a fall in service revenue of 4.9%.
EBITDA declined by 16.0% mainly due to a reduction in service revenue coupled with turnaround investment in Turkey.
The significant service revenue growth in the second half of the financial year in Turkey was driven by investment and improvement in many areas of the business.
These led to higher operating costs which, when coupled with increased interconnect costs arising from the introduction of new any network tariffs plans, resulted in negative EBITDA for the financial year.
In Romania EBITDA decreased by 26.5% due to the revenue decline but this was partially offset by strong cost reduction initiatives in all areas.
The EBITDA margin fell by 3.4 percentage points with declines in all markets except the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech Republic and Hungary.
The decline in service revenue was partially offset by lower customer costs and a reduction in operating expenses.
