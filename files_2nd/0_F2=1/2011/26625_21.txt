Vesting annually over three years.
4.2 Performance bonus The main bonus pool is determined by the profitability of the business for the financial year after a charge on surplus capital.
The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed judgemental accounting items and reported its findings to the Remuneration Committee to provide guidance on risk matters for the Remuneration Committees consideration in determining the bonus pool.
GLG investment managers are compensated based on the performance and contribution of their funds.
Sales executives may be remunerated by marketing incentives based on funds raised, retained and under management.
Investment performance and the level of sustainable profitability, within a governance framework, are therefore a direct driver of compensation.
Employees are measured against both delivery of business objectives, risk management and compliance with formal performance reviews used to assess the employees contribution and potential.
The purpose is to increase the effectiveness and potential of every Man employee by aligning individual objectives with overall business and department goals.
senior employees also have part of their performance bonus mandatorily deferred into shares and funds with the proportion deferred increasing as total compensation increases with maximum deferral levels at 50% of variable compensation.
Awards are through the Man Group share plans to align them with the shareholders and the future performance of the Company.
Deferred compensation awards for senior managers may also be invested in fund based incentives to align employees with the interests of investors in funds managed by the Company.
4.3 All employee option plans and employee share ownership Participants in the UK Sharesave Scheme SAYE are permitted to save up to 250 per month to purchase Man Group plc shares at a discount.
The option price is set at a 20% discount to the market value at the time the option is granted.
This is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme.
Contracts are for three or five year periods.
The Company encourages employee share ownership and has a high level of staff participation in employee share and option plans with 48% participating in the all employee or senior staff share and option plans.

Executive Committee and FSA Code Staff remuneration 5.1 Executive Committee remuneration The Executive Committee is the senior management team of 10 comprising the executive directors and senior business leaders.
The Executive Committee members who are not executive directors have had their remuneration policy assessed such that senior management is appropriately incentivised to deliver the corporate strategy.
Variable incentives are structured such that 50% of the awards have been deferred into share or fund based incentive arrangements this year for the ongoing members of the Executive Committee.
This aligns their interests with the long-term return to shareholders and with the interests of investors in Man funds.
All share and fund awards are conditional and subject to forfeiture if an employee resigns or employment is terminated for misconduct.

Man Group plc Report and accounts 125 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 5.3 Key management compensation Key management compensation is for those directors and employees classified as key management, being those having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of Man.
The Executive Committee was set up following the acquisition of GLG and Executive Committee compensation has been included in key management compensation from its inception on 22 November 2010.
The current nine month financial period, 9M 2011, compensation includes salary for the nine month financial period ended 31 December 2011 and bonus for the 12 month period ended 31 December 2011.
The previous financial year ended 31 March 2011 FY 2011 includes salary for 12 months for Man staff and 5.5 months for incoming GLG staff with the performance period and bonus being nine months for Man and 5.5 months for incoming GLG staff.
The data in the table R18 is heavily influenced by the incoming key management with bonus included for 1.2 months in the prior year FY2011 and 12 months in the current 9M 2011.
Given the incoming key management headcount and the change in financial reporting periods it is not practical to make comparisons between periods.

Executive directors additional information 6.1 Introduction In line with shareholders interests being managed within a robust governance framework, the Company aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executive directors and align their remuneration with the interests of shareholders by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with a performance bonus and long-term incentive awards which are linked to: profits and contribution: the achievement of individual objectives, which are consistent with the strategy of the Company and building sustainable profitability: the achievement of the Companys key financial targets: the creation of long-term shareholder value: on-going oversight of a robust risk management framework: maintenance of strong capital and liquidity positions: and addition of senior talent, building succession for leadership and setting a strong governance structure for the Boards delegated authorities.
In assessing executive director remuneration internal relativities within the Company are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
These internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
Whilst the fixed component of remuneration is sufficiently high to allow the Company to operate a fully flexible bonus policy in order to preserve alignment with shareholder interests, the Remuneration Committee seeks to deliver a high proportion of total compensation as mandatory deferral into shares and into options over Company shares and as long-term incentives.

8% of the award vests for achieving positive AROE and if NMFIG is 10%.
The proportion of award vesting increases incrementally so that the award vests in full for achieving either AROE of 10% and NMFIG of 30%, or AROE of 30% and NMFIG of 20%.
None of the award vests if AROE is negative.
The 2009 grants are due to be tested for the three year period ended 31 March 2012.
