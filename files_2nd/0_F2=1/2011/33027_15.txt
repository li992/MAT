Delivering our strategy Intellectual Property We protect the ownership of our inventions Patent process We file applications for patent protection for our inventions to safeguard the large subsequent investment required to obtain approval of potential new drugs for marketing.
Further innovation means that we may seek additional patent protection as we develop a product and its uses.
We apply for patents via patent offices around We seek to protect the value the world which assess whether our inventions meet the strict legal requirements for a patent to be granted.
In some countries, our of our products and our competitors can challenge our patents in the patent offices, and, in all countries, competitors can challenge our patents in the courts.
Company, while safeguarding We can face challenges early in the patent application process and our reputation throughout the life of the patent.
These challenges can be to the validity of a patent and or to the effective scope of a patent and are based on ever-evolving legal precedents.
There can be no guarantee of success for either party in patent proceedings.
For information about third party challenges to the patents protecting our products, see Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184.
The basic term of a patent is 20 years from filing of the patent application with the relevant government patent office.
However, the product protected by a pharmaceutical patent may not be marketed for several years after patent filing due to the time required for clinical trials and the regulatory approval process necessary to obtain marketing approval for the product.
Patent Term Extensions PTE are available in certain major markets including the EU and US Jeff Pott to compensate for these delays.
The term of the PTE can vary from General Counsel zero to five years depending on the time taken to obtain any marketing approval.
The maximum patent term, including any PTE, is however capped at 15 years EU or 14 years US from the first marketing approval.
The average effective patent term on the market is frequently several years less than these maximum terms for reasons including The discovery and development of a new unpredictable regulatory timings and the time taken for any required medicine requires a significant investment of pricing negotiations.
