Diageo Annual Report 2011 72 Business review Business review Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 25 August 2011: Diageo is a strong business as these results show.
Our leading brands and superior routes to market have delivered volume growth, positive price mix, gross margin expansion and strong cash flow.
We have strengthened the business, investing more behind our brands and in our routes to market and we have deepened our leading brand and market positions in the fastest growing markets of the world.
In addition we have implemented changes to drive further operational efficiencies.
It is the basis of our medium term outlook for average top line growth of 6%, operating margin improvement, with the first 200 basis points achieved in the next three years, and double digit eps growth.
Diageo is not immune from a fragile global economy, however achievement of these aims would underpin even stronger dividend growth.

Borrowings The groups net borrowings and gross borrowings in the tables below are measured at amortised cost with the exception of borrowings designated in fair value hedge relationships, interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency forwards and swaps.

Net borrowings, reported on this basis, comprise the following: 30 June 2011 2010 2009 million million million Overdrafts 12 55 68 Other borrowings due within one year 1,435 532 822 Borrowings due within one year 1,447 587 890 Borrowings due between one and three years 2,441 2,189 1,537 Borrowings due between three and five years 1,741 2,732 2,747 Borrowings due after five years 2,566 3,256 3,401 Fair value of foreign currency forwards and swaps 182 227 170 Fair value of interest rate hedging instruments 58 191 93 Finance lease liabilities 79 61 21 Gross borrowings 8,034 8,407 8,333 Offset by: Cash and cash equivalents 1,584 1,453 914 Net borrowings 6,450 6,954 7,419 Based on average monthly net borrowings and interest charge, the effective interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2011 was 4.9% 2010 4.8%: 2009 6.2%.
