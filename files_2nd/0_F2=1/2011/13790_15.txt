Auditors Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that, as far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys Auditors are unaware.
In addition, each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys Auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP were first appointed as Auditors to the Company in September 2005 and have expressed their willingness to continue as Auditors.
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as the Groups Auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
41 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Directors report continued Going concern The Group has significant expenditure commitments on its exploration and development portfolio within the next 12 months.
As highlighted in note 21 to the consolidated Financial Statements, the Group meets these investment requirements through a combined senior and junior seven year Reserves Based Lending RBL facility, entered into in May 2011, and a $100 million convertible bond, the terms of which are described in note 22 to the consolidated Financial Statements.
In order to ensure it remains within the terms of these loan facilities, the Group regularly produces cash flow statements and forecasts and sensitivities are run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups producing assets and delays to development projects of which the most significant in the next 12 months relates to the expansion of the Bualuang field.
The commodity primarily oil price risk also affects the availability under the Reserves Based Lending facility, but is partly managed by a 2012 hedging programme.
To optimise the development of the portfolio, or in the event there are unexpected adverse changes to the Groups cash flows, the Directors are confident that the Group could manage its financial affairs, including the securing of additional capacity under its RBL, portfolio management, share placings and deferring of non-essential capital expenditure, so as to ensure that sufficient funding remains available for the next 12 months.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the above uncertainties, the Directors believe that the Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in economic assumptions, show that the Group will be able to meet all its contractual commitments and to operate within the level of its current reserves based lending facility for the foreseeable future, being 12 months from the date of this report.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.
