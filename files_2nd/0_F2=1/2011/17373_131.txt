How were rewarded  Non-regulatory and non-audited information on executive directors compensation There are often differences between the compensation amounts which our executive directors are granted in any particular year and the amounts they actually receive.
This is because, in addition to cash base salary and fees, pension and STIP, executive directors and other senior management in the Group are also awarded deferred shares ESAs as part of their annual bonus.
ESA awards usually vest two years after grant, and can only be sold once vested.
In the case of LEAP awards, as is described elsewhere in this report, executive directors are annually invited to participate in LEAP.
Such invitation requires the executive director to make and retain an investment in shares as determined by the committee.
At the end of a five-year performance period which begins in the year of grant of a LEAP award, the committee determines the number of matching shares to which participants are entitled, using criteria which are explained on page 134.
The matching shares, if any, are not received and cannot be sold by the participant until the performance period has ended and the committee has made that determination.
The committee believes that it is more transparent, and in the spirit of the UK governments current proposed changes in the area of executive pay, to disclose the value of amounts received by each executive director based on the timing differences described above in addition to the previous emoluments table which is required by statute.
The information contained in the below table is not required by statute.
Benefits include such items as healthcare, life assurance, spouse travel and allowances for cars and housing.
Both Sir Martin Sorrell and Paul Richardson currently receive part of their remuneration in pounds sterling and part in US dollars.
Any US dollar amounts received in 2011 have been converted into sterling at an exchange rate of $1.6032 to 1.

The following table shows the number and value as at 31 December 2011 of WPP shares required to be held by the executive directors for five years, as an investment in WPP, to entitle them to receive any matching shares on vesting of their awards under LEAP.
In addition to retaining such significant investments in WPP, the vesting of any matching shares is conditional on WPPs relative TSR performance against the comparator group as explained on page 134.
