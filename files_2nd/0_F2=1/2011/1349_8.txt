business and financial review continued key performance indicators At Group level, we measure the performance of the business using a number of key performance indicators as shown in the table below.
These help to ensure that we are delivering against our stated objectives.
As discussed further in the report from the Remuneration Committee, we link the remuneration of our executive directors to the achievement of certain of our KPIs, specifically underlying earnings per share.
Certain KPIs are more appropriately measured for each of our two operating businesses, whereas other KPIs are best measured for the Group as a whole.
Physical utilisation % Physical utilisation is measured as the daily average of the amount of serialised fleet at cost on rent as a 69 69 percentage of the total fleet at cost and for Sunbelt is measured only for equipment whose cost is over 68 $7,500 which comprised 90% of its serialised fleet at 30 April 2011.
67 66 It is important to sustain annual average physical utilisation at between 60% and 70% through the cycle.
64 If utilisation falls below 60% then yield will tend to suffer, whilst above 70% we may not have enough fleet in certain stores to meet our customers needs.
09 10 11 Utilisation this year in the US reached a five-year high in October 2010 as markets commenced cyclical recovery and we operated with a fleet size 9% below peak because of downsizing during the recession.
Sunbelt A-Plant Fleet on rent $ m Fleet on rent is measured as the daily average of the original cost of our itemised equipment on rent.
Original cost, rather than net book value, is used because it correlates more directly with rental income as rental rates 1,515 1,432 1,368 vary only slightly with the age of the item being rented.
Fleet on rent measures the activity within our business and also provides an indication of market share.
In the US, fleet on rent grew 5% in 2010 11.
245 221 227 09 10 11 Sunbelt A-Plant Change in yield % Yield is measured as the change in our rental revenue which is not explained by the change in volume of fleet on rent.
Yield is therefore an all encompassing measure which captures changes in rental rates, changes in delivery charges and other ancillary rental revenue, together with changes in both the customer mix larger 3 customers generally pay lower rates and the mix of equipment.
-1 -5 We were pleased in the past year to have delivered what we believe to be the strongest yield performance in -8 -12 the US with Sunbelt returning to yield growth year on year in our second quarter, a full quarter ahead of its -16 large US peers and delivering 3% growth over the year as a whole.
09 10 11 Sunbelt A-Plant Underlying EBITDA margins % Underlying EBITDA margins are measured before exceptional costs.
Underlying EBITDA correlates closely in our business with our top line cash flow and is therefore an important measure of our financial health.
Given 35 the cyclicality of our revenue, it is also important that we adjust our cost base as far as practicable to limit 32 32 any reduction in our underlying EBITDA margin when revenues are declining.
30 26 26 09 10 11 Sunbelt A-Plant Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 21 Underlying EPS p Underlying EPS is a key measure of financial performance for the Group as a whole.
It is measured before exceptional costs, amortisation of acquired intangibles and fair value remeasurements.
This year, as we 14.8 generated improved volumes of fleet on rent and growth in yield, EPS improved over the cyclical low of 2010.
11.9 11.3 Our balance sheet structure, which involves us incurring a significant interest cost, means that our underlying 10.3 EPS varies substantially through the cycle.
4.0 0.2 06 07 08 09 10 11 Return on investment % In a capital intensive business, profitability is not the only measure of performance as it is possible to 15 14 generate good margins but poor value for shareholders if assets are not deployed efficiently.
Return on 13 investment RoI measures both profitability and capital efficiency and is calculated as underlying operating 10 profit divided by net tangible and intangible fixed assets employed plus net working capital but excluding net 7 5 debt, deferred tax and fair value remeasurements.
Averaged across the economic cycle we look to deliver RoI well ahead of our cost of capital.
As with underlying EPS, the past fiscal year has seen the first stage of recovery in RoI from 2009 10s cyclical low.
06 07 08 09 10 11 Net debt and leverage at constant exchange rates We seek to maintain a conservative balance sheet structure with a target range for net debt to underlying EBITDA of 23 times.
This years initial stage of the expected cyclical recovery in earnings has seen this ratio 1,133 quickly return to within our target range.
1,101 1,096 3.1 2.9 We also aim to sustain significant availability the difference between the amount we are able to borrow 3.3 921 2.9 under our asset-based facility at any time and the amount drawn through the cycle.
Availability at 30 April 2.6 2.6 776 756 2011 was $479m which both ensures all our debt remains effectively covenant free and also provides us with substantial headroom for future investment.
Aug Apr Apr Apr Apr Apr 06 07 08 09 10 11 Net debt m Leverage x Staff turnover % We are a service business that differentiates itself by the strength of our service offering.
Central to this service offering are our people.
While it was not unexpected that employee turnover declined in a recession, we are nonetheless pleased with the reduction given the pressure our people were under to deliver in difficult 21 19 market conditions.
As we move into recovery, we are aiming to keep turnover below historical levels to build 18 16 14 13 on the skill base we have established.
Staff turnover is calculated as the number of leavers in a year excluding redundancies divided by the average headcount during the year.
09 10 11 Sunbelt A-Plant Safety Our business involves frequent movement and maintenance of large and heavy pieces of equipment, often in confined spaces.
Rigorous safety processes are essential if we are to avoid accidents which could cause injury to our people and damage our reputation.
1.52 1.00 1.04 In the chart we have plotted the RIDDOR reportable incident rate for A-Plant and also for Sunbelt on the 0.97 0.95 0.85 same basis in each of the past three years.
While increased pressure on our business during the recession resulted in an increase in A-Plant in 2010, accident rates have reduced this year and we believe our continued focus on health and safety will further reduce incident rates in the future.
