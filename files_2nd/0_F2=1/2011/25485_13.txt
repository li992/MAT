However, a portion thereof 82.5 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Refer to page 49 for further details Central costs are higher than the prior year mainly due to the appreciation of the Rand against Pounds Sterling as well as increased headcount and related expenses.
Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the speci c financial and strategic requirements the group faces at the time The funds raised are applied towards making acquisitions, funding central services and debt obligations, and purchasing corporate assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

UK and Europe Credit risk The year in review remained challenging as the severe deterioration in economic conditions globally continued to impact on clients activities and underlying asset values.
As a result impairments and defaults have continued to increase.
The Irish market was particularly affected by economic dif culties and the local banking crisis.
Core loans and advances increased marginally by 2.6% to 5.6 billion, primarily as a result of a cautious approach in accepting new loan exposures and a conscious effort to rebalance our existing portfolio mix.
Defaulted loans net of impairments have increased from 3.16% to 4.23% of core loans and advances and the credit loss ratio has increased from 1.72% to 2.22%, largely as a result of an increase in impairments in our Private Banking division, notably against our Irish loan portfolio.
Traded market risk In the UK, the Structured Equity desk has continued to experience growth in their retail product sales and they continue to expand their product range.
The Interest Rate and Forex desks have also performed well in a challenging environment, whilst the Equity Trading business had a strong year.
The remaining UK commodities book was sold during the course of the year.

Good growth was experienced in the banks corporate and structured equity deposit book, whilst the Private Bank slowed its intake of deposits.
