That immediately changes your mindset.
Youve got to be 100% sure that this is what you want and can do.
Immediately you look at your operations in a different way.
You have to cascade that responsibility down, which takes the decision-making to the most appropriate level the operational level the guys who keep the wheels going and make the money for the company.

com Operating review: Alloys continued 74 Markets Global ferrochrome consumption kt Ferrochrome 10,000 Strong global stainless steel demand growth, driven mostly by continued double digit growth in China, resulted in record production of stainless steel in 2011.
Global consumption of ferrochrome reached a record 7,500 8.7 million tonnes, exceeding the previous high of 8.3 million tonnes in 2010.
Strong end-user demand and restocking by stainless steel distribution centres in the first half supported the growth in global 5,000 demand for both stainless steel and ferrochrome.
Despite rising oil prices and global events such as the natural disaster in 2500 Japan and political unrest in the Middle East, volumes in the global stainless industry remained healthy for the first half of 2011, albeit with considerably reduced margins.

Q Global ferrochrome consumption Global ferrochrome production rose in response to increased demand to reach a record 8.7 million tonnes in 2011, 1% higher than 2010.
South African production rose during the first quarter of 2011, but overall volumes from South Africa declined by 9% due to progressively weaker demand during the year and reduced production during the high electricity tariff South African winter.
Platinum Group Metals PGM Despite the global economic uncertainty, total demand for platinum showed In response to strong demand and an increased availability of chromite ore, modest year-on-year growth in all sectors apart from the investment sector Chinese ferrochrome production increased by 12%, or 260,000 tonnes, on during the year.

Global economic concerns negatively impacted investment demand for Increased demand for stainless steel will lead to higher stainless steel melt PGMs in 2011, with investors following different strategies for platinum and production and, as a result, increased demand for virgin ferrochrome units palladium.

Double digit inationary rises in key costs were experienced during 2011, increasing costs in nominal terms.
In real terms, measured against the inationary headwinds, our chrome business achieved $32 million of unit cost savings from efficiency improvements.
The impact of lower grades due to difficult operating conditions in the platinum division largely offset the chrome efficiencies, resulting in unit cost savings of $5 million.
The weakening of the rand against the dollar during 2011, compared to the inverse trend in 2010, had a positive impact of $59 million.

Vanadium pentoxide and ferrovanadium production decreased by 4% and 8% respectively compared to 2010, mainly due to a 14-day planned maintenance shutdown.
Platinum Group Metals PGM volumes were 22%, or 42,417 ounces, lower than 2010 as Eland mine continued to transition from an open pit to an underground mine.
Production was also impacted by delays in obtaining mining rights extensions for the open cast mining areas and for the fide Wildt mineral resource block and by industrial action at Eland in October.
The Mototolo joint venture increased throughput by 39,757 tonnes, marginally more than in 2010, and succeeded in maintaining nameplate ROM production of around 200,000 tonnes per month throughout the year, processing a total of 2,302,990 milled tonnes.
