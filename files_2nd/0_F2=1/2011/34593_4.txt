Sushi Nandos Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 28 Annual Report 2011 Market review CSC is well placed to deal with the challenges and opportunities arising from the current economic environment UK macro and consumer backdrop In June 2009 the UK economy started to recover from the credit crunch recessionary period but GDP dipped again in the last quarter of 2010.
2011 proved more diffi cult than generally anticipated with only 0.8 per cent GDP growth overall.
For CSC, this is most noticeable in the level of tenant failures, at a very low level in 2010 but increased to 3 per cent of passing rent in 2011.
We expect UK economic output to grow only slowly for some time.
The appetite of both businesses and households to make investment and borrowing decisions isbeing aff ected by the current constrained lending markets and uncertainty relating to the euro-zone.
Focus is rmly on downside risks.
Consumer con dence remains at an extremely low level, below the previous trough in winter 2008 9 according to the Nationwide benchmark metric.
In ationary pressure on household costs, particularly from the fuel price increases in 2011, whilst apparently starting to ease, is still well in excess of wage increases.
Combined with higher unemployment, this has brought the UK average household disposable income down 7per cent in the year to December 2011 according to the Asda benchmark index.
The UK retail environment Faced with this spending squeeze, consumer habits have been changing.
CSCs consumer feedback including from focus groups is stressing value for money and convenience, including access to all their favourite brands.
National spending patterns have been shifting, notably with a higher proportion of sales conducted online from 8.6 per cent of all retail trade in 2008 to 12 per cent in 2011 and in the larger destinations both in cities and out-of-town.
With shoppers becoming more demanding inlooking for their preferred combination of product, experience and service, top shopping centres such as CSCs with a compelling mix of retail brands, catering and leisure have shown increasing footfall and retailer sales in contrast to the UK overall data which shows reductions.
The challenge to retailers has been to keep their business moving forward while facing reduced disposable income and changing consumer patterns in the face of supply chain in ation and, insome cases, limited access to capital.
Not all retailers have succeeded.
Failures include business models challenged by structural shift or prolonged sub-sector cyclical downturn, nancing structures unable to withstand the tighter nancing market, businesses focused on big ticket products and those simply losing their share to competitors.
However the level of failures this winter has been well below that of winter 2008 9 when, inthe immediate aftermath of the credit crunch, CSC lost 9 per cent of the rent roll in two quarters by way of failures.
The adept retailers have been successfully focusing on cost control toimprove margins and returns.
As well as work on supply chains, several retailers have publicly initiated programmes to exit their tail of underperforming stores.
This will challenge less successful locations, with potential for downward spiral, but is unlikely to harm the best cities and centres where other expanding retailers including international brands are competing for well-con gured space in prime pitches.
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 29 and strategy review review responsibility information Braehead Located on the banks of the River Clyde, Braehead is a world class retail and leisure destination with the UKs top retail names and successful international arrivals.
With an impressive integrated leisure off er, Braeheads catering options have been widened in 2011 by the successful introduction of three new restaurants on a former childrens icerink.
Aff ected by 19 tenant failures during the 2008 9 recession, CSCs team has developed the retailer mix, upsizing successful tenants such as Primark and H&M to new agship stores.
With CSCs strong relationships and proven record of delivery, Braeheads compelling story attracted both Apple and Hollister during 2011.
Other strong brands are following, demonstrating that Braehead is the regions centre of choice.
We are working with the local authority on a master plan which should lead over time to increased economic and social activity in the area.
Successful retailers are seeking out the most cost eff ective access to their customers, be thatthrough online or physical footfall, with the best located stores and integration of online 3% and physical brands.
Various techniques are being applied to drive traffi c between the CSC vacancy rate, compared to 14% national channels such as click and collect options and access to pods for in-store access to online vacancy rate per Local Data Company ranges.
Four of CSCs centres have now launched mobile apps which provide shoppers withconvenient access to centre and retailer information and special off ers.
Several brands which started without stores have now added a physical presence to extend their reach including, now in our centres, Simply Be and Amazon.
CSCs position The eff ect of this polarisation can be seen in the vacancy rates of diff erent retail property, with secondary shopping centres averaging over 15 per cent, town centre properties over 10per cent, the larger prime centres 8 per cent and CSCs centres 3 per cent.

As a result, yields for prime assets such as CSCs have remained stable Valuation surplus year ended 31 December 2011 toslightly tightening.
By comparison secondary retail property, a category in which none of CSCs regional shopping centres would be classi ed, has had more variable pricing.
Yields have increased during 2011 6.0% aspurchasers allowed for their expectation of falling rents see Market review, as the pool of potential lenders reduced by well publicised withdrawals from UK real estate lending and with CSC weighted average nominal equivalent yield the unresolved overhang of defaulted property in the hands of lenders.

Yields CSCs performance results from a slight tightening of equivalent yields, 11 basis points in the rsthalf and 8 basis points in the second half, and increases in passing rent partly off set by net reductions in ERV.
Comparison of CSC yield and 10 year gilt yield 10.0 9.0 8.0 6.7% 7.0 6.0% 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0% 1.0 % 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Weighted average nominal equivalent yield CSC Gilts 10 years IPD Monthly Index Retail At 5.98 per cent, CSCs weighted average nominal equivalent yield has recovered 139 basis points from 7.37 per cent at the point where the market troughed in June 2009 and remains 121basis points above its level of 4.77 per cent at the peak of the market in June 2007.
Further, with continuing reductions in the yields available from investment grade bonds, the spread of CSCs nominal equivalent yield over a medium-term gilt yield represents a historic high of 400 basis points as illustrated by the graph above, demonstrating the attractiveness of the income proposition.
ERV ERVs are regularly adjusted to re ect the impact of transactions and changing circumstances.
The largest component of the ERV in the valuation calculation is the passing rent, with any step up to estimated market rent being discounted to match the timing of the relevant lease event.
CSCs like-for-like ERV fell 2 per cent in the year, largely in the second half, bringing the total reduction from its peak to 8 per cent.
The aggregated change in 2011 re ects the impact ofvariable performance between centres and between areas within individual centres as commented on below.
Prime pitches tend to hold their own on the downside and lead the way in demonstrating growth in the recovery.
Weaker areas of centres are inevitably more susceptible to tenant failures and are more diffi cult to relet.
There is greater churn, more availability and therefore more downward pressure on the rents achievable, the risk of which tends to be re ected in ahigher yield until leasing evidence supports a new ERV level.
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 32 Annual Report 2011 Investment property valuations continued Lakeside With 254 stores including 45 catering outlets, Lakesides retail off er is an ever-changing blend 9,000 ofnational and international brands.
During 2011 Number of jobs supported at Lakeside we welcomed 16 new retailers, as part of 29 new long-term lettings, including Boux Avenue, Jack n Jones, Love Coff ee and Panasonic.
Theopening inNovember of Topshop TopMans new concept store was one of the more impressiveof 52 retailer touts during the year.
And Forever 21, an exciting US brand, will be opening a 35,000 agship store inlate 2012, just their fourth in the UK.
Located within the largest concentration of retail and leisure in Europe, Lakeside has continuously evolved over its 21 years.
By supporting over 9,000jobs in the area, the centre makes a vital 5 % contribution to its community.
And with a Increase in Lakeside net rental income in2011 planning application submitted for a 325,000 sq.
ft. extension including a new department store, 30 to 40 new shops and restaurants, new public space and integrated transport hub, it remains uniquely positioned for the future.
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 33 and strategy review review responsibility information The interaction of yield and other valuation factors can be seen in second half valuation changes at some of the centres: Lakesides value increased by 10 million.
The improved equivalent yield, down 6 basis points to 5.63 per cent, has more than off set a marginal reduction in ERV in secondary malls.
Lettings in prime areas above the tone of 339 ITZA has not yet been re ected inadjacent unit ERV Metrocentres value reduced by 10 million.
Total ERV has reduced by 5 per cent.
However, expectation of some disruption from the expiry pro le hadbeen factored into the previous yield.
Thus the ERV reduction is largely off set in thevaluation by a 12 basis points improvement in the equivalent yield re ecting the reduced uncertainty following theprogress made on lease expiries The value of The Harlequin, Watford reduced by 26 million, largely due to a 12 per cent reduction in prime headline Zone A rent to 250 ITZA re ecting recent lettings The value of Manchester Arndale increased by 22 million.
Following consistent lettings well above previous tone and a strengthening tenant mix, aggregate ERV has increased 1per cent.
Further, the equivalent yield improved by 23 basis points to 5.74 per cent The value of The Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent reduced by 14 million.
Its equivalent yield has increased 25 basis points to 7.50 per cent to re ect the risks associated with a third ofthe rent roll due to expire in 2013.
Also aggregate ERV has reduced by 3 per cent re ecting recent lettings The Traff ord Centres value increased by 50 million, as improved tenant mix, including new agship store openings, has reinforced its position as a top prime centre.
As such, theequivalent yield has contracted 10 basis points to 5.52 per cent As illustrated by the chart below, there is signi cant increment between the topped up netrent and the valuers assessment of the ERV.
The impact on the valuation of the uplift is discounted for the time to the reversionary lease event and is subject to assumptions regarding the level of running voids, any re-letting period and the valuers expectation of incentives.

This drives rental levels over the long term Introduction Two thirds of the UKs population live within a 45 minute drive of a CSC shopping centre.
This scale and specialist approach gives CSC strong relationships with retailers, providing opportunities for both CSC and the retailers businesses to develop.
CSCs objective is to create long-term and sustainable income growth to drive capital appreciation and hence attractive shareholder returns.
We made signi cant progress on the three key objectives for 2011, namely: continued enhancement of our centres growth in like-for-like net rental income integration of the Traff ord Centre team and operations David Fischel We start 2012 with robust operating indicators.
Chief Executive Value creation through continued enhancement ofCSCsdestinations CSC aims to provide great retail and leisure experiences so that shoppers prefer to spend their time at one of our centres than on one of the many other activities competing fortheir attention.
By providing entertainment, a sense of theatre and catering outlets, as well as the full range ofmajor brands, our centres have recorded some 320 million customer visits in 2011, almost amillion a day.
Combined with the effi cient delivery of facilities and operational services to retailers, CSCaims to create an environment in which the retailers brands can ourish.
This drives rental levels over the long term and reduces the risk associated with tenant failures and leaseexpiries.
Four main aspects are central to CSCs business proposition: Tenant mix Retailers are highly aware of how their brand performs relative to competitors and complementary off ers.
The right neighbouring stores guarantee a ow of potential customers and cut down risk when investing in a new location.
CSC has been successful inattracting the brands customers most want to see for example six centres now have both Apple and Hollister.
33 new brands have been introduced to CSC centres during 2011and 14 new names brought to Wales at St Davids, Cardiff Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 35 and strategy review review responsibility information Catering Its no surprise that Jamie Oliver chose to open his first restaurant in Wales, Jamies Italian, at 2 5% StDavids.
The centre has exceptional catering Increase in CSCs catering rent roll in2011 throughout from grab and go off ers including YO!
Sushi, Pret a Manger and Cadwaladers to restaurants such as TGI Friday, Caf Rouge, Nandos and Chimichangas.
As well as giving ourshoppers more reasons to visit and stay, the31outlets deliver a full 13% of St Davids rentalincome.
But this is not unique in CSCs portfolio, with The Traff ord Centres 60 restaurants plus in-store catering outlets providing 6,000 covers including the UKs number one TGI Fridays.
Four of our centres now have a Carluccios and six a YO!
We have added new casual dining at Braehead, 400 Newcastle and Norwich in 2011, with plans Outlets underway at Bromley, Metrocentre and Stoke-on-Trent.
With this exceptional blend, its no wonder that our shoppers list food and drink as one of their 10 % top reasons for visiting.
Of rent roll now catering andleisure Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 36 Annual Report 2011 Operating review continued Top quality centres As several retailers have publicly commented, not all stores contribute equally to their business.
In focusing their investment on the stronger centres that attract the highest footfall, retailers get the most cost-eff ective and reliable access to potential customers.
CSCs footfall has continued rising over the last three years by contrast to UK retail footfallstatistics published by Experian which have shown falls Minimal new supply With minimal new supply of retail space at UK regional shopping centres, retailers requiringlarger spaces for agship stores in the best locations are driving rental levels forward.
Recent lettings of larger space at The Traff ord Centre have created new higher evidence for certain 2013 rent reviews.
The competitive challenge for established shopping centres is to reinforce the superiority of their tenant mix, experience and service over other formats available to retailers and shoppers such as the traditional high street, retail parks, outlet centres, superstores and online shopping New initiatives Retail is a dynamic sector, with shoppers and retailers attracted to locations where something fresh is happening.
A continuing trend in 2011 has been improved catering, witha25 per cent increase in CSCs passing rent from catering operators and almost 400catering outlets now among CSCs 2,500 units.
Other projects are outlined below inPlans for major centres Capital expenditure and active management In positioning CSC for the future, four planning consents have been obtained during 2011 andafurther four have been submitted and are awaiting determination.
Capital expenditure of 77 million is committed or accrued and there are a variety of active management projects totalling around 120 million over the next three years.
In aggregate we anticipate creating a stabilised initial yield on cost of around 10 per cent on these projects.
We have also acquired assets where they increase our strategic exibility: In November we bought Broadmarsh, the second shopping centre in Nottingham, for73million In two transactions since the year end which arose from our closer relationship with the Peel Group, we purchased for 4.7 million a 31 acre site adjacent to Braehead and obtained for 2.5 million an option over an approximately 60 acre site in Southern Spain with planning consent for a major regional shopping centre Net rental income Net rental income NRI of 364 million is 31 per cent above that of 2010 including 11 months of The Traff ord Centre.

Occupancy 19 8 Occupancy remains high at 96.7 per cent 31 December 2010 97.7 per cent.
The bulk of Long-term lettings thedecrease can be attributed to tenants representing around 1 per cent of rent entering administration in the fourth quarter, compared to none in the same period of 2010.
This brought the total of tenant failures for 2011 to 3 per cent of rent.
The first few weeks 97% of2012 have seen failures amounting to a further2 per cent of rent, the majority of which arestill trading.
Occupancy Lettings Notwithstanding the deterioration in the UK macro environment in the second half of 2011, steady progress has been made in securing new lettings.
198 long-term lettings have been completed in the year increasing the annual rent for those units by 11 million to 35 million inaggregate.
Excluding partners interests, CSCs share increased by 9 million to 29 million.
Lettings and ERV The new rent on long-term lettings made during the year represented on average 96 per cent of ERV for those units, with upside potential beyond the base rent from turnover leases in the majority of CSCs lettings.
New rent on leases signed in the fourth quarter represented 98 per cent of ERV.
Leases may be agreed below ERV for tenant mix enhancement, to retain exibility for a planned asset management initiative or for stabilisation of a particular area of a centre.
Forexample the fourth quarter included three lettings at Victoria Centre, Nottingham, designed to build exibility in the run up to the proposed extension.
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 38 Annual Report 2011 Operating review continued In all cases, the overall objective is long-term sustainable growth in net rental income.
This has been demonstrated by the asset management approach at Chapel eld, Norwich.
Having been open for just three years before the downturn, the centre had 18 tenant failuresout of 94 units during 2008 and 2009 including CSCs only large format Borders store.
Anumber of short-term leases were entered into for immediate stabilisation, particularly ofareas which had yet to establish themselves within the new centre.
With the objective of establishing Chapel eld as the new prime pitch of Norwich, in 2010 and 2011 a number of major brands were attracted to the centre at rental levels below ERV to establish the best retail and catering mix.
This created the ideal environment to attract shoppers and other retailers, such that 2011 net rental income is up 10 per cent, passing rent up 5 per cent, footfall up 13 per cent, retailer sales up 9 per cent and the centre is 99 per cent let.
ERVs are adjusted at each valuation date to take account of market conditions: see Investment property valuations.
At 31 December 2011 CSC had 132 short-term leases in place which represented 1 per cent of passing rent, 2 per cent of space and 4 per cent of ERV 2010 2 per cent, 4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, excluding The Traff ord Centre.
Footfall The number of customer visits to CSC centres increased by 2 per cent in 2011.
The second quarter of the year showed the highest increase relative to the same period of 2010, followed by a at autumn but a good run in to Christmas.
Chapel eld, Norwich, up 13 per cent, and Manchester Arndale, up 7 per cent, have been consistently strong all year, as have Eldon Square, Newcastle, and St Davids, Cardiff, up 6 and5per cent respectively in their second years after signi cant extensions.
Lakeside nished the year up 3 per cent, with a 2 per cent increase recorded in the fourth quarter.
Some ofthesmaller centres recorded small negative gures in the diffi cult environment including ThePotteries, Stoke-on-Trent, situated in a region whose economy has suff ered more thanmost.
Retailer sales Retailer sales in CSC centres increased by an estimated 2 per cent in total, out-performing the national trend.
The benchmark BRC non-food like-for-like index has indicated declines for the last five quarters.
Lease expiry pro le The estimated occupancy cost ratio rent to retailer turnover for the group including TheTraff ord Centre and St Davids, Cardiff, is 13.2 per cent excluding anchor stores, compared 40 to13.7 per cent at 30 June 2011, continuing the recent slight downward trend as sales continue 33% to progress ahead of rental increases.
28% 30 Lease expiry pro le CSCs average lease maturity has increased slightly to 7.5 years 31 December 2010 pro forma 20 7.3 years, largely due to the progress made on the signi cant level of expiries due in 2011 and2012 at Metrocentre.

Braehead market value 583 million, planned expenditure 12 million : With Apple and Hollister plus a new restaurant cluster open and trading well, plans have been drawn up to improve impact and sight lines on the upper mall by increasing the height of shop fronts and moving escalators.
We continue to work with the local authority on a master plan for the mix of uses in the broader Braehead area and, as part of these plans, have acquired an adjacent 31 acre site, currently a working dock, with future development potential.
Nottingham Victoria Centre market value 333 million, Broadmarsh market value 65 million : Nottingham ranks sixth in the UK in terms of available comparison shopping expenditure but has suff ered relative to other cities from a lack of modernisation of its shopping centre provision.
Following the acquisition of Broadmarsh in the last quarter of 2011, we are optimistic about the citys potential assuming a pragmatic approach by the local authority.
We aim to bring forward proposals for complementary development to upgrade both centres and the city centre overall.

Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 40 Annual Report 2011 Operating review continued International CSC holds 4.1 million shares directly in Equity One, a US retail REIT, and 11.4 million redeemable joint venture units convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares, as a result of the restructuring ofour previous investment in Californian property which was completed in January 2011.
Thisprovides an eff ective 12 per cent interest in Equity One valued at 168 million based on the31December share price of $16.98.
Its annualised dividend is $0.88 per share.
Equity One owns, develops and manages US neighbourhood shopping centres anchored by supermarket chains.
It has had an active and constructive year with sales of non-core assets exceeding $700 million, including a $473 million portfolio of 36 centres sold in a single transaction, and hasbeen recycling capital into high quality urban retail assets mainly in New York State and California.
CSCs interests in India comprise a 25 per cent interest in the shopping centre developer, Prozone, and 11.4 million shares 9.9 per cent in the listed Indian retailer, Provogue, our jointventure partner in Prozone.
Provogue has announced terms for the demerger of Prozoneas aseparately listed real estate company in 2012 which will result in approximately a32per cent interest for CSC.
The economic and political uncertainties in India in 2011 led to both its currency and stock marketproducing some of the worst falls in global markets and the share price of Provogue, in common with many small  stocks, showed a material decline in the year.
Improved sentiment as the rising interest rate cycle is considered to have peaked, helped by the relaxation of rules relating to foreign investment in Indian retailers and listed shares, has led to a signi cant rise in the stock market and Provogues share price since the year end.
Prozones first shopping centre, Aurangabad, has recorded its first full year of operations since opening in October 2010 with encouraging levels of trade at the hypermarket, other anchor stores and catering outlets.
In 2012, work is expected to commence on three mixed-use projects in Indore, Coimbatore andNagpur, to be funded locally.
Prospects and priorities Our base case assumption is that the UK economy will continue to experience low growth for some time, with continuing risk of tenant failures and closures on expiry of leases.
Our specialist skills and relationships enable us to manage those risks while identifying and developing those shopping centres which have the most potential to produce attractive returns over the medium to long term.
We consider that CSC is well positioned to create value as the market recovers.
Our strategic priorities for 2012 are: to optimise the performance of our existing assets, prioritising medium-term value creation to identify further initiatives and create the nancing exibility to advance CSCs business and deliver incremental returns David Fischel Chief Executive 23 February 2012 Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 41 and strategy review review responsibility information Financial review CSC has a robust capital structure underpinned by astute financial management Financing strategy and financial management In 2011 the Groups financial management has focused on achieving the successful integration 16.

It is pleasing to note that in respect of our additional funding aim, to achieve interest cover greater than 1.6x, following an improvement in the year to 1.71x, this target has also been achieved.
Acquisition of The Trafford Centre and associated CapitalRaising The Group successfully completed the acquisition of The Traff ord Centre on 28 January 2011.
Details of the opening balance sheet and the contribution to the Groups results are provided in note 40.
The Income Statement includes the results of The Traff ord Centre for the period from 28 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.
As part of the acquisition in January 2011, Peel subscribed 43.7million for 12.3million ordinary shares and 23.7million for convertible bonds with a nominal value of 26.7million converting into 6.7million ordinary shares at a conversion price of 400 pence, giving a total cash in ow of 67.4million.
Acquisition of Broadmarsh The Group completed the acquisition of Broadmarsh, Nottingham, on 1 December 2011 foran initial cash consideration of 73million.
This initial consideration is subject to an adjustment based on the opening net assets position.
It is anticipated that this adjustment will be nalised in the first half of 2012.
Details of the opening balance sheet and the contribution to the Groups results for the year are provided in note 40.
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 42 Annual Report 2011 Financial review continued Results for the year ended 31 December 2011 As has been widely reported, the general economic environment in the UK became increasingly challenging as 2011 progressed and it is therefore encouraging that the Group achieved a further year of growth in both like-for-like net rental income and underlying earnings per share, two of the Groups key measures of performance.
Property valuations have in aggregate been positive and overall there has been a small increase in adjusted net asset value per share.
Income statement The Group recorded a pro t for the period of 34million, a reduction on the pro t of 529million reported in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The major factors in the uctuation from 2010s result are valuation items.
These comprised a lower level of property valuation gain and a higher non-cash charge arising from the change in fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments.
The derivatives are largely interest rate swaps used to hedge theinterest rate payable on a signi cant proportion of the Groups oating rate borrowings.
The 2011 results include a 63million gain on property valuations which is more than off set bya193million non-cash charge due to the movement in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
In contrast, the 2010 results included a 497million gain on property sales and valuations from continuing operations and a 50million adverse movement in the fair value ofderivative financial instruments.
The 2010 results also included a 83million pro t, largely due to property valuation gains, from those businesses classi ed as discontinued operations, namely Capco, which was demerged in May 2010, and C&C US, which was sold for shares and instruments convertible into shares inEquity One, a US retail REIT in January 2011.
As the fair value of the Traff ord Centre net assets acquired of 756million exceeded the 703million fair value of the consideration, based on the Groups share price on 28 January 2011 of 376 pence per share, negative goodwill of 53million arose on the acquisition.
There has 1 39m been a 1million reduction to the negative goodwill gure compared to that disclosed in the 2011 Interim results mainly due to nalisation of certain taxation provisions.
This negative Underlying earnings goodwill is recorded in the Income Statement as a gain on acquisition of subsidiaries.
The disposal of the C&C US business that was completed in January 2011 resulted in a gain of 40 million before tax.
The results for the year also includes an initial deferred tax provision of14 million in respect of the investment in Equity One shares and joint venture units receivedas consideration, giving a net post-tax gain of 26 million on the combined impact ofthis transaction.
Exceptional costs in the period include finance costs of 48million being largely interest rate swap amendment costs.
Expenses relating to the two acquisitions completed in 2011, including financial advice costs in relation to the Simon Property Groups proposal, amounted to 21million in the period.
These costs are classi ed as exceptional administration costs.
The income statement includes two items arising from the Groups interests in India.
The9.0million share of associate income from Prozone, the shopping centre developer, isoff set by the impairment of 8.7million in the market value of the 9.9per cent interest in Provogue, the listed Indian retailer, as the overall Indian stock market came under pressure.
Underlying earnings which excludes valuation and exceptional items, increased by 42million to139million, as shown in the chart below.
Taking into account additional shares issued as partof the Traff ord Centre acquisition, underlying earnings per share increased by 7per cent to16.5 pence.
The Groups net rental income which increased by 4per cent on a like-for-like basis in the year bene tted from the continued growth in income at St Davids, Cardiff, Lakeside and Chapel eld.
More detail on the rental performance is included in the Business review.
Underlying net finance costs, which exclude exceptional items, increased by 35million in 2011, with the bene t of the interest rate swap amendments undertaken in January 2011 off setting the 42million cost of the Traff ord Centre CMBS notes.
Ongoing administration expenses, increased from 23million in 2010 to 24million in 2011 wholly due to inclusion of The Traff ord Centre, illustrating the continued focus on tight control ofadministration costs.

It is anticipated that approximately 90 million relating to capital at 31 December 2011 projects, both committed and currently at the planning stage, will be incurred in 2012.
Financial position At 31 December 2011, the Group had net external debt of 3,374million, an increase of 185million compared to the 31 December 2010 pro forma of 3,189million.
In addition to cash balances of 91million the Group had undrawn facilities of 357 million at 31 December 2011, the 330million undrawn element of the new revolving credit facility agreed in November 2011 and 27million on the St Davids, Cardiff, joint venture loan facility, giving total headroom of 448million.
Debt structure The Groups debt is largely arranged on an asset-speci c basis, with limited or non-recourse Debt maturity pro le from the borrowing entities to other Group companies.
It is largely syndicated bank debt and CMBS structures with corporate-level debt limited to the revolving credit facility.
970 1,000 881 The revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in mid 2013 was re nanced in November 2011 as a first step towards a broader re nancing of the Groups asset speci c debt.

At the same time, a reduction in utilisation fee levels 600 505 was also achieved.
The re nancing was delivered in a challenging market.
The table to the left shows that the value of maturities peaks in 20152017.
Consideration 400 is being given to replacing facilities early, although the associated one-off costs remain high.
However, this needs to be weighed against longer term rates currently being low.

These payments will be reported as an exceptional finance charge and will impact NAV diluted, adjusted as incurred.
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 47 and strategy review review responsibility information Covenants Full details of the loan financial covenants are included in the Other information section of this report.
The Group is in compliance with all of its corporate and asset-speci c loan covenants.
As detailed in that analysis, as a result of improved property valuations and rental income levels, the headroom over the minimum covenant levels has generally increased in the year.
Tax strategy and charge for the year Being a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT signi cantly reduces the taxation costs of the Group, but brings with it the requirement to operate within the rules of the REIT regime.
Since 2007, the Group has paid REIT entry charges of 184 million in respect of the original property portfolio and subsequent purchases with a further amount of 15million to be paid in 2012.
The Group must also meet certain REIT requirements and conditions, but doing so results in not having to pay tax on property income or gains on property sales, the financial bene ts of which to date amount to 200 million.
The Groups approach to taxation is approved by the Board and is subject to regular review.
The Group maintains an open, up-front and no-surprises policy in dealing with HMRC and as a result it is anticipated the Group will receive a low risk rating from HMRC once the recent major corporate transactions are fully absorbed into the Group.
The Group seeks pre-clearance from HMRC in complex areas and actively engages in discussions on potential or proposed changes in the taxation system that might aff ect property tax and REIT legislation.
The Group continues to pay tax on overseas earnings, any UK non-property income under the REIT rules, business rates, and transaction taxes including the REIT entry charge and stamp duty land tax.
In the year ended 31 December 2011 the total of such payments to HMRC was 54million.
In addition, the Group also collects VAT, employment taxes and withholding tax ondividends for HMRC.
The tax expense in the period of 2.6 million comprises current tax on US investments of 0.3million and deferred tax largely on the revaluation of interest rate swaps and investments of2.3million.
Matthew Roberts Finance Director 23 February 2012 Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 48 Annual Report 2011 Corporate responsibility CSC has been at the heart of many of Britains towns and cities for over 25 years.
Some of our shopping centres, including Braehead and Lakeside, have led large-scale out-of-town regeneration But our centres are more than just retail destinations.
They provide Benchmarks and accolades compelling places to shop, eat, drink and spend leisure time: and this brings communities together.
They also drive economic development, creating jobs, stimulating growth and generating revenue for our retail partners and suppliers locally, regionally, nationally and internationally.
As an owner and developer of prime shopping destinations, we understand the impact that we can have on the environment.
CSC aspires to be a leader in environmental practices and measurement, regularly exceeding national and local regulations.
We are aware that an increasing number of people who use our centres, including retail occupiers, expect nothing less than a strong commitment to environmental management.
We therefore continue to make signi cant environmental effi ciency improvements and benchmark our performance against external sustainability measures every year to ensure we are always one step ahead.
Our commitment is based on a simple premise: environmental management saves CSC money, helps keep operating costs low for our tenants and protects our reputation, all of which is good for our business.
For us, corporate responsibility isnt about marketing gloss or PR.
Its a practical and sustainable approach to doing business and making a diff erence at our centres.
It fosters conversations with the people that matter, while generating value for communities through jobs and social cohesion, and for our investors and tenants through cost control and far-sighted risk management.

Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 51 and strategy review review responsibility information Communities and economic contribution Why it matters One of our primary aims is to provide shoppers with compelling retail destinations whichwe hope will leave a lasting impression.
We strongly believe that the experience onoff er in our shopping centres goes far beyond the retail, leisure and catering mix.
Ourshopping centres are at the heart of their communities.
They provide places to meet, eat, drink and socialise.
They also support local and national charities by providing space, investment and CSC staff time.
Community outreach therefore plays a vital role inhelping make our centres part of the communities they serve.
We aim to deliver community strategies that address fundamental issues in modern society which are important to the long-term success of our business.
In particular, our joint projects focuson youth, education and the prevention of anti-social behaviour.
