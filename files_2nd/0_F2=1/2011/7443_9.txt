Exploration work is delivering positive results at the silver equivalent ounces per year.
These are typically high property which covers 46,100 hectares of continuous strike sulphidation, disseminated or gold copper porphyry deposits length at the highly productive Domeyko Fault Zone.
In 2011, and are generally open pit operations.
In 2011, $12.4 million 7,359 metres of drilling was completed.
Exploration focused was invested in finding and developing such deposits and on the porphyry potential of the property and work was the2012 budget has increased to $15.8 million.
completed on a number of targets.
The Picaron target was drill tested and significant alteration and anomalous copper mineralisation was encountered, proving it to be a true copper porphyry system.
The resource is open and may increase in Mercurio grade and thickness at depth.
Selected intercepts from these 1 exploration programmes include : VPI-DD-11-003 From 224.0265.0m depth 41.0m at 1,293 ppm Cu VPI-DD-11-003 From 316.0350.0m depth 34.6m at 869 ppm Cu, 15.6 ppm Mo Mexico VPI-DD-11-003 From 357.0368.0m depth 11.0m at 2,102 ppm Cu, 27.8 ppm Mo and 0.1 g t Au VPI-RC-11-010 From 18.032.0m depth 14.0m at 0.39% Cu and 0.43% Mn Includes: 6.0m at 0.53% Cu and 0.62% Mn The drilling campaign of 6,800 metres in 2012 will include offset drilling of the recently reported intercepts in and around Coriwasi the Picaron target as well as continued definition drilling of the exotic copper oxide deposit.
A data compilation and surface exploration programme will also be carried out over the entire Victoria property in 2012 and the drilling of defined targets Peru will subsequently take place in the second half of the year.
Apacheta Valeriano: Chile Huachoja The 100% owned Valeriano property in Chile is located Soranpampa 27kilometres north of Barrick Gold Corporations Pascua Lama project, in close proximity to the border with Argentina, and covers an area of 3,750 hectares.
The property hosts both high-sulphidation as well as porphyry style disseminated gold mineralisation.
The property has been explored by a number of mining companies in the past, including Phelps Dodge 19891991 and Barrick 19951997, both of which completed drill campaigns totalling 12,575 metres.
Victoria Nosignificant exploration had been undertaken attheproperty since 1997.
Encrucijada Chile Hochschild commenced drilling at Valeriano in October 2011 La Falda and at the end of the year, 2,302 metres had been drilled, with anomalous gold and molybdenum intercepts reported.
