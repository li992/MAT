The British Land Share Ownership Plan the Trust, a discretionary trust, has been established to facilitate the operation of the above long-term incentive schemes.
The Trustees of the Trust purchase the Companys ordinary shares in the open market in order to satisfy the above Awards.
If Awards vest, immediately after vesting, shares are transferred out of the Trust to the Schemes participants as appropriate.
Dividends under the above share incentive schemes are retained by the Trust in interest bearing accounts and are payable to employees only on the vesting of the employees shares: along with, in the case of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, interest earned on the dividends.
In the event of a variation of capital, the Trustees having considered the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have discretion to take such action as they consider appropriate.
Directors pension benefits for the year ended 31 March 2011 Three Executive Directors, Lucinda Bell, Graham Roberts and Tim Roberts, earned pension benefits in schemes sponsored by the Company during the year.
Although Lucinda Bell was appointed an Executive Director on 11 March 2011, legislation requires disclosures of the amounts of and changes in, accrued pension benefits for all service rather than just service as a Director, and also to disclose the change that happened over the whole year, rather than just the period as a Director.
Chris Grigg receives a sum equal to 35% of basic salary in lieu of pension contributions, which for the year amounted to 280,000 2010: 280,000.
The Company also contributed a sum equal to 15% of Charles Maudsley and Stephen Smiths basic salaries, which amounted to 63,750 to each Director 2010: 10,625 for Charles Maudsley and 15,685 for Stephen Smith.
As a result of changes introduced by the UK Finance Act 2004 affecting the taxation of pensions from 6 April 2006, Executive Directors and other senior employees were offered the option of having benefits in excess of their lifetime allowance provided by an unfunded non-registered arrangement.
Mr Graham Roberts has opted to have part of his benefits in excess of the lifetime allowance and annual allowance provided in this manner.
The Remuneration Committee is willing to adopt a flexible approach to providing retirement benefits at a time of significant change to the taxation system affecting pension scheme benefits and in the light of changes announced in 2010 particularly affecting defined benefit schemes resolved to: 1 Limit the increase in defined benefit accrual to currently 3,125 a year.
2 Provide the contractual promise in excess of this annual amount either by means of an unfunded Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme EFRBS if it is tax efficient or through a pensions allowance instead.
3 Keep the costs broadly similar from a Company perspective.

Since the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 came into force, company accounts are subject to two sets of disclosure requirements.
The extended Companies Act 2006 requirements have to be observed in addition to the current UK Listing Authority requirements.
The requirements differ slightly and these Regulations are expected to remain in force for the time being.
The alternative disclosures shown in the two tables below provide the details of Directors pensions necessary to satisfy the two sets of requirements.

Notes 1 The total accrued pension shown are those that would be paid annually on retirement at age 60 based on service to the end of the year.
2 Graham Roberts has a contractual entitlement of a pension of 2 3rds of Final Pensionable Salary at age 60.
This contractual entitlement is being met using FURBS DC account: an unfunded EFRBS top-up arrangement and a pension payable from the British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme.
Since 2006 accrual in the FURBS arrangement was no longer tax efficient and the balance of Graham Roberts contractual promise is now being met by the unfunded EFRBS arrangement.
3 The benefit provided by the FURBS was a lump sum paid based on salary above the Earnings Cap.
To convert this into pension equivalent at the start of the year we have used the basis used for setting commutation factors in the British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme.
4 Contributions and investment returns in the FURBS are taxed whereas the benefits are paid tax free.
The pension equivalent shown above for Graham Roberts are a mixture of FURBS pension paid free of income tax and pension from the Registered Scheme and EFRBS that will be taxed as income.
5 Members of the Scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
6 The following is additional information relating to Directors pensions for those included in the above table: a Normal retirement age for pension arrangements is age 60: b Members of the Scheme were not required to pay contributions during the year: c Retirement may take place at any age after 55 subject to the consent of both the Company and the Trustees of the Scheme.
Pensions are reduced to allow for their earlier payment: d On death in service, the Scheme provides a capital sum equal to four times salary and a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members prospective pension at age 60.
If a Member is entitled to a deferred pension, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members accrued pension is payable on death before or after retirement.
These pensions are paid throughout the spouses lifetime or until the youngest child reaches age 18 or age 23 if in full time education, if later: e Pensions are guaranteed to increase each year in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI subject to a maximum of 5%.
The Trustees may grant additional discretionary increases subject to the consent of the Company.
Statutory increases apply to pensions during deferment: f Transfer value calculations allow for discretionary pension increases such that, in aggregate, pension increases in line with increases in the RPI are valued.
7 The premiums paid in respect of life cover exclude accidental death cover insured with Cassidy Davis whilst increases to Group life cover were being underwritten.
This Report was approved by the Board on 22 May 2011.
