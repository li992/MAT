Although the RISK controls framework within LGIM Holdings has allowed the uncertainty in markets to be managed, a lack of confidence remains in the sector which may result in increased downgrade or default of counterparties.
LGIM Holdings seeks to limit the potential exposure to loss from counterparty and third-party failure through financial strength based pre-selection criteria for those counterparties with which the Group will do business and the setting of pre-dened risk based limits on concentrations.
This includes a number of dened policies and procedures covering different types of counterparty exposure and ongoing contingency strategies inplace relating to eurozone failure.
REGULATION AND The markets in which the Group operates are highly regulated, with regulation and legislation dening the overall framework for the design, marketing and distribution of products: the acceptance and administration of business: and the prudential capital that regulated companies LEGISLATION should hold.
Current areas of significant regulatory change include, the changes within, and to, the FSA, Solvency II and Development in OTC market infrastructure, MiFID II and the US FATCA legislation.
Dedicated control functions exist in LGIM and Group to review and assess these changes and to ensure that actions are taken to maintain compliance.
