qxp:u10775 12 p26-41 Directors' Report 14 6 11 17:06 Page 25 Bleed: 0 mm Scale: 100% DIRECTORS REPORT The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2011. BUSINESS REVIEW Principal Activity and Investment Status The Company is a public limited company in terms of the Companies Act 2006 and is an investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006.
In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has directed its affairs so as to be able to continue to seek approval as an investment trust from the HM Revenue & Customs under Section 1158 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 2010.
Investment Policy The objective of the Company is to provide long-term capital appreciation for its shareholders through investment in companies operating in emerging markets or whose stocks are listed on the stock markets of such countries.
No material change will be made to this policy without shareholder approval.
The Investment Manager employs a bottom-up, value oriented, long-term approach to investing.
It focuses on the market price of a company relative to the Investment Managers evaluation of the companys long-term earnings, asset value and cash flow potential.
As it looks for investment, it focuses on specific companies and undertakes in-depth research to construct an action list from which it makes its buy decisions.
Before a purchase is made, it looks at the companys potential earnings and growth over a five-year horizon.
During its analysis, it also considers the companys position in its sector, the economic framework and political environment.
Risk is spread by investing in a number of countries and companies.
Where possible, investment will generally be made directly in the stock markets of emerging countries.
Where the Investment Manager determines appropriate, for example to gain access to markets closed to foreign portfolio investors, investment may be made in emerging markets through collective investment schemes, although such investment is not likely to be substantial.
As at 31 March 2011 the Company had no such investments.
In addition, investment in companies listed on more developed countries stock exchanges may also be made where those companies have a significant source of their revenue from emerging countries.
The Investment Manager does not anticipate investing a significant part of the Companys assets in such companies.
Templeton Asset Management Ltd. TAML or the Investment Manager, the Investment Manager of the Company, will invest directly only in countries where it is satisfied that acceptable custodial and other arrangements are in place to safeguard TEMITs investments and in companies where there is evidence of satisfactory governance procedures.
It is intended that the Companys funds will normally be invested in equity investments.
However, the Investment Manager may invest in equity-related investments such as convertibles where there are believed to be advantages to so doing.
The portfolio may frequently be over-weight or under-weight against the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and may be concentrated into a more limited number of sectors, geographical areas or countries.
This is consistent with the stated investment approach of long-term value investing.
The Investment Manager evaluates investment opportunities with updated financial ratios on a daily basis, and, where opportunities are identified, adjusts the portfolio to seek optimal exposures to stocks which are assessed to be the best bargains in global emerging markets.
The Investment Manager searches for well-managed companies assessed as undervalued, especially those that are out-offavour among investors.
On the other hand, the Investment Manager sells companies that, in its opinion, are overvalued, typically when the earnings prospects or underlying net asset values are fully recognised by other investors.

qxp:u10775 12 p26-41 Directors' Report 14 6 11 17:06 Page 26 Bleed: 0 mm Scale: 100% DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED The Investment Managers investment research and portfolio construction processes may be summarised in six steps: 1 Identify Opportunities A master list is compiled which is screened for securities that meet certain market capitalisation and liquidity criteria as determined by the Investment Manager: 2 Analyse Companies A detailed analysis of the companys industry and financial accounts is undertaken along with a visit to the company to interview management, assess its quality of product or services, analyse customers and competitors and ascertain competitive advantage: 3 Construct Action List Each company on this list has a specified buy and sell target.
This selection list is a dynamic list that is monitored continually: 4 Allocate Portfolio On a weekly basis, the portfolio is reviewed for consistency and to ensure that it complies with the Investment Managers investment committee guidelines: and 5 Evaluate and Monitor Portfolio Once the portfolio has been constructed, each investment within the portfolio is reviewed against price targets set for the securities.
These targets are continually updated, with comparisons made with the sector in which the investee company operates.
Contact is also maintained with the company and its suppliers and staff.
6 Risk framework This utilises a comprehensive, integrated investment risk management approach structured to ensure risks are recognised, rational and rewarded.
This investment risk program focuses on ensuring that the portfolio managers understand that the risks in the portfolio at the security, sector and country level, that these risks are consistent with their investment convictions, and have an opportunity for a commensurate reward.
The Investment Manager employs a global team of dedicated investment risk management specialists who work collaboratively with the portfolio managers to provide an independent perspective on portfolio risks and returns.
Additionally, all investment activities are subject to review and oversight from global risk committees covering particularly complex areas of risk, including complex securities, counterparty risk, valuation and liquidity.
The general policy of the Board is to be fully invested.
In response to market conditions, the Investment Manager may hold funds temporarily in cash or other appropriate assets.
Key Performance Indicators The following are considered key performance indicators for the Company: the return in net asset value per share compared to its benchmark: the movement in share price and discount: and, the total expense ratio.
Performance The Investment Manager employs a value investing strategy and purchases companies trading at less than their assessed value.
In the year to 31 March 2011, the Companys net asset value per share produced a total return dividend re-invested of 16.5%.
This was ahead of the Companys benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which returned 12.4%.
Since launch, the Company is well ahead of the benchmark as the net asset value total return for TEMIT is 2,553% 16.3% per annum compared with a total return of 1,078% 12.1% per annum for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
The graphs on page 5 show the total return of TEMITs NAV and share price relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the relative annual total return of TEMITs NAV and share price against the MSCI Emerging Markets Index over the last 10 years.
The Chairmans Statement on pages 6 to 7 and the Investment Managers Report on pages 11 to 17 include a review of the main developments during the year and the investment outlook.

The share price of TEMIT increased by 14.4% to 660.0 pence as at 31 March 2011 from 577.0 pence as at 31 March 2010.
Over the year, the Companys share price discount to NAV has generally been in the range of 3% to 9%.
As at 31 March 2011, the discount had widened slightly to 8.1% from 7.0% at 31 March 2010.
Share Price Discount to NAV % 5.0 0.0 -5.0 -10.0 -15.0 -20.0 Mar-06 Mar-07 Mar-08 Mar-09 Mar-10 Mar-11 TEMIT Share Price Discount, based on a 15 day moving average During the year 50,000 shares of 25 pence each were repurchased, representing 0.02% of the issued share capital, at a cost to the Company of 0.3 million.
These shares were cancelled which resulted in a small benefit to the net asset value per share.
In the period from 1 April 2011 to 14 June 2011, no shares were bought back and cancelled.
Expense Ratio The Total Expense Ratio TER has increased from 1.29% for the period to 31 March 2010, to 1.31% for the year to 31 March 2011.
This increase was largely attributable to VAT recoveries which benefited the prior period TER and which were not repeated in the current year.

qxp:u10775 12 p26-41 Directors' Report 14 6 11 17:06 Page 28 Bleed: 0 mm Scale: 100% DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Results and Dividends The capital profit for the year was 314.4 million 2010: 851.4 million and the revenue profit was 20.3 million 2010: 9.5 million.
Capital profit was lower compared to the period to 31 March 2010 as large gains seen in 2009 as markets recovered following the downturn were not repeated in the year to 31 March 2011.
Revenue profits increased as a result of: a number of companies returned to paying out increased dividends following reductions last period following the economic downturn in 2008: and the prior period covered eleven months as a result of the change in accounting year end date.
Consequently, April, traditionally a strong month for dividend receipts, was not included in the results to 31 March 2010.
The full results for the Company are disclosed in the Income Statement on page 44.
The Directors propose an ordinary dividend of 4.25 pence per share 2010: 3.75 pence.
The dividend represents an increase of 13.3% on the amount paid last year 3.9% annualised.
If approved by shareholders at the AGM, to be held on 22 July 2011, the ordinary dividend will be payable on 27 July 2011 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 24 June 2011.
Gearing The Board has agreed that in exceptional circumstances, and for short periods, TEMIT may borrow up to 10% of its net assets.
During the year the Company did not utilise this short term borrowing facility.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by your Board, are summarised below.
The Board monitors risk on a quarterly basis as part of the Board meetings including benchmark and performance attribution, risk analysis, contributors and detractors, major overweight and underweights and portfolio information including purchases and sales.
In addition the Directors, on an annual basis, receive a comprehensive risk and control analysis identifying the areas of risk and mitigating controls which are in place.
As part of this review, the Directors also ensure that the Companys primary service providers have adopted an appropriate framework of controls, monitoring and reporting to enable the Directors to evaluate these risks.
Investment risk The Company may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of one issuer, securities domiciled in a particular country, or securities within one industry.
In addition, emerging markets can be subject to greater price volatility and more rapid and severe re-rating than developed markets.
In periods of pronounced volatility, the differential between emerging market stocks, markets and countries decreases.
In such times, the benefits that diversification generally provides are reduced.
As a result of both these factors, there is the potential for increased concentration risk in terms of economic, business and political exposures which may result in greater fluctuation in the value of the portfolio.
Market risk Many of the companies in which TEMIT does or may invest are, by reason of the locations in which they operate, exposed to the risk of political or economic change.
In addition, exchange control, tax or other regulations introduced in any country in which TEMIT invests may affect its income and the value and marketability of its investments.
Investors in emerging markets may face settlement and custodial problems.
Furthermore, companies in emerging markets are not always subject to accounting, auditing and financial standards which are equivalent to those applicable in the United Kingdom and there may also be less government supervision and regulation.
These risks can increase the potential for losses in the Company and affect its share price.
For these reasons, a long-term approach to investing in emerging markets is taken.

qxp:u10775 12 p26-41 Directors' Report 14 6 11 17:06 Page 29 Bleed: 0 mm Scale: 100% Foreign currency risk It is important to recognise the effect of currency movements on TEMITs performance.
In general, if the value of sterling increases compared with a foreign currency, an investment traded in that foreign currency will decrease in value because it will be worth fewer UK pounds.
This can have a negative effect on fund performance.
Conversely, when, in general, sterling weakens in relation to a foreign currency, investments traded in that foreign currency will increase in value, which can contribute to an improvement in the Companys performance.
Credit risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment purchase or cash in relation to sale or declared dividend after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
Operational risk Like many other investment trust companies, the Company has no employees.
The Company therefore relies upon the services provided by third parties and is dependent upon the control systems of the Investment Manager and the Companys service providers.
The security, for example, of the Companys assets, dealing procedures, accounting records and maintenance of regulatory and legal requirements depend on the effective operation of these systems.
These are regularly tested and monitored and an internal control report, which includes an assessment of risks together with an overview of procedures to mitigate such risks, is prepared by the Secretary and Administrator and reviewed by the Audit Committee annually.
The global custodian JPMorgan Chase Bank produces a bi-annual SAS 70 report which is reviewed by its auditors and gives assurance regarding the effective operation of controls.
Key personnel The ability of the Company to achieve its investment objective is significantly dependent upon the expertise of the Investment Manager and its ability to attract and retain suitable staff.
The Investment Manager has endeavoured to ensure that the principal members of their management teams are suitably incentivised, but the retention of such staff cannot be guaranteed.
Regulatory risk The Company operates in a complex and changing regulatory environment and faces a number of regulatory risks.
A breach of Section 1158 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 2010 would result in the Company being subject to capital gains tax on portfolio investments.
Breaches of other regulations, such as the UKLA Listing Rules, could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and reputational damage.
Further information on the risks that TEMIT is subject to including additional financial and valuation risks are also detailed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL Share Capital Changes in the share capital of the Company are set out in Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Going Concern Having made suitable enquiries, including considerations of expenditure forecasts and the principal risks and uncertainties described within the Annual Report, the Directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, as such, a going concern basis is appropriate in preparing the financial statements.
Comparative Information The financial statements in 2010 were prepared for the eleven months to 31 March 2010.
The change of year end was initiated by the Directors to allow shareholders to more readily compare the Companys financial performance with that of TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 29 u10775 12 p25-38 Directors' Report.

As a result, the comparative information presented is for the eleven months from 1 May 2009 to 31 March 2010 and is not entirely comparable with the information presented for the year to 31 March 2011.
Creditor Payment Policy Investment transactions are settled by the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant market.
While the Company follows no formal code, its policy is to agree the terms of payment at the start of business and ensure that the supplier is aware of the terms of payment.
Payment is made in accordance with these terms provided that the supplier is also complying with all the relevant terms and conditions.

qxp:u10775 12 p26-41 Directors' Report 14 6 11 17:06 Page 32 Bleed: 0 mm Scale: 100% DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Directors Conflicts of Interest The Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act sets out directors general duties.
Under the 2006 Act, a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the Companys interests.
The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
The 2006 Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect.
The Companys Articles give the Directors authority to approve such situations.
There are safeguards which apply when Directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
Firstly, only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered are able to make the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Companys success.
The Directors are able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
The Company maintains a register of Directors conflicts of interest which have been disclosed and approved by the other Directors.
This register is kept up to date and the Directors annually complete an updated conflicts of interest questionnaire disclosing any conflicts or potential conflicts.
Gregory Johnson is not present when the performance of the Investment Manager and the Secretary and Administrator are considered.
Indemnification and Insurance The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with each of the Directors.
These are qualifying third party indemnity provisions and are in force as at the date of this report.
This information is disclosed in accordance with Sections 236 2 and 236 3 of the 2006 Act.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against the Directors.
Remuneration The Companys policy on Directors remuneration, together with details of the remuneration of each Director who served in the year is detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 40.
The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Directors should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts similar in size, capital structure and investment objective.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits in accordance with other long standing investment trusts.
TEMIT has no employees and therefore no retirement or health scheme obligations or policies in respect of employment, including the employment of disabled persons.
No Director had notified the Company of any beneficial interest including any family interest existing either at the beginning or at the end of the year to 31 March 2011 in the Companys shares save as follows: 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Peter A Smith 10,000 10,000 Hamish N Buchan 15,000 15,000 Sir Peter Burt 4,000 4,000 Neil A Collins 7,000 7,000 Peter O Harrison 2,535 Nil The Company has not received notification of any changes in the above interests as at 14 June 2011.

TAML acted as Investment Manager to the Company under an investment management agreement and received from the Company a monthly fee at an annual rate of 1.00% of the total net assets of the Company.
The Board have examined the basis on which the Investment Manager is remunerated and considers that this flat rate ad valorem fee is appropriate and that it is not in the interests of shareholders to include a structured performance fee.
The investment management agreement between the Company and TAML is of an unlimited duration and may be terminated by either party but in certain circumstances the Company may be required to pay compensation to TAML of an amount up to one years management fee.
Compensation is not payable if at least one years notice of termination is given.
The Board considers the arrangements for the provision of investment management services to the Company on an ongoing basis and a formal review is conducted annually.
When assessing the performance of the Investment Manager, the Board believes it is appropriate to make this assessment over a medium to long term timeframe which is in accordance with the long term approach taken to investment.
In the opinion of the Directors, the continuing appointment of TAML on the agreed terms is in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole.
The Directors believe that TAML is well positioned to act as Investment Manager to the Company and well resourced to identify attractive investment opportunities and this is evident by the Investment Managers performance to date.
Secretarial and Administration Managers During the year Franklin Templeton Investment Management Limited.
FTIML acted as Secretary and Administrator of the Company.
The fee paid to FTIML for this is an annual rate of 0.20% of the total net assets of the Company, payable monthly.

Its ethical policy is focused on ensuring that its funds are properly managed and invested within the guidelines approved by the Board.
The Board receives regular reports on the policies and controls in place.
The Investment Manager invests in companies that it considers to be well managed and subject to appropriate corporate governance.
A well-managed company is considered to be one which complies with all the relevant legislation and which meets the environmental, social, community and ethical requirements of the country in which it operates.
It is important to recognise that local laws and requirements of emerging markets do not necessarily equate with those of developed countries.
Environmental, social, and governance issues have become increasingly important to companies worldwide as they seek to balance organisational goals with the expectations of their stakeholders in an increasingly complex operating environment.
When companies manage these stakeholder relationships effectively, they are more successful at managing risks and capturing opportunities placing them in a better position for long-term success.
As a long-term investor, the Investment Manager performs extensive bottom-up investment analysis, employing rigorous and comprehensive processes to assess both the risk and return potential of the investments it considers for the Company.
The depth of its research provides comprehensive insights into the many factors that affect the value of an investment, which may include environmental, social and governance issues.
The Investment Manager determines the extent to which various research inputs are included and weighted in its investment decisions.
Institutional Shareholder Voting and Engagement As an institutional investor, the Company recognises its responsibility that the companies in which it invests should aspire to appropriate levels of corporate governance.
As a matter of policy, the Company aims to utilise its votes in shares held in the relevant underlying portfolio companies at the annual general meetings of these companies.
The Company has engaged with the Investment Manager in relation to its approach to the Stewardship Code the Code.
The Company and the Investment Manager generally support the Principles of the Code as outlined below.
Ongoing monitoring of investee companies and dialogue with management are fundamental to the Investment Managers investment approach.
The strategy on intervention with investee companies is dealt with on a case by case basis and is usually a judgement made by the portfolio managers based on the research done on each investee company for the investment decision making progress.
In all cases, the Investment Manager holds regular review meetings with the senior management of investee companies.
In exceptional circumstances, the Investment Manager may provide a director to the investee company.
The Investment Manager considers the key objectives are to seek to obtain value for the Company and to comply with its fiduciary duties.
The level of engagement with investee companies derives from the fiduciary duties of the Investment Manager to the Company.
Thus, for example, in voting shares, the Investment Manager considers what would be in the best interests of the Company.
Similarly, there will be many instances in which actions such as a dialogue between the Investment Manager and the management of investee companies, or with other shareholders, may help to maximise shareholder value.
At the same time, there may be instances in which activism is not consistent with the Investment Managers fiduciary duty.
For example, in the process of company research and monitoring, a significant problem or risk may be identified and the Investment Manager may decide it is better simply to sell a position than seek to undertake a lengthy engagement with management.
Decisions involving when and how to engage with management or carry out collective engagement are matters of judgement.
Consequently, there are no set guidelines adopted on when this should occur.
The Investment Manager has adopted proxy voting policies and procedures which cover voting guidelines, processing and maintenance of proxy records and conflicts of interest.

Voting records for the Company detailing the proxies voted for investee companies are not currently published.
The Company considers that there is limited demand for such detailed disclosure and therefore the administrative burden and expense is not justified.

Authority for the Allotment of New Shares The resolutions to allot shares are set out in resolutions 13 and 14 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
These resolutions, if passed, will give your Directors power to allot for cash equity securities of the Company up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of 4,123,304 being an amount equal to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2011 as if Section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act did not apply This section requires, when shares are to be allotted for cash, such new shares first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings of shares, this entitlement being known as pre-emption rights.

TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 37 u10775 12 p25-38 Directors' Report.
qxp:u10775 12 p26-41 Directors' Report 14 6 11 17:06 Page 38 Bleed: 0 mm Scale: 100% DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED The Directors are seeking renewal of the authority to purchase the Companys shares in the market, being a maximum of 14.99% of the shares in issue on 22 July 2011 or 49,446,666 shares, whichever is the lower, at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Purchases will only be made for cash at a cost which is below the prevailing net asset value per share.
Under the rules of the UK Listing Authority, the maximum price which may be paid is the higher of a 5% above the average market value of the shares for the five business days before the purchase is made and b that stipulated by Article 5 1 of the Buyback and Stabilisation Regulation.
The minimum price payable for the shares will be 25 pence per share.
Purchases will be funded either by using available cash resources, by selling investments in the portfolio or by borrowing.
The authority to purchase shares will only be exercised if to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally and would result in an increase in asset value per share for the remaining shareholders.
Other than in accordance with a dispensation from the UK Listing Authority, no shares will be purchased by the Company during periods when the Company would be prohibited from making such purchases by the rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The Directors envisage seeking the renewal of the relevant authority in 2012 and in each succeeding year.
Notice period for general meetings At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 23 July 2010, a Special Resolution was passed authorising the Company to call general meetings other than annual general meetings on 14 days clear notice, up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2011.
The Directors are seeking renewal of the authority to call general meetings other than annual general meetings on 14 days clear notice, up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2012.
This resolution is required to reflect the implementation of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive which requires that all general meetings must be held on 21 days notice, unless shareholders agree to a shorter notice period.
The Directors only intend to call a general meeting on less than 21 days notice where the proposals are time sensitive and the short notice would clearly be an advantage to shareholders as a whole.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next annual general meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under the Directive before it can call a general meeting on 14 days notice.
Recommendation The Directors believe all the resolutions proposed are in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole and recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of all the resolutions.
The results of the votes on the resolutions at the Annual General Meeting will be published on the Companys website www.
