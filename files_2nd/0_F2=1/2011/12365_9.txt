Business review Operating review Dukat Our cornerstone asset and largest silver mine Russia, Magadan Region Managing director: Gennady Kuzmenko Employees: 1,911 Located in the Magadan Region in the Russian Far East, Dukat is one of Polymetals original assets.
3rd It is the third largest silver deposit Largest silver deposit in the world in the world, the largest primary silver operation in Russia and our flagship operation.
17% The Dukat hub was created in 2008 Silver production in 2011: 17.0 Moz by merging the Dukat and Lunnoye operating units.
It consists of the Omsukchan concentrator, which processes ore from the Dukat and Goltsovoye mines, and the 401 Moz Lunnoye processing plant, which Silver reserves and resources, Moz processes ore from the Lunnoye and Arylakh mines, as well as concentrate from the Omsukchan facility.
The Dukat hub also includes 83% the Nachalny-2 mine.
Adjusted EBITDA growth, 2011 2010, % The year ahead In 2012, the Dukat hub will Grades will remain at around continue to see a decrease current levels which, combined in open-pit mining volumes with improved recoveries, as open-pittable deposits will allow us to achieve moderate approach depletion.
However growth in volumes of silver underground mining volumes at produced.
No major reconstruction Dukat, Goltsovoye and Lunnoye or modifications are expected will continue to grow and will at the existing processing become the key source of ore, plants, and near-mine exploration worked through a combination activities will continue with the aim of open stoping and cut-and-fill of further strengthening the hubs methods to maintain full utilisation resource base.
