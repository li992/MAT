Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 36 Remuneration Committee report continued Remuneration policy The Companys remuneration policy is designed to reward Executive Directors with remuneration arrangements that are competitive, but not excessive and which closely align the interests of the Directors and shareholders.
The policy is designed to ensure that a signifi cant proportion of the total remuneration is dependent upon the Groups fi financial performance over the fi scal year, as well as over extended periods and that the remuneration policy is aligned to the Groups risk profi le.
These objectives are achieved through a combination of base salary and benefi ts, performance-related annual bonuses, a defi ned contribution pension scheme and long-term incentive plans.
The Committee considers, when reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Senior Executives, the wider remuneration levels of all employees of the Group.
The Committee reviews the average base salary increases applied across the Group when base salary increases of the Executive Directors and Senior Executives are considered.
The audited tables and related notes are identifi ed within the report, with the A key.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Companys forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2012.
Executive remuneration The main elements of Executive Directors remuneration for 2011 and for 2012 are shown below, together with what was paid in 2010 for comparative purposes.
2012 2011 A 2011 2010 Maximum Maximum 2011 2010 2012 Base salary Base salary bonus bonus 2011 2010 Total Total Executive Base salary and fees and fees potential potential Actual bonus Actual bonus remuneration remuneration Mike Norris 500,000 500,000 475,000 600,000 550,000 350,350 467,875 850,350 942,875 Tony Conophy 325,000 332,465 314,800 300,000 290,000 192,560 221,630 525,025 536,430 Each Executive Directors base salary is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains appropriate and fair.
In setting base salary levels, the Committee considers a variety of factors including information provided by the remuneration consultants, Mercer, on remuneration levels and trends in peer companies.
The Executive Directors receive benefi ts in line with those offered to employees throughout the Group, including the provision of a car allowance, life insurance, personal accident insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Groups Save as You Earn scheme SAYE, as well as participation in the fl exible benefi ts scheme MyBenefi ts.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37 Performance-related bonus scheme The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important that the Executive Directors are incentivised in a way that aligns with the Companys strategy and the interests of the Companys shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee has devised a performance-related bonus scheme for the Executive Directors which is well structured and aims to achieve this objective.
Each December, the Remuneration Committee meets to set not only the base salary for the Executive Directors, but to determine the performance targets for their bonuses for the forthcoming year.
The Executive Directors are then notifi ed of these targets in January.
However, once set, the Committee continually reviews these targets throughout the year to ensure that they remain appropriate.
For example, in 2011, the Remuneration Committee revised upwards the profi ts targets for the Executive Directors following the successful acquisitions of both Top Info SAS and Damax AG.
The bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors for 2011 and 2012 are: Performance target element 2012 2011 Mike Norris Profi t Group profi t before tax Up to 45% Up to 45% Services contribution growth Up to 15% Up to 15% Cost savings Up to 10% Up to 10% Cash balance Up to 10% Up to 10% Personal objectives Up to 20% Up to 20% Total: 100% of max.
bonus potential Maximum bonus potential 600,000 550,000 Base salary 500,000 500,000 Maximum potential bonus % of base salary 120% 110% Actual bonus paid 350,350 % of base salary 70.1% Tony Conophy Profi t Group profi t before tax Up to 45% Up to 45% Services contribution growth Up to 10% Up to 10% Cost savings Up to 15% Up to 10% Cash balance Up to 10% Up to 15% Personal objectives Up to 20% Up to 20% Total: 100% of max.
bonus potential Maximum bonus potential 300,000 290,000 Base salary 325,000 315,000 Potential bonus % of base salary 92.3% 92.1% Actual bonus paid 192,560 % of base salary 61.1% Within each performance target element, the Remuneration Committee has set stepped thresholds that have to be achieved for a proportion, or for the whole, of that bonus element to be paid.
The personal objective targets are non-fi financial targets and will only be paid provided that the profi t performance target has been achieved and that the Remuneration Committee is fully satisfi ed that the personal objectives have been met.
Notwithstanding that the performance targets might be achieved, in order to provide for unexpected circumstances, the payment of any bonus to an Executive Director is at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee normally determines in February of each year whether the performance targets for the previous year have been met, including the personal objectives, and the amount of bonus to be paid to the Executive Director in relation to that year.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 38 Remuneration Committee report continued Pension The Executive Directors participate in the Computacenter Pension Scheme, a defi ned contribution salary sacrifi ce scheme, under which a maximum annual Company contribution of 5,975 per employee is payable, based on base salary.
For 2011, the CEO and Finance Director received the maximum annual Company contribution of 5,975.
The scheme is open to all UK employees and allows employees to make additional salary sacrifi ces, which the Company may contribute to the scheme, on their behalf.
Long-term incentive plans Long-term incentive plans are considered to be an important part of the executive remuneration policy, designed to support management retention and motivation, whilst aligning senior managements interests with those of shareholders.
The details of the historical grants and associated performance conditions are set out in the table of Directors Interests in Share Plans on page 40.
Performance Share Plan annual awards The Performance Share Plan 2005 PSP is the Companys primary long-term incentive plan for Executive Directors and Senior Executives and has been operating since 2006.
The Remuneration Committee approves grants under this scheme, once a year, although further grants may be made in appropriate circumstances.
Under the PSP, awards may be made to Executive Directors and Senior Executives in the form of either a conditional right to acquire shares in the Company or the grant of a nil-cost option to acquire shares.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction over a three-year period of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time the awards are made.
At the end of 2010, the Remuneration Committee commissioned an external adviser, Mercer, to undertake a review of the PSP in the context of the overall remuneration packages of Executives, which culminated in the shareholders passing a resolution at last years AGM, whereby the rules of the PSP the PSP Rules were amended.
The principal amendments to the PSP Rules were that: 1 in any one year, the market value of shares in respect of which awards can be made to an Executive can now be up to two times base salary previously the multiple was one and, in exceptional circumstances, the multiple can now be four times base salary previously the multiple was two : and 2 awards under the plan may now be made as nil-priced options rather than performance shares and options granted are now capable of being exercised for a seven-year period following vesting: and 3 the performance measure for awards from 2011 onwards was changed from EPS growth relative to infl ation to absolute EPS growth: and 4 the vesting schedule was amended to ensure that the increase in the maximum award is subject to stretch performance measures.
The amendments to the PSP Rules were to allow for potentially greater rewards in return for achieving more signifi cant growth targets, to encourage the retention of interests in shares following vesting at the end of the three-year performance period and to give the Executives fl exibility to choose when to exercise their awards.
The PSP awards granted to the Executive Directors on 17 March 2011 were made on the assumption that the PSP Rules would be amended at the 2011 AGM and hence the multiple of two times base salary was used for each Executive Director in determining the awards.
The awards made were subject to the PSP Rules being amended at the 2011 AGM and the performance criteria for the awards are set out in note 9 in the table of Directors Interests in Share Plans on page 40.
In summary, the vesting schedule for the award was as follows: One-quarter of the shares will vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period from 1 January 2011 to 31December 2013 the Performance Period equals 7.5 per cent per annum.
One-half of the shares will vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the Performance Period equals 10 per cent per annum.
If the compound annual EPS growth rate over the Performance Period is between 7.5 per cent and 10 per cent over the Performance Period, shares awarded will vest on a straight line basis up to one-half.
Awarded shares will vest in full if the compound annual EPS growth equals or exceeds 20 per cent or more over the Performance Period.
Earnings per share EPS have been chosen as a performance measure as it is widely used and is considered a transparent yardstick.
EPS is calculated on a pre-exceptional, diluted basis.
After careful review it was agreed that EPS was the most appropriate performance measure for the long-term incentive plan.
It has the benefi t of being a published number and is widely understood by management and shareholders alike.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Share options The Company also operates the Computacenter Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 the Option Scheme.
As the PSP is the primary long-term incentive scheme, the Remuneration Committee intends that the scheme be used only in exceptional circumstances.
No grants were made to employees or Directors, under this scheme, during 2011.
The Executive Directors have historically been awarded share options under the Companys previous share option plans and details of these grants can be found in the table of Directors Interests in Share Plans on page 40.
The maximum number of options that can be awarded under the Option Scheme is three times base salary, although this can be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
If a grant is to be made to an Executive Director, it is current policy to grant a maximum of 1.25 times base salary.
Should grants be made under the scheme in 2012, any applicable performance conditions will be subject to review by the Remuneration Committee, taking account of prevailing market conditions, Group plans and objectives.
There is currently no intention to make grants under the Option Scheme.
Dilution limits The Company uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy awards under the Option, PSP and Share Save Plans.
In line with best practice, the use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any ten-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary schemes of 5 per cent in the same period.
As at the year-end, the potential dilution from awards under all share plans was approximately 5.26 per cent and the potential dilution from awards under the discretionary schemes was approximately 1.61 per cent.
Minimum shareholding In February 2011, the Remuneration Committee approved the Minimum Shareholding Policy which requires the Executive Directors and Senior Executives to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company over a fi five-year period.
The minimum holding for each year is set with reference to the share price at 31December in the preceding year using the below mentioned multiples for the Executive concerned: Group 1 CEO 2 x base salary Group 2 Finance Director 1 x base salary Executives within the remit of the Remuneration Committee Executives within the Group Executive Committee Group 3 Senior Country, Functional or Other Executives 0.5 x base salary As at 31 December 2011, both the CEO and the Finance Director were compliant with this policy.
