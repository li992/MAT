BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Dear Shareholder The 2011 financial year saw the Company deliver a positive return in its net asset value but experience a decline in its share price.
This occurred against a challenging and volatile macro backdrop.
Concerns over the state of the European Sovereign Debt markets dominated investors focus, and rapid swings in sentiment provided multiple opportunities for investors to be wrong-footed.
Whilst the absolute level of return was below AllBlues annual target, downside distributions were effectively minimised as a result of the consistent and disciplined adherence to BlueCrests long established risk management procedures.
Unlike most peer companies, and contrary to movements in most equity markets, the Company saw a 2.22% increase in net asset value per share for the Sterling Class.
However, while the Companys Sterling shares traded at a premium throughout most of the calendar year, the shares moved from a premium to a 0.7 % discount towards year-end resulting in a -1.71% fall in the share price for the year.
Aggregate net assets of the Company across the three share classes in Sterling terms at year-end were approximately 935 million.
The Company represents approximately 20% of AllBlues net assets.
Investment Performance During 2011, the published Sterling Share NAV rose from 164.69p to 168.34p, a return of 2.22% for the year.
AllBlue recorded eight months of positive performance over the year, with returns driven predominantly by two strategies with the other strategies exhibiting a more muted impact.
The annual report by BlueCrest, the manager of AllBlue, on pages 14 to 25 provides a more detailed review of the various sub-strategy returns for the year.
