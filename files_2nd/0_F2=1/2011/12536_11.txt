26 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements OPERATIONS REVIEW continued Pakistan Average net to Premier production in Pakistan during 2011 was 15,100 boepd, marginally higher than in 2010 14,900 boepd.
Net to Premier, the Qadirpur field averaged 3,750 boepd 2010: 3,550 boepd.
The increased production was the result of the wellhead compression project coming on-stream at the end of 2010.
Work is in progress for the installation of two front end compressors by September 2012 in order to maintain production levels.
The development extended reach wells ERW QP-42 and QP-43 have been successfully drilled, completed and tied in to production during 2011, while drilling of QP-44 also ERW is in progress.
Two centrifugal compressors for the compression and re-cycling of permeate gas a side stream were commissioned in July and October 2011.
This has minimised the flaring of permeate gas and resulted in a corresponding increase of sales gas 25-30 mmscfd, gross.
Average production net to Premier from the Kadanwari field was 2,050 boepd 2010: 1,750 boepd and included increased contributions from successful exploration and development wells.
The Zamzama field averaged 5,800 boepd net to Premier 2010: 6,050 boepd.
The decrease in production was primarily due to natural decline.
Front end compression was commissioned in July.
Subsurface studies were conducted during the year, following which two infill wells Zam-8 and Zam-9 are now planned to be drilled in the second half of 2012, while an additional infill well Zam-10 is under consideration for drilling in the first quarter of 2013.
The Bhit Badhra fields produced 3,500 boepd net to Premier 2010: 3,550 boepd.
The slight decrease in production was because the fields annual maintenance programme, originally scheduled to be carried out in the second half of 2010, was deferred to April 2011.
The Bhit- 13 development well was successfully drilled and completed in the second half of 2011 and was tied in to facilities in January 2012.
The installation and commissioning of a wellhead compressor at the Badhra gas field was successfully completed at the end of 2011.
Mauritania In Mauritania, 2011 working interest production from the Chinguetti field averaged 650 bopd 2010: 700 bopd with the decline rate continuing to be lower than expected.
Negotiations between the government and the joint venture partners have been completed for extensions to PSC A and PSC B.
Their respective exploration areas have been merged into a new PSC, C-10, in which Premier holds a 6.23 per cent working interest.
The undeveloped discoveries Banda, Tiof and Tevet in PSC A and PSC B will continue to be held by joint venture partners for up to 18 months while development studies are undertaken.
Potential gas sales arrangements for Banda are currently under discussion.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 27 EXPLORATION REVIEW By Andrew Lodge Exploration Director The near-term goal for exploration within Premier is to add 200 mmboe of net 2P reserves by 2015.
This is being achieved by focusing on geographies and geological themes in which Premier has demonstrable knowledge, skills and expertise namely in rift basins of South East Asia, the North Sea and Africa, together with frontal fold belt provinces as exemplified by our asset base in Pakistan.
Since the goal was set in 2009, 70 mmboe of reserves and resources have been added which, with further evaluation and appraisal, could rise to over 100 mmboe.
The programme is therefore on track to meet its target.
In 2011, Premier participated in 21 exploration and appraisal wells, of which 12 were successful, an overall success rate of 57 per cent.
The most notable successes were in the UK Central North Sea and the Nam ?
In Vietnam, the 2009 C R ong Do discovery in Block 07 03 was successfully appraised with oil, gas and condensate being encountered.
The gas and condensate was found in a deeper reservoir sequence than the oil and this opens up a new play fairway within Premiers acreage in the Nam Con Son Basin.
In the UK Central North Sea the discovery at Burgman continued the successful exploration drilling on the Catcher licence, UK Block 28 9.
Premier also explores for near-field resources capable of being tied back to its existing infrastructure.
In Pakistan, three near-field exploration wells encountered gas in untested fault block compartments within the Kadanwari field area and, in Vietnam, oil was discovered in a previously untested trap immediately north west of the Chim So field on Block 12W.
Premier continues to apply the most advanced seismic interpretation techniques in maturing its lead and prospect inventory to drillable status and, in 2011, acquired new 3D seismic data in the Catcher licence and surrounding acreage.
On non-operated acreage, a new 3D survey was acquired in Norway in the Blbaer licence, and 2D and 3D seismic data was acquired in Kenya.
2011 was a significant year for new acreage capture with a total of 25 licences being secured by year-end, amounting to a net acreage gain of 2 3,885km.
A total of 12 licences were acquired in the UK Central North Sea and two in Ireland, in the Celtic Sea, via the EnCore acquisition.
In addition, four new blocks were offered for award through EnCore as part of the deferred 26th Round awards in early January 2012 three of these are in the Central North Sea and one is in the Solent.
In Norway, Premier acquired two new blocks in February 2011 as a result of the 2010 APA awards.
In the latter half of 2011, three licences in the Norwegian portion of the Central North Sea were acquired from Nexen for a cost of US$5.5 million.
Early in 2012, Premier was also awarded equity in four new licences via the 2011 APA Licence Round, three licences in the North Sea and one offshore mid-Norway.
All acreage awards in Norway were acquired on a drill or drop option basis and the target is to deliver prospects from this new portfolio for drilling in the 2013 2014 time frame.
