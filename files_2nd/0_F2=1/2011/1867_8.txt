Our Strengths Our Strengths BBA Aviation is a focused aviation services and aftermarket support business, ideally placed to exploit opportunities in these cyclical but attractive markets.
There are five critical factors which will contribute to the continued success of BBA Aviation in the future: Market leadership We are market leaders in the markets in which we operate with strong, recognised brands Signature is the worlds leading fixed base operation FBO network with 90 wholly owned worldwide locations and 22 additional locations in which we have minority interests ASIG is the largest independent refueller in the world Our ERO business has market-leading positions in the programmes in which it participates Barriers to entry The requirement for a lease from an airport authority to operate an FBO: the average unexpired lease term of our FBO network in the USA is 17 years The need for an authorisation to provide commercial aviation services at individual airports and the required technical capability around into-plane refuelling The need for a licence from an OEM to service its engines: we are authorised by the OEMs for engine overhauls on 80% of B&GA engines now in service Intellectual property on aviation component systems and sub-systems which we develop ourselves or which we license from OEMs Service orientation Our businesses have a service focus with low asset intensity, a naturally flexible cost base and are highly cash generative which makes them inherently well suited to deal with market cyclicality as demonstrated through this cycle.
Growth There are significant growth opportunities across all of our businesses resulting from cyclical recovery, structural growth and the scope for consolidation in fragmented markets.
Common focus The business is actively managed by an empowered, experienced and motivated management team with a defined common Group-wide focus as expressed in our vision, mission and values.
