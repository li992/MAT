Work conducted in 2011 was focused on attaining the relevant government and community permits Mosquito: Argentina and approvals for both projects.
The community permit has Two rounds of drilling were completed at the 100% been received, and in 2012 the exploration programme will ownedMosquito property in Argentina in 2011.
A total include a 1,106 metre drilling campaign.
Exploration activity of8,495 metres was drilled, testing over 12 different vein will be carried out at Faralln, as well as the testing of targets.
The majority of the drilling did not intercept any anomalies in the Astana area.
In 2012 the 2,000 metre drilling programme will include offset drilling in and San Martin: Peru aroundthe mostanomalous intercepts reported to date.

In2011, a total of 1,812 metres was drilled at La Flora and anumber of vein targets were tested.
Drilling was successful inintercepting anomalous gold and silver mineralisation.

In 2012 the Company will conduct detailed mapping and sampling and IP geophysical survey Antay: Peru programmes in order to define targets for drilling.
At the 100% owned Antay copper project, the Company isinthe process of obtaining the necessary access permits Copper projects fortheproject.
Following the acquisition of Southwestern Resources in 2008, the Company currently holds a number of copper projects Generative located in the southern Andes in Peru, within a highly The Company holds over one million hectares of prime prospective area for copper deposits.
The Company has landin key geological regions across four countries and has committed 6% of the total 2012 budget and a dedicated committed 3% of the total 2012 budget to conduct further exploration team to drilling at the properties in order to exploration in these premium areas.
