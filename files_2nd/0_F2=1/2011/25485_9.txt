Review of operating environment The South African commercial property market rent producing has weathered the impact of the global economic downturn more favourably than its international counterparts.
The property development environment is relatively uncertain and dif cult to anticipate due to pressures on capital funding from financial institutions.
The property industry relies on a well regulated environment within which to operate.
Changes in this environment are impacting on planning and development, availability of services and deeds registration.
To manage the impact of the changing legislative and operating environment, the business has ensured that it is well prepared and adequately staffed.
The Australian property market has seen some interesting developments and gone through what would appear to be some fundamental changes over the past year: Listed property players continue to stabilise their capital structures and refocus on core business Valuations and senior debt availability appear to be stabilising, but remain conservative Property fundamentals are beginning to stabilise and the general consensus is that the market is at or near the end of the downward cycle Increasing M&A activity in the local market, with a number of acquisitions mergers and management changes, although still in the early stages The fund management environment is fundamentally different, with many retail fund management players no longer operating independently Limited material unlisted capital raisings, particularly opportunistically, with current focus on smaller, yielding syndicates.
Overall, despite increasing market con dence, many investors remain cautious.
Over time we anticipate investor con dence returning, but in the near term likely to be focused on yield and certainty of investment.
However, in contrast, many opportunities continue to present themselves in the development and opportunistic area for the principal investor who can take advantage of the recent downturn to acquire projects from pressurised vendors.
