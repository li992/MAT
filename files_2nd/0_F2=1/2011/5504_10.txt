The project reuses existing facilities and is designed to ensure that abandonment costs will be minimised.
alma, formerly the Argyll field, was the first oil field in the uK, and was abandoned at relatively low water cut using the technology available at the time.
With current technology, field life can be extended significantly.
This type of opportunity fits the EnQuest model of finding fresh opportunities in mature assets.
the alma and galia development provides a material increase of approximately 29 mmboe in EnQuests reserves and underpins our medium term production growth profile.
This is EnQuests largest new project so far and the first new hub since our IPO.
