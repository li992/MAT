Park House, W1 Just a few years ago this site was simply a hole in the ground.
We saw its potential and laid the foundations for a stunning mixed-use development.
When completed in 2012, Park House will provide contemporary of ce space, luxurious Mayfair apartments, and stylish shops on Europes busiest high street Oxford Street.
The quality of our scheme quickly attracted a buyer and we sold the site for 296m this year.
