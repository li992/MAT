b Includes BP share of equity-accounted entities, as indicated.
c Group interest is quoted at 100%, reecting the capacity entitlement which is marketed by BP.
d Due to the integrated nature of these plants with our Gelsenkirchen renery, the income and expenditure of these plants is managed and reported through the fuels business.
e Group interest varies by product.
f BP Zhuhai Chemical Company Ltd is a subsidiary of BP, the capacity of which is shown above at 100%.
Outlook In the petrochemicals industry, we expect significant new capacity to come In 2012, we expect the overall economic environment to be challenging, onstream in acetic acid and PTA in 2012, 7% and 15% of global capacity with below-average growth.
Emerging economies are likely to drive respectively.
Demand is expected to remain robust in 2012, but not growth, while developing countries are expected to lag behind.
We expect sufficient to absorb the additional capacity, hence we expect the margin that reners will continue to operate with excess capacity globally, despite environment to be weaker in 2012 than in 2011. the announced shutdown of reneries in the US East Coast and Europe.
Our priorities in 2012 remain consistent with those in 2011 and The RMM in 2012 is expected to remain in a range of $8-12 per barrel.
We will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and compliant expect the differential between WTI and Brent crude to eventually return to operations, improving the performance of our integrated FVCs, and driving lower levels as additional US pipeline capacity is brought online.
The level further cost efficiencies across all our businesses.
We intend to increase of BPs renery turnaround activity is expected to be broadly similar in 2012 our investment levels slightly in 2012 versus 2011 and 2010, focusing compared with 2011. on key safety and operational integrity priorities, maintaining our quality We expect the marketing environment for lubricants to remain manufacturing and marketing portfolio, strengthening our US East of challenging given the outlook for global economic growth.
Longer term Rockies FVC business through the Whiting renery modernization project, however, we expect to see growth in global lubricants demand through to and continuing to grow our advantaged petrochemicals business in China.
2020 as a result of continued growth in the number of vehicles, continuing We intend to continue to upgrade our portfolio through investments in industrialization in emerging markets, and expanding world trade.
This advantaged assets and the completion of our divestment programme, growth is expected to be concentrated in non-OECD markets.
Lubricants including the US southern west coast FVC and the Texas City renery, demand is also expected to continue to shift towards higher quality, announced in February 2011. premium products as new vehicles adopt advanced, smaller, more efficient engines placing greater demands on lubricant performance.
