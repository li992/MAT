The Committee continues to believe that the compliance and internal control systems and the internal audit function in place within the Manager and Company Secretary provide sufficient assurance that a sound system of internal control, which safeguards shareholders investment and the Companys assets, is maintained.
An internal audit function, specific to the Company, is therefore considered unnecessary.
