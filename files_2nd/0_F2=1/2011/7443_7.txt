Hochschild Mining plc 28 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Operating & exploration review Advanced Projects The Company has three Advanced Projects: Inmaculada, Inmaculada estimated timeline Crespo and Azuca.
The Company recently announced theresults of feasibility studies, conducted by Ausenco, 2012 2013 anindependent consultant, on Inmaculada and Crespo.
Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Theseprojects are expected to contribute an average attributable annual production of ten million silver equivalent Procurement ounces, increasing current production levels by 50%.
Engineering Bothprojects aredue to be commissioned in Q4 2013 and have an initial combined capital cost estimated at $426 million Permitting process $335 million attributable to Hochschild.
Mine development At Azuca, the Company has delayed the feasibility study to continue exploration work at the project throughout 2012 in Process plant construction order to consolidate resources and provide a more comprehensive Start of production picture of the complex vein structures in the area.
increase in the plant capacity from 3,000 tpd to 3,500 tpd.
Inaddition, as a result of feasibility level geotechnical studies, Inmaculada the rock quality was determined to be poorer than anticipated which has affected dilution, mine capex and mining costs.
Crespo Allof these factors were incorporated in the new capex, costand Net Present Value NPV figures presented in Azuca thefeasibility study results.
The feasibility study was conducted using only measured and indicated resources from the Angela vein.
Summary results ona 100% basis, applying a 1.5 g t gold equivalent cut-off grade are as follows: Measured & Indicated resources: 7.07 mt at an average grade of 4.07 g t gold and 144 g t silver containing approximately 925,100 ounces of gold and 32.8 million ounces of silver Inmaculada: Peru Inferred resources of 4.94 mt at an average grade of 3.91 g t gold and 152 g t silver containing approximately 620,000 Inmaculada is a 20,000 hectare gold-silver project located in ounces of gold and 24.2 million ounces of silver the Companys existing operational cluster in southern Peru and is 60% owned and controlled by Hochschild, following Estimated mineral reserves at a cut-off grade of 2.3 g t gold theacquisition of a controlling stake in October 2010. equivalent : 7.80 mt at an average grade of 3.37g t gold and Theremaining 40% is held by the Companys joint venture 120 g t silver containing approximately 845,000 ounces of partner at Pallancata, International Minerals Corporation IMZ.

The single, day tpd underground operation with average annual wide vein will also allow for lower mining costs and a production of 12 million silver equivalent ounces seven metallurgical process with estimated recovery rates of 95.6% million attributable ounces, and is due to be commissioned for gold and 90.6% for silver.

feasibility study process include: an update of the mineral resource: the use of only Measured & Indicated resources as The feasibility study results confirmed that the project provides the basis for the initial reserves: a change in the metallurgical strong returns based on the existing reserve base.
However, process from flotation to leaching with the resulting change Hochschild is confident that the mineable resource base will from a concentrate to dore as the final product: and an Operating & exploration review 29 be expanded by upgrading the inferred mineral resources in The updated resource estimate for Crespo replaced the the South West and North East extensions of the Angela vein.

There is also further geological upside at Crespo is 100% owned by Hochschild and is located in theQueshca gold target, to the north of the current feasibility theCompanys existing operating cluster in southern Peru.
In addition, a drilling gap exists between Crespois also set to begin construction, with total initial capital Crespo and Queshca and encouraging geological evidence expenditure of $111 million for a 6,850 tpd operation with would suggest further potential for economic mineralisation.

This will be a relatively simple open pit converting Inferred resources to the Indicated resource project with high gold recovery rates, and again, will benefit category and to increase the resource base and to continue from operational synergies due to its proximity to the exploring the Queshca target.
The principal execution risksfacing the Crespo project are possible disruptions to the project schedule resulting from social or political instability and Azuca: Peru the projects dependence on third-party supplies ofelectricity.
The 100% owned Azuca project is also located in the Changes from the January 2011 scoping study resulting from Companys southern Peru operating cluster.
In January 2012, thefeasibility study process include: an update of the mineral the Company took the decision to delay the feasibility study resource: an increase in the plant capacity from 5,650 tpd atAzuca and continue exploration work at the project to6,850 tpd: and a change in the source of power, to a throughout 2012 in order to consolidate resources and to 25kilometres 60 KV transmission line connecting the Arcata provide a more comprehensive picture of the dispersed vein operation to Crespo.
