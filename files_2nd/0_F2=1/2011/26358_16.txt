Total Income increased by 7 per cent: Net interest income grew by 11 per cent, due largely to the increase in deposit balances, and a higher net interest margin.
This deposit balance growth, the beneficial effect of the consequently larger funding surplus, and a more favourable deposit mix were the key drivers behind the 47 basis point increase in banking net interest margin Other operating income decreased by 2 per cent, reflecting subdued levels of business activity in the early part of the year and reduced levels of money transmission income reflecting the greater use of electronic banking facilities by customers.
Operating expenses reduced by 4 per cent, primarily as a result of integration cost savings including lower back office staffing requirements.
The impairment charge reduced by 21 per cent, due to an overall improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio reflected in a reduction in observed default and delinquency rates.
This is supported by the specialist relationship support, which helps customers facing difficult business conditions.
Loans and advances to core customers increased by 3 per cent against a contracting market.
This reflects the continuing support given to small and medium sized businesses, fully offsetting the reduction in non-core assets.
Customer deposits grew 3 per cent, reflecting our ongoing success in attracting deposits from new customers, combined with targeted support in key customer segments such as the education and legal sectors.
Risk-weighted assets decreased by 5 per cent, reflecting the improved mix and risk profile of the portfolio.
Against its strategic objectives, Commercial has focused on strengthening its customer relationships and supporting SMEs through the cycle by further developing its understanding and support of individual business requirements.
This is demonstrated by: Sustainable franchise growth in supporting 124,000 start up businesses, and achieving positive net switchers from other banks.
Supporting customers through responsible lending, combined with improving credit quality, balance sheet funding and RWA use.
Improving cross-sales of Wealth Management, Insurance, and Treasury products leading to additional revenue for other businesses in the Group.
Strategic focus Commercials goal is to be the best bank for smaller and medium sized businesses.
The main strategic focus is to improve the depth of relationship with SMEs through specialist customer propositions in key markets, by improving relationship management skills and capacity to cross-sell and optimising customer service through efficiencies that also contribute to cost effectiveness targets.
Progress against strategic initiatives Reshaping the business The business is being reshaped by investing to improve the customer proposition, leveraging wider Group capabilities, and supporting SMEs through the cycle to help them prosper and develop.
This will be achieved through investment in our Relationship Managers and will be supported by product and system development aligning to customers wider financial needs.
The number of customer facing industry specialists has increased improving support in key markets.
In support of the SME sector, the Group has exceeded its agreed full year contribution to the aggregate Merlin capacity lending target in respect of SMEs.
The core net lending balance growth of 3 per cent compares favourably with the contraction of SME lending across the industry reported by the Bank of England.
Supporting the full range of customer needs has resulted in balanced growth of deposits and lending, which has strengthened the balance sheet maintaining the funding surplus.
The benefit of close relationship support through the cycle is evidenced in the improvement in credit quality.
Risk-weighted assets have reduced in the context of increased lending, reflecting the improvement in risk profiles as well as the higher mix of secured lending in the book.
Simplifying the Bank Commercial has made good progress with simplification, with the majority of customers now on a single banking platform.
Simpler organisational structures and processes have been delivered with the benefit of lower back office staffing requirements.
The customer benefits arising from simplification are important with significant progress being made on the re-engineering of the lending process.
A successful pilot of the new process has halved the time taken to fulfil lending to customers.
This will be fully rolled out by the end of 2012.
The product range has also been simplified for customers with the launch of the UKs first range of Monthly Price Plans providing certainty and control over bank charges to SME customers: over 30,000 customers have already signed up to this new product.

The Commercial Finance business, which provides asset backed lending to SMEs, has increased its client base and provided further support to industry sectors including increasing advances to the manufacturing sector by 30 per cent against the prior year.
The Business Support Unit BSU is helping businesses in financial difficulties, in line with the commitment to support customers through the economic cycle.
Since 2009 the BSU has restructured facilities for around 10,000 businesses and has protected more than 250,000 UK jobs.
Commercials commitments to customers are made in the SME Charter which has been refreshed and extended to encourage enterprise, provide clear and fair pricing, access to finance and support for communities.
As part of this, Commercial has committed to lend 12 billion to customers in 2012.
This will be supported by at least 200 customer networking events which have proved to be a key platform for recruitment and customer support.
Commercial supports businesses across the SME sector and has supported 124,000 start up businesses in 2011 as part of the three year commitment to help 300,000 businesses.
Support to SME customers will be improved through deepening customer relationships, with internal investment resources agreed along with detailed plans to achieve this.

Financial performance Profit before tax and fair value unwind in 2011 was 446 million compared to a profit of 210 million in 2010.
The improvement of 236 million was largely driven by deposit balance growth and the increased value to the Groups cost of funding from deposits as well as a benefit from a change in the mix of Commercials deposit balances.
The increase in income is partially offset by other operating income which has decreased 11 million, 2 per cent, due to subdued levels of trading activity in the early part of the year and reduced levels of money transmission income reflecting the greater use of electronic banking facilities by customers.
Operating expenses have decreased 44 million, 4 per cent, primarily as a result of integration cost saving programmes delivering positive results, including lower back office staffing requirements.
Impairment has decreased 79 million, 21 per cent, due to an overall improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio leading to a reduction in observed default and delinquency rates.
Impairment charges as an annualised percentage of average loans and advances to customers has reduced to 1.06 per cent from 1.24 per cent in 2010, an improvement of 18 basis points year-on-year.
The fair value unwind decreased by 34 per cent, reflecting the decrease in impairment charge.
Balance sheet progress Loans and advances to customers at 28.8 billion, were broadly unchanged from the prior year.
However, core lending increased 3 per cent, where Commercial has been successful in encouraging SME customers to invest and attract switchers requiring term lending and invoice finance facilities.
Significant effort in promoting support has included running nearly 700 customer events in 2011.
Customer deposits increased 3 per cent to 32.1 billion reflecting our ongoing success in attracting new customers, combined with targeted support in key customer segments such as the education and legal sectors.
