in addition drilling was GKDH353 - 12.2 metres at 6.46g t from 721.95 metres: and also completed to infill gaps within the resource model, particularly GKDH352 - 15.5 metres at 6.07g t from 532.8 metres including along the northsouth iron structure in the south of the deposit 9.4 metres at 10g t from 537.1 metres.
as well as at the base of the reserve pit.
thirty-seven holes for 22 900 metres were completed in 2011.
At depth, a brittle fault limits the down dip extension of the high grade mineralisation which appears to have been down thrown to the south.
A model is being developed to predict the offset and the host rocks to the Gounkoto mineralisation are a sequence of design follow-up holes to be completed during 2012. fine grained arkoses which have undergone a complex series of alteration events.
the first phase is associated with metasomatic albite-ankerite alteration with minor silica.
this alteration event prepares the host rock for mineralisation.
in localised areas of the deposit, early syn-mineralisation tourmaline alteration is also observed.
this is followed by magnetite-chlorite alteration.
the former is then oxidised by hematite and associated with sulphidegold mineralisation.
the last stage of alteration is a second phase of iron which pseudomorphs the sulphide minerals and causes a remobilisation of gold.
More than 95% of the sulphide is pyrite with minor arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite.
Gold tellurides are also present.
Mineralisation is bounded by a hangingwall shear and footwall mylonite.
in the hangingwall there is a prominent limestone unit which is used as a marker horizon.
the mineralisation at Gounkoto has now been intersected over a 1.9 kilometre strike length and down to a depth of 959 vertical metres.
the geometry of the Gounkoto system varies along its length as well as down dip and variations in strike, dip and thickness are closely related to grade distribution.
structural intersections also played an essential role in focusing fluid flow and multiple plunging zones projected from the surface have been confirmed by deeper drilling especially in the Jog Zone which forms the principal potential for an underground project and is where the main zone of mineralisation is offset across three structures, creating distinct lodes of mineralisation.

All the holes intersected the Gounkoto hydrothermal system but in general gold assay results Results from this work returned a close correlation with the results returned intersections of less than 1g t. from previous RC drilling and infill holes confirmed the continuity of the mineralisation within the Us$1 500 pit shell where an inferred However, to the north of the deposit, deep holes intersected broad resource of 355 000 ounces at 2.11g t has been estimated using zones of low grade mineralisation: GKDH292 - 86.1 metres at input costs to truck the ore to loulo.

ongoing work returned good drill intersections at toronto south, further defining a deep zone of mineralisation with strike continuity over 400 metres: fRDH012 - 16 metres at 2.41g t from 211 metres: and fRDH018 - 24 metres at 2.17g t from 219 metres and 19.6 metres at 3.36g t from 264.1 metres.
interpretations suggest the mineralisation is associated with a blind fold which is not exposed at surface.
to the north of Gounkoto, hole fRDH020 returned 3.5 metres at 5.57g t from 133.5 metres associated with massive pyrite and tourmalinised greywacke.
At P64, 300 metres to the northwest of Gounkoto where mineralisation is hosted in a tourmalinised greywacke with weak chlorite alteration over a strike length of 145 metres, 21 holes were completed for 1 867 metres drilled over three different mineralised zones.
