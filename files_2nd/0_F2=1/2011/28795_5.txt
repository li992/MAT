DIRECTORS REPORT 21 The Directors present their Annual Report and Accounts for the Company, covering the year ended 31 March 2011.
STATUS OF COMPANY The Company is registered as a public company and is incorporated in England and Wales, Company Registration Number 2129188.
The Company conducts its affairs so as to qualify for approval as an investment trust for tax purposes, confirmation of which has been received from HM Revenue & Customs for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Approval for the year ended 31 March 2010 is subject to no subsequent enquiry being made under the corporation tax self assessment legislation.
The Directors are of the opinion that, since that date, the Company has conducted its affairs in a manner which will satisfy the conditions for continued approval as an investment trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
The Company is not a close company within the meaning of Section 439 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
The Companys subsidiaries are mainly engaged in investment activities and the activities of the Group are principally undertaken in the UK.
DIRECTORS Biographies of the Directors holding office at the date of this report are shown on pages 19 and 20.
The following Board changes took effect on 22 July 2010, during or at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting: Charles Bailey retired as a non-executive Director: Lord Douro was elected by shareholders as a non-executive Director: and Nathaniel Rothschild retired as a non-executive Director.
Lord Myners was appointed as a non-executive Director on 11 August 2010.
Rick Sopher was appointed as a non-executive Director on 2 December 2010.
There were no other changes in the Companys Directorate during the year ended 31 March 2011.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS After taxation, the Group made a capital gain of 166.4 million, revenue profit of 5.4 million, and a total profit of 171.8 million during the year ended 31 March 2011.
The Board is intending to pay a dividend of 6.2 million, being 4.0p per share, on 19 August 2011.
This will be categorised as an interim dividend in respect of the year ending 31 March 2012.
This is because the lack of sufficient distributable reserves of the Company prevents it from paying a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011.
As there are significant distributable reserves within subsidiary companies, the Board plans to utilise part of these to fund payment of the interim dividend in August.
These arrangements are not expected to prevent the Company from also paying a final dividend in respect of the year to 31 March 2012 in August next year.
The Company paid a dividend of 6.2 million, being 4.0p per share, on 1 April 2010, in respect of the year ending 31 March 2010.
The movements on Company and consolidated capital and revenue reserves are shown in notes 22 and 23 on page 67.
SHARE CAPITAL Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 20 on page 66.
During the year ended 31 March 2011, no ordinary shares were issued or repurchased.
The existing authority for the repurchase of shares expires on the earlier of the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2011 or 30 September 2011 and a replacement authority is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, as explained in the Notice and Explanatory Notes on pages 91 to 98.
NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value of one ordinary share at 31 March 2011, was 1,289.4p 31 March 2010: 1,180.1p.
RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 DIRECTORS REPORT 22 INVESTMENT POLICY The Companys Corporate Objective is: to deliver long-term capital growth, while preserving shareholders capital: to invest without the constraints of a formal benchmark, but to deliver for shareholders increases in capital value in excess of the relevant indices over time.
The Companys Investment Policy is: to invest in a widely diversified, international portfolio across a range of asset classes, both quoted and unquoted: to allocate part of the portfolio to exceptional managers in order to ensure access to the best external talent available.
The Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority require closed-ended investment funds to publish information about the policies that the fund will follow relating to asset allocation, risk diversification and gearing, including maximum exposures.
Asset allocation The Board currently intends to continue to allocate the Groups assets predominantly amongst quoted equities, long equity funds, hedge funds, unquoted direct investments, unquoted funds, real assets, absolute return, fixed income, currencies, government securities and money market funds.
There are no restrictions on the relative allocation of assets amongst these classes and the maximum exposure of any single asset class is therefore 100%, subject to the investment trust restrictions incumbent upon the Company, which require that the Companys income from shares and securities must be at least 70% of its total income, thus automatically limiting the allocation of assets to areas such as property.
In addition the Group uses derivatives to hedge various risk exposures and also to increase exposure to movements in individual securities, markets and currencies where desired.
The allocation amongst these asset categories at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2011 is shown on pages 7 to 9.
Risk diversification The Groups investment portfolio is diversified by asset class, industry sector, geography and currency.
Overall exposures in each case are monitored and managed by executive management under the supervision of the Board.
The portfolio is further diversified through the selection of external managers with different mandates.
The Company also complies with the requirements of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group of companies at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
Gearing The Company maintains structural gearing principally through a revolving credit facility.
At 31 March 2011, the Sterling equivalent of the indebtedness was 249.0 million, against total assets of 2,290.3 million, or 10.9%.
This percentage may fluctuate as permitted under the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility agreement.
Were it not for these, the maximum indebtedness that the Company is empowered to incur under its Articles of Association is five times its adjusted capital and reserves, as defined.
Cross holdings The UKLA Listing Rules also require closed-ended investment companies to disclose quarterly all of their investments in other listed closed-ended investment funds which themselves do not have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds.
The Group discloses such investments, but does not restrict its own investment policies in this manner.
BUSINESS REVIEW The Company invests with the object of achieving long-term capital growth.
An analysis of the investments is contained in the Investment Directors Review on pages 7 to 18.
The Group holds both listed and unlisted investments.
The Chairmans Statement on pages 4 to 6 of this annual report and the Investment Directors Review contain a review of the Groups business in the year to 31 March 2011.
Financial highlights and performance information is set out on page 3, and the portfolio and currency exposure is analysed on pages 8 and 9.
The principal risks are as set out in note 26 on pages 69 to 84 and in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 26 to 32.
The Directors consider that the key performance indicator most relevant to the Group is the MSCI World Index in Sterling, compared with the movement in the Groups net asset value per share, as set out on page 3.
23 At the present time, the portfolio meets the requirements to enable the shares of the Company to be included as an investment within an Individual Savings Account ISA.

Components of the interests of Lord Rothschild are held by family trusts.
Accordingly, the names of the respective trustees are disclosed under Major Holders of Voting Rights, where any individual trust controls 3% or more of the Companys voting rights, whereas the overall holdings of Lord Rothschild together with all interests held through family trusts are disclosed under Directors Interests.
Other than an investment to utilise an annual ISA allowance, the change in the disclosed interests of Lord Rothschild during the year arose as a result of a personal gift of shares to a Rothschild family charity where he is a trustee and the receipt of shares by way of a donation into the same charity.
Between the end of the year and the date of this Report, there were no changes in the Directors interests.
Requests from the Chairman for permission to deal in the ordinary shares of the Company are considered by the Board of Directors.
Requests from other Directors and employees of the Group are referred to the Chairman or Senior Independent Director, except in the case of small volume transactions requested by those other than Directors and senior executives, which are considered by the Company Secretary.
Except as stated in note 28 to the financial statements as regards Lord Rothschild no Director has, or has had during the period under review, any beneficial interest in any contract or arrangement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries within the terms set out in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Company maintained liability insurance for its Directors and Officers throughout the year.
The process for the appointment and replacement of Directors is set out on page 29.
MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION In accordance with the Groups investment policy, management of certain assets including long equity funds, hedge funds and unquoted funds is delegated to external managers.
A number of these managers operate segregated accounts on behalf of the Company, the largest of which are separately disclosed in the Investment Directors Review.
Fees associated with the management of the segregated accounts are disclosed as investment management fees in the income statement.
The investment managers charge fees based on a percentage of the funds under management in the range from 0.5% to 1.5% per annum and, in certain cases, performance fees are charged where the increase in the value of the funds exceeds specified hurdles.
The investment management agreements can be terminated with notice periods of between one and three months.
Apart from the right to receive accrued fees, the investment management agreements do not provide for any other payment on termination.
The performance of each of the external managers is reviewed regularly by the executive Directors and the Board as a whole.
The terms of the contracts between the Company and those managers are also reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate.
In the opinion of the Directors, the continuing appointment of the investment managers gives the Company access to the expertise of managers who specialise in particular asset classes or geographical areas and is therefore in the best interests of shareholders.
STEWARDSHIP CODE The Company supports the applicable principles of the Stewardship Code published during the year by The Financial Reporting Council.
The Companys Stewardship Policy may be viewed on its website.
Save for voting rights on the Companys investments held in segregated accounts by external managers who have control on the voting of those shares, the Companys investment department determines voting on resolutions of directly-held investee companies and funds, as described in the Companys Stewardship Policy.
Monitoring of directly-held investments is also carried out by the investment department which is responsible for elevating any matters of concern to the investment committee.
Active intervention 25 appropriate for the circumstances will be considered where it is in the Companys best interests.
The Company does not publish its voting record as it invests as principal rather than agent.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The Companys Annual General Meeting will be held on Thursday 28 July 2011 at 11.00 am at Spencer House, 27 St. Jamess Place, London SW1A 1NR.
The Notice is set out on pages 91 to 94 of this document, with Explanatory Notes relating to each of the proposed resolutions on pages 95 to 98.
PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS It is the Companys payment policy to obtain the best terms for all business.
The Company agrees the terms on which business will take place with its suppliers, and it is the Companys policy to abide by such terms.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year-end 31 March 2010: nil.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND CHARITABLE DONATIONS During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Company made no charitable donations or political contributions.
TAKEOVER DIRECTIVE Section 992 of the Companies Act 2006 requires certain disclosures to be made in relation to the EU Takeover Directive.
Note 20 on page 66 provides disclosure of the Companys share capital.
The significant direct and indirect holdings in the Companys securities are disclosed on page 23.
There are no restrictions or significant agreements that may restrict, on a change of control, transfer of securities in the Company or the voting rights attaching to those securities.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS A resolution to re-appoint  LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS With regard to the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2011, the Directors have confirmed to the auditors that: so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware: and they have taken the steps appropriate as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
