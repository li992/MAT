Directors Executive Directors: Alex Kanellis Group Chief Executive Chris Davis Commercial Director Brandon Leigh Group Finance Director John Pantelireis Supply Chain Director Independent Non-executive Directors: Richard Harvey Derek Lewis Professor John Arnold Simon Heale James Steel As Non-executive Directors, Professor Arnold and Messrs Harvey, Lewis, Heale and Steel do not have service contracts.
Details of the letter of engagement relating to each are set out under the heading Service Contracts within the Report on Directors Remuneration.
Under the Companys present Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to retirement by rotation and to re-election by shareholders at intervals of no more than three years and any Director who is appointed during the year is required to retire and seek re-election at the next Annual General Meeting.
The Board recognises that the UK Corporate Governance Code recommends the annual re-election of all Directors and it has resolved to comply with this provision with immediate effect.
Accordingly, each of the Directors will retire prior to the 2011 Annual General Meeting and each, being eligible, will offer himself for re-election at the meeting.
The Directors have also decided to follow this approach at subsequent Annual General Meetings if to do so remains consistent with the Code and, accordingly, the Board will ask shareholders to approve the adoption of new Articles of Association at the 2011 Annual General Meeting reflecting the annual retirement and re-election of each Director.
The evaluation of the Board, as reported within the Report on Corporate Governance, concluded that each of the Directors continues to demonstrate effectiveness and commitment to his particular role and the re-election of each is accordingly recommended by the Board.
