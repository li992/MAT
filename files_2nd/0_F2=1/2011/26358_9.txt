In addition to the continued strengthening of our capital ratios, we have continued to make excellent progress in our wholesale 2014 target 2013 target funding and continued to reduce the level of government and central bank funding.
Though much progress has been made in the last few 130% 10% years in this area, it is clear, given the current economic and regulatory 169 10.8 environment that further strengthening is required and we will continue 10.2 Target to target improvement in four main areas: capital position, liquidity, 154 funding and loan to deposit ratio.
