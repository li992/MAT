Group matters Pensions The Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF had approximately 15,400 members in its defined benefit section at 31 March 2006: some 1,200 members remain in active employment, 9,300 members have deferred benefit entitlements and 4,900 members are drawing pension benefits.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 1999.
A defined contribution section was added for new employees in the UK in 1997.
About 8,600 members participate in the defined contribution section of which some 2,500 remain in active employment.
Nearly 200 ex-Energis employees joined the defined contribution section on 1 April 2006.
The defined benefit scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
It is subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the scheme actuary determines the rate of employers contributions, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the CWSF was made as at 31 March 2005.
Discussions with the trustees and the scheme actuary resulted in us paying a 98 million contribution on 31 March 2006.
As a result of this contribution, the scheme is fully funded on an ongoing basis, based on the 2005 funding valuation.
Our ordinary contribution rate for 2005 06 including administration costs and an allowance for the pension protection fund levy, was 22.3% of employees pensionable pay or 13 million.
We used the latest generally adopted mortality tables and other assumptions for the funding valuation, adjusted to reflect the schemes actual experience, and including an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
Under these assumptions the average life expectancy is 26.5 years for a man aged 60 and 28.1 years for a woman aged 60.
A one year change in the life expectancy assumption would have increased or decreased the scheme liabilities by around 40 million.
A 0.25% change in the assumed rate of return on scheme investments would have increased or decreased the funding required by around 86 million.
A 0.25% change in the assumed rate of salary increases would have increased or decreased the funding required by 7 million.
The IAS 19 deficit for the CWSF at 31 March 2006 is 89 million 31 March 2005 176 million.
The assumptions used for the IAS 19 calculation are different from those adopted by the trustees and the scheme actuary to determine the funding position of the scheme.
In particular, IAS 19 requires the funds liabilities to be discounted at an AA corporate bond rate, whereas the funding valuation discounts the liabilities at a higher expected rate of return on the scheme assets.
We have further unfunded liabilities in the UK of 22.6 million 31 March 2005 20.2 million.
A number of our overseas businesses also operate defined benefit pension schemes.
The aggregate IAS 19 surplus of these schemes is 10 million at 31 March 2006 31 March 2005 deficit 5 million.
