The Board has adopted a schedule of matters which are specifically reserved for its decision which includes various matters to do with Companies Act and other legal requirements, listing requirements, Board membership and Board Committees, management, corporate governance, employment, financial and other miscellaneous items.
In addition, it has a series of matters that are dealt with at regular Board meetings including an operational review, a financial review, land purchased, major projects, senior appointments, corporate governance, internal control and health and safety.
It has also adopted a framework of delegated commercial and operational authorities, which define the scope of powers delegated to management below Board level.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive, which are recorded in writing and approved by the Board, are separate with a clear division of responsibilities, ensuring a balance of responsibility and authority at the head of the Group.
The senior independent non-executive director is Mr L P Finn.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary and all the directors may take independent professional advice at the Groups expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibility as directors.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Report of the Directors continued Board effectiveness The directors possess an appropriate balance of skills and experience for the requirements of the business.
During the year there were ten Board meetings, three Audit Committee meetings, five meetings of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration, one meeting of the Board Committee on Non-executive Directors Remuneration and two Nomination Committee meetings.
There were no absences from any Board or committee meetings by any director, with the exception that Mr D G Perry was unable to attend one Board meeting and one meeting of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration.
Each of the non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, has at all times acted independently of management and has no relationship which would materially affect the exercise of his independent judgement and decision making.
The Company considers all of its non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, to be independent, as defined in the Combined Code.
In the case of Mr L P Finn however, he has served on the Board and its Committees for more than nine years.
In April 2004, the Company consulted with its major shareholders, setting out the reasons why it considered it appropriate for Mr Finn to remain as senior independent non-executive director beyond the nine year period.
The Company received a positive response and consequently he remains as the Groups senior independent non-executive director subject, of course, to re-election each year at the Annual General Meeting, in line with the recommendations contained in the Combined Code.
The Board considers that Mr Finn continues to be independent in character and judgement.
He has experience of running a large and complex public limited company and understands the needs of institutional shareholders.
The Board considers this to be vital for the role of senior independent non-executive director.
His independence is evidenced by his work in the public and voluntary sector, particularly in housing related matters.
One third of the directors offer themselves for re-election each year at the Annual General Meeting and all directors seek re-election every three years in accordance with the Articles of Association.
Mr Finn is excluded from the foregoing as he retires each year as detailed above.
New directors appointed during the year offer themselves for re-appointment at the next Annual General Meeting.
Board balance and independence Appointments to the Board are made on merit through a formal, rigorous and transparent process against objective criteria recommended by the Nomination Committee, which also guides the whole Board in arranging orderly succession for appointments to the Board.
The appointment of a non-executive director is for a specified term and re-appointment is not automatic and is made on the recommendation of the Committee.
The Board has reviewed and reaffirmed that it considers all of the non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, to be independent as defined in the Combined Code.
Whenever any director considers that he is interested in any contract or arrangement to which the Group is or may be a party, due notice is given to the Board.
No such instances of any significance have arisen during the year.
33 Board evaluation During the year the directors undertook an evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees and individual directors.
The evaluation was performed using a self-assessment framework.
This involved the Chairman evaluating the performance of the other individual directors, and the non-executive directors, led by the senior independent non-executive director, assessing the performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive directors.
The Board, led by the Chairman, evaluated its own performance and the Committees, led by the Chairman of each, evaluated their own performance.
As part of the process of ensuring Board effectiveness, the non-executive directors, led by the senior independent non-executive director, met without the Chairman present.
Additionally, the Chairman held meetings with the non-executive directors without the executives present.
The Chairman also had meetings with each of the executive directors.
The Board and its Committees reviewed the results of these evaluations and are satisfied with the evidence it provided about the balance, effectiveness and performance of the Board and its Committees and the effectiveness and commitment of each director.
In coming to these conclusions, the Board can confirm that it has carried out a particularly rigorous review in relation to the effectiveness and commitment of Mr Finn who is due for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting because he has served in excess of six years as a non-executive director at that date.
The Board Committees The Board has properly constituted Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
