Lead stocks should continue to increased by 5% to 7.9 million tonnes in remain at low levels and consequently the 2006.
Around half of this amount came market is expected to remain fairly tight from secondary production, mainly from throughout 2007, supporting lead prices.
In China, primary lead production increased by 12% while secondary production increased by 21%.
As a result, the refined lead market was in supply deficit in 2006 with lead stocks at LME warehouses remaining at very low levels during the period.
At the end of 2006, LME stocks of 41,125 tonnes represented less than one week of global consumption.
During the year, the cash price for lead traded between $914 and $1,809 per tonne, to finish the year at $1,775 per tonne.
The average price in 2006 was $1,287 per tonne, 31% higher than the previous year.
Backwardation was again a key feature of trading throughout the year, reflecting the tight physical market.
