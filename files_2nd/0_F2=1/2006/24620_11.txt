Our Brands Jo Dawson Chief Executive, Insurance & Investment Growing the UK franchise Targeted international growth Cost leadership Colleague development Capital discipline 44 45 Who we are Insurance & Investment is one of the UKs largest providers of investment products, offering multi-brand life, pensions, mutual funds and general insurance products.
Multi-channel, multi-brand Insurance & Investment manufactures and distributes a range of life, pensions, investment and general insurance products.
The division uses its multi-channel, multi-brand operating model to maximise both distribution reach and product and pricing exibility.
Whilst low cost access to the large HBOS Retail customer base is a core strength, the division also enjoys strong 3rd party distribution relationships with partners and intermediaries.
Personal Lines Insurance Our General Insurance business focuses on Household, Repayment and Motor Insurance.
The Retail branch network is our core distribution channel for Household Insurance.
However, increasingly sales are being made through partners and intermediaries and direct to customers via e-commerce and telephone channels.
Our Repayment Insurance products are distributed through the Retail branch network and a number of large 3rd party relationships.
Motor Insurance The esure and First Alternative joint ventures underwrite all of the Groups Motor Insurance under the esure, First Alternative, Sheilas Wheels, Halifax and Sainsburys Bank brands.
Distribution is largely through esures direct channels as well as in Sainsburys supermarkets and via our Retail branch network.
Investment Business Our Investment businesses focus on manufacturing and distributing investment funds, bonds and pension products.
This business mix covers over 80% of the UK life, pensions and investment market.
We have chosen not to actively market annuities given the longevity risk and capital requirements of these products - instead offering our customers access to products from other providers via an in-house independent annuity service.
Distinct distribution channels Our Investment businesses have three distinct distribution channels: Bancassurance, Intermediary and Wealth Management.
In Bancassurance, Halifax branded business is distributed principally through branch-based personal financial advisers with high net worth business sold under the Bank of Scotland Investment Service BOSIS brand.
In Intermediary, we distribute Clerical Medical branded products and, in Wealth Management, we own a 60% stake in St Jamess Place SJP, a leading player in the wealth management market.
