It has since expanded rapidly and now has businesses in four countries in Central Europe, another in Mexico and a new pilot in Romania.
It has almost 1.8 million customers and made 46.2 million profit in 2006.
The countries in which it operates have clear, common characteristics namely, strong economic growth accompanied by rising demand for consumer goods and services, and an underdeveloped supply of consumer credit.
With a number of other countries potentially meeting these criteria, the business expects further rapid growth in the years ahead.
The objectives of the international business are to maximise returns from established markets in Central Europe, develop the newer markets of Mexico and Romania to their full potential, and step up the rate of expansion into new markets.
