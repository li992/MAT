07. indd 25 12 3 07 18:50:41 PROPERTY FINANCIAL REVIEW The property business performed strongly, achieving a 25% increase in both market valuation of its assets to 343.9m 2005: 274.2m and gross rental income of 6.0m 2005: 4.8m mainly due to business parks income growth.
This lifted net rental profits to 3.3m 2005: 2.3m.
After revaluation gains of 68.6m 2005: 40.7m, property activities generated a profit of 73.3m 2005: 45.7m.

The great majority of our land is agricultural and is likely to remain so.
This land provides a ow of rental income and portions of it may be selectively sold, thereby also potentially providing capital that can be redeployed into higher return browneld site development activity.
A portion of our land supports our continuing mining operations and provides sites which may become surface mines with appropriate permissions - in a number of cases also providing a potential pipeline of future development sites, once mining activities are completed and the land is restored.
Within our land portfolio, we also have a number of sites which represent considerable potential for development and consequential substantial value creation.
These represent the core of our browneld site development proposals and activities and are reported on below.
ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGE The Group has revised its accounting policies during the year to bring the market value of its full range of properties held for investment on to the balance sheet.
Group properties are now classied either as: Investment properties.
These are valued at market value if held for capital growth, or rental income, or both Operating properties.
These are properties used in the business and are held at historic or deemed cost from when consent to mine is gained until mining completes The Group accounting policy of recognising initial revaluations in reserves and subsequent revaluations in the income statement is unchanged.
This is in accordance with International Accounting Standards.
The accounting policy change increased gains in the income statement by 47.8m 2005: 29.3m and the property values in the balance sheet by 213.7m 2005: 165.7m.
07. indd 26 12 3 07 18:50:42 Deferred taxation of 1.1m 2005: 1.0m has been provided on revaluation gains.
UK COAL has substantial capital losses available to offset taxable gains, which avoids the need to create substantial deferred tax liabilities.

Disposals included auctions of land identied as non-core.
Our land auction proceeds of 4.8m exceeded management expectations by 60% covering 1,700 acres.
Total disposals covered 1,916 acres of property in 2006, of which 162 acres were for commercial or development purposes, compared with 102 acres of property in 2005, of which 91 acres were for commercial or development purposes.
Expenditure on property development activities net of grants amounted to 3.4m 2005: 8.1m.
The significant increase in the value of the property portfolio in 2006 of 68.6m 2005: 40.7m was recorded in the income statement.
Gains in the value of property do not involve a cash ow until they are realised on sale.
As a result, this item does not appear in the cash ow statement.
OPERATING REVIEW On 3 July, Jon Lloyd joined the Group Board as Chief Executive of Property.
Under his direction, a strategic appraisal of the Groups property business was completed and presented externally in November, outlining the Groups inherent property value and development strategy.
This was well received and has led to a substantial market reappraisal of the potential value of our property business.
The operating structure of the property business has been further strengthened by three key appointments, Development Director, Estates Director and Forward Planning Manager.
The Development Director will lead delivery on the planning consents and on-site infrastructure and its appropriate development through the direction of highly skilled and motivated external project teams.
The Estates Director and Forward Planning Manager will focus on growing the asset base and half-yearly portfolio valuations by identifying and bringing forward additional properties over and above the 2,650 acres identied in the November 2006 presentation.
The Harworth Estates portfolio RICS valuation at the year end is summarised in the table below: Dec 06 Dec 05 Like for like Dec 05 to 06 m m Business parks 48.3 37.0 29.7% Commercial with planning 23.2 30.0 17.4% Other commercial and residential 157.3 116.2 34.8% Agricultural 115.1 91.0 31.4% Total 343.9 274.2 33.8% 27 UK Coal 06 Report 12.3.
07. indd 27 12 3 07 18:50:43 Operating Review continued The valuation is before the deduction of rehabilitation and restoration costs of 51.7m 2005: 66.4m, which are provided in the accounts and relate mainly to working surface mines and sites in aftercare.
On a like for like basis, taking into account disposals and development expenditure, the property portfolio has shown a gain of 86m 34%.
On a net basis after disposals and acquisitions, the portfolio value has increased by 69.7m, being 25%.
We expect, however, that the valuation of UK COALs property interests, with the benefit of the planning permissions currently in hand and envisaged, would be substantially greater than the valuation of our land and property interests in their current usage and, at 2006 prices, could be around 800m by 2012.
PRINCIPAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY The principal areas of development activity in 2006 are summarised below: Waverley Orgreave, Rotherham 2 Planning approval was granted at Waverley for a business park area of 650,000 ft offering mixed use.
Work is progressing towards submitting further planning applications to create a new community which in total will include up to 4,000 new homes, a 60 acre business park, 20 acres other community use social, health and education and a 300 acre country park.
The Advanced Manufacturing Park is already well established on this site and includes a number of companies involved in the high-tech metals and aviation industries.
Prince of Wales, Pontefract A planning application was submitted to Wakeeld Metropolitan District Council at the end of 2006 for the redevelopment and regeneration of this major site.
The application includes over 900 homes and 2 250,000 ft of employment space along with community facilities.
We have engaged in substantial preapplication discussions with the Local Authority and other interested parties and are hopeful that planning approval will be granted during the middle of 2007.
Other developments A large number of other development projects are progressing and we have entered into a number of arrangements with blue chip key partners which will help us maximise value from these developments.
The process of working up new schemes continues to ensure we add value across the whole of the portfolio.
Business parks Business parks continue to be well-tenanted and attract strong demand when units become available.
Terms are in progress to add additional capacity to our Asfordby business park with construction of a new, pre-let, building and we will continue to develop this area of the business.
Sales The policy of disposing of land assets where we have maximised value continues.
This has included land at our Tetron and Denby developments, both of which are now nearly sold out, and a successful auction of agricultural land which had little or no development potential, achieving proceeds some 60% above market expectations for the 1,700 acres sold.
07. indd 28 12 3 07 18:50:43 Development market conditions The majority of our development land identied is classied as browneld and, as such, is well positioned to respond to and benefit from evolving Government policy.
Kate Barkers report for the Government in December 2006 foreshadows changing planning policy and processes that should both streamline the planning timeline for our major sites and give further confidence to the likelihood of planning success.
Recent announcements by the Department of Communities and Local Government set a very strong platform from which we intend to build a nationally significant residential development land bank.
We will realise this through working in partnerships with some of the UKs most successful house builders.
Demand for our mixed use employment sites and our increasing residential development sites remains strong and we expect it to be robust for the period of our initial property strategy articulated to shareholders in November 2006.
Rental income from our existing business parks and our agricultural estate is expected to continue to grow.
The primary opportunity for income and trading profits will come from the gaining of planning consents for our mixed use employment land and residential development sites.
Success will be measured initially by targeting and achieving planning consents for the maximum possible acreage of employment development and optimum number of housing units.
Our participation in the residential market will principally be by way of gaining consents and disposing of serviced sites to major house builders who will pay both full market value and offer a share of any super profit created during the build-out phase.
We will both sell serviced plots and progressively build out a number of our mixed use sites with best in class development partners.
Future prospects The Group is currently managing around 60 separate property projects and continues to seek additional opportunities.
In the short term, it is the intention of management to maintain, and enhance where possible, the current income streams while adding value by: Completing master planning and gaining planning consents at our key development sites Completing construction and letting of development properties Commencement of master planning at appropriate sites Constructing new buildings at existing business parks, where demand for pre-let accommodation is strong Continuing the process of securing planning at sites where there is the opportunity to create value through new commercial or residential development Identifying specic opportunities to extend the development programmed beyond the initial 60 sites specifically focusing on bringing forward a premium mixed use business park at Cutacre Bolton Exploiting the agricultural portfolio for surface mining, residential development and possible disposals of surplus land and properties WAVERLEY.
IN PLANNING PROCESS FOR UP TO 4,000 HOMES, 2 1 MILLION FT EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL LEISURE COMMUNITY USES.
07. indd 29 12 3 07 18:50:45 Valuation A full independent property valuation of all our properties in current usage was carried out at 31 December 2006 in accordance with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Of the portfolio valuation, 311.7m 2005: 251.2m, is recognised in the balance sheet at market value under investment properties.
The valuation of the non-agricultural properties was undertaken by Atisreal formally known as NAI Fuller Peiser acting in the capacity of external valuers.
The basis of value is fair value, but subject to a number of assumptions, the most important of which are: The sites will be cleared of redundant buildings, levelled and prepared ready for development The values are on the basis that no material environmental contamination exists on the subject or adjoining sites, or where this is present the sites will be remediated by UK COAL to a standard consistent with the intended use No deduction or adjustment has been made in relation to clawback provisions, or other taxes which may be payable It should be noted that changes, such as planning approvals, could have a material effect on future valuations.
The agricultural land in the north of England and Scotland was valued by Bell Ingram with the remaining land valued by Smiths Gore.
Both valuations used market value subject to existing tenancies and were based on existing use.
