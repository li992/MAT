Basis of preparation The above unaudited pro-forma financial information is prepared on the same basis as the consolidated income statement except for the following adjustments: The pro-forma financial information includes the results of GWR Group and Independent Radio News Limited IRN as if the Merger had taken place on 1 April 2004 rather than 9 May 2005.
IRN was previously accounted for as an associate but became a subsidiary as a result of the Merger: Amortisation of intangible assets and associated deferred tax has been excluded from the pro-forma financial information for all periods to provide more comparable information.
In accordance with IFRS the Directors identified 321.4 million of separable intangible assets acquired as a result of the Merger.
These include licences, brands and customer relationships and are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of between one and 20 years: and The pro-forma financial information relates solely to ongoing operations and therefore excludes separately disclosed items, which are detailed in note 4 to the statutory results.
These include the costs of merging Capital Radio and GWR Group, some impairment of goodwill, the profit on sale of Balkan Broadcasting OOD, the profit on sale of Century 106 Limited and their trading results for both periods.
The pro-forma financial information for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been prepared on the basis of previously published accounts which cover that period for GWR Group and Capital Radio, after IFRS adjustments to ensure consistency with the accounting policies applied for periods starting after 1 October 2004, the IFRS transition date.
