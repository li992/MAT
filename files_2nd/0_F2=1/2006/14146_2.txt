annual report 2006 report of the directors.
The Directors present their annual report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
1 Annual General Meeting The notice of the Annual General Meeting is set out on pages 75 and 76.
Resolutions 1 to 6 to be proposed at this years AGM are concerned with routine ordinary business.
The following special business will also be considered at the meeting.
The Directors consider that the passing of all the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and they unanimously recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions.
Resolution 7 Authority to allot unissued shares The current authority to allot unissued shares was granted in July 2002 and is due to expire on 24 July 2007.
Although this is some time away, it is likely that such expiry will occur before the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2007 and, therefore, the Directors consider that it is advisable to replace the current authority to allot unissued shares at this years AGM.
Accordingly, resolution 7 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution authorising the Directors to allot up to an aggregate nominal amount of 7,820,000 of the authorised but unissued ordinary shares during the period ending 26 July 2011.
This represents approximately 33% of the total issued share capital of the Company as at 19 June 2006.
The Directors do not have any present intention of exercising this authority other than in connection with the Companys employee share schemes.
Resolution 8 Authority to purchase own shares The Company has the authority to purchase up to 23,400,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
The authority remains valid until the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 27 January 2007.
The Directors recommend that shareholders renew the Companys authority to purchase its own ordinary shares as permitted under Article 10 of its Articles of Association.
Accordingly, resolution 8 will be proposed as a special resolution seeking authority to make such purchases in the market.
The Directors have no immediate intention of using such authority and would do so only when they consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any ordinary shares purchased under this authority will be cancelled and the number of ordinary shares in issue will be reduced accordingly.
The Company did not purchase any of its ordinary shares during the year.
Resolution 8 specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased representing approximately 10% of the Companys existing issued ordinary share capital and the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought, reflecting the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and the UK Listing Rules.
The Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
As at 19 June 2006 being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document there were outstanding options to subscribe for a total of 3,493,940 ordinary shares in the Company, representing 1.5% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date.
If the share buy-back authority referred to above is exercised in full, the outstanding options as at 19 June 2006 would represent 1.7% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Resolution 9 Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights The Directors consider it advisable to renew their authority to allot equity securities for cash, other than to existing shareholders pro-rata to their holdings, which is due to expire on 27 October 2006.
This authority will enable the Directors, at any time until 26 October 2007, to allot equity securities wholly for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,170,000 or otherwise in connection with a rights issue.
This limited disapplication will allow the Directors to allot up to 11,700,000 ordinary shares, representing just under 5% of the issued equity share capital of the Company as at 19 June 2006.
Resolution 9 will be proposed as a special resolution.
