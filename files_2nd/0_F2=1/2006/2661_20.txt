tended to increase their spend, thereby mitigating the impact of those players that leave the site or become inactive.
The result has been that each group of poker players that signs-up adds an incremental layer of revenue.
The impact of the UIGEA on this trend can be seen from the chart below where there is a sharp drop in revenue generated by all groups of sign-ups in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Poker yield is influenced by a number of factors including seasonality, marketing spend and the balance of experienced and casual players in the total player pool.
As with many other online businesses, the first and fourth quarters have historically been strong with the second quarter being seasonally quieter.
As daylight hours increase and the weather in the Groups main markets improve, people typically spend less time online.
The third quarter tends to be better than the second but not as strong as the first or fourth quarters.
Another important factor impacting average player yield is the relative experience of players.
New and relatively inexperienced players tend to spend less time playing and also tend to play at lower stakes and therefore generate lower yield.
As a result, given the continued growth in new player sign-ups, poker yields have tended to fall over time.
The impact of the UIGEA and the loss of high-raking players during the fourth quarter of 2006 also had a significant impact on poker player yield which fell to $12.9 from $19.4 in the Poker yield previous quarter.
Yield per active player day in poker fell sharply to $12.9 in the fourth quarter of 2006 following the enactment of the UIGEA.

This is particularly true for larger high-rolling players or whales as they are known in the industry, that can have a greater effect on the overall result.
Typically, casino games are quicker to play and players generate revenue on an individual basis, unlike in poker where there may be as many as 10 players involved in generating rake from one hand of poker although multi-player blackjack is an example of a peer-to-peer casino game.

These include large set piece events such as the football World Cup or the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, as well as the regular seasons of the most popular sports.
The timing of such events means that the number of bets placed and total amount wagered can vary substantially month to month.
The volume of bets placed and average bet size can also vary substantially between countries.
Gross win The conversion from stakes placed to revenue or gross win is determined by the gross win margin.
This reflects the ability of the bookmaker to price the odds correctly and ultimately make a profit.
Typically in online sports betting, gross win margins are between 5% and 7% but can vary markedly.
Gross win margins can be negative when an unexpected result occurs and the bookmaker has not taken appropriate steps to mitigate the financial impact of such an event occurring.
Volatility in gross win margins can be reduced through a combination of careful risk management and through offering a broad portfolio of bets that help to spread the impact of an unexpected event across a wider revenue base.
