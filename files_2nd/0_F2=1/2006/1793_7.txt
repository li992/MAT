Valuations of PPP equity often rely on the use of multiples to produce a proxy cash flow valuation.
This produces somewhat crude benchmarks as such an The valuation method approach takes no account of the time value of money, expected rate of return The valuation does not set out to estimate the market value of the of the asset, the performance of the asset or the potential for capital restructuring.

Cash flows anticipated to occur during the operations period are discounted back to the beginning of the operations phase at 8%.
A net present value is calculated at the end of the construction period by deducting the investment cash flows that occur at this time from the value of the discounted cash flows at the beginning of operations.
The net present value at the end of the construction period is then discounted back to financial close at 12%.
Any projects at preferred bidder have a scaling factor of 50% applied to the NPV at financial close.
