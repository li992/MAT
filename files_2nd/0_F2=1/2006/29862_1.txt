TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY The investment objective of Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC TEMIT or the Company is to provide long-term capital appreciation for its investors through investment in companies operating in emerging markets or whose stocks are listed on the stock markets of such countries.
Where possible, investment will generally continue to be made directly in the stock markets of emerging countries.
However, investments in companies listed on more developed stock exchanges may also be made where those companies derive a significant source of their revenue from emerging markets.
Where appropriate, for example to gain access to markets closed to foreign investors, investments may be made in emerging markets through collective investment schemes but such indirect investment is not likely to be substantial.
In any event, Templeton Asset Management Ltd TAML or the Investment Manager, as the Investment Manager to the Company, will invest directly only in countries where it is satisfied that acceptable custodial and other arrangements are in place to safeguard TEMITs investments and in companies with perceived satisfactory procedures.
TEMITs funds are normally invested in equity securities, although the Investment Manager may invest in equity-related investments such as convertibles when there are perceived to be advantages.
In addition, in response to market conditions, funds may be held temporarily in non-equity related securities or cash.
The Board has agreed that in exceptional circumstances, TEMIT may borrow up to 10% of its net assets.
