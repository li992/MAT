Dividends An interim dividend of 3.80p 2005: 3.50p per share was paid on 13 January 2006.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 14.20p 2005: 12.90p per share be paid on 6 July 2006 to shareholders on the register on 9 June 2006, with an ex-dividend date of 7 June 2006.
Share Capital Share options outstanding at 31 March 2006 are shown in Note 27 to the financial statements.
A resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting authorising the directors to allot shares and other securities of the company and empowering them in certain limited circumstances to issue shares for cash without first being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders.
If the resolutions are passed the directors will be able to allot 10,021,482 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 501,074 representing 11.79% of the issued share capital and will be able to issue 4,248,925 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 212,446 representing 5% of the issued share capital for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders.
A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting to renew the authority for the company to purchase up to 10% of its own shares.
The authority would only be exercised when it was in the best interests of shareholders and would be expected to lead to an increase in earnings per share.
Performance Share Plan The companys existing long-term incentive policy for senior executives has been based around periodic grants of share options.
The existing option scheme is nearing the end of its ten year life.
Following a review of the possible alternative long-term incentive arrangements, the Remuneration Committee has concluded that the current option-based policy should be discontinued in favour of annual conditional awards of shares, which will be released to the executive after three years if stretching performance conditions are achieved.
To facilitate this change of policy it is proposed to seek shareholder approval for a new long-term incentive arrangement, the Findel Performance Share Plan 2006.
In conjunction with the introduction of the new plan, shareholding guidelines will be introduced by the Remuneration Committee requiring executive directors to build and maintain a significant shareholding in the business.
Under the new policy, executive directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of any shares delivered under the new plan net of taxes until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base salary has been achieved.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this new approach is a significant improvement over the option-based policy it replaces as it provides a much greater focus on the achievement of stretching performance conditions and a strong emphasis on share ownership by the most senior executives.
Supplier Payment Policy The policy of the company is to agree in advance the terms of payment with suppliers, ensure suppliers are made aware of those terms and to abide by such terms.
The companys trade creditors at 31 March 2006 represented 25 creditor days 2005: 18 days based on the total amounts invoiced by suppliers during the year.
