The performance of this product, which ran from 18 December 1996 to 30 November 2005, was exceptional: Total return of 313.5%: Annualised return of 17.1% with a volatility of 18.0%: $100,000 invested in 1996 worth $413,500 in November 2005.
The new Man IP 220 product aims to achieve similar target returns and volatility by investing in the trading programmes of two of our core investment managers whilst providing a capital guarantee from a leading financial institution.
The investment managers comprise AHL target exposure of 100% and Glenwood target exposure of 60%, giving a combined target exposure of 160%.
The $2.3 billion of investor money will give rise to a total increase in funds under management of $3.7 billion, when the targeted level of investment exposure is achieved.
This is by far the largest global private investor launch of a hedge fund product ever achieved.
It is a significant milestone for Man Investments and for the hedge fund industry, particularly during the current more challenging market conditions.
We were able to achieve this international success by making the best use of our resources and global relationships.
This included the structuring of multiple product offerings through six onshore and offshore structures, in five underlying currencies.
