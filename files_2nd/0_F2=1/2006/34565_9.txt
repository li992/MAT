15 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 Our management approach We regard The Mall as a business, not just a portfolio of assets.
Each Mall is more than a collection of shops, it is a venue at the heart of its community.
Local people serving local people.
We aim to recruit General Managers with retail experience, and to place them at the centre of our operation.
Each Mall has access to marketing, financial, HR, IT and surveying expertise located at our London and Glasgow offices.
Our objective is to provide and promote a clean, safe and stimulating shopping environment, with the retail mix relevant to each local community.
We both create the right space for retailers, and create, manage and market an exciting branded retail environment for our shoppers.
Our strategy There is a significant opportunity to enhance investor returns from further expansion of the portfolio.
We are already seeing scale benefits in terms of financing, branding, ancillary incomes and co-operation with retailers and other commercial partners on a portfolio basis.
When we buy an extra centre we have a distinct competitive edge we can immediately link it to our management system, and take steps to improve the retail offer.
In order to raise the equity to increase the size of the portfolio, we need to continue to outperform and to further build up our management infrastructure.
