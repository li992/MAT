Financial performance during the year The Group produced record underlying earnings of $5.5 billion, 46% higher than 2005, with record production levels at many of its mining operations.
With strong cash ow, the Group announced during 2006 and early 2007 the return of $10.5 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and special dividends.

Underlying earnings totalled $5,471 million, with strong contributions from Base Metals and Platinum Base metals and Platinum as well as a signi cant increase in contribution from AngloGold Ashanti.
Coal recorded lower underlying produced record results earnings mainly due to a decline in export sales volumes and increased costs, while Paper and Packaging recorded a lower earnings contribution and Industrial Minerals a at contribution, owing to continuing dif cult Increased production in most market conditions, although Paper and Packaging saw some improvement in overall market conditions in the commodities, with particularly second half of the year.
Underlying earnings at fide Beers were below the prior year, principally re ecting strong performances in second lower sales by The Diamond Trading Company and increased exploration and development costs, as well as half of the year lower preference share income arising from the June 2006 redemptions, and higher minorities as a result of Pro t for the financial year up the Ponahalo black economic empowerment transaction which was completed in April 2006.
Kumbas 76% over 2005 results showed a signi cant increase over the prior year: however, Ferrous Metals as a whole recorded a lower contribution chie y owing to lower manganese and vanadium prices, the impact of the increased During 2006 and early 2007, minorities as a result of the Highveld part disposal in July 2006, as well as the full year impact of the Anglo American announced the disposal in mid-2005 of Boart Longyear and Samancor Chrome.

This increase relates mainly to strong operational results, as discussed above.
There was a signi cant increase in net pro ts on disposal which, including associates, was $1,182 million higher than 2005, mainly as a result of the Groups disposal of 19.7 million ordinary shares in AngloGold Ashanti and the Groups non-participation in the issue of ordinary shares by AngloGold Ashanti $909 million net pro t on disposal, as well as the pro t of $301 million on part disposal of Highveld.
This was largely offset by the $52 million loss on part disposal of Kumbas non-iron ore assets as well as operating special items and remeasurements losses of $991 million, including the impairment and restructuring of certain Tarmac assets $278 million, impairment and closure costs relating to the Dartbrook coal mine in Australia $125 million, impairment mainly of certain downstream converting Packaging assets and certain Business Paper assets at Paper and Packaging $104 million and unrealised losses on non-hedge derivatives $429 million, recorded principally at AngloGold Ashanti.
The Groups results are in uenced by a variety of currencies owing to its geographic diversity.

This included a $278 million combined impairment and restructuring charge relating to certain noncore assets to be sold and other assets to be restructured at Industrial Minerals following the conclusion of the strategic review, an impairment and related closure costs of $125 million at Anglo Coal Australias Dartbrook mine, and a $104 million impairment at Paper and Packaging mainly of certain downstream converting Packaging assets.
Operating remeasurements, including associates, of $429 million principally related to unrealised losses on non-hedge commodity derivatives at AngloGold Ashanti.
The loss in 2006 related to the revaluation of non-hedge derivatives resulting from changes in the prevailing spot gold price, exchange rates and interest rates compared with the equivalent period in 2005.
Net pro t on sale of operations, including associates, amounted to $1,367 million.
This included the pro t on sale of 19.7 million ordinary shares in AngloGold Ashanti, which resulted in $737 million pro t on disposal as well as $172 million pro t on the deemed disposal of AngloGold Ashanti arising from the non-participation in the issue of ordinary shares by AngloGold Ashanti.
A gain of $301 million also arose on the part disposal of Highveld, offset by a loss of $52 million on the part disposal of Kumbas non-iron ore assets.
The Group also realised a $103 million pro t on the sale of an indirect 26% equity interest in fide Beers Consolidated Mines Limited to Ponahalo Holdings Proprietary Limited.
34 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Financing remeasurements, including associates, are made up of a $18 million fair value loss on the AngloGold Ashanti convertible bond option, unrealised gains of $8 million on non-hedge derivatives and a $40 million foreign exchange gain on fide Beers dollar preference shares held by a rand denominated entity.
In line with IFRIC guidance, the option component of the AngloGold Ashanti convertible bond is fair valued at each reporting period and held as a liability.
Changes in fair value of the liability are taken to the income statement.
The fide Beers dollar preference shares held by a rand functional currency entity are classi ed as financial asset investments and are retranslated at each period end.
The resulting rand:dollar foreign exchange gains and losses are reported through the income statement as a remeasurement charge.
Net finance costs Net finance costs, excluding special items and remeasurement gains of nil 2005: gain of $35 million, decreased from $428 million in 2005 to $165 million.
The decrease re ects lower interest costs due to the reduction in net debt.

Associates tax, before special items and remeasurements included within Share of net income from associates for the year ended 31 December 2006 is $369 million 2005: $281 million.
The effective rate of taxation, before special items and remeasurements including share of associates tax before special items and remeasurements, was 32.7%.
This was an increase from the effective rate, on the same basis, of 26.5% in the year ended 31 December 2005.
The December 2005 tax rate bene ted from the one-off impact of a reduction in the statutory tax rates in South Africa and Ghana.

Repayment of loans and capital from associates amounted to $394 million, and is attributable to capital redemptions by fide Beers, comprising the redemption of $175 million of preference shares and a further $219 million in respect of a share premium redemption following the Ponahalo black economic empowerment transaction.
Purchases of tangible assets amounted to $3,686 million, an increase of $380 million.
Increased capital expenditure by Platinum, Coal, Ferrous Metals and Industries and Base Metals was partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditure at Paper and Packaging, as well as the impact of including AngloGold Ashantis capital expenditure up to 20 April 2006, after which it was accounted for as an associate.

This was achieved on the back of a signi cantly higher price achieved for the basket of metals sold, increased production and a weaker average rand US dollar exchange rate.
Markets The average dollar price realised for the basket of metals sold equated to $2,030 per platinum ounce, 46% higher than in 2005, with rmer platinum, rhodium and nickel prices making the largest contribution to the increase.
The average realised price for platinum of $1,140 per ounce was $246 higher than in 2005, while nickel averaged $10.74 per pound against $6.77 in 2005.
The price achieved for rhodium averaged $3,542 per ounce, an increase of $1,576 per ounce over 2005, and includes the effect of existing long term contractual arrangements entered into with some customers to support and develop the rhodium market.
Technological development continues to drive industrial demand for platinum and ongoing research into new applications will create further growth in this sector.
With the rapid spread of exhaust emissions legislation, over 91% of new vehicles sold in the world now have autocatalysts tted.
The intensifying stringency of emissions legislation will drive growth in PGM demand for autocatalysts as new legislation is applied to trucks and off road vehicles in the US.
The increasing popularity of diesel powered vehicles in Europe continues and this has also intensi ed the demand for platinum, as diesel powered cars can only use autocatalysts that are predominantly platinum based.
Operating performance Re ned platinum production for the year rose by 15% to 2,816,500 ounces, primarily due to increased production at mining operations and the release of metal from pipeline stocks, including the processing of concentrate built up at the Polokwane Smelter in 2005.
Platinum production from mining operations, expressed in equivalent re ned ounces metal contained in concentrate net of smelting and re ning losses increased by 5% to 2,638,600 ounces.
The increase was mainly attributable to improved production volumes at the Amandelbult, Kroondal, Modikwa, Bafokeng-Rasimone and Rustenburg operations as well as new output from the Marikana and Mototolo operations.
However, this was partly offset by lower output from Potgietersrust and the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment plant.
The cash operating cost per equivalent re ned platinum ounce in rand terms increased by 10.7%.
Once-off additional ground support work during 2006 at Union, equipping and development programmes to establish a sustainable base for future production at Amandelbult and Rustenburg, cost increases in diesel, steel, tyres and labour and the effect of lower grades as a consequence of a higher percentage of UG2 ore mined were the principal reasons for the above in ation unit cost increase.
Projects Anglo Platinum remains con dent of the robustness of demand for platinum and is continuing with its expansion programme and expects to meet its stated average compound growth target of 5% per annum by exploiting its own reserves through direct investment in projects as well as with joint venture partners.
This growth pro le requires projects that will create incremental new production as well as maintain existing production levels due to reserve depletion from current mining activities.
The implementation of Anglo Platinums extensive suite of mining and processing projects to expand and maintain production continues on schedule.
Projects that have increased production include Modikwa, Kroondal and, for the first time in 2006, the Marikana and Mototolo ventures each added 12,800 equivalent re ned platinum ounces.
Marikana, approved in 2005, will produce 74,000 re ned platinum ounces a year by 2009.
Mototolo is set to reach steady state production by the end of 2007, producing re ned platinum of 130,000 ounces per annum at steady state.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 37 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 | OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR In 2006 the company approved capital expenditure totalling $1.6 billion, which included the Potgietersrust North expansion project.
Work on this project, which aims to mill an additional 600,000 tonnes per month tpm of ore, producing an additional 230,000 re ned platinum ounces per annum from 2009, has commenced.
Projects that contribute towards maintaining production levels include the Amandelbult 1 shaft optimisation project, which was successfully completed during the year, with the 75,000 tpm UG2 concentrator being fully commissioned and running at capacity.
This concentrator processes UG2 ore as Merensky production declines due to the depletion of Merensky ore reserves.
The Amandelbult East Upper UG2 project, which was approved in 2006, will conventionally mine the UG2 reef, using existing mining infrastructure previously employed to extract Merensky reef, at the vertical number 2 shaft and at three decline shafts.
The 75,000 tpm UG2 concentrator will be expanded to 210,000 tpm and by 2012 the project will contribute an additional 106,000 ounces of re ned platinum per annum.
The Rustenburg Paardekraal 2 shaft replacement project will access deeper Merensky reserves at a rate of 100,000 tpm.
The project is expected to produce 120,000 ounces of re ned platinum per annum by 2015, replacing decreasing production as a result of reserve depletion.
The Townlands Ore Replacement project at a capital cost of $139 million was approved in February 2007 and will replace 70,000 ounces of re ned platinum per annum by 2014 with production from new Merensky and UG2 areas at the Rustenburg Townlands shaft.
In December, Anglo Platinum concluded a black economic empowerment transaction with the Bakgatla-BaKgafela traditional community, under which the community acquired a 15% interest in Anglo Platinums Union Section mining and concentrating business as well as interests in the prospecting rights of certain properties in the vicinity of Union Section.
Outlook The demand for newly mined platinum continues to grow from the autocatalyst and industrial sectors, offsetting the decline in demand from the jewellery sector.
Autocatalyst demand is expected to continue expanding in response to growth in the sales of diesel vehicles worldwide coupled with the advances in emission legislation requiring the tment of catalyst systems and particulate lters containing platinum.
The application of platinum in a wide variety of uses in industry remains robust.
In the jewellery sector, the high price of platinum, but more importantly the volatility in the price, is limiting the levels of stock held within the trade and hence demand is down.
Additional development projects to support the Platinum brand and the industry are being implemented in China, Japan and the US.
These initiatives are expected to sustain interest and assist in restoring demand even at current price levels.
The recovery of palladium demand in the industrial market continues particularly in the autocatalyst and electronics sectors.
Substitution of palladium for platinum in petrol engine emission control catalysts is a continuing feature.
Demand for palladium in the Chinese jewellery trade reduced from the exceptional peak last year as the manufacturing and retail pipelines were established.
Sustained demand will be dependent on creating consumer desire for the product.
The development of a differentiating image for palladium is in its infancy, but being pursued.
Investor interest is also supporting the market for palladium, which continues to absorb additional supply from Russian stocks.
The markets for rhodium and ruthenium are supported by strong industrial demand and are expected to be buoyant in the medium term.
Re ned platinum production for 2007 is expected to be between 2.8 million and 2.9 million ounces.
While production and sales volumes will increase in 2007, the most signi cant variable affecting earnings will be metal prices and the rand US dollar exchange rate.

The Groups share of fide Beers net assets is disclosed.
The Groups share of operating pro t from fide Beers declined by 21% to $463 million from the 2005 gure of $583 million.
This was largely attributable to lower sales by The Diamond Trading Company DTC, the marketing arm of fide Beers, increased exploration and development costs, reduced earnings in the diamond account, the impact of increased finance charges, and the dilution in earnings as a consequence of the sale of 26% of fide Beers Consolidated Mines to a black economic empowerment consortium.
38 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Markets Solid consumer demand for diamond jewellery continued in 2006, with the US, and particularly China and India, reporting strong sales growth.
Sales by the DTC were $6.2 billion, slightly below the previous year 2005: $6.5 billion, though still the second highest on record.
The decline re ected the reduced supply available to the DTC and the continuing challenging environment in the wholesale market for rough diamonds, where a lack of liquidity, margin pressure and increasing nancing costs impacted pipeline demand.
DTC marketing initiatives continue to effectively drive demand for diamond jewellery.
Preliminary reports point to global retail sales for 2006 rising by about 4%-5%, with India and China achieving double digit growth.
DTC marketing programmes such as Journey Diamond Jewellery and Trilogy were strong growth drivers in 2006.
Independently managed fide Beers Diamond Jewellers DBDJ, the fide Beers retail joint venture with Met Hennessy Louis Vuitton, had an excellent year, with an encouraging performance in the US, which accounts for around 50% of world jewellery sales by value.
In 2007 DBDJ will introduce its first wristwatch collection and increase its presence in the US, the Middle East, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea.
Operating performance In 2006 the fide Beers group achieved its highest ever production of 51 million carats 2005: 49 million carats.
This was attributable mainly to Debswana raising output in Botswana from 31.9 million carats to 34.3 million carats.
In Namibia, Namdeb lifted production by 18% to just over 2 million carats.
Production from the South African operations totalled 14.6 million carats.
Element Six, fide Beers industrial diamond business, continues to achieve sustained growth, recording a satisfactory pro t for the year.
In Canada, fide Beers is on target to start production at Snap Lake in the Northwest Territories in October 2007, while the Victor mine in Ontario is scheduled to come on stream in the last quarter of 2008.
In June 2006 fide Beers announced that it had been granted a right to mine for diamonds at the long closed Voorspoed mine in South Africas Free State province.
As part of its $145 million South African Sea Areas marine mining project, a mining vessel, now undergoing commissioning, will commence operations off the west coast of South Africa in the third quarter of 2007.
When all of these operations are in full production they will contribute 3.3 million carats, valued at $700 million, to fide Beers production capacity.
In 2006 fide Beers positioned itself well to take advantage of exploration opportunities.
The company has been granted three new concessions in Angola, prospecting licences have been granted in Botswana around the Jwaneng and Orapa areas, while fide Beers is involved in a number of joint ventures to access promising ground in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In Canada, fide Beers has sold its 42% stake in the Fort la Corne project in Saskatchewan.
In September 2006 fide Beers and Alrosa, the leading Russian diamond mining company, signed a Memorandum of Understanding which should lead to joint diamond prospecting and exploration activities in Russia.
A groundbreaking empowerment transaction was concluded in April 2006, resulting in the sale of 26% of fide Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African mining arm of fide Beers, to a black economic empowerment consortium.
In May 2006 the Government of Botswana and fide Beers signed the renewal of the mining licence for Jwaneng, the worlds most valuable diamond mine.
The licence will run for 25 years effective from 1 August 2004, while the currently held licences for the Orapa, Letlhakane and Damtshaa mines were also extended to 2029.
The agreement also covered the sale of diamond production from Debswana held 50:50 by the Government of Botswana and fide Beers to the DTC for a further five years, and the establishment of Diamond Trading Company Botswana also equally owned by the two parties to sort and value all Debswanas diamond production.
On 30 January 2007, the Government of Namibia and fide Beers announced the extension of the DTC sales contract for a further eight years effective 1 January 2006, and the establishment of Namibia Diamond Trading Company to sort, value and market Namibias diamond output.
Following the announcement in 2004 that fide Beers had reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice, fide Beers announced a provisional agreement in March 2006 to settle and consolidate the remaining class actions against fide Beers for a total sum of $295 million.
Proceedings to obtain final judicial approval of the settlement of the class actions are continuing.
On 31 January 2007 the European Commission formally announced that it had decided to reject all of the outstanding complaints against fide Beers and the DTC in respect of the DTC Sales and Marketing policy, and the Russian Trade agreement.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 39 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 | OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR Outlook The outlook for further growth in retail diamond jewellery sales remains positive, with India and China likely to be the leading growth markets, and the US continuing its five year growth trend.
While DTC sales are likely to be constrained by availability in 2007, due to the reduction in Russian purchases as agreed with the European Commission, fide Beers will bene t from bringing new production on stream towards the end of the third quarter of 2007. fide Beers will focus on implementing its new vision of maximising the value of its leadership position.
This includes, in addition to new production, reviewing assets that do not t the fide Beers portfolio criteria, focusing exploration on the most prospective areas, continuing to improve cost ef ciency and investing in DBDJ and the Forevermark marketing programmes.

Although copper and zinc treatment and re ning charges eased, increases in metal price linked smelter deductions and price participation saw a signi cant increase in this component of costs.
The strength of the Chilean and Brazilian currencies against the dollar also adversely impacted operating pro ts.
Markets 2006 2005 Average LME prices US cents lb Copper 305 167 Nickel 1,095 668 Zinc 148 63 Lead 58 44 With global GDP growth remaining strong, average base metal prices moved signi cantly upwards in 2006.
Although copper demand was slightly weaker than expected with destocking by the Chinese and other manufacturers and price induced substitution particularly in respect of copper and nickel was also a feature, aggregate demand growth for base metals was largely as expected at 5%-6%.
The primary drivers of the dramatic increase in prices were tight metal inventories in turn, a re ection of weak mine supply growth arising from a lack of investment in new capacity and further supply side disruptions, particularly in the case of copper and the signi cant and rapid in ow of speculative and investor funds into commodities markets.

Production, which included a record amount of cathode, was marginally lower at 226,000 tonnes 2005: 227,300 tonnes.
El Soldado saw increasing mining exibility and grade as the year progressed and delivered 68,700 tonnes 2005: 66,500 tonnes.
Mantoverde suffered some delays in dump construction early in the year and output decreased by 3% to 60,300 tonnes.
Mantos Blancos reduced the dump leach area under irrigation but this was more than offset by improved grades and recoveries in both the vat leach and sulphide ore circuits, resulting in a 5% rise in production to 91,700 tonnes.

Molybdenum production rose materially to 3,400 tonnes 2005: 300 tonnes in the first full year of molybdenum plant production.
Chagres increased production by 26% to 173,400 tonnes following the completion of the expansion project at the end of 2005.
40 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 The $80 million El Soldado pit extension project was completed on time and under budget.
The Los Bronces feasibility study, which contemplates increasing copper production by 75% at a cost of approximately $1.2 billion, will be completed in mid-2007, while the Quellaveco revised feasibility study, examining a project with production of copper of around 200,000 tonnes per annum tpa at a capital cost of approximately $1.2 billion, will be complete in 2008.
Evaluation of the progressive debottlenecking project at Collahuasi will be undertaken this year.
The new Chilean mining tax was paid with effect from January 2006.

Codemin output rose to 9,800 tonnes 2005: 9,600 tonnes, but sales volumes were 11% higher owing to the timing of shipments.
In the first full year of production following the completion of the scalping project, niobium output increased a further 18% to a record 4,700 tonnes.
Namakwa Sands zircon and rutile production was very similar to 2005 at 128,400 tonnes and 28,200 tonnes respectively, while slag tonnage, which had been at similar levels until a major furnace burn out occurred in August, was 19% lower at 133,900 tonnes.
In December the $1.2 billion Barro Alto project, which will see the construction of a 36,000 tpa ferronickel operation in Brazil, was approved.

Although operations were again running at design capacity by December, production for the year eased to 129,900 tonnes 2005: 132,800 tonnes.
Increased production from secondary mining released by the back ll programme, improved grades arising from the start up of mining in the Bog Zone and higher mill throughput and recoveries resulted in Lisheen producing 170,700 tonnes of zinc and 23,100 tonnes of lead 2005: 159,300 tonnes and 20,800 tonnes, respectively.
At Black Mountain the commissioning at the Deeps shaft and the phased redeployment from the Broken Hill and Swartberg orebodies to, and the opening up of, the Deeps orebody has led to a gradual improvement in grade.
This, together with a modest improvement in mill throughput, saw an increase of 6% in zinc production and 14% in lead output to 34,100 tonnes and 48,300 tonnes, respectively.
In January 2007 it was announced that black economic empowerment company Exxaro Resources Limited had exercised an option under which it had, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent and contractual price adjustments, agreed to acquire Namakwa Sands for $0.3 billion R2.0 billion and 26% of each of Black Mountain and Gamsberg for a combined gure of $26 million R180 million.
Anglo Base Metals continues to focus on operational excellence and delivering on the value adding growth options that it is creating.
Increases in zinc and ferroniobium production are forecast in 2007 while nickel output should be maintained.
Copper production, excluding Collahuasi, is forecast to increase modestly.
Collahuasi had forecast a rise in production of some 5%, but the taking down of a SAG mill for 65 days to replace its stator motor which is covered by insurance will result in an attributable shortfall of approximately 13,000 tonnes and a level of production in line with 2006.
Outlook After four consecutive years of particularly strong growth in the world economy, the current consensus is one of slightly lower growth in 2007 without undue pressure on in ation rates and thus the level of interest rates.
Although fundamentals will continue to be positive and overall stock levels below normal, both the zinc and the copper markets are likely to see some stock build up as they move into a surplus in 2007, the extent of which particularly in copper will depend on supply side disruptions.
Nickel markets will remain very tight in 2007, but nickel and zinc markets will see further increases in supply in 2008.
Fundamentals are therefore supportive, but suggest an easing of prices.
The full extent of any price moves and the pace of such change will be dictated by uctuations in speculative and investment funds sentiment in what is likely to be a volatile pricing environment.

Markets World crude steel production increased by 9% in 2006, to reach a total of 1.2 billion tonnes.
China accounted for most of the increase, with its share of global output rising to 34% in 2006.
The South African steel market was characterised by strong demand, attributable to numerous major projects, among them infrastructural preparations for the 2010 Soccer World Cup, as well as expansion by utilities and the mining and chemical industries.
Operating performance Kumba achieved an operating pro t of $778 million 2005: $568 million.
Global iron ore demand remained strong in 2006, fuelled by the continuing expansion of the steel industry in China.
In addition to the 71.5% annual iron ore price increase achieved in April 2005, an annual increase of 19% was achieved with effect from April 2006.
Export sales volumes for the period grew in line with production improvements.
Kumba Iron Ore produced a record 31 million tonnes mt of iron ore for the period, exporting 21 mt.
A $754 million, three year expansion programme is currently under way at the Sishen mine which will increase sales volumes by 40% to 45 million tonnes per annum.
Ramp up will commence in 2007, with full production expected in early 2009.
Scaw produced a record operating pro t of $160 million 2005: $121 million.
The acquisition in February of AltaSteel, a manufacturer of value added steel products in Canada, together with the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Moly-Cop Canada, contributed $32 million for the year.
Strong demand for rolled, cast and wire rod products contributed to higher pro ts.
The international grinding media operations achieved higher sales volumes, although this bene t was more than offset by negative exchange rate movements.
Anglo Americans attributable share of Samancors operating pro t was $52 million 2005: $144 million.
The 2005 operating pro t included a $16 million contribution from Samancors chrome business, which was disposed of in June 2005.
Although higher manganese ore sales volumes were achieved, lower alloy volumes and lower selling prices negatively impacted pro ts.
In 2006, the average manganese ore price achieved was $2.2 per metric tonne unit mtu, compared with the 2005 average price of $2.9 mtu.
Highveld reported a lower operating pro t of $230 million 2005: $436 million, although this performance was still the second best in its history.
An increased contribution from the steel business, driven by strong South African steel demand, was more than counteracted by the easing of vanadium prices from the record levels achieved in 2005.
In 2006, the average ferrovanadium price achieved was $39 per kilogram of vanadium kgV compared with the 2005 average of $66 kgV.
Tongaat-Huletts operating pro t grew to $154 million 2005: $131 million.
The sugar operations bene ted from a higher world sugar price of 12.8 US cents per pound c lb in 2006, compared with 9.0 c lb in 2005, while the 2006 South African sugar crop was the second lowest in ten years.
Hulamin continued its progress in increasing sales volumes, with record rolled product sales of 183,000 tonnes 2005: 173,000 tonnes.
African Products margins were affected by pricing pressures on starch and glucose and increasing maize input costs.
Moreland bene ted from increased contributions from its commercial, industrial and resorts property development portfolios.
42 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Strategic review Further progress was made on optimising asset base during the year.
In July, Anglo American announced the sale of its 79% shareholding in Highveld Steel to Evraz, an international steel producer, and Credit Suisse, for an aggregate consideration of $678 million.
Following the disposal of the initial 49.8%, for which Anglo American received $412 million, Evraz has an option to acquire Anglo Americans remaining 29.2% stake in Highveld Steel for $266 million once regulatory approvals are received.
This amount will be reduced by any dividends paid by Highveld Steel prior to Anglo American selling its remaining shares.
The deal represents a substantial foreign direct investment in South Africa.
In November the Kumba empowerment transaction was completed.
This resulted in the listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange of Kumba Iron Ore, as a pure-play iron ore company in which Anglo American holds 64%, and Exxaro, which became South Africas largest black economic empowered natural resources company.
In December the Tongaat-Hulett Group announced the proposed unbundling and listing of Hulett Aluminium and simultaneous introduction of broad based black economic empowerment BBBEE into both companies.
This transaction, which is anticipated to be completed by mid-2007, will result in BBBEE groups acquiring 25% and 15% interests in Tongaat-Hulett and Hulett Aluminium, respectively.
Anglo Americans shareholding in Tongaat-Hulett will reduce from 50% to 38% and its shareholding in Hulett Aluminium from an effective 45% to 39%.
In line with Anglo Americans objective of consolidating its agri-processing businesses within TongaatHulett, it was announced in December that Tongaat-Hulett had acquired Anglo Americans 50% shareholding in the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange listed sugar producer, Hippo Valley Estates, for $36 million.
Outlook Global economic growth looks set to continue in 2007, albeit at a slightly softer pace, with global steel output forecast to rise by over 6% in 2007.
The outlook for Ferrous Metals and Industries remains broadly positive, given the benchmark annual iron ore price increase of 9.5% effective 1 April 2007 and a stable rand.
Earnings in 2007 will be in uenced by the timing of the sale of Anglo Americans remaining Highveld stake and the transaction unbundling the Tongaat-Hulett aluminium business.
Scaws volumes in the South African market are expected to grow, driven by infrastructural expansion and construction and mining industry activity.
Demand for Scaws products internationally is forecast to remain strong, driven by mining demand in Latin America and buoyant economic growth in Alberta, Canada.
Samancor should bene t from volume improvements and higher prices.
Highvelds performance in 2007 should be similar to that of 2006, depending largely on vanadium prices and continued strength in South African steel demand.
Tongaat-Hulett is expected to bene t from higher sugar production and sales revenue, while Hulett Aluminium plans to continue to grow its rolled product volumes and optimise its sales mix.
02 & 4 MILLION Coal $ million unless otherwise stated 2006 2005 #OAL 1,019 864 Operating pro t 864 1,019 South Africa 380 470 Australia 279 323 South America 227 240 Projects and corporate 22 14 EBITDA 1,082 1,243 Net operating assets 2,862 2,244 Capital expenditure 780 331 Share of Group operating pro t 9% 16% Share of Group net operating assets 10% 6% Anglo Coals operating pro t decreased by 15% to $864 million.
Coal production and sales for the first half of the year were adversely affected by a combination of poor weather in South Africa and rail and port constraints in Australia.
In the second half production and sales volumes recovered and were markedly higher.
Nevertheless for the year, operating pro t was lower due to an overall decline in export volumes and a pull back in export prices from the very high levels of the year before.
South Africa, Australia and South America contributed 44%, 32% and 26% respectively to operating pro t. Markets Global demand and supply for thermal coal remained well balanced during 2006.
The dampening effect of mild winter temperatures in Europe and the US was mitigated by a series of worldwide logistical and production constraints and a buoyant European energy market, bolstered by high oil and gas prices.
The combination of these factors maintained thermal coal prices at historically high levels.
Metallurgical coal prices softened in 2006 from the highs of 2005, particularly the semi-soft coking and pulverised injection PCI coals.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 43 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 | OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR During 2006 geopolitical events demonstrated coals strategic importance to the overall energy mix.
Compared to oil and gas, coals security of supply from widely distributed reserves makes it one of the worlds most reliable energy sources.
This together with the development and implementation of clean coal technologies will, over time, position coal to make a signi cant contribution towards satisfying future global energy demand while addressing environmental concerns.
Operating performance Operating pro t for South African sourced coal, at $380 million, was 19% lower than the previous years $470 million, re ecting average realised export prices which were 6% lower in 2006 and a 1% decline in export sales volumes.
The rand continued to weaken in 2006, with a positive impact on operating pro t of $28 million.
Production for the year increased by 2.5 million tonnes mt, or 4.3%, to 59.3 mt, as Isibonelo went into full production and output from Landau and New Denmark grew.
Landau bene ted from improved yields arising from plant ef ciency improvements and favourable contractor performance, while New Denmark bene ted from strong longwall performance.
Excessive rainfall during the first quarter hampered production at several operations, in particular New Vaal and Kleinkopje.
Total sales, bolstered by Isibonelo, reached 59.3 mt, 4.5% higher than prior year.
Export sales decreased by 0.2 mt or 1%.
Sales to Eskom rose by 2.5% as increased economic activity continued to spur electricity demand.
Operating pro t for the Australian operations reduced by 14% to $279 million although the 2005 results included $27 million from insurance proceeds pertaining to a roof fall at Moranbah North the previous year.
The decline in operating pro t was chie y on account of lower production volumes arising from the cessation of mining at Dartbrook owing to dif cult geological conditions, combined with commissioning delays to the Grasstree longwall operation.
These reductions were partly compensated by the staged expansion at Dawson, resulting in an overall reduction of 0.9 mt for Anglo Coal Australia.
Site costs rose, with industry in ation statistics reporting 11.7% increases year on year on the back of rising prices of commodities globally and often poor local availability of scarce resources.
Other cost increases came with the expanding Dawson mine and the purchase of third party coal during the Grasstree transition phase at Capcoal.
Port and rail constraints impeded final sales volumes and resulted in higher closing stock on hand at all export mine sites.
Callides output increased by 0.3 mt to 9.8 mt.
Dawson mine received additional heavy mining equipment as part of its incremental expansion and increased production by 11%, with the coking coal proportion of its coal mix rising to 45% from 30% in 2005.
Drayton maintained output, although port constraints resulted in the mine being stock bound at year end.
During the year Capcoal moved its main underground operations to the Grasstree mine, which experienced delays owing to conveyor and longwall commissioning problems, resulting in an 11% reduction in production.
In 2006 work got under way on the Lake Lindsay project, which will extend open cut mining from the Capcoal operation.
Moranbah Norths production was 0.5 mt lower, primarily as a result of dif cult geological challenges being experienced during the first half of 2006.
In South America, operating pro t was 5% lower than 2005 at $227 million following a decline in export selling prices, higher operating costs, particularly in respect of fuel prices, and a stronger Colombian peso.
The decrease in operating pro t was partly offset by an increase in production at Cerrejn of 9% to 28.4 mt as the first expansion project was completed.
Sales volumes at Carbones del Guasare in Venezuela were marginally below 2005 because of transportation dif culties between the mine and the port.
In Australia, capital expenditure for the year was 190% higher at $537 million, principally attributable to the ramp up of the $426 million Dawson and $361 million Lake Lindsay projects.
Dawson is expected to reach full production of 5.7 million tonnes per annum Mtpa in 2007.
Lake Lindsay is proceeding to plan, with first coal scheduled for 2008.
In South Africa, the start of work at the $132 million Mafube mine, wash plant enhancements at Goedehoop and completion of the Isibonelo mine represent the majority of the capital expenditure.
Mafube will increase Anglo Coals thermal coal production by a total of 5 Mtpa Anglo Coals attributable share 2.5 Mtpa.
In South America the expansion of Cerrejn to 32 Mtpa is continuing and full production is scheduled for 2008.
A pre-feasibility study is investigating additional capacity beyond 32 Mtpa.
44 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Outlook The rand exchange rates and coal prices will continue to be the two main variables in 2007, with export prices expected to be more stable in 2007, though with a somewhat softer bias.
Thermal coal prices for 2007 will continue to be subject to volatility, resulting from anticipated growth in India and the Asian economies, increased incremental supply from major producing regions, unpredictable uctuations in seasonal temperatures and the price of competing energy fuels.
Hard coking coal prices have decreased by up to 20% for 2007 contracts beginning in April.
Early negotiations in thermal coal are showing that the market is remaining strong, with similar prices set to be realised in 2007.
Substantial capital will continue to be invested in all regions, with accompanying increases in production, particularly in South Africa and Australia.
In November 2006, Anglo Coal, Hillsborough Resources and North Energy Mining Incorporated created Peace River Coal, of which Anglo Coal owns 60%.
Peace River Coal is a metallurgical coal mine in Canada that is expected to produce around 2.0 mt in 2007.
The agreement between Anglo Coal and Shell with respect to the joint development of Monash Energy coal-to-liquids project advances and the conclusion of the concept study is anticipated in 2007.
In February 2007, Anglo Coal announced the creation of Anglo Inyosi Coal, an empowered coal company housing key current and future domestic and export focused coal operations.
Anglo Coal has signed a Heads of Agreement with Inyosi, a newly formed broad based black economic empowerment company.
Inyosi will acquire 27% of Anglo Inyosi Coal, creating a company valued at $1 billion and incorporating several key Anglo Coal assets, namely Kriel Colliery an existing mine, and the Elders, Zondagsfontein, New Largo and Heidelberg projects.

Tarmac groups operating pro t was 7% lower than 2005 at $315 million.
The UK pro t was down 10%, a robust performance in the face of challenging market conditions, with lower volumes and weaker margins in some businesses exacerbated by high energy costs for much of the year.
Input cost pressures were partly mitigated by cost savings of some $63 million as a result of operational ef ciencies, including Tarmacs ongoing supply chain management programme.
Markets and operating performance Tarmacs contribution from its international businesses increased by 5%, re ecting strong performances by the Middle East and improvements by Poland and Germany, offset by weaker demand in Spain.
Copebrs operating pro t was down 30% from the prior year owing to the combined effects of the 11% strengthening of the Brazilian real against the US dollar and weak demand from the agricultural sector.
In 2006 Tarmac completed its operational, commercial and organisational restructuring.
The new business structure facilitates continuous improvement both operationally and commercially.
The scope of its activities is also now clearly fide ned as aggregates, together with the three routes to market asphalt, concrete and concrete products, and integration of cement where appropriate.
This strengthens Tarmacs ability to improve its results and grow.
A special charge for impairment and restructuring costs of $278 million was taken.
This related to businesses sold $46 million, businesses retained and restructured $212 million and closure and other items $20 million.
In addition to bolt-on acquisitions in France, the Czech Republic and Poland, Tarmac successfully entered Turkey and acquired a developing business in Romania, involving interests in quarries and ready-mixed concrete.
These acquisitions enhance Tarmacs ability to develop its business in central and eastern Europe, identi ed as a key focus of the companys growth strategy.
2006 saw increased focus on improving the pro tability of underperforming businesses and on disposing of non-core businesses, including the UK based Minerals and Materials business and the underperforming TopPave business.
Previously announced disposals of assets in Hong Kong and Germany were completed in the second half of the year.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 45 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 | OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR Tarmacs operating pro t in the UK declined owing largely to general market weakness, which caused demand to fall, and to high and volatile energy related costs for much of the year.
The Aggregate Products business was impacted by weak demand and a highly competitive marketplace, with demand for coated stone being 8% down on the previous year.
During 2006, additional resources were directed at improving commercial and operational processes in Aggregate Products, and early results are encouraging.
Work has started on Tarmacs largest ever contract, resurfacing a stretch of Englands M1 motorway an example of new, long term, framework agreements that now prevail in the marketplace.
Tarmacs Building Products and International businesses experienced improved results compared with the previous year.
However this gain was offset by weak demand for aggregate products, particularly in the road and housing sectors.
Despite a substantial decline in demand from the housing sector for blocks, underlying pro ts in Building Products were 23% better than 2005.
This re ects the bene ts of operational improvements in the Topblock and Precast businesses and the disposal of the underperforming TopPave business.
The Precast business also bene ted from the work related to the construction programme for the 2012 London Olympic games.
Operating pro ts for Tarmac International improved 5% over the previous year owing to stronger markets in France and bene ts accruing from acquisitions and re-organisation and improved performance in Poland, the first full year bene t of the Shawkah quarry in the Middle East one of the largest in the Tarmac group and high demand in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Pro ts in Spain were lower, largely re ecting the impact of higher cement costs despite strong demand in the Central Region.
Outlook Market conditions in the UK are expected to remain challenging with weak demand in some sectors and high cost pressures.
The uncertainty of government spending on infrastructure is also a cause for concern, as is the increasing impact of different types of construction materials such as steel and timber on the industry.
Volatility of energy prices and the impact that they have on Tarmacs business in terms of cement and distribution costs will also continue to affect performance and demand commensurate efforts to drive further ef ciencies.

The Groups share of AngloGold Ashantis net assets is disclosed.
Attributable operating pro t in 2006 climbed to $467 million, 41% higher than the gure for the previous year 2005: $332 million, mainly due to the impact of a stronger gold price, partially offset by the Group accounting for AngloGold Ashanti as an associate from 20 April 2006.
At the end of 2006 the gold price $604 per ounce was more than 36% higher than at the beginning of the year $445 per ounce, while the average price received for the year was 31% higher than the prior year.
Total cash costs were $27 per ounce higher, at $308 per ounce, mainly resulting from stronger operating currencies, in ation and lower grades.
Markets Investor interest in gold continued throughout 2006.
The average gold price received increased by $138 per ounce to $577 per ounce.
This momentum has continued into 2007, with the spot gold price currently well above the $600 per ounce mark.
Operating performance In 2006, AngloGold Ashantis production from ongoing operations declined by 9% to 5.64 million ounces and was largely attributable to reductions of 305,000 ounces in Tanzania, 122,000 ounces in South Africa and 88,000 ounces in Ghana.
These decreases were only partly compensated by small increases in output from assets in Australia, Argentina and Mali.
The review of AngloGold Ashantis assets has resulted in management implementing programmes to ensure that these operations better their ore reserve, pro t margin and growth potential.
46 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 During the year AngloGold Ashanti successfully raised $500 million of equity at a negligible discount to the prevailing market price.
AngloGold Ashanti is focusing on growing the reserve and resource base, both through exploration and through a disciplined, value adding mergers and acquisitions programme.
In respect of both of these activities, the company is now looking outside of the worlds mature gold regions and has exploration projects in Africa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in South America in Colombia.
In Russia, AngloGold Ashanti has announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Polymetal.
Strategic alliances are being pursued in China to allow the company to successfully extract value from a region undergoing signi cant regulatory change.
Exploration partnerships in the Philippines, Laos and Mongolia have resulted in land positions being acquired in several prospective areas.
Outlook The gold price has now risen for six years in succession, which has not been seen since the deregulation of the gold market in the developed markets in 1971.
Ongoing strong demand from the growing economies of China and India as well as continued investor speculation and of cial sector activities are seen as being supportive of the gold price.

The second half performance partially offset the impact of a poor first six months with full year pro ts of $477 million, 4% down on 2005.
Although operating rates for Mondis European upstream paper markets appear to have improved, allowing for some price increases, input cost pressures bre, chemicals and energy and tough trading conditions in downstream converting activities have continued to put margins under pressure.
In response, Mondi has focused on cost saving and pro t improvement initiatives, delivering $224 million of bene ts for the full year.
Markets and operating performance Mondi Packagings operating pro t of $287 million was 2% below the previous years $293 million, the strong upturn in packaging paper pricing was more than offset by higher input costs and continued margin pressure in the converting operations.
Mondi has been active in restructuring its converting operations to improve ef ciencies and focus on high growth niche areas, with ten sites divested and one closed during the year.
In addition Mondi closed down two corrugators amounting to 8% of its capacity.
The results of these actions can be seen in productivity, measured in output per employee, which has improved by 9% across the business.
There were several small acquisitions in the period, with Mondi further strengthening its position in the higher growth niche release liner segment through the acquisition of Akrosil mainly US and European based, Schleipen & Erkens and NBG Special Coatings both European based.
The acquisition of Peterson Barriere in Norway adds to the extrusion coating segment.
The acquisition of the Bulgarian Kraft Paper Factory Stambolijski was nalised during June 2006.
Agreement to dispose of Mondis stake in Bischof Klein, an associate company specialising in polymer lms and exible packaging, was reached in December with completion expected during the first quarter of 2007.
Mondi is considering an investment in Poland or the Czech Republic in a new paper machine to produce lightweight testliner and uting.
This is a market which is growing rapidly and where there is a shortage of product in eastern Europe.
The cost of this investment is estimated at $365 million and will provide capacity of 470,000 tonnes with first production expected in the second half of 2009.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 47 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 | OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR Mondi Business Papers operating pro t of $130 million was 20% down on the $163 million recorded in 2005.
Tough trading conditions contributed to the decline in pro ts particularly in the first half, and were compounded by the slow start up, at the Merebank South Africa operation, of the paper machine PM31 following a major rebuild, and expenses related to project development.
PM31 is now operating at a much improved run rate and is producing better grades of paper.
Further improvement is required, which may include some modi cations to the machine in order that it can produce at its design potential.
In addition the South African operation is undergoing a major restructuring programme to improve ef ciencies and lower costs.
As a result of this restructuring and the improvement in PM31 performance a better result is expected in 2007 from South Africa.
Within the rest of the business the non-integrated mills saw pro tability signi cantly eroded by rising pulp costs but both Syktyvkar and Ruzomberok recorded strong results on the back of increased sales volumes and good cost control.
In response to weak European market conditions Mondi took 110,000 tonnes of annual production capacity out of the business papers market in 2006 by irreversibly converting the Dunaujvaros mill in Hungary to a speciality paper plant and selling the assets.
Overall product demand was positive with uncoated woodfree sales volumes up 10% also helped by increased production from PM31.
The increased demand has led to improved operating rates and some improvement in pricing towards the end of the year an average price increase of 4% was announced across Mondi Business Papers key paper grades in January 2007.
However pricing is still well below historical midcycle levels and margins continue to be impacted by rising input costs, particularly for bre and energy.
Consideration is being given to a major modernisation programme for the Russian operation which could see substantial investment over the next five years in improving infrastructure, increasing capacity and reducing costs through enhanced ef ciencies.
This capital expenditure programme includes some elements that would have been part of the previously announced major pulp expansion project initial cost estimate of $1.5 billion and will allow the mill to be in a good position to reconsider this project once the modernisation programme is complete.
Mondi Packaging South Africa had a better year with improved agricultural packaging volumes and good cost control.
Other operations which comprise the newsprint and merchant activities as well as corporate costs, saw net operating pro ts well up on the comparable period.
All major trading operations recorded improved results with both newsprint operations performing well as a result of an improved pricing environment.
Outlook The company enjoyed a strong nish to 2006 which will provide a good platform going into 2007.
While the trading environment has undoubtedly improved, concerns remain about the strength of the recovery and the level of overcapacity in some of the markets in which Mondi operates.
Mondi management is encouraged by the number and scale of recent industry announcements regarding capacity closures and this bodes well for the future.
Overall Mondi expects a better financial performance in 2007, despite rising corporate costs in anticipation of the demerger from Anglo American plc, as a result of improved pricing for its key products, the focus on cost saving and the bene ts of better PM31 performance.
