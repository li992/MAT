Source: HSBC Baillie Gifford & Co Contributions cannot be added together as they are geometric: for example to calculate how a return of 46.7%, against an index return of 33.2% translates into a relative return of 10.1%, divide the portfolio return of 146.7 by the index return of 133.2 and subtract one.
The above returns are calculated on a total return basis with net income reinvested and borrowings valued at par.
Monks gures represent the returns on the Companys portfolio and the index gures for each geographical area represent the return on the appropriate FTSE World Index.
Asset allocation includes the contribution attributable to currency movements.
