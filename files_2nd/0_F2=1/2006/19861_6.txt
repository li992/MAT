DEEP MINING OVERALL, THE REMAINING FIVE DEEP MINES ACHIEVED A 9% INCREASE IN THE GROUPS OUTPUT OF COAL TO 8.2 MILLION TONNES 2005: 7.5 MILLION TONNES, DEMONSTRATING A MORE ROBUST PLATFORM FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS.
07. indd 15 12 3 07 18:50:33 FINANCIAL REVIEW Deep mining improved its financial performance, producing a profit before Exceptional Items over three of the four quarters of the year.
In the third quarter, however, our deep mines faced difficulties on several fronts, most notably from a major roof fall at the Maltby Colliery.
Although Maltbys production was restored by year end, these difficulties contributed to a loss of 1.3 million tonnes of production across several mines equating to some 44m of lost revenues.
The production loss extended to Welbeck and Thoresby mines which met geological difficulties during face changes, restricting their output, while Daw Mill did not recover to full operating profitability until Q4.
These factors resulted in a loss for the year for ongoing mines of 28.0m 2005: 34.3m.
There were significant geological problems at Harworth and Rossington, which proved insurmountable and ultimately led to the decision to cease operations at these mines.
They made an operating loss of 25.2m 2005: 44.1m and involved exceptional closure costs of 25.4m 2005: 24.8m.
Total deep mining operating losses for the year were 53.2m 2005: 78.4m.
Overall, the remaining five deep mines achieved a 9% increase in output of coal to 8.2 million tonnes 2005: 7.5 million tonnes, demonstrating a more robust platform for future operations.
The profit performance of Harworth and Rossington referred to as closed mines, and ongoing mines all other mines including Maltby is set out in the table below, noting operating and cash costs per Gigajoule GJ against sales prices per GJ to indicate levels of production profitability.

Operating cost excludes Exceptional non-recurring Items.
Operating costs Total operating costs per GJ reduced in the year to 1.56 2005: 1.64, benefiting from lower infrastructure costs at Harworth and Rossington in the run down to closure in 2006.
Ongoing mines operating costs per GJ, however, increased to 1.55 per GJ 2005: 1.54 reecting the events of the third quarter.
The increase in sales price to 1.41 per GJ 2005: 1.35 helped to reduce the scale of losses.
The increase in sales price in 2006 and further price increases expected in 2007 and beyond should provide greater leverage to improve deep mining profitability in the medium term.
Cash costs per GJ also improved at 1.32 per GJ 2005: 1.41.
This excludes central and exceptional costs, and is disclosed to indicate the level of unit cash generation from the mines when comparing this cost to sales price per GJ.
Sale of Maltby Following the year end, we took the decision to sell our Maltby Colliery to Hargreaves Services plc with a transfer of operational assets and liabilities, together with the workforce.
Hargreaves is the second largest customer for Maltby, and the benets to it of owning Maltbys metallurgical coal production and reserves should improve the security of employment at the mine.
The consideration of 21.5m results in a profit on disposal of some 13m.
Maltby delivered an operating loss of some 18m last year after Exceptional Items.
07. indd 16 12 3 07 18:50:34 Exceptional Items Exceptional Items of 24.2m 2005: 32.0m primarily related to the closure of production at Harworth and Rossington collieries and to the roof fall at Maltby.
Exceptional Items also include income of 7.9m 2005: 14.6m from the Coal Investment Aid scheme, which was in the last year of its operation, and pension scheme gains of 4.4m 2005: 5.2m arising from the effect of redundancies.

07. indd 17 12 3 07 18:50:35 Cash generated from ongoing mines was 5.4m 2005: 11.5m, while outows generated from closed mines were 23.6m 2005: 33.5m following the run down of production.
Capital investments of 21.5m 2005: 17.5m were made to ensure continued access to reserves at our ongoing mines to ensure future production.
This represents 54% 2005: 47% of deep mining depreciation and diminution.
This expenditure is generally below depreciation as a result of the annual charge of 11.6m 2005: 9.9m made against the original acquisition cost to cover the depletion of coal reserves.
Redundancy payments of 10.0m 2005: 16.1m were made, together with of 11.5m 2005: 20.5m to restore and rehabilitate mines and against surface damage and liability claims.
After reducing liabilities, receipts from secured deposits for coal and insurance claims were 9.9m 2005: 3.1m, and Coal Investment Aid receipts were 11.1m 2005: 18.5m in the last year of the scheme.
Additional payments to the pension and concessionary fuel schemes of 6.4m 2005: 6.5m reduced retirement benefit liabilities accordingly.
OPERATING REVIEW Ongoing deep mines continued to produce an overall profit before Exceptional Items since the fourth quarter of 2005 with the exception of the third quarter of 2006.
Third quarter performance, and our first fatalities since 2001, overshadowed a year of underlying improvement, in which ongoing mines increased output by 9%.
Production and operating performance by colliery are set out below: Production 2006 mt 2005 mt Ongoing mines Daw Mill 2.7 2.0 Kellingley 2.1 2.0 Maltby 0.7 1.1 Thoresby 1.5 1.4 Welbeck 1.2 1.0 Total ongoing mines 8.2 7.5 Closed mines Harworth 0.5 0.8 Rossington 0.2 0.5 Ellington 0.2 Total closed mines 0.7 1.5 Total deep mines 8.9 9.0 KELLINGLEY COLLIERY.

07. indd 18 12 3 07 18:50:36 Ongoing mines Daw Mill: Output increased to 2.7 million tonnes 2005: 2.0 million tonnes, although this was overshadowed by two fatalities within two months in 2006, and an additional fatality in January 2007.
This has brought the colliery into a period of intensive health, safety and environmental reviews and investigations.
The underlying potential of Daw Mill, which has two sets of state of the art equipment and remaining reserves of some 21.5 million tonnes, however, remains robust.
Kellingley: Output of 2.1 million tonnes improved on the excellent 2005 result of 2.0 million tonnes.
Productivity was sustained, and continuous production was achieved despite two face changes.
The colliery continues to be strongly productive in an area of difficult geology with a move planned to a new area of reserve in 2008.
The mine is currently developing into the new reserves, and the key objectives remain focused on cost efficiencies.
During this period of intensive investment, however, cash generation from this colliery will be limited.
Maltby: Output of 0.7 million tonnes 2005: 1.1 million tonnes was severely impaired by a critical roadway closure throughout Q3 after a major roof fall.
Localised old workings and hard ground severely restricted progress and almost halted production.
The team succeeded in recovering the roadway and full productivity was restored in Q4 after a difficult and highly challenging mid-year, with exibility enhanced by a new fiveshift pattern.
Since the year end this colliery has been sold.
Thoresby: Output improved to 1.5 million tonnes 2005: 1.4 million tonnes despite a seven week face gap from August when ground movements prevented recovery of vital equipment.
Operational teams worked hard to overcome major salvage difficulties and introduced a new, more effective four-shift pattern for the rest of 2006, returning the colliery to full productivity.
Welbeck: Output of 1.2 million tonnes exceeded 2005 1.0 million tonnes following a period of intense operational review and revised working practices.
This was achieved despite face gap delays of 15 weeks after encountering extremely difficult ground conditions caused by nearby old workings, which greatly slowed down a face transfer.
The colliery has increased round the clock shift patterns and has reduced face cycle times by up to 30% by increasing shearer cutting speeds.
Closed and mothballed mines Harworth: Coaling was run down from the half year, nishing in August, after attempts to develop a new face became impossible following geological faulting.
The site is now in a state of care and maintenance to temporarily preserve access to alternative reserves if economic contracts can be secured.
Harworth Colliery incurred exceptional costs of 15.8m relating to costs of closing operations.
Of this, 10.3m was incurred in bringing the colliery to closure.
Additionally, assets were written off, including plant and equipment of 3.6m, and stores stocks of 1.9m.
Rossington: Production ceased in April 2006, following the extraction of 0.2 million tonnes of coal.
Exceptional costs of 5.3m were incurred in closing operations.
Face gaps and operational costs The length of face gaps, when production changes from one area of the mine to another, is a key performance driver of the business.
This typically represents a period of no production when costs are running at normal levels, or in certain cases slightly higher.
There were five face changes in the year, resulting in three protracted face gaps totalling 26 weeks 2005: 33 weeks.
Welbeck had a face gap of 15 weeks from May to July, Maltby had four weeks in Q1, and Thoresby seven weeks in Q3.
07. indd 19 12 3 07 18:50:36 Face gaps and operational costs continued Management efforts and planning continue to focus on reducing these production gaps.
Face gaps and operating costs by quarter are set out in the table below: All mines: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total Face gaps 2006 wks 4 10 12 26 Face gaps 2005 wks 3 23 7 33 Tonnes 2006 million 2.9 2.4 1.5 2.1 8.9 Op.
costs per GJ 2006 1.40 1.40 2.47 1.26 1.56 Operational costs per GJ improved in 2006 except in Q3 when costs increased due to factors discussed earlier in the OFR.
Productivity Costs per GJ reduced in the fourth quarter when productivity improvements were achieved as a result of initiatives to make the mines competitive with foreign coal suppliers, including: Closure or mothballing of high risk, inefficient areas of reserve.
Improved planning on a daily, weekly and long-term basis.
Introduction of project control techniques to improve the management and accountability through the identication and delivery of critical activities to time and cost.
Focus on improving the maintenance regime at the mines in order to improve machine availability and reduce down time.
Improving productivity through focus on performance indicators, cycle time, detailed delay analysis and reduction.
Introduction of multi-disciplined operational improvement teams.
Introduction of more efficient technologies from around the world in all aspects of the underground environment.
At the ongoing mines, the workforce agreements launched in 2005 are being consolidated across all the mines giving a much more exible system of working.
FUTURE PROSPECTS In the final quarter of 2006, deep mining production returned to operating profitability before Exceptional Items.
Forward prices are projected to improve signicantly as historic contracts expire in the next two years, providing improved potential for deep mining cash generation.
Our strategy continues to focus on mining only where access to reserves is sufciently economic.
A wide-ranging operational review is being undertaken to identify and implement further cost-efficiencies within operations.
Forward price and cost projections are continually reviewed to seek out optimal mining decisions for shareholder value.
Decisions have to take account of long-term as well as short-term projections.
UK COAL continues to have a substantial projection of reserves, which will be mined only where economic.
Our reserves potential is described in more detail on the next page.
07. indd 20 12 3 07 18:50:37 Reserves The reserves available in the ongoing deep mines are critical to the long-term prospects of the Group.
The denition of reserves is always subject to some elements of change.
UK COAL continues to utilise the latest technology in seismic exploration, including 3D representations of seams, to provide better denition of reserves.
These techniques have been used at Daw Mill, Kellingley, and Thoresby to assess the reserves more effectively.
The Groups latest estimate at January 2007 of its deep mine coal reserves, excluding Maltby, is as follows: Coal million tonnes Reserve Resource Mineral potential Total: 173 40 70 63 Reserve: Proven reserves which are accessible using the broad infrastructure in place at the current time, and which are in the current mining plan.
Resource: Proven reserves, but reserves that require substantial development and other costs to allow accessibility and are not currently in any mining plan.
Mineral potential: Coal that has been assessed although possibly not to the same extent as Reserve and Resource coal but UK COAL does not have any licenses or planning permission to extract the deposits.
These gures must be treated with caution, being based on the Groups best estimate at the current time.
A number of factors may cause the actual production to vary signicantly from these estimates.
These factors include, but are not limited to: Ongoing seismic surveying of reserves - these could result in either an increase or a decrease to the production estimates: Geological problems - despite the improved seismic surveying being carried out, there remains a risk that a coal face is subject to unforeseen geological problems that makes production unsustainable: Sales price of future coal and cost increases - these could render production plans uneconomic or could allow extraction from areas previously believed to be unviable: and Government support - this could allow investment into new areas of mines not included in current plans.
Centechnology UK Limited In 2006, Centechnology UK Limited completed its first full year of operations, having been established to supply skilled labour to full mining and other associated requirements.
Going forwards, Centechnology UK Limited adds exibility to UK COALs labour resources and has begun to earn revenue externally when there is spare capacity.
Harworth Insurance Limited Harworth Insurance is the Groups captive insurance company and provides insurance services for Group companies to cover risks which are either uninsurable on the open market or where premiums are at uneconomic levels.
These principally relate to deep mining operations, and net costs are incorporated within the deep mining segmental results.
