ANNUAL DIVIDENDS The table below sets out the amounts of interim, final and total dividends paid in respect of each of the years in the five years ended 31 December 2006 in pound Sterling per ordinary share.
These amounts are also shown translated, solely for convenience with the associated UK tax credit included, but after deduction of withholding tax, into US$ per ADS each representing five ordinary shares at the Noon Buying Rate on each of the respective payment dates for such interim and final dividends.
ADS holders will be entitled to receive the US$ equivalent of 0.21 per ADS on 4 June 2007.
The Company is not subject to any laws or agreements that materially restrict its ability to pay dividends from distributable reserves other than those disclosed in note 32, page 127.
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 4.2p, bringing the total for the year to 7.2p.
Future dividends will be dependent on the cash flow, earnings and financial condition of the Company and other factors.
The Noon Buying Rate on 2 April 2007 was $1.9786 per 1.00.
Dividends are paid by the Company in pounds Sterling and exchange rate fluctuations will affect the US$ amounts received by ADS holders on conversion by JPMorgan Chase Bank as depositary of such cash dividends paid.
Moreover, fluctuations in the US$ UK exchange rate will affect the US$ equivalent of the pound Sterling price of the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs in the USA.
