Source: Fundamental Data Ltd. NAV total returns are now calculated on a bid to bid basis.
Historic NAVs have been adjusted to a bid basis by using an average factor compiled from the previous 12 month end valuations.
This adjustment may vary from that shown in the accounts.
4 Change in value with net dividends reinvested.
5 The Companys benchmark is the FTSE World Europe Ex-UK in sterling terms.
Comparison of the Companys performance is made with its benchmark.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not follow or track this index and, consequently, there may be some divergence between its performance and that of the Company.
6 The fair value of the Euro 35m and Euro 100m loans have been calculated by estimating the cost of breaking the interest rate swaps.
With effect from 31st March 2006, the interest rate swaps are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Therefore, the net asset value shown at the foot of the current year balance sheet on page 36 includes debt at fair value.
The net asset value with debt at par value excludes the fair value of the interest rate swaps.
7 Actual gearing means investments expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
This calculation excludes the Companys holdings in liquidity funds which are held as an alternative to cash.
8 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments expressed as a percentage of average net assets over the year.
