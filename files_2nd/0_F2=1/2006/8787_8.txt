A review of strategic performance measurement, including key performance indicators for the business, is included in the Business Review section of the Financial Review on pages 24 and 25.
Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 11.00am on 24 May 2007 at the premises of Cardew Group, 12 Suffolk Street, London SW1Y 4HQ.
The business for the meeting includes eight resolutions as Ordinary Business and four resolutions proposed as Special Business.
Included as Ordinary Business are resolutions to re-elect four Directors.
Mr Burrows is proposed for re-election on retirement.
Dr Davies is proposed for re-election in line with the Companys stated intention in the 2006 Annual Report following the passing of Resolution 7 at the 2006 Annual General Meeting of the Company whereby the Articles of Association were amended to remove the exemption of the Chief Executive from retirement by rotation.
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie Q. C. and Viscount Asquith are proposed for re-election given they have both served on the Board for more than nine years.
The Board have conducted a rigorous review and conclude that Lord Fraser of Carmyllie Q. C. and Viscount Asquith remain independent.
In the spirit of the principles of Corporate Governance contained in the Combined Code of Corporate Governance appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the Board believes it appropriate to seek annual re-election of all non-executive directors who serve on the Board for greater than nine years.
Included in Special Business is an ordinary resolution to allow the Company to send or supply documents or information to members by making them available on the Companys website or other electronic means.
This follows the ability to do so on enactment of the Companies Act 2006 and the Board believes it an appropriate step to take.
Under the legislation it is also a requirement for the individual members to give their consent to receiving information via the website or by e-mail.
Accordingly, in the event the resolution is passed, before communicating electronically, the Company will distribute letters of consent to shareholders.
The three special resolutions to be proposed as Special Business at the Annual General Meeting are: a Purchase of own shares: The Directors recommend that the Company seek authorisation at the Annual General Meeting to renew the authority for the Company to make on-market purchases of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, such authority to expire on the earlier of 15 months from the date of the passing of the resolution and the conclusion of the next annual general meeting if sooner.
The minimum price payable per share under the proposed authority in resolution 10 is the nominal amount of each share currently 10p and the maximum price exclusive of expenses is 5% above the average market price per share for the five business days immediately preceding any purchase.
If granted, the authority will allow the Company to take advantage, if appropriate, of stock market conditions to purchase its own shares.
In assessing whether to purchase the Companys own shares, the Directors will take into account all relevant factors including the effect on earnings per share and assets per share ratios and other benefits to Shareholders.
Any shares purchased would be held as treasury shares.
b Electronic communications with members: As described above under Ordinary Business, the Company is seeking to obtain authority to supply documents to members via the Company website or other electronic means.
This requires the Companys Articles of Association to be amended by replacing the existing Article 142 and adding a new article 147.
The replacement Article 142 adds electronic mail and a website to the mediums of giving notice to a member.
