EBIT was also impacted by XNi rose by 56% to $3,364 million compared to the prior year, primarily due increased unit costs from the strengthening nickel to very strong nickel prices.
A 3% year-on-year reduction in the output of the Canadian dollar, which impacted of refined nickel was mostly offset by a 4% increase in ferronickel output at Falcondo.
EBIT by $40 million in 2006, and inflationOn a pro forma basis, EBIT rose by 180% to $931 million, compared to $333 million for related input costs, such as labour 2005.
The full benefit of higher sales prices and higher volumes was tempered by the compensation and royalties.
strengthening of the Canadian dollar, higher oil prices, rising labour costs and increased royalties payments linked to higher metal prices.
Sudbury and Montcalm Mined nickel production at Sudbury On a consolidated basis, post by-product operations was impacted by lower nickel credits, nickel cash costs fell by 7% to ore grade which fell to 1.11% compared 2.77 per pound, bolstered by stronger to 1.16% in 2005, and poor ground copper and precious metal production and conditions at the Thayer Lindsley mine.
robust copper and precious metal prices.
As a result, the amount of mined ore Ferronickel cash costs increased by 18% processed through Sudburys Strathcona to 5.18 per pound, primarily due to mill declined by 13% to 1.89 million higher oil prices.
This decline was largely offset by a significant increase in custom ores milled, INO which rose more than four-fold to 365,800 Xstrata Nickels Integrated Nickel tonnes compared to 73,300 tonnes in 2005.
Operations INO comprise the Sudbury mines and smelter, Montcalm, and Raglan The Montcalm mine set a production mine in Canada, together with the record in 2006 for net metal nickel Nikkelverk refinery in Norway.
Lower levels produced at 10,600 tonnes, surpassing the of ore feed from Sudbury, combined with 2005 level by 17%.
Production of matte custom matte feed shortfalls in the second at the Sudbury smelter decreased by 2% and third quarters, resulted in lower to 112,400 tonnes, primarily due to lower overall sales volumes for the year, down mine concentrate tonnages, lower feed View of the Nikkelverk refinery, Norway by almost 4% to 82,300 tonnes.
This was grades in the first half of the year, and a three-week vacation shutdown in July.
The decrease was partially offset by a higher volume of custom feed concentrate.
A new three-year labour agreement was signed with production and maintenance employees at Sudbury in early February 2007, with no labour disruptions.
Raglan The Raglan mine in the Canadian Arctic increased milled production by 14% to 1,062,400 tonnes.
Higher mill throughput was achieved as a result of a mill optimization project, the first phase of which was commissioned in October 2005.
