Circulation revenue increased by 0.7 million 0.8%.
The division continued to drive circulation revenue through the ongoing policy to increase cover prices on a little and often basis.
During the year, the division experienced circulation volume declines of 7.7% for Evening titles, 6.3% for Morning titles, 4.8% for Weekly titles and 8.7% for Sunday titles.
Other revenue, excluding acquisitions, fell by 1.1 million 2.5% from 43.9 million to 42.8 million, reflecting a fall in leaflets revenues driven by the difficult advertising marketplace.
The implications of the adverse revenue environment have been partially mitigated by our targeted cost savings and continued tight cost management in the face of significant inflationary cost pressures.
Excluding acquisitions, costs have fallen by 8.4 million from 380.6 million to 372.2 million, contributing to operating profits falling by only 27.2 million, despite revenue declines of 35.6 million.
The declining revenues have, however, impacted operating margins which, excluding acquisitions, fell by 3.4% to 24.8%, and including acquisitions fell by 3.5% to 24.8%.
Whilst margins will remain under pressure due to the continued weakness in advertising markets, the significant cost savings already achieved in the business and the planned efficiencies expected through technology-driven changes to the operating model will ensure a recovery in margins as soon as the advertising markets stabilise.
