A 25 kilometre long, northeast trending 060 anomalous 1 992 metre tactical diamond coring programme at the Tongon corridor has been defined at the contact between granite and prospect, which locates in the Nielle permit, in the north of the volcaniclastic sediments within which locate two target areas.
Geologically the Tongon area comprises a sub-vertical northeast Zamsa consists of two sub parallel anomalies: the first is to east-northeast trending package of intercalated clastic and a plus 20ppb gold in soil anomaly measuring 14 kilometres mafic to intermediate volcano-sedimentary lithologies.
These long by up to 2.5 kilometres wide.
This anomaly is lithologies have been intruded in the central and northern associated with the main regional Bole-Bolgatanga shear regions by large oval shaped northeast trending granodiorite and locates at the contact between granite and to quartz diorite igneous bodies.
In the south, diorite dykes volcanoclastic sediments.
The second is a plus 10ppb and small micro-gabbro bodies have intruded along east gold in soil anomaly measuring five kilometres long by one northeast to east trending structures.
Mineralisation locates kilometre wide and is coincident with the axis of a regional in two zones: northern and southern.

Five holes were completed on the northern zone, further testing Navrongo locates five kilometres to the northeast of Zamsa a 1.5 kilometre strike length of the main shear.

The gap relates to a national forest which cannot be permitted.
Three holes were completed in the southern zone to confirm Ground truthing of anomalies indicates a gentle undulating the results of the prefeasibility study: the results are presented topography with residual soils and poor outcrop.
pitting is in progress to understand the regolith profile and mobile element dispersion prior to infill soil sampling.
The overall geometry of the mineralised zones suggests a significant component of dextral shear which is compatible with previous interpretations.
