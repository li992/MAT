qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 25 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our view of the market UK equity market performance In 2006 the asset management industry benefited from a year of positive returns in the FTSE 100 Index major asset classes.
Despite a sharp correction in equities in May, markets staged a 2006 6,221 remarkably rapid recovery.
The outlook for 2007 is one of slowing economic growth and 2005 5,619 an easing of inflationary pressures.
This benign backdrop should be broadly supportive 2004 4,814 of equities, although we believe that returns are unlikely to be as high as those experienced in 2006.
A key risk is a more pronounced deterioration in the US than 2003 4,477 expected.
We also anticipate that volatility will rise from the low levels seen in 2006.
Merger & Acquisition M&A activity was a significant feature of markets during 2006 as UK Government bond market performance companies have shifted their focus from balance sheet strengthening to aggressive FTA Brit.
fixed all stocks total return growth.
An injection of private equity cash has also helped fuel M&A activity, with deals 2006 1,949 increasingly taking place at the upper end of the market cap spectrum.
2005 1,935 The asset management industry itself was not immune to this upsurge in corporate 2004 1,793 activity, with a number of sizeable transactions during 2006 as well as an expansion of 2003 1,682 the listed asset management sector.
We envisage corporate activity remaining an industry trend, with drivers including the continued move towards open architecture by Note: All graphs are as at 31 December financial services institutions, notably banks, building societies and insurance companies.
As these businesses re-focus on distribution, there is greater willingness to use multiple external asset managers in their product ranges.
In the UK, firms of Independent Financial Advisers are also scaling up to meet the challenge of the new distribution landscape.
This has led to both increasing sectoral consolidation and the emergence of new entrants.
The top tier of investment advisers are increasingly developing discretionary services while the broad adviser market is making more use of multi-manager products.
Fund supermarkets are now widely used by IFAs and we anticipate that the use of wrap accounts will gather pace.
Access to the retail market is therefore about positioning on these platforms and servicing distribution relationships in addition to the prerequisites of strong investment performance supported by a credible brand.
The developments of the last few years in the institutional market continue to gather pace.
The UK has seen a shift over a number of years away from balanced management towards the separation of alpha and beta and increasing use of specialist mandates, and this continues.
A comparable trend towards specialist mandates is now emerging in The Netherlands, Europes second largest pensions market, with a number of schemes moving towards a fiduciary model where a third party manager determines asset allocation, risk budgeting and underlying manager selection.
This development poses a significant risk to balanced management in The Netherlands.
In addition, across a number of developed markets there is a much greater focus on ensuring that pension scheme assets are sufficient to match their liabilities.
This is driving interest in Liability Driven Investment LDI and Asset Liability Management ALM.
Together, these market changes are leading to demand for multi-management capabilities, LDI products, active added value alpha products and alternative investments.
Many of these trends require asset managers to deepen their derivatives expertise.
This demand for more specialist products is prompting asset managers to evolve their business models accordingly.
House processes and top down investment leadership through a Chief Investment Officer are giving way to multi-boutique investment models where investment teams have much greater accountability for specific products and processes, whilst leveraging off a common operational infrastructure.
Likewise, remuneration is becoming more integrally linked to the performance of specific teams and the products that they manage.

Across 2006, F&C experienced net outflows of 32bn of assets under management.
Insurance The remaining 21bn of Resolution Life assets were withdrawn during the 2006 fund flows second quarter of 2006 and F&C received 27m in compensation.

2006 2005 Investment Trusts 2006 was a period of considerable corporate activity within the investment trust sector.
A 694m net outflow of investment trust assets related to three factors: The loss of the F&C Emerging Markets Trust due to corporate activity Asset class 2006 2005 The loss of the F&C Latin American and ISIS Smaller Companies trusts following Fixed interest 52% 55% manager departures Equities 37% 35% Share buy backs, discount controls and restructurings initiated by the trusts Property 5% 5% Other alternative investments 1% 1% Our investment trusts savings products continued to account for approximately a third Money market 5% 4% of all inflows, with our Child Trust Fund exceeding our targeted business volumes.
The F&C UK Select Trust adopted a unique strategy among UK equity trusts ahead of its rollover.
During the first half of 2007 we will look to expand our range of investment trusts with the launch of a listed fund of hedge funds vehicle.
UK Retail 2006 was a strong year with net retail sales up 98%.
This was ahead of the industry increase of 87.5%.
Flows were spread across a range of key products including our ethical UK equities, corporate bonds and multi-manager.
Relationships with key distribution partners have strengthened and we have extended access to our products on a number of platforms.
Our focus in 2007 will remain on multi-manager, UK equities, ethical investment and corporate bonds.
Additionally we are enhancing the marketing of our cash-plus product and will cross-sell our Luxembourg registered global real estate fund into the UK.
Continental European Retail We saw positive progress in The Netherlands and a strong first half in Portugal.
Following the sharp decline in equities in May, fund flows reversed in Portugal as retail investors switched into cash.
This resulted in a net outflow of 278m in our total sub-advisory business at year end.
Retail flows were positive in Germany, where we established a white-labelled share class on our emerging debt fund for Commerzbank and reached a five year performance record on our flagship F&C HVB Stiftungsfonds product which is co-branded with HypoVereinsbank.
We have now created a Euro denominated version of the Stewardship International fund and will seek ways to enhance the marketing of our SICAV range.

qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 29 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our financial performance Underlying profit Asset Management underlying profit decreased by 18% to 89m 2005: 108m.
2006 -18% 89m This reduction mainly arises as a result of the fall in revenues following the previously announced loss of investment mandates.
2005 108m IFRS underlying profit comprises figures in m : 2006 2005 Net reveunes 248 267 Operating expenses 159 151 Other expenses net - 8 F&C underlying earnings per share Underlying earnings per share reduced by 19% to 12.8p 2005: 15.9p.
This 2006 2006 12.8p -19% 12.8p reduction mainly arises as a result of the decrease in underlying profit but also 2005 15.9p reflecting an increase in the number of shares in issue.
Net revenues Net revenues amounted to 248m 2005: 267m.
Revenues were impacted by net 2006 -7% 248m fund outflows of 32bn 2005: 6bn including 21bn in respect of Resolution Life following their merger with Britannic.
Net revenues include performance-related 2005 267m management fees of 10m 2005: 13m.
Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the ongoing costs of running the business and these 2005 2006 50% 5% 151m 159m have increased by 5% to 159m 2005: 151m.
Expenses have increased due to 2005 151m inflationary pressure and increasing competition for management talent.
Staff related costs amount to approximately 60% of total costs and the management of headcount is critical to effective cost control.
Other expenses included in underlying profits, but excluded from operating costs, mainly consist of net finance costs.
Operating expenses exclude: Re-Investment Plan costs, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and net operating costs on investment and insurance costs.
Operating margin Operating margin represents the ratio of operating profit to net revenues and 2006 2006 -17% -17% 36.5% decreased from 44.1% to 36.5%.
The decline in operating margin is mainly due to the lower revenue resulting from the loss of mandates.
We anticipate that the margin will 2005 44.1% fall to around 30% in 2007 as although new products will have a higher margin, our accelerated investment plan will mean investing in additional product and distribution personnel and infrastructure.
Funds under management Funds under management reduced from 131bn to 104bn.
Whilst new business of 2006 -21% 104bn 6bn was won during the year, the loss of the Resolution Life contract through corporate activity was a major factor impacting our net outflows of 32bn.
Resolution outflows in 2005 131bn 2005 were approximately 5bn and a further 21bn was withdrawn in the first half 2006.
We agreed a termination payment with Resolution in respect of this business of 27m which was received in the first half of 2006 and accounted for as a capital receipt to write down the value of the intangible asset.
Net fund flows are a key performance measure for us and indicative of the growth of our business.
Intangible assets the level of fund losses in institutional and investment trust clients and resultant impact on future revenue was significant enough to be considered a potential indicator of impairment in respect of the related intangible assets.
A full impairment review of these assets was therefore undertaken which indicated that the recoverable amount was less than the carrying value by 58m 2005: 112m and accordingly an impairment charge was booked and included in Other Profit Items see page 32.
The value of investment management contracts at 31 December 2006 amounted to 284m 2005: 416m.
Under IFRS we are required to conduct an annual impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill as there is no annual amortisation charge.
Our review demonstrated that there was no impairment in Asset Management goodwill and hence no requirement to write down goodwill 2005: nil.
