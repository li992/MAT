WHAT: Ian is in charge of a 12 million investment programme to improve the quality of drinking water in Northumberland.
Work started on site in January 2006 and is due to be completed by April 2007.
The additional process, known as granular activated carbon GAC, passes water through a bed of carbon to remove the herbicides and pesticides which are present.
GAC is an efficient process because a small amount of carbon, which traps the herbicides and pesticides, has the same surface area as a football pitch, explained Ian.
WHY: Changing agricultural techniques and land use have led to increasing levels of herbicides and pesticides in the river Coquet and studies predict that these levels will continue to rise.
The new treatment process being built at Warkworth will ensure the continuing high quality of drinking water.
This technique has not been used in NWLs northern area before, explained Ian, but it is widely used in Essex and Suffolk, where they have large arable farms.
