SEGRO Annual Report 2006 Focus on a core asset class 05. with secure high-quality income and covenant resilient income profile with a weighted average lease length of 11 years before breaks We develop and acquire buildings on industrial sites or business parks located at key infrastructure junctions or in edge of town locations.
We seek to hold clusters of assets in key business locations in areas of economic growth.
The mix of building type reflects customer requirements as influenced by local economies as well as the precise location on each estate.
For example, the Slough Trading Estate near Heathrow airport, at its centre, has both traditional manufacturing units and modern data centres, but also major corporate offices on prime road frontage locations.
In Belgium we have corporate headquarters in Pegasus Business Park near Brussels airport, whereas in Poland we provide large warehouse and manufacturing facilities again at key transport infrastructure hubs, in this case near to major pan-European road intersections.
This combination of a strong industrial focus with a pan-European geographical spread, means that, even in more challenging macroeconomic conditions, we will always have customers whose businesses are growing, with continual opportunities for us to meet their space requirements across our portfolio.
Currently for example, we have occupiers who have chosen to relocate from the UK or other parts of Western Europe to newly-thriving areas of Central Europe, and we can serve their needs in both ends of this spectrum of locations.
With a diversified range of more than 1,760 occupiers across a wide range of industrial sectors, our customers can, and often do, include small start-up operations, but our major customers also include some of the worlds best-known organisations.
Cisco Systems, RIM BlackBerry, KarstadtQuelle, Masterfoods Mars, O2, Ernst & Young, Corning, Ferrari and DHL are all SEGRO customers.
