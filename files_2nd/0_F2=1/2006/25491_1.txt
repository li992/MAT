The variance in operating profit can be explained as follows: The solid increase in net interest income has been driven by: - Very strong growth in loans and advances and deposits.
- A strong increase in arrangement and exit fees associated with a 54.1% increase in lending turnover.
The impact of IAS 18 has resulted in R345 million 30.0 million 2005: R201 million 17.5 million of lending fees in the South African business being deferred for recognition as margin, 75% of which will be recognised as income by 31 March 2008.
Net fees and commissions receivable principally include fees in relation to trust and fiduciary services, investment management, banking and treasury activities as well as profit share fees arising out of lending transactions.
The growth in net fees and commissions has been driven by strong activity levels in the majority of these areas of specialisation.
Principal transactions include the revaluations and realisations of equity and warrant positions held these are associated with our lending activities and the manner in which certain of our deals are structured.
The increase in principal transactions reflects the increasing contribution made by the Growth and Acquisition Finance business.
Impairment losses on loans and advances have decreased primarily due to the recovery of 5.6 million of specific impairments previously held against two loans and an improvement in the non-performing book in South Africa.
The increase in expenses is mainly as a result of an increase in variable remuneration in line with growth in profitability, an increase in personnel costs given an increase in average headcount and investment in product development and IT infrastructure.
The Banking business launched a range of mortgage offerings for private clients with bespoke mortgage requirements.
These included an innovative multi-currency offering.
The Growth and Acquisition Finance business was a key contributor to bottom line and its portfolio of deals was significantly enhanced.
It was named Alternative Debt Provider of the Year in the Real Deals Private Equity Awards in London 2005 calendar year.
The Investment Management business is validating the investment made over the last few years and has won a number of significant private client mandates.
It was recognised through its nomination for Best Private Bank Internationally for Innovative Products and Services in The Private Banker International Awards 2005, alongside Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.
The Guernsey based bank continues to successfully penetrate the Channel Islands market for deposit raising and is a key provider of liquidity for the Private Bank in Europe.
The Trust and Fiduciary business acquired Quorum Management Limited in Jersey during November 2005 to bolster the scale of its existing operations.
A boutique property fund administration business was launched successfully in Guernsey.
South Africa The Banking division launched the first full internet based mobile banking service in South Africa.
This enables clients to view accounts and make payments and inter-account transfers using their mobile phones, thereby completing the daily banking value proposition.
The treasury cash aggregation product launched during the year was significantly enhanced.
A number of off-balance sheet securitisation vehicles were also established in support of funding initiatives.
The significant ongoing increase in headcount in support of the South African growth strategy bore fruit.
This was reflected in a 39.9% growth in advances, 45.7% growth in deposits and 72.6% increase in funds under advice.
The Growth and Acquisition Finance team completed 24 transactions, providing R758 million of funding for black economic empowerment initiatives.
Private Banking 44 Partner of choice from wealth creation to wealth management Australia The Growth and Acquisition Finance team was bolstered with new specialist skills.
The Structured Property Finance team diversified its proposition and partnered with its clients in a number of principle investments.

Note: The breakdown of profit between Financial Market Activities and Banking Activities as previously provided is no longer considered relevant as the Financial Market Activities support customer flow in the Banking Activities and the businesses are therefore integrated.
The variance in operating profit can be explained as follows: Net interest income has benefited from an increase in advances and average margin, and a stable interest rate environment.
The increase in net fees and commissions receivable is attributable to a solid performance from the advisory and structuring businesses with a number of mandates closed successfully in the year in Project Finance, Resource Finance, Structured Finance and Financial Products.
Principal transactions reflect a significantly improved trading performance in South Africa, particularly from the Equity Derivatives desk which has benefited from its back to basics approach coupled with an increase in volumes, volatilities and the return of the retail investor.
Furthermore, the establishment of the Structured Derivatives Sales team has contributed to the overall performance in South Africa.
In the UK we continue to invest in the trading infrastructure and the newly formed Principle Finance team presents us with a new business opportunity.
The increase in impairment losses on loans and advances reflects an increase in specific impairments in relation to certain project finance and leasing exposures.
Expenses have increased largely due to an increase in headcount staff have been hired to progress various new initiatives and an increase in variable remuneration in line with strong growth in profitability.
This team will seek to create platforms for the securitisation of internal and third party originated banking assets.
We placed our first collateralised loan obligation of acquisition finance assets in March 2006.

The Institutional Stockbroking operations performed very well against a backdrop of favourable equity markets.
The Direct Investments and Private Equity divisions continue to benefit from the strong performance of their underlying portfolios and increased presence in these activities.
The increase in expenses largely relates to an increase in variable remuneration given increased profitability.

The variance in operating profit can be explained as follows: UK and international Operating profit growth of 118.3% to 10.6 million.
The significant growth of the business was underpinned by favourable conditions for financial markets and substantial net inflows into our mutual funds.
Assets under management increased to 11.8 billion on the back of net inflows in excess of 1 billion for the reporting period.
Southern Africa Operating profit growth of 56.0% to 48.8 million R552.2 million.
The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in asset levels and benchmark beating investment performance of the specialist propositions which translated to substantial growth in performance fees.
Performance fees for the financial year grew to 18.8 million R209.9 million, up from 8.0 million R91.4 million in the previous year.
The retail book had net inflows of R3.7 billion.
The institutional book benefited from the take-on of the assets from the Alliance Capital acquisition R9.2 billion but was impacted by client portfolio restructures and rebalances of R4.6 billion and continued structural outflows from the ex-Fedsure book of R5.5 billion.
The increase in expenses is largely due to an increase in variable remuneration in line with the strong growth in profitability and an increase in headcount to drive future growth opportunities of the business.
Assets from Alliance Capital acquisition excluded from flows.

The variance in operating profit can be explained as follows: The South African division posted solid results largely due to: - Favourable equity and property market conditions.
- A 34.4% increase in funds under management from R14.7 billion 1.3 billion to R19.8 billion 1.8 billion.
- Realised gains on the sale of properties.
- Revaluation of investment properties 2006: 6.4 million : 2005: 6.0 million net of funding costs.
This portfolio of investment properties is managed by the Property division in South Africa.
Previously the income in this regard was recorded in the Central Funding division.
On reflection we believe that it is more appropriate and more accurate to reflect this income in the earnings of the Property division the prior year numbers have been restated.
The UK division earned several exit fees in the prior year.
The increase in costs is largely as a result of an increase in variable remuneration given increased profitability and an increase in headcount in the South African division.
Outlook UK and Europe Refer to strategic focus above.
South Africa We expect to be able to continue to capitalise on the buoyant property market, due primarily to our dominant positioning in the listed sector.
We have a good pipeline of development and trading opportunities.

Group Services and Other Activities 74 Central Services Costs We have a policy of allocating costs that are housed in the centre that are in effect performing a function for the divisions of the group.
There are certain costs that are strategic in nature which have not been allocated for pure segmental disclosure amounting to 57.9 million 2005: 40.0 million.
However, a portion thereof 33.2 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Refer to page 30 for further details.
Central services costs have increased from 40.0 million to 57.9 million largely as a result of: An increase in variable remuneration given increased profitability an increase of 9.9 million.
The introduction of a long-term incentive plan in June 2005 for a group of senior employees.
An increase in headcount in the Central Services areas due to a large number of regulatory issues underway.
A shortfall in the recovery of costs in the UK due to the sale of Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite.
An increase in infrastructural costs relating to certain projects underway to improve efficiency which should result in long term cost savings.
Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained.
Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the specific financial and strategic requirements the group faces at the relevant point in time.
The funds raised are applied towards the making of acquisitions, the funding of central services and debt obligations and the purchase of corporate assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

The cost of the preference dividends of approximately 7% is reflected as part of dividends payable.
- The sale of Capital Alliance Holdings Limited CAL to Liberty Group Limited 31 March 2005 and the reinsurance of the group risk business conducted by Investec Employee Benefits to CAL 31 December 2004 generating net cash proceeds of approximately R1.3 billion.
- The 60 million loan to Rensburg arising from the sale of Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite to Rensburg accruing interest at approximately 7.0% from 6 May 2005.
- A subsidiary of Investec plc issued e200 million 132 million preferred securities on 24 June 2005.
The dividends of approximately 7.0% are accounted for as part of dividends payable.
The growth in income from principal transactions reflects the solid performance of the assets within the division's portfolio particularly: - Equity and listed property holdings revaluations and realisations.
- Income of approximately 23 million relating to a portfolio of properties which is in the process of being sold expected to be completed in the first half of the 2007 financial year.
Operating income from associates has declined as a result of the sale of our associate investment in CAL, to Liberty Group Limited effective on 31 March 2005.
Impairment losses on loans and advances decreased largely as a result of a large impairment made in the prior year.

adequacy goals which are closely monitored by strategic capital plans approved by a sub-committee of the board.
Clearly, the adoption of the Basel II framework will have a significant impact on the capital management process, more from a calculation perspective than a principle or philosophical standpoint.
The reason is that the acute sensitivity of transactions to capital use is already embedded in our deal credit approval and performance measurement ethos as detailed above.
However, the basis for quantifying the capital use will become more sophisticated under the revised framework.
Hence, although the underlying process for capital adequacy assessment in relation to risk profile and strategy formulation for capital level maintenance will remain essentially the same, refinement will be needed to quantify capital in terms of the more advanced approaches and evaluate the results against our risk appetite.
In terms of the current process, the following features exist: Internal Audit 102 Internal Audit proactively reviews its practices and resources for Internal Audit adequacy and appropriateness, to meet our increasingly demanding corporate governance and regulatory environment.

for Investec plc and Investec Limited respectively.
An Internal Audit function reporting into Investec plc also exists in Sydney.
The combined functions cover all of the geographies in which we operate.
All the Internal Audit departments use similar risk based methodologies.
The heads of Internal Audit report at each Audit Committee meeting and have a direct reporting line to the chairman of their entity's Audit Committee.
They operate independently of executive management but have ready access to their local Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
For administrative and co-ordination purposes, they also report to the Global Head of Corporate Governance and Compliance.
Annually, Internal Audit conducts a formal risk assessment of all businesses, incorporating management's assessment of risk, which is documented within the Enterprise Risk Assessor Operational Risk system.
A comprehensive risk based annual audit plan is derived from this assessment, which identifies areas of focus.
These are then confirmed with executive management and approved by the responsible Audit Committee.
High risk businesses and processes are audited annually, with other areas covered at regular intervals based on their risk profile.
Given our dependence on IT systems, there is an ongoing focus on auditing technology risks.
In line with international trends, we have an increased focus on fraud risk and review the control environment for conditions which may facilitate the occurrence of fraud.
We also liaise with the external auditors to ensure a complementary approach and to avoid duplication.
The annual plan is reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and responsive, given changes in our operating environment.
The Audit Committee approves any changes to the plan.

Other international business units operate in accordance with the governance recommendations of their jurisdictions, but with clear reference at all times to group values and culture.
While the board is responsible for the overall process and structure of our corporate governance, each business area and every employee worldwide is responsible for adherence to good corporate governance practices.
In formulating our governance framework, the board is committed to applying leading governance practices in a pragmatic way, so as to: Promote informed and sound decision making.
Support the trust and confidence of stakeholders.
Lead to effectiveness and efficiency.
Enhance the capital market's perception of us.
Our values and philosophies form the framework against which we measure behaviour, practices and activities to assess the characteristics of good governance.
Our values require directors and employees to conduct themselves with integrity, consistently and uncompromisingly displaying moral strength and behaviour which promotes trust.
Sound corporate governance is implicit in our values, culture, processes, functions and organisational structure and the structures designed to formalise oversight of and to ensure that the values remain embedded in all businesses and processes.
We continue to refine both these structures, and a written Statement of Values, which serves as our Code of Ethics has always been a pillar of our culture.

Driven by the identified need, among other things, for distinctive leader development, this strategic imperative embraced a number of different dimensions, across the varying geographies, and resulted in the launch of a number of partnered, highly customised, leadership programmes throughout the organisation.
