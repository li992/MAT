DIRECTORS REPORT 27 Business Review WE AIM TO MAINTAIN OUR POSITION AS A WORLD LEADER did, however, confirm a number of important clinical benefits for Iressa, including tumour IN CANCER TREATMENT THROUGH CONTINUED GROWTH OF shrinkage and a significant improvement in ARIMIDEX, FURTHER LAUNCHES AND LINE EXTENSIONS OF the time to treatment failure.
Pre-planned subgroup analyses showed a statistically NEWER PRODUCTS SUCH AS FASLODEX, AND THE SUCCESSFUL significant increase in survival with Iressa INTRODUCTION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES in patients of Asian ethnicity and in patients who had never smoked.
CURRENTLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE.
Following the announcement of the ISEL data, PRODUCTS study were presented.
This study compared in 2005 we voluntarily withdrew the European Arimidex continues to grow strongly on the Faslodex with exemestane in patients who had submission for Iressa and regulatory authorities basis of the ATAC five-year treatment data.
received prior aromatase inhibitor therapy the in the US and Canada restricted the use of In several key markets, it has already replaced first Phase III trial in this patient population.
The Iressa to those patients already benefiting tamoxifen as the preferred primary adjuvant study showed Faslodex to have similar efficacy from the drug.
In the Asia Pacific region, due treatment for post-menopausal women with to exemestane.
Trials are ongoing to further to the ethnic differences in lung cancer, Iressa hormone-receptor positive invasive early understand the full utility of Faslodex in the has become an established therapy for prebreast cancer.
In 2006, Arimidex exceeded treatment of post-menopausal breast cancer.
treated advanced NSCLC, and use of the two million patient years of clinical experience drug in the first-line advanced setting is now and is now the leading hormonal therapy in Casodex continued growth has been driven being studied in a large, Phase III, pan-Asian the US, Japan and France.
In June, Arimidex by: the use of Casodex 50mg in advanced trial known as the IPASS study, which was approved in Europe for a new switch prostate cancer: the growth of Casodex involves 1,212 patients.
indication for patients who have already 150mg, which is approved for use in locally received two to three years of tamoxifen.
This advanced prostate cancer in over 60 countries: Progress continues to be made in identifying was based on results from three collaborative and the growth of Casodex 80mg, which is which patients, in which treatment settings, group trials: ABCSG-8, ARNO and ITA, which only available in Japan, where it is approved are most likely to benefit from treatment showed the benefits of switching to Arimidex for all stages of prostate cancer.

countries, breast cancer and gynaecological comparing Iressa with docetaxel in NSCLC disorders.
In non-metastatic prostate cancer, has now reported.
There was no statistically Data presented at the European Society of Zoladex is the only  difference in overall survival between Medical Oncology meeting in September releasing hormone LHRH agonist shown the two treatments but the study, which was showed that the combination of Arimidex with to improve overall survival both when used in set up to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority, Herceptin trastuzumab was synergistic and addition to radical prostatectomy and when did not meet the primary objective, as the effective in patients with advanced postused in addition to radiotherapy.
In breast confidence interval did not lie entirely below menopausal breast cancer who were both cancer, Zoladex is widely approved for use in the pre-defined non-inferiority limit.
However, hormone-receptor positive and Her2 Neu advanced breast cancer in pre-menopausal we believe these data have not altered the positive.
These patients are considered to be at women.
In a number of these countries, benefit risk profile of Iressa in pre-treated higher risk of the cancer spreading.
When the Zoladex is also approved for the adjuvant Japanese NSCLC patients.
two drugs were combined, this was proved treatment of early stage pre-menopausal more effective than Arimidex alone.
These data breast cancer as an alternative to and or in Further Phase II trials are ongoing to evaluate do not yet form part of the current licence.
Zoladex offers the potential benefits of Iressa in NSCLC and Arimidex is also approved for the treatment of proven survival benefits for breast cancer other EGF receptor-driven tumours.

Iressa is indicated for the treatment of agreement with Abraxis BioScience, Inc. advanced non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC Abraxis to co-promote Abraxiss product Faslodex offers an additional hormonal in patients who have failed chemotherapy.
Abraxane paclitaxel therapy for patients with hormone-sensitive It is approved in 35 countries.
Clinical trials protein-bound particles for injectable advanced breast cancer, delaying the need have shown that Iressa is an effective and suspension albumin-bound is a novel, for cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Due to its novel generally well-tolerated treatment for some albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel, mode of action, Faslodex offers an effective, patients with advanced NSCLC.
Those which was approved by the US Food and well-tolerated additional treatment with the patients who benefit tend to do so quickly, Drug Administration FDA in January 2005. compliance and convenience benefits of and sometimes results are dramatic.
Abraxane is indicated for the treatment of a once-monthly injection.
Faslodex is now breast cancer after failure of combination launched in more than 30 markets.
It is In 2004, results from the ISEL study, which chemotherapy for metastatic disease or indicated for the second-line treatment of compared Iressa with placebo in advanced relapse within six months of adjuvant hormone-receptor positive advanced breast NSCLC patients who had failed prior chemotherapy.
This agreement gives us cancer in post-menopausal women.
