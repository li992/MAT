Diageo plc is incorporated as a public limited company in England and Wales.
Diageo plcs principal executive office is located at 8 Henrietta Place, London W1G 0NB and its telephone number is 44 0 20 7927 5200.
Diageo is a major participant in the branded beverage alcohol industry and operates on an international scale.
It brings together worldclass brands and a management team committed to the maximisation of shareholder value.
The management team expects to invest in global brands, expand internationally and launch innovative new products and brands.
Diageo produces and distributes a leading collection of branded premium spirits, beer and wine.
It produces and distributes a wide range of premium brands, including Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker Scotch whiskies, Guinness stout, Baileys Original Irish Cream liqueur, Captain Morgan rum, J&B Scotch whisky and Tanqueray gin.

Strategy Diageo is the worlds leading premium drinks business and operates on an international scale.
It is one of a small number of premium drinks companies that operate across beer, wine and spirits.
Diageo is the leading premium spirits business in the world by volume, by net sales and by operating profit and manages nine of the worlds top 20 spirits brands as defined by Impact database.
Diageos beer brands include the only global stout brand, Guinness, and together these beer brands account for approximately 20% of net sales while Diageos wine brands represent approximately 5% of Diageos net sales.
Diageos size provides for scale efficiencies in production, selling and marketing.
This enables cost efficiencies and the dissemination of best practices in business operations across markets and brands allowing Diageo to serve its customers and consumers better.
Diageos business has a high return on invested capital and low capital intensity and therefore generates high levels of free cash flow.
All of the above factors enable Diageo to attract and retain talented individuals with the capabilities to contribute to the delivery of Diageos strategy, which is to focus on premium drinks to grow its business through organic sales and operating profit growth and the acquisition of premium drinks brands that add value for shareholders.
Diageos brands have broad consumer appeal across geographies and the company and its employees are proud of the responsible manner in which the brands are marketed and the role that moderate consumption of these brands plays in the lives of many people.
Diageo recognises, however, that excessive or irresponsible patterns of alcohol consumption may cause health or social problems for the individual or society as a whole.
Diageo seeks to be at the forefront of industry efforts to promote responsible drinking and combat misuse and works with other stakeholders to combat alcohol misuse.
Diageos approach is based on two principles: set world-class standards for responsible marketing and innovation: and promote a shared understanding of what responsible drinking means in order to reduce alcohol-related harm.
Market participation Diageo targets its geographical priorities in terms of the major regional economies in which it operates.
These markets are managed in three regions: North America, Europe and International.
International markets comprise Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and India, China and other Asian markets, Australia and New Zealand, and the Global Duty Free business.
North America accounts for the largest proportion of Diageos operating profit.
Product offering Diageo manages its brands in terms of global priority brands, local priority brands and category brands.
Acting as the main focus for the business, global priority brands are Diageos primary growth drivers across markets.
Local priority brands have marketleading positions in the markets in which they are distributed.
They drive growth on a significant scale but with a narrower geographic reach than the global priority brands.
Category brands comprise the smaller scale brands in Diageos collection.
Business effectiveness Over the long term, Diageos strategy will be continually focused on driving growth and increasing shareholder value.
Diageo has completed a number of acquisitions and disposals consistent with its strategy of focusing on its premium drinks business.
Between the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group in December 1997 and 30 June 2006, the group has received approximately 10.5 billion from disposals including 4.3 billion from the sale of Pillsbury, 1.9 billion from the sale of General Mills shares and 0.7 billion from the sale of Burger King and spent approximately 4.9 billion on acquisitions including 3.7 billion in relation to certain Seagram businesses.
Continuing operations Premium drinks Diageo is engaged in a broad range of activities within the beverage alcohol industry.
Its operations include producing, distilling, brewing, bottling, packaging, distributing, developing and marketing a range of brands in approximately 180 markets around the world.
Diageo markets a wide range of recognised beverage alcohol brands including a number of the worlds leading spirits and beer brands.
The brand ranking information below, when comparing volume information with competitors, has been sourced from data published during 2006 by Impact.
Market data information is taken from industry sources in the markets in which Diageo operates.
Seventeen of the groups owned brands were among the top 100 premium distilled spirits brands worldwide, as ranked by Impact, in calendar year 2005.
References to ready to drink products below include flavored malt beverages.
Ready to drink products are sold throughout the world, but flavored malt beverages are currently only sold in the United States and certain markets supplied by the United States.
References to Smirnoff ready to drink include Smirnoff Ice, Smirnoff Black Ice, Smirnoff Twisted V, Smirnoff Mule, Smirnoff Spin, Smirnoff Caipiroska, Smirnoff Signatures, Smirnoff Raw Teas, Smirnoff Storm and Smirnoff Caesar Classic.

An equivalent unit represents one nine litre case of spirits, which is approximately 272 servings.
A serving comprises 33ml of spirits, 165ml of wine, or 330ml of ready to drink or beer.
Therefore, to convert volume of products other than spirits to equivalent units, the following guide has been used: beer in hectolitres divide by 0.9, wine in nine litre cases divide by five and ready to drink in nine litre cases divide by 10, with certain pre-mixed products that are classified as ready to drink divided by five.
The collection of premium drinks comprises brands owned by the company as a principal, and brands the company holds under agency agreements.
The collection includes: Global priority brands Smirnoff vodka and Smirnoff ready to drink products Johnnie Walker Scotch whiskies Guinness stout Baileys Original Irish Cream liqueur Captain Morgan rum J&B Scotch whisky Jos Cuervo tequila agency brand in North America and many other markets Tanqueray gin Other spirits brands include: Wine brands include: Other beer brands include: Crown Royal Canadian whisky Beaulieu Vineyard wine Harp Irish lager Buchanans fide Luxe whisky Sterling Vineyards wine Smithwicks ale Gordons gin and vodka Chalone Vineyards wine Malta non-alcoholic malt Windsor Premier whisky Blossom Hill wine Red Stripe lager Bells Extra Special whisky Piat dOr wine Dimple Pinch whisky Seagrams 7 Crown American whiskey Old Parr whisky Seagrams VO Canadian whisky Bundaberg rum Ursus vodka Bushmills Irish whiskey Diageos agency agreements vary depending on the particular brand, but tend to be for a fixed number of years.

Global priority brands Diageo has eight global priority brands that it markets worldwide.

The Canada business unit distributes the groups spirits, wine and beer portfolio across all Canadian territories.
Within the United States, there are generally two types of regulatory environments: open states and control states.
In open states, spirits companies are allowed to sell spirits, wine and beer directly to independent distributors.
In the open states, Diageo trades through a three tier distribution system, where the product is initially sold to distributors, who then sell it to on and off premise retailers.
In most control states, Diageo markets its spirits products to state liquor control boards through the bailment warehousing system, and from there to state or agency liquor stores.
There are variations for example, certain states control distribution but not retail sales.
Generally, wines are treated in the same way as spirits, although most states that are control states for spirits are open states for wines.
Beer distribution follows open states regulation across the entire United States.
In Canada, beer and spirits distribution laws are generally consistent and similar to those of control states in the United States.
Diageo, however, has some licences to direct-deliver keg beer to licensed accounts, which account for approximately 33% of Diageos beer business in Canada.
Diageo has pursued a distribution strategy focused on consolidating the distribution of Diageos US spirits and wine brands into a single distributor in each state wherever possible.
The strategy is designed to provide a consolidated distribution network limiting duplication of activities between Diageo and the distributor, increasing Diageo and distributor selling capabilities and employing a number of alternative approaches to optimise product distribution.
Through this strategy, Diageo has consolidated its business in 39 states plus Washington DC, representing over 80% of Diageos US spirits and wine volume.
Across the United States, Diageos distributors and brokers have over 2,100 dedicated sales people focused on selling Diageos spirits and wine brands.
In the future, Diageo will focus on helping to build the capabilities and selling tools of the distributors dedicated sales forces and creating a more efficient and effective value chain.
The remaining states are franchise states that will be consolidated as opportunities arise.

16 | Diageo Annual Report 2006 Research and development The overall nature of the groups business does not demand substantial expenditure on research and development.
However, the group has ongoing programmes for developing new drinks products.
In the year ended 30 June 2006, the groups research and development expenditure amounted to 18 million 2005 16 million.
Research and development expenditure is generally written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Trademarks Diageo produces and distributes branded goods and is therefore substantially dependent on the maintenance and protection of its trademarks.
All brand names mentioned in this document are trademarks.
The group also holds numerous licences and trade secrets, as well as having substantial trade knowledge related to its products.
The group believes that its significant trademarks are registered and or otherwise protected insofar as legal protections are available in all material respects in its most important markets.
Regulations and taxes Diageos worldwide operations are subject to extensive regulatory requirements regarding production, product liability, distribution, importation, marketing, promotion, labelling, advertising, labour, pensions and environmental issues.
In the United States, the beverage alcohol industry is subject to strict federal and state government regulations covering virtually every aspect of its operations, including production, marketing, promotion, sales, distribution, pricing, labelling, packaging and advertising.
Spirits, wine and beer are subject to national import and excise duties in many markets around the world.
Most countries impose excise duties on beverage alcohol products, although the form of such taxation varies significantly from a simple application to units of alcohol by volume, to advanced systems based on imported or wholesale value of the product.
Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories such as Scotch whisky or bourbon in the rate of such tariffs.
Within the European Union, such products are subject to different rates of excise duty in each country, but within an overall European Union framework, there are minimum rates of excise duties that can be applied.
Import and excise duties can have a significant impact on the final pricing of Diageos products to consumers.
These duties have an impact on the competitive position versus other brands.
The group devotes resources to encouraging the equitable taxation treatment of all beverage alcohol categories and to reducing government-imposed barriers to fair trading.
Advertising, marketing and sales of alcohol are subject to various restrictions in markets around the world.
These range from a complete prohibition of alcohol in certain countries and cultures, through the prohibition of the import of spirits, wine and beer, to restrictions on the advertising style, media and messages used.
In a number of countries, television is a prohibited medium for spirits brands and in other countries, television advertising, while permitted, is carefully regulated.
Spirits, wine and beer are also regulated in distribution.
In many countries, alcohol may only be sold through licensed outlets, both on and off premise, varying from government or state operated monopoly outlets for example, Canada, Norway, and certain US states to the common system of licensed on premise outlets for example, licensed bars and restaurants which prevails in much of the western world for example, most US states and the European Union.
In about one-third of the states in the United States, price changes must be filed or published 30 days to three months, depending on the state, before they become effective.
Labelling of beverage alcohol products is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information.
Specific warning statements related to the risks of drinking beverage alcohol products are required to be included on all beverage alcohol products sold in the United States.
Following the end of the voluntary restrictions on television advertising of spirits in the United States, Diageo and other spirits companies have been advertising products on the air on local cable television stations.
Expressions of political concern signify the uncertain future of beverage alcohol products advertising on network television in the United States.
Further requirements for warning statements and any prohibitions on advertising and marketing could have an adverse impact on sales of the group.
Regulatory decisions and changes in the legal and regulatory environment could increase Diageos costs and liabilities or impact its business activities.
Business services Diageo has committed to re-engineer its key business activities with customers, consumers, suppliers and the processes that summarise and report financial performance.
In that regard, global processes have been designed, built and implemented across a number of markets and global supply.
A business service centre in Budapest, Hungary performs various process tasks for Australia, Austria, Benelux, Brazil, Canada, the Canaries, Eurobeer, Germany, Global Duty Free, Great Britain, Guinness supply, Ireland, Mexico, the Nordics, North America, Northern European Logistics and Switzerland.
Certain central finance activities including group financial control and treasury activities are in the process of being transferred to Budapest over the next 12 months.
Additional markets and supply entities are scheduled to transfer to Budapest during the next few years.
The costs of the business service centre and other corporate costs which cannot be directly allocated to the geographical operating units are reported separately as Corporate costs in the geographical analysis of business performance.
Also included in Corporate are the revenues and costs related to rents receivable in respect of properties not used by Diageo in the manufacture, sale or distribution of premium drink products and the results of Gleneagles Hotel.
It also owns shares in a number of other associates.
In the year ended 30 June 2006, the share of profits of associates after tax was 131 million 2005 121 million, of which Mot Hennessy accounted for 122 million 2005 113 million.
Diageo owns 34% of Mot Hennessy, the principal spirits and wine business of LVMH Mot Hennessy-Louis Vuitton SA LVMH.
LVMH is based in France and is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Mot Hennessy is also based in France and is a producer and exporter of a number of brands in its main business areas of champagne and cognac.
Its principal products include champagne brands, Mot & Chandon including Dom Prignon, Veuve Clicquot and Mercier, all of which are included in the top 10 champagne brands worldwide by volume, Hennessy, which is the top cognac brand worldwide by volume, and Glenmorangie, a malt whisky.
Since 1987, a number of joint distribution arrangements have been established with LVMH, principally covering distribution of Diageos premium brands of Scotch whisky and gin and Mot Hennessys premium champagne and cognac brands in the Asia Pacific region and France.
Diageo and LVMH have each undertaken not to engage in any champagne or cognac activities competing with those of Mot Hennessy.
The arrangements also contain certain provisions for the protection of Diageo as a minority shareholder in Mot Hennessy.
The operations of Mot Hennessy in France are conducted through a partnership in which Diageo has a 34% interest and, as a partner, Diageo pays any tax due on its share of the results of the partnership to the tax authorities.
Acquisitions and disposals Diageo has made a number of acquisitions and disposals of brands, distribution rights and equity interests in premium drinks businesses including the following: In February 2005, Diageo acquired The Chalone Wine Group for $285 million 153 million.
The Chalone Wine Group is a North America based wine business with a range of premium brand wines and has been merged into Diageos North American wine business, Diageo Chateau & Estate Wines.
In February 2005, Diageo acquired Ursus Vodka Holding BV, the owner of the Ursus vodka and Ursus Roter brands.
The principal market, by volume, for the Ursus vodka and Ursus Roter brands is Greece.
Diageos total cash investment was a146 million 99 million.
On 25 August 2005, Diageo completed the purchase of The Old Bushmills Distillery Company Limited, owner of Bushmills Irish whiskey, one of the worlds leading Irish whiskey brands, from Pernod Ricard SA for approximately a296 million 209 million.
Disposed businesses General Mills Diageo acquired an investment in the shares of General Mills on the disposal of Pillsbury to General Mills in October 2001.
On 4 October 2004, Diageo sold 50 million shares of common stock in General Mills and transferred a further 4 million shares to the Diageo UK pension fund and Diageo ceased to be an affiliate of General Mills for US federal securities laws purposes at that time.
In November 2005, Diageo sold its remaining 25 million shares of common stock of General Mills.
During the year ended 30 June 2006, the group recorded dividends receivable of 5 million from General Mills 2005 17 million.
18 | Diageo Annual Report 2006 Risk factors Diageo faces competition that may reduce its market share and margins Diageo faces substantial competition from several international companies as well as local and regional companies in the countries in which it operates.
Diageo competes with drinks companies across a wide range of consumer drinking occasions.
Within a number of categories, consolidation or realignment is taking place.
Consolidation is also taking place amongst Diageos customers in many countries.
Increased competition and unanticipated actions by competitors or customers could lead to downward pressure on prices and or a decline in Diageos market share in any of these categories, which would adversely affect Diageos results and hinder its growth potential.
Diageo may not be able to derive the expected benefits from its strategy to focus on premium drinks or its systems change and cost-saving programmes designed to enhance earnings Diageos strategy is to focus on premium drinks to grow its business through organic sales and operating profit growth and the acquisition of premium drinks brands that add value for shareholders.
There can be no assurance that Diageos strategic focus on premium drinks will result in better opportunities for growth and improved margins.
It is possible that the pursuit of this strategic focus on premium drinks could give rise to further acquisitions including associated financing, disposals, joint ventures or partnerships.
There can be no guarantee that any such acquisition, disposal, joint venture or partnership would deliver the benefits intended.
Similarly, there can be no assurance that the systems change and cost-savings programmes implemented by Diageo in order to improve efficiencies and deliver cost-savings will deliver the expected benefits.
Systems change programmes may not deliver the benefits intended and systems failures could lead to business disruption Certain change programmes designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of end-to-end operating, administrative and financial systems and processes continue to be undertaken.
This includes moving transaction processing from a number of markets to business service centres.
There can be no certainty that these programmes will deliver the expected operational benefits.
There is likely to be disruption caused to production processes and possibly to administrative and financial systems as further changes to such processes are effected.
They could also lead to adverse customer or consumer reaction.
Any failure of information systems could adversely impact on Diageos ability to operate.
As with all large systems, Diageos information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes.
Such unauthorised access could disrupt Diageos business and or lead to loss of assets.
The concentration of processes in business service centres also means that any disruption arising from system failure or physical plant issues could impact on a large portion of Diageos global business.
Regulatory decisions and changes in the legal and regulatory environment could increase Diageos costs and liabilities or limit its business activities Diageos operations are subject to extensive regulatory requirements regarding production, product liability, distribution, importation, marketing, promotion, labelling, advertising, labour, pensions and environmental issues.
Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy could cause Diageo to incur material additional costs or liabilities that could adversely affect its business.
In particular, governmental bodies in countries where Diageo operates may impose new labelling, product or production requirements, limitations on the advertising and or promotion activities used to market beverage alcohol, restrictions on retail outlets or other restrictions on marketing, promotion and distribution.
Regulatory authorities under whose laws Diageo operates may also have enforcement power that can subject the group to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on its sales or damage its reputation.
In addition, beverage alcohol products are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world.
An increase in import or excise duties could have a significant adverse effect on Diageos sales revenue or margin, both through reducing overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.
Companies in the beverage alcohol industry are, from time to time, exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising, alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.
If such litigation resulted in fines, damages or reputational damage to Diageo or its brands, Diageos business could be materially adversely affected.
A number of similar putative class actions are pending in state and federal courts in the United States against Diageo plc, Diageo North America Inc and other Diageo entities, along with a large group of other beverage alcohol manufacturers, brewers and importers.
All have been brought by the same national counsel.
In each action, the plaintiffs seek to pursue their claims on behalf of parents and guardians of people under the legal drinking age who illegally bought alcohol beverages during the period from 1982 to the present.
Plaintiffs allege several causes of action, principally for negligence, unjust enrichment and violation of state consumer fraud statutes.
Some complaints include additional claims based on conspiracy, nuisance and on other legal theories.
Diageos reported after tax income is calculated based on extensive tax and accounting requirements in each of its relevant jurisdictions of operation.
Changes in tax law including tax rates, accounting policies and accounting standards could materially reduce Diageos reported after tax income.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 19 Business description continued Demand for Diageos products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes Diageos collection of brands includes some of the worlds leading beverage alcohol brands as well as brands of local prominence.
Maintaining Diageos competitive position depends on its continued ability to offer products that have a strong appeal to consumers.
Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic and social trends, public health regulations, changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns, weather effects and a downturn in economic conditions, which may reduce consumers willingness to purchase premium branded products.
In addition, concerns about health effects due to negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption, negative dietary effects, regulatory action or any litigation or customer complaints against companies in the industry may have an adverse effect on Diageos profitability.
The competitive position of Diageos brands could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or service levels to customers.
In addition, both the launch and ongoing success of new products is inherently uncertain especially as to their appeal to consumers.
The failure to launch a new product successfully can give rise to inventory write offs and other costs and can affect consumer perception of an existing brand.
Growth in Diageos business has been based on both the launch of new products and the growth of existing products.
Product innovation remains a significant aspect of Diageos plans for growth.
There can be no assurance as to Diageos continuing ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products or as to the profitable lifespan of newly or recently developed products.
Any significant changes in consumer preferences and failure to anticipate and react to such changes could result in reduced demand for Diageos products and erosion of its competitive and financial position.
If the social acceptability of Diageos products declines, Diageos sales volume could decrease and the business could be materially adversely affected In recent years, there has been increased social and political attention directed to the beverage alcohol industry.
Diageo believes that this attention is the result of public concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including drink driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.
If, as a result, the general social acceptability of beverage alcohol were to decline significantly, sales of Diageos products could materially decrease.
Diageos operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs or shortages of raw materials or labour or disruption to production facilities or business service centres The raw materials which Diageo uses for the production of its beverage products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions, agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls.
If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in the cost of raw materials, glass bottles and other packaging materials or the transportation of such materials and Diageos beverage products, Diageo may not be able to increase its prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue and operating income.
Diageo may be adversely affected by shortages of raw materials or packaging materials.
Energy costs have increased recently, and energy costs could continue to rise, resulting in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.
Diageos operating results could be adversely affected by labour or skill shortages or increased labour costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.
Diageos success is dependent on the capability of its employees.
There is no guarantee that Diageo will continue to be able to recruit, retain and develop the capabilities that it requires to deliver its strategy, for example in relation to sales, marketing and innovation capability within markets or in its senior management.
The loss of senior management or other key personnel or the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could make it difficult to manage the business and could adversely affect operations and financial results.
Diageo would be affected if there were a catastrophic failure of its major production facilities or business service centres.
See Business description Continuing operations Premium drinks Production for details of Diageos principal production areas.
In addition, the maintenance and development of information systems may result in systems failures which may adversely affect business operations.
Diageo has a substantial inventory of aged product categories, principally Scotch whisky and Canadian whisky, which mature over periods of up to 30 years.
As at 30 June 2006, the historical cost of Diageos maturing inventory amounted to 1,644 million.
The maturing inventory is stored primarily in Scotland, and the loss through contamination, fire or other natural disaster of all or a portion of the inventory of any one of those aged product categories could result in a significant reduction in supply of those products, and consequently, Diageo would not be able to meet consumer demand for these products as it arises.
There can be no assurance that insurance proceeds would cover the replacement value of Diageos maturing inventory or other assets, were such assets to be lost due to contamination, fire or natural disasters or destruction resulting from negligence or the acts of third parties.
In addition, there is an inherent risk of forecasting error in determining the quantity of maturing inventory lay down in a given year for future consumption.
This could lead to an inability to supply future demand or lead to a future surplus of inventory and consequent write down in value of maturing inventories.
20 | Diageo Annual Report 2006 Diageos business may be adversely impacted by unfavourable economic conditions or political or other developments and risks in the countries in which it operates Diageos business is dependent on general economic conditions in the United States, Great Britain and other important markets.
A significant deterioration in these conditions, including a reduction in consumer spending levels, could have a material adverse effect on Diageos business and results of operations.
In addition, Diageo may be adversely affected by political and economic developments in any of the countries where Diageo has distribution networks, production facilities or marketing companies.
Diageos operations are also subject to a variety of other risks and uncertainties related to trading in numerous foreign countries, including political or economic upheaval and the imposition of any import, investment or currency restrictions, including tariffs and import quotas or any restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and capital.
Current examples of such potential upheaval are the unrest in the Middle East, and the impact on tourism and travel of terrorist threats.
These disruptions can affect Diageos ability to import or export products and to repatriate funds, as well as affecting the levels of consumer demand for example in duty free outlets at airports or in on trade premises in affected regions and therefore Diageos levels of sales or profitability.
Part of Diageos growth strategy includes expanding its business in certain countries where consumer spending in general, and spending on Diageos products in particular, has not historically been as great but where there are prospects for growth.
There is no guarantee that this strategy will be successful and some of the markets represent a higher risk in terms of their changing regulatory environments and higher degree of uncertainty over levels of consumer spending.
Diageo may also be adversely affected by movements in the value of, and returns from, the investments held by its pension funds.
Diageo may be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
The results of operations of Diageo are accounted for in pounds sterling.
Approximately 32% of sales in the year ended 30 June 2006 were in US dollars, approximately 23% were in sterling and approximately 20% were in euros.
Movements in exchange rates used to translate foreign currencies into pounds sterling may have a significant impact on Diageos reported results of operations from year to year.
Diageo may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates, mainly through an increased interest expense.
To partly delay any adverse impact from interest rate movements, the profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings is maintained according to a duration measure that is equivalent to an approximate 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
See Operating and financial review Risk management.
Diageos operations may be adversely affected by failure to renegotiate distribution and manufacturing agreements on favourable terms Diageos business has a number of distribution agreements for brands owned by it or by other companies.
These agreements vary depending on the particular brand, but tend to be for a fixed number of years.
There can be no assurance that Diageo will be able to renegotiate distribution rights on favourable terms when they expire or that agreements will not be terminated.
Failure to renew distribution agreements on favourable terms could have an adverse impact on Diageos revenues and operating income.
In addition, Diageos sales may be adversely affected by any disputes with distributors of its products.
Diageo may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights Given the importance of brand recognition to its business, Diageo has invested considerable effort in protecting its intellectual property rights, including trademark registration and domain names.
Diageos patents cover some of its process technology, including some aspects of its bottle marking technology.
Diageo also uses security measures and agreements to protect its confidential information.
However, Diageo cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe on or misappropriate its intellectual property rights.
Moreover, some of the countries in which Diageo operates offer less intellectual property protection than Europe or North America.
Given the attractiveness of Diageos brands to consumers, it is not uncommon for counterfeit products to be manufactured.
Diageo cannot be certain that the steps it takes to prevent, detect and eliminate counterfeit products will be effective in preventing material loss of profits or erosion of brand equity resulting from lower quality or even dangerous counterfeit product reaching the market.
If Diageo is unable to protect its intellectual property rights against infringement or misappropriation, this could materially harm its future financial results and ability to develop its business.
It may be difficult to effect service of US process and enforce US legal process against the directors of Diageo Diageo is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
The majority of Diageos directors and officers, and some of the experts named in this document, reside outside of the United States, principally in the United Kingdom.
A substantial portion of Diageos assets, and the assets of such persons, are located outside of the United States.
Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States upon Diageo or these persons in order to enforce judgements of US courts against Diageo or these persons based on the civil liability provisions of the US federal securities laws.
There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgements of US courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the US federal securities laws.
IFRS may introduce greater volatility into Diageos financial statements These are the groups first consolidated annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
For all periods up to and including 30 June 2005, Diageo prepared its primary financial statements in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
It is likely that reporting under IFRS will introduce a greater degree of volatility in Diageos reported results.
This may include, but is not limited to, the potential adverse impact of accounting for changes in taxation rates and their impact on deferred tax balances, and accounting for financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
There is no assurance that further volatility in Diageos financial statements due to IFRS will not have a significant adverse effect on financial results.
