Investment Managers Review Investment Portfolio Analysis Electra is currently receiving attractive investment opportunities despite conditions in the private equity market which remain very competitive.
Furthermore, the ability to adopt a flexible approach enables Electra to maximise the benefits from these investment opportunities.
Electra is therefore in a good position to add new investments with potential to a portfolio which is already well positioned for further growth.
Investment Portfolio Review Investments Electra invested 131 million in the year and at 30 September 2006, had Electra invested 131 million in outstanding commitments to invest of 133 million.
Investments and commitments the year and at 30 September 2006, taken together represented a marked step up in investment activity and compared had outstanding commitments to to investments and commitments of 82 million and 70 million made in the invest of 133 million.
Since 2001 Electras investment strategy has restricted the funds available for investment.
Such restrictions have gradually decreased as the pre-2001 portfolio has been realised, with the result that the investment rate has increased in each of the last three years.
Following approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 October 2006, all restrictions on new investment have been removed.
The investments made by Electra in the year of 131 million were made up of 104 million in direct investments and 27 million in private equity funds.
Direct investments included 18 million in the refinancing of Capital Safety Group II and 23 million in the secondary buyout of Amtico.
While these investments had previously been held by Electra, the refinancing and restructuring provided excellent opportunities to reinvest in a cost effective manner while continuing to benefit from the growth of these companies.

102 million, 162% higher than the carrying value at 30 September 2005 which demonstrates the value that can be achieved in the current marketplace in a well controlled and competitive auction.
The proceeds of 102 million compare to a book value of the investment at 30 September 2005 of 38.7 million.
The original cost of the investment in 1999 was 17 million and the subsequent further investment of 10 million was repaid by Inchcape Shipping Services prior to the final sale.
The refinancing and restructuring of Capital Safety Group I resulted in proceeds to Electra of 59 million, which included interest payments of 15.5 million, accounted for through the revenue account.
As well as the proceeds, Electra acquired a significant stake in the restructured company.
In August, Electra sold its investment in Amtico to another financial investor resulting in proceeds to Electra of 36.8 million.
The rate of return to Electra over the eleven years in which the investment was held was just over 14% per annum and the proceeds, together with previous loan repayments, provided a multiple of 3.5 times the original investment.
The other significant sale was that of Tensar, where total proceeds amounted to 17 million.
This investment had previously been provided against in full, in view of the companys potential exposure to a legal action.

Over the year, changes in value to the portfolio gave rise to a net capital increase of 153 million, a percentage appreciation of 43.4%.
Of these gains, 124 million represented realised profits on the sale of investments and a further 10 million resulted from share price movements of restricted listed securities held at the end of the financial year.
The remaining 19 million represented the net increase in unrealised appreciation in respect of unlisted investments held at the end of the year.
Total increases in unrealised appreciation amounted to 25 million offset by valuation decreases of 6 million.

Increases in unrealised appreciation were made in respect of ten investments, the largest relating to Electras investments in Capital Safety Group II, Greenpark and Baxi.
Increases of 5.8 million in Capital Safety Group II and 4.3 million in Baxi were made to reflect strong operating performance.

Valuation reductions were made in the case of four investments for a total of 6 million of which 4.9 million related to Prize Foods which was fully provided against after a disappointing trading performance.
