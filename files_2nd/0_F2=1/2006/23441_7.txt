22 Electra Private Equity PLC Accounts Report of the Directors To the Members of Electra Private Equity PLC The Directors present the audited Accounts of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2006 and their Report on its affairs.
Investment Trust Status The Company carries on business as an investment trust.
HM Revenue and Customs has approved the Company as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for the accounting period to 30 September 2005.
The Directors are of the opinion that, since that date, the Company has conducted its affairs in a manner which will satisfy the conditions for continued approval as an investment trust under that section.
Business Review Objective and investment strategy In 2004 the Board reviewed the Companys investment strategy and confirmed that it should remain unchanged from that approved by shareholders in 2001.
Under this strategy, up to one-third of realisation proceeds in respect of investments made prior to June 2001 were available for new investment together with all realisation proceeds for investments made subsequently.
Following the approval by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 12 October 2006, a new investment strategy has been adopted whereby the Company returns to full investment of its capital resources in private equity, complemented by on-going share buybacks and the active management of its capital position.
Following implementation of this new investment strategy, Electra will target a return on equity of between 10 and 15 per cent per annum over the long-term.
Investment policy Consistent with its previous investment policy, the Company intends to target private equity opportunities including direct investment, fund investment and secondary buyouts of portfolios and funds so that the risks associated with such investments are justified by expected returns.
Such investment will be made across a broad range of sector and types of financial instrument.
The Company will continue to focus principally on Western Europe, with the majority of investments expected to be made in the United Kingdom, which continues to be the largest private equity market in Western Europe and where historically the Company has made the majority of its investments.
The Company will also continue to invest across all industry sectors, but would expect there to be an emphasis on areas where the senior management team of Electra Partners has specific knowledge and expertise.
In circumstances where Electra Partners believe that there is merit in gaining exposure to countries and sectors outside Electra Partners network and expertise, the Company will also consider investing in specific funds managed by a third party with such expertise or co-investing with private equity managers with whom the senior management team of Electra Partners has developed a long-standing relationship.
Electra will also continue to invest in a range of financial instruments such as equity, senior equity, convertibles and mezzanine debt.
Current and future development A review of the main features of the year is contained in the Chairmans Statement and the Investment Managers Review on pages 3 to 5 and 12 to 15 respectively.
The Board regularly reviews the development and strategic direction of the Company, a process which culminated in the approval by the Companys shareholders of the new investment strategy at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 12 October 2006.
The Boards main focus continues to be on the Companys long-term investment return.
Attention is paid to the integrity and success of the investment process and to factors which may have an impact on this.
Due regard is given to the promotion of the Company, including effective communication with shareholders and other external parties.

Risk Management As the Company is focused on private equity and therefore on unquoted companies, the Directors aim to limit the risk attaching to the portfolio as a whole by careful selection and distribution of investments, and by monitoring the spread of holdings in terms of maturity and industry sector.
The Board reviews the investment portfolio with the Manager on a regular basis.
The Risks facing the Company include Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Liquidity Risk and Foreign Currency Risk as further detailed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Accounts.

As detailed in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 30 to 33, the Board reviews the activities of Electra Partners on an ongoing basis and believes the continuing appointment of Electra Partners on the terms agreed is in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
Electra Partners is responsible for the investment management of a number of limited partnership funds to which the Company has subscribed.
The Directors of the Company retain control over its investment policy.
Electra Partners manages the Companys investments in accordance with guidelines determined by Directors and as specified in limited partnership and in management and investment guideline agreements.
The majority of the investments are made by the Company as a limited partner of limited partnership funds.
The contract with EP Private Equity Limited during the year ended 30 September 2006 had a rolling one year notice period and therefore could be terminated on one years notice, without penalty.
The new contract with Electra Partners LLP, was approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 12 October 2006.
Electra may terminate the new management agreement on 12 months notice, after the initial two year period.
After three years, the Company has the right to require Electra Partners LLP to work a shorter notice period for which Electra Partners LLP will receive priority profit share in the ordinary course.
Whatever notice period is worked, Electra Partners LLP will be entitled to receive additional compensation equivalent to 12 months priority profit share determined by reference to the previous 12 months priority profit share.
Electra Partners LLP may also terminate the new management agreement on 12 months notice, after the initial two year period.
If Electra Partners LLP terminates the new management agreement at any time after the initial three year period, Electra may pay compensation in lieu of any part of the notice period but Electra Partners LLP is not entitled to any additional compensation.

During the year the Company continued to operate carried interest and co-investment schemes for executives of Electra Partners and details of these schemes are contained in Note 21 of the Notes to the Accounts.
24 Electra Private Equity PLC Accounts Report of the Directors Socially Responsible Investment Electra believes that high standards of corporate social responsibility CSR make good business sense and have the potential to protect and enhance investment returns.
Consequently, the investment process takes social, environmental and ethical issues into account when, in Electra Partners view, these have a material impact on either investment risk or return.
Electra recognises and supports the view that social, environmental and ethical best practice should be encouraged.
It favours investing in companies committed to high standards of CSR and to the principles of sustainable development.
Electra Partners does not screen out companies from its investment universe purely on the grounds of poor social, environmental or ethical performance.
Instead, it adopts a positive engagement approach whereby, if it is appropriate, it discusses these issues with the management of the companies in which it invests.
The information gathered during these meetings is used both to assist Electra Partners investment decisions and also to encourage investee company management to improve procedures and attitudes.
Electra Partners strongly believes that this is the most effective way to improve the CSR policies of the businesses in which it invests and the Board endorses this view.
