Performance The strong performance over the year of the combined portfolio, which includes our share of the value of joint ventures, reects not only the continued yield shift but also the value we have created through our development and asset management activities, with a particularly strong contribution from development.
We revalue our investment portfolio every six months.
Part of the 37.7% increase in the size of the portfolio over the year is attributable to our expenditure on acquisitions and developments, net of disposals.
The like-for-like valuation surplus for the year was 1,047m or 15.9% of which 573.9m or 8.7% occurred in the six months since 30 September 2005.

As we have previously commented, continued yield shift was one of the factors behind the strong performance of the investment portfolio this year, which also benefited from 4.8% like-for-like rental growth.
On the like-for-like portfolio we have seen the strongest total return from our London Portfolio, which has delivered 24.2%, followed closely by retail warehousing with 21.9% and shopping centres and shops with a 19.8% total return over the period.
Land Securities Annual Report 2006 45 Operating and financial review continued Returns are boosted further when the 565.3m of completed developments are included.
These comprise Empress State, SW6:Whitefriars, Canterbury: 40 Eastbourne Terrace, W2 and the Ravenside Retail Park, Bexhill.
In addition, our ongoing extensive development programme, currently valued at 1.3bn, has delivered a 32.9% valuation surplus, with the largest contribution from Cardinal Place, SW1.
The overall total return from our combined portfolio over the last 12 months, including acquisitions and developments, was 23.3%.
Our contribution to performance Long-term performance relative to IPD Ungeared total returns periods to 31 March 2006 In terms of ungeared total property return, our combined portfolio outperformed the UK commercial property market, as represented by the IPD Quarterly benchmark, by 2.2%.

It can be seen that explanation of the key drivers of that performance.
It is clear that yield shift played only a part in Land Securities portfolio has outperformed and produced a return which places it in the top quartile of contributing portfolios over the last 10 and the creation of shareholder value.
This also demonstrates clearly the strong contribution from 20 year time periods.

less than the estimated rental value of the property ERV, in which case a property is described as having reversionary potential.
Equally, as happened most recently in the London ofce markets, if the ERV drops below the current rent a property becomes over-rented.
This, together with the level of vacancies voids across the portfolio, is an important factor both in terms of risk management and future growth in values.
At the year end the net reversionary potential of the like-for-like portfolio was 6.5% compared to 3.9% 12 months ago.
This improvement has arisen from a reduction in the over-rented element of London ofces, which are now only slightly over-rented, and from continued rental growth on retail assets, which now have a net reversionary potential of 12.2%.
Set against this positive news on rental growth, voids on the like-for-like portfolio have increased from their historically low levels to 3.1%, although a proportion are strategic voids where we are keeping units vacant prior to redevelopment.

We also had our most active year ever in terms of acquisitions with the purchase of 2.2bn of investment properties including assets bought by way of corporate acquisitions and joint ventures, which have shown a valuation surplus of 5.7% over the period since acquisition.
The average yield on the properties sold was 3.3% the low gure being explained by the rent free period on 30 Gresham Street and the average initial yield on the assets acquired was 5.2% or 5.4% excluding properties acquired vacant.
The purchase activity was principally accounted for by the acquisitions of Tops Estates, the LxB portfolio, and 15 London ofce investments.
Development Timing of completion of development pipeline Our development programme, including our share of joint ventures and those properties completed 800 and let in the year, produced a valuation surplus of 364.7m of which 181.3m occurred in the second half of the year.
Four schemes were transferred into the investment portfolio from the development programme.
These were 99% let and generated rents of 9.4m in the year under 600 review.
In a full year these will contribute 14.4m of rental income.
Including our share of joint ventures and land acquisitions we spent 313.6m excluding capitalised 400 interest on the development pipeline on projects including Cardinal Place, New Street Square, Bankside 2 and 3 in London and shopping centre developments in Bristol and Exeter.
Cardinal Place has now reached practical completion and we have therefore stopped capitalising interest on this 200 project.
However, during the year interest of 11.5m on Cardinal Place was capitalised 2005: 9.0m.
We have an estimated further spend of 821m on the projects underway currently which, when complete and fully let, will produce 144.2m of annual income at todays ERV.

We are currently developing two projects on behalf of the BBC, Pacic Quay, Glasgow and Broadcasting House, W1.
The BBCs new headquarters in Glasgow is on programme for completion by the target date of mid-July and within budget.
Broadcasting House has shown some slippage, however, the first phase has now been completed and preliminary works have started on the second and final phase.
We, the BBC and Bovis Lend Lease, our building contractor have agreed in principle the construction programme and costs for Phase 2 and we have also reached agreement on the final account on Phase I.
Property management We are also responsible for the provision of property management services across the communal areas of buildings in our investment portfolio.
These include: Repairs and maintenance Security and building reception services Cleaning Key services, such as electricity, water and waste Insurance Promotional and marketing activity at shopping centres We procure and manage these and charge the related costs back to our occupiers through an annual service charge.
This is potentially an area of contention between an occupier and the property owner and we have worked hard over the past few years to provide transparent communication on service charges to our occupiers.
Managing Unlike many of our peer group, we do not outsource the property management of our investment portfolio.
Instead we have developed a strong in-house capability which we believe improves dialogue and lines of communication with our occupiers and is increasingly a differentiator as we Through our in-house team and our service seek to consolidate those relationships.
In the past year we have looked closely at the way in which partners we are responsible for providing a we deliver services across our portfolios and the way in which we manage the relationship with our range of property management services occupiers.
As a result we have restructured the teams responsible for the day-to-day management across both our investment portfolio and of our London multi-let premises and are in the process of introducing changes to the structure of property outsourcing contracts.
our retail property management teams.
At the same time we have recently announced the introduction of a new occupier portal, an online system which will give occupiers direct access to our internal systems to view property lease and service charge information.
Not only will this improve the availability of data to our occupiers but we also hope that it will make our organisation more accessible to our customers by providing details of the individual people an occupier might need to contact about their property needs.
We conduct annual customer satisfaction surveys across our business and believe that willingness to recommend Land Securities as a landlord is a key measure of our performance.
In the last year we were pleased to note a greater than 94% willingness to recommend us as a landlord by those customers surveyed.
We believe our approach to property management differentiates Land Securities from other providers of commercial property accommodation, strengthening our ability to attract new and retain existing customers and enhancing our market leading reputation.
