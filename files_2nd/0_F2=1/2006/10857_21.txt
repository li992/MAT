reat service comes from the heart.
Like many companies, we strive to delight our customers.
In our business, that is not something we can achieve with systems and processes alone.
Great customer service is essentially personal.
It is delivered to people, by people who recognise their individual needs and concerns and act on them, there and then.
We opened our third Customer Service Academy in 2006.
And this year we are putting even more emphasis on training and empowering our people, particularly those on the front line to enable them to make a difference.
Some of our services are the best in the business Midland Mainline won the 2006 National Rail Award for Passenger Operator of the Year and Gatwick Express continues to top the National Passenger Survey tables for customer satisfaction.
We want to achieve that kind of performance right across the Group.
So we have been listening to customers more systematically, using increasingly detailed research to identify and fix the things that dissatisfy them, and make improvements across the board.
In North America, the customers for our school bus operations are school boards.
Our regular customer questionnaires have always showed high levels of satisfaction, confirmed by a contract renewal rate of greater than 95%.
Last year we held 150 in-depth interviews with all our customers in the US and Canada, which identified some important opportunities.
For example, local managements responsiveness to customers is strongly linked to customer retention.
Armed with this insight, we are taking appropriate action to provide tools for our management teams.

YOU HAVE TO SET THE AGENDA AND GET ON WITH IT.
e have to look beyond the status quo.
We need to be leaders in performance, quality and fresh ideas.
To lead the way in public transport, we are learning to think and act differently.
We called our new leadership development strategy DNA because it reflects the individuality of our businesses and our leaders.
It also recognises the unique leadership skills that we share across the National Express Group and that were developing to continuously improve and grow the business.
Unlike many businesses, we see all our managers as leaders, from the front line to the board room because we believe that leaders at every level in the business have a role to play in delighting our customers.
DNA isnt just about attending training programmes.
Its about creating ways of working that deliver continued success for the business whilst enabling people to achieve their potential.
In consultation across the business, we asked: what are the leadership skills that we need to become one of the worlds leading transport businesses?
The response: leaders who inspire people, think customer, look ahead, generate value, collaborate for success, drive improvement, and who get it right day-in dayout.
DNA is focused on developing these skills by taking an integrated approach to how we recruit, develop, support and motivate both existing and new leaders.
Some of the best service innovations come from seeing things from the customers point of view.

CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS IS A KEY FOCUS e have a major impact in the political, social, economic, safety and environmental arenas.
So there are a great many stakeholders that we need to know, understand and work with.
They include customers, rail and bus passenger groups, local, regional and state transport bodies, non government organisations, employees, suppliers, shareholders and Trades Unions, organisations like BAA and, of course, our own people.
We are getting to know them better, and are putting in place better processes to improve the way we communicate with individuals and organisations.
Last year all our businesses formally identified the stakeholders they need to work with, and planned how to build more positive, active relationships with them to achieve our business goals.
The next step is to carry out detailed research, to understand better how they see us and how they want to relate to us.
We need a realistic and up to date vision of the stakeholder landscape so that we can identify gaps, set priorities and move more quickly as we have done, for example, in engaging with the Olympic Delivery Authority on plans for Stratford, the primary location for the London 2012 Olympics.

The Ministry is a key stakeholder for Alsa because of its role in regulating the industry.
Safety is a common concern for many stakeholder groups.
In North America we join forces with the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services to promote National School Bus Safety Week.
This governmentrecognised event enables us to work with students, parents, school administrators and our own drivers to raise safety awareness.
The key to productive stakeholder partnerships is mutual benefit.
Rather than leave unused station buildings boarded up and forgotten, Central Trains is making them available to local community organisations.
Working with Network Rail it has created an innovative three-way lease that gives non-commercial groups tenancies of up to 25 years at peppercorn rents of as little as 1 a year.
Tenants so far include a sustainable development project, a music teaching and practice facility, a local enterprise agency and an art gallery in a converted urinal.
The expected benefits include revitalised stations for Central Trains, better maintained assets and less vandalism for Network Rail.
In addition, there is greater security and an improved environment for customers, extra amenities for the community, and greater engagement for all the stakeholders involved.

rail or bus timetable is a picture of order and predictability.
Real life, unfortunately, is not.
Beneath the surface of smooth-running operations there is a huge amount of activity by people with a passion for detail.
They have a deep sense of their responsibility for delivering safe, reliable and excellent services.
The more successfully they do their jobs, the less our customers should notice.
Our goal is to Make Travel Simpler.
To do that, we first have to achieve operational excellence.
There is no operational issue more important than safety.
Trains, coaches and buses are rightly recognised as three of the safest forms of transport, and we guard that reputation jealously.
Safety is our first responsibility to our customers and our people, and essential to our business success.
We constantly review ways to improve our performance.
All our UK coaches are fitted with seat belts by law, and since 2006 it has been mandatory for passengers over 14 to wear them.
In Spain, the law will require seat belts to be fitted to coaches registered from October 2007.
On that basis, it could have been 2011 before our whole Alsa fleet was seat belt equipped.
But in fact, Alsa has been fitting this vital safety equipment to new coaches since 2003.
And last year, with belts fitted to just under half the seats in its long distance scheduled fleet, Alsa decided to retro-fit belts to the rest of its long distance fleet.
The work will be completed this year.

Each of our rail businesses has its own SPAD reduction strategy involving driver training, driver assessment and competence management.
Our SPAD rate has been improving for several years and the 2006 figure was our lowest ever.
To maintain further improvement we are working in partnership with the drivers union, ASLEF, on a development programme that will further enhance the way we support safety awareness and competence in our driver workforce.
After safety, customers greatest concern is reliable, punctual services.
In the most recent National Rail Trends reliability and punctuality table, National Express companies topped all three categories see Table 1.
But we still have work to do.
In 2006 Central Trains achieved its highest ever scores for punctuality.
In the National Passenger Surveys twice-yearly customer satisfaction figures, the weighted average of our train companies has been consistently ahead of the national average in both our focus areas of punctuality and cleanliness see Table 2.
As we achieve the standards customers expect in basic criteria such as punctuality, we can now address more of the other details that affect customer satisfaction.
18 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REVIEW & SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT 2006 We are defining and formalising the levels of service customers can expect for example, Midland Mainline now has written standards for every train setting out details such as when the buffet must be open.
Customers are frustrated by complex fare structures and timetables, so we have been working with the Association of Train Operating Companies on fare simplification and the results will be seen in 2007.
In Birmingham we have worked in partnership with Centro to simplify fares and use distinctive branding on certain routes to make identification simpler.
In Spain, we have just launched the Bus Plus card for regular customers.
Cardholders get priority booking and fare discounts, and can change or cancel reservations with less hassle which makes life simpler.
They also get access to premium waiting rooms, special offers, discounted theatre tickets and a prize draw.
Which makes life a bit more fun.
Each of these little extras is just a detail.
But taken together, we believe details like these make a real difference.

eanwhile, we are planning to begin trials of biodiesel on buses in the UK.
And we are having positive discussions with Transport for London to trial five diesel-electric hybrid buses which should lead to a significant reduction in both CO2 emissions and exhaust pollutants.
But the most important thing we can do to combat global warming is achieve large-scale shifts to public transport.
As well as making public transport more attractive by improving our services, we are also promoting the environmental benefits: this year, for example, we are launching a new facility on our websites that enables people to calculate how much CO2 they can save by changing their transport habits.
The figures can be startling, for example, swapping from car to coach on a London to Birmingham return trip, travellers could cut their CO2 emissions by up to 91%.
Overall our services result in a massive net saving in emissions than had the journeys been undertaken by a car see table above.
As well as saving energy, public transport eases congestion.
In crowded town centres and in some of Europes finest mountain wilderness.
In Northern Spains Picos fide Europa National Park in Asturias, holiday traffic on the road to Covadonga Lakes meant the 11km journey could take three hours in summer.
In partnership with Alsa, the local authorities have established a flexible park and ride scheme involving three car parks and 40 coaches on a 25km route.
During peak seasons the road is closed to cars and visitors travel quickly and comfortably by coach, watching an onboard video about the area and related environmental issues.
The project has greatly improved the local environment, makes access quicker and easier, and saves an estimated 64,000 litres of fuel and almost 800 tonnes of CO2 a year.
We will continue to explore ideas like these, and every avenue for reducing climate change.
Not least because we also have to ensure that our operations are able to cope with the more extreme weather conditions that have been forecast.
