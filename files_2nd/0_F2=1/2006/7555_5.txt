T he Market Home owners, tenants and property developers How big is the kitchen market?
Its difficult to say, because it depends how you define the market.
For instance: does it include bespoke, DIY, appliances, trade.
There are many different ways to cut the numbers.
What we can say about our market is that the ageing and inadequate housing stock in the UK means that there is market demand.
To compete in this market means meeting demand for increasingly sophisticated products and increasingly demanding legislative standards.
We also know that the installation of a kitchen with related accessories and joinery is time critical, because a home cannot function without its kitchen.
It depends on a collection of pieces and different skills being brought together to meet that time critical process.
All this is driving the market from DIY Do it yourself towards DFY Done for you, as disposable incomes increase.
