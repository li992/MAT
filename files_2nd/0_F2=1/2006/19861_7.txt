SURFACE MINING FINANCIAL REVIEW Surface minings financial performance is set out below: 2006 2005 m m Turnover 21.7 33.4 Operating profit before Exceptional Items 0.5 3.3 Exceptional Items 4.1 2.5 Operating profit 4.6 0.8 2006 2005 KPIs m m Sales per Gigajoule GJ 1.58 1.42 Controllable cash costs per GJ 1.46 1.25 Operating cost per GJ 1.93 1.31 before Exceptional Items and provision releases Surface mining achieved a small profit on output of 0.6 million tonnes 2005: 1.0 million tonnes.
profitability was held back, with only one site operating for most of the year and three sites being developed, increasing operating cost per GJ to 1.93 2005: 1.31.
The result includes net provision releases of 5.4m 2005: 2.3m mainly in respect of restoration liabilities in the North East which have been reassessed now that we have planning permission to extract coal in adjacent reserves.
Net exceptional income of 4.1m includes gains of 4.4m from the disposal of unutilised plant, and 0.3m related to redundancy costs.

After gaining new planning permissions, 7.2m 2005: 1.9m was invested in 2006 on the start-up of new sites which will come into full production in 2007.
Restoration activities continue on our Orgreave site and on several other former surface mine sites.
As a result, expenditure of 11.2m 2005: 10.8m was incurred in the year on this activity.
Asset disposal proceeds from the sale of unutilised plant were 5.6m 2005: 0.5m.

WITH THE IMPORT OF COAL POTENTIALLY RESTRAINED BY PORT AND RAIL CAPACITY IN THE COUNTRY, OUR RESERVES SHOULD FORM AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL RESOURCE WITH ECONOMIC VALUE.

07. indd 23 12 3 07 18:50:39 OPERATING REVIEW With the completion of coaling at Orgreave in January 2006, the Group operated for most of 2006 with only one surface mine, Maidens Hall, in Northumberland.
This was subsequently supplemented by operations commencing at Stony Heap in August 2006, and Stobswood North and Cutacre in December.
Surface mining made good progress in developing its potential reserves in 2006 to 14.0 million tonnes, including applications planned to be submitted in 2007 2005: 13.1 million tonnes.
Planning approval was gained for two sites in 2006, Steadsburn and Stobswood North.
Reserves with planning consent at the year end were 4.1 million tonnes 2005: 3.7 million tonnes, and planning applications submitted in the year were 5.4 million tonnes 2005: 5.1 million tonnes.
Applications expected to be submitted in the new financial year amount to 4.6 million tonnes 2005: 4.3 million tonnes.
Future prospects UK COAL has approximately 97 million tonnes of potential surface mine coal reserves which, at current prices, should be capable of economic extraction.
With the import of coal potentially restrained by port and rail capacity in the country, our reserves should form an important national resource with economic value.
Although planning permission for coaling has been difficult to obtain in previous years, UK COAL believes this attitude is changing and is confident that, in future, schemes can be progressed.
The Group is continuing its efforts to obtain further planning permission based on improvements in the environmental acceptability of browneld site regeneration.
The end result will be both additional domestic production and sites restored to a standard and at a cost which would be prohibitive without prior mining.
The Group has significant surface mining plant, equipment and expertise and is actively looking at additional sites in England, Scotland and Wales in order that these resources may be used efficiently.
