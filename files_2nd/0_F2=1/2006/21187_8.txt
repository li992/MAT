Aviva plc Business review continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 32 Europe Dear Shareholder, Europe is, and will continue to be, one of the worlds main savings markets.
We have secured a unique operating platform on the continent and are in a prime position to capture the opportunities that changing demographics, increasing private wealth and stretched public finances will create to provide customers with our products and services.
Continental Europe now contributes 41% of the groups total sales and is a key source of growth and profits for Aviva.
We continued to grow at a healthy pace in 2006, increasing our total long-term sales by 8% to 14 billion.
Bancassurance is at the heart of our European strategy.
In 2006, we completed a new distribution agreement with AIB in Ireland and significantly expanded our distribution in Italy with UniCredit Group.
Elsewhere we have continued to work hard on increasing our penetration of the banks customer base and have made good progress in France and Spain.
Our Dutch operations have had a difficult year, largely as a result of increased competition in a number of markets and changing economic conditions.
Local management continues to seek out new sales opportunities and has taken action to improve efficiency and competitiveness through cost control.
In the emerging markets of Central and Eastern Europe, we have made good progress.
In Poland our long-term sales increased by 74% and profits by 19%.
We are leveraging our multi-channel distribution skills acquired in the more mature markets of Western Europe to accelerate the development of strong long-term businesses in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania and Turkey.
Financial performance Benefiting from our highly diversified geography and distribution network, we achieved growth of profits and sales in 2006 reflecting good operational performances across our long-term, fund management and general insurance businesses.
Total operating profit was up to 1,634 million 2005: 1,558 million.
Our general insurance and health operations across Europe have once again delivered a strong performance, achieving a general insurance only COR of 89% 2005: 92%, therefore beating the group target of 98%.
Strategic developments Although the markets of continental Europe are highly competitive, we believe that they offer excellent growth opportunities to players who have the right skills and the right geographic spread.
We invest significant resources in research and development to stay ahead of our competition, and to understand our customers and our distribution partners better.
Access to our customers distribution is crucial to unlocking Europes growth potential.
Our primary focus is to sell more to our existing 18 million customers: therefore, penetration rates, cross-selling and up-selling have become part of the day-to-day vocabulary of all our European staff.
In Spain, for instance, working ever more closely with our banking partners, we have been able to more than double the proportion of the banks customers using our products and services over the past five years.
Organic growth is central to our strategy and critical to our success, yet we are also keen to capture value-creating opportunities to increase our distribution reach.
Finally, we will continue to invest in Central and Eastern Europe, which after Asia, is one of the fastest growing economic areas in the world.
These economies are expected to grow at double the rate of Western European economies.
As income and private wealth increase in these countries, we know that consumers will invest a significant proportion of their growing disposable income in the kind of products and services that we provide.
Our 2006 achievements in Poland and Hungary, to name just two countries, illustrate the kind of potential available in that region.
Outlook Our priority is to achieve strong, sustainable and profitable growth.
We will continue to work hard to increase the penetration rate of our existing customer base, to increase our distribution reach through new partnerships and to grow our presence in the emerging markets of Central and Eastern Europe.
I strongly believe that Europe will continue to make a major contribution to the success of Aviva, and that we will build further on our current strong position to become the leading insurance company in Europe.
