Prior to 1 January 2004, the Groups financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Under EU IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Groups UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated.
This was permitted under the rules governing the transition to EU IFRS set out in IFRS 1.
The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity.
As a consequence, shareholders funds under Australian IFRS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$740 million at 31 December 2006 US$743 million at 31 December 2005.
Save for the exception described above, the Groups financial statements drawn up in accordance with EU IFRS are consistent with the requirements of Australian IFRS.

The value in use was based on cash flows forecast in real terms and discounted at a pre-tax rate of eight per cent.
The KUC impairment provision in 2002 was calculated using a pre tax discount rate of six per cent.
An increase in the Groups long term iron ore price assumption triggered an assessment of the recoverable amount of IOC.
The IOC impairment provision in 2002 aligned the carrying value with the value negotiated between shareholders during that year as part of a financial restructuring exercise.
A continuation of operating losses triggered an assessment of the recoverable amount of Tarong, one of the Groups coal mines in Australia.
The carrying value of Argyle included goodwill and was therefore subject to annual impairment reviews.
In the case of Argyle, impairment has occurred earlier than expected as a result of adverse changes in assumptions about future prices, capital and operating costs.
The impairment provision included the elimination of the balance of Argyles goodwill, which amounted to US$223 million.
The value in use was based on cash flows forecast in real terms and discounted at a pre-tax rate of eight per cent which was the same as the discount rate used in the 2005 annual assessment.

The amounts as at 31 December 2006 disclosed above include goodwill relating to Australian Iron Ore of US$394 million and goodwill of US$231 million relating to Rio Tinto Energy America RTEA.
Australian Iron Ore comprises the business units located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia that mine iron ore, namely Robe River and Hamersley Iron.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill relating to Australian Iron Ore and RTEA have been assessed by reference to value in use.
The valuations are based on cash flow projections that incorporate best estimates of selling prices, ore grades, production rates, future capital expenditure and production costs over the life of each mine.
In line with normal practice in the mining industry, the cash flow projections are based on long term mine plans covering the expected life of each operation.
The projections therefore generally cover periods well in excess of five years.
The valuations are particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions about selling prices, operating costs, exchange rates, and discount rates.
Future selling prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy in note 1 i.
Long term average selling prices are forecast taking account of estimates of the costs of the producers in each industry sector.
To the extent that future coal sales are subject to fixed price contracts, such contracted prices are used.
Forecasts of operating costs are based on detailed mine plans which take account of all relevant characteristics of the ore body.
Exchange rate assumptions are based on the spot rates as of the time of the annual goodwill impairment review.
An exchange rate of A$1 US$0.76 was used.
Discount rates represent an estimate of the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
The Groups weighted average cost of capital is used as a start point for determining the discount rate with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the individual cash generating unit.
Goodwill relating to Australian Iron Ore and RTEA has been reviewed applying a discount rate of 6.5 per cent to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
Impact of Reasonably Possible Changes in Key Assumptions Australian Iron Ore It does not appear that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which Australian Iron Ores recoverable amount is based would cause its value to fall short of its carrying amount at 31 December 2006.
RTEA The recoverable amount of goodwill relating to RTEA is similar to its carrying value at 31 December 2006.
Thus, any significant adverse change in the valuation assumptions would cause its carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
Other Under IAS 36, goodwill is no longer amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The Groups business relates to the mining and processing of finite resources and it is therefore likely that impairments of certain elements of the goodwill may occur at some stage in the future as resources are depleted.
For this reason, the value of the goodwill related to RTEA is likely to fall short of its carrying value in the near future.

They are a fundamental tenet of the Groups long term strategy.
The Groups business is mining and not trading.
The Group only sells commodities it has produced.
In the long term, natural hedges operate in a number of ways to help protect and stabilise earnings and cash flow, obviating the need to use derivatives or other forms of synthetic hedging for this purpose.
Such hedging is therefore undertaken to a strictly limited degree, as described below.
The Group has a diverse portfolio of commodities and markets, which have varying responses to the economic cycle.
The relationship between commodity prices and the currencies of most of the countries in which the Group operates provides further natural protection.
In addition, the Groups policy of borrowing at floating US dollar interest rates helps to counteract the effect of economic and commodity price cycles.
Rio Tinto does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes: nor does it believe that it has exposure to such trading or speculative holdings through its investments in joint ventures and associates.
Derivatives are used to separate funding and cash management decisions from currency exposure and interest rate management.
The Group uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with longer term funds raised in the capital markets to achieve a floating rate obligation which is consistent with the Groups interest rate policy.
Currency swaps are used to convert debt or investments into currencies, primarily the US dollar, which are consistent with the Groups policy on currency exposure management.
Foreign exchange risk Rio Tintos shareholders equity, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a wide variety of currencies due to the geographic diversity of the Groups sales and the countries in which it operates.
The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the great majority of the Groups sales are denominated.
Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where the Groups mines and processing plants are located and also by those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
The Australian and Canadian dollars are the most important currencies apart from the US dollar influencing costs.
Details of the derivative financial instruments entered into to manage the Groups exposure to currencies other than the US dollar are provided in note A below.
Given the dominant role of the US currency in the Groups affairs, the US dollar is the currency in which financial results are presented both internally and externally.
It is also the most appropriate currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of surplus cash may also be held in other currencies, most notably Australian dollars, in order to meet short term operational and capital commitments and dividend payments.
The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars, either directly or using currency swaps, and a substantial part of the Groups US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having functional currencies other than the US dollar.
The Group does not generally believe that active currency hedging would provide long term benefits to shareholders.
Currency protection measures may be deemed appropriate in specific commercial circumstances and are subject to strict limits laid down by the Rio Tinto board.
As set out in note A below, as at 31 December 2006 there were forward contracts to sell US$581 million 2005: US$512 million in respect of future trading transactions.
A significant part of the above hedge book was acquired with North Ltd. North held a substantial hedge book on acquisition which has been retained but is not being renewed as maturities occur.
Interest rate risk Rio Tintos interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates.
Short term US dollar rates are normally lower than long term rates, resulting in lower interest costs to the Group.
Furthermore, cyclical movements of interest rates tend to compensate in the long term, to an extent, for those of commodity prices.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
At the end of 2006, US$1.2 billion 2005: US$1.1 billion of the Groups debt was at fixed rates after taking into account interest rate swaps and finance leases.
Based on the Groups net debt at 31 December 2006, and with other variables unchanged, the approximate effect on the Groups net earnings of a one percentage point increase in US dollar LIBOR interest rates would be a reduction of US$6 million 2005: US$4 million.
Commodity price risk The Groups normal policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices.
Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid down by the Rio Tinto board and to rigid internal controls.
Rio Tintos exposure to commodity prices is diversified by virtue of its broad commodity spread and the Group does not generally believe commodity price hedging would provide long term benefit to shareholders.
During 2005, forward contracts to sell 509 million pounds of copper at a fixed rand price per pound were entered into as a condition of the refinancing of Palabora, for which cash flow hedge accounting is achieved of which 420 million pounds remain at 31 December 2006. Credit risk No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non performance of the counterparties to financial instruments, other than trade and other receivables held by the Group.
Given the large number of internationally dispersed customers the Group has limited concentration of credit risk, with regard to its trade and other receivables, which is closely monitored.
Financial instrument disclosures Except where stated, the information given below relates to the financial instruments of the parent companies and their subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated units, and excludes those of equity accounted units.
Trade and other receivables payables are included only in the currency analysis.

This results in an accounting exposure to exchange gains and losses as the financial assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency of the subsidiary that accounts for those assets and liabilities.
These gains and losses are recorded in the Group income statement except to the extent that they can be taken to equity under the Groups accounting policy which is explained in note 1.
After taking into account relevant derivative instruments, almost all of the Groups net debt is either denominated in US dollars or in the functional currency of the entity holding the debt.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.

These plans have been accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2, Share based Payments, which means that IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of employee share based payments that had not vested as at 1 January 2004.
The compensation cost that has been recognised in income for Rio Tintos share based compensation plans, and related liability, are set out in the table below.

The significant assumptions used in the valuation model are disclosed below.
Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of Rio Tintos share returns under the UK and Australian listings.
Historical data were used to estimate employee turnover rates within the valuation model.
Under the Share Option Plans, it is assumed that after options have vested, 20 per cent p. a. of participants will exercise their options when the market price is at least 20 per cent above the exercise price of the option.
Participants in the Share Savings Plans are assumed to exercise their options immediately after vesting.
The implied lifetime of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk-free rate used in the valuation model is equal to the yield available on UK and Australian zero-coupon government bonds for plc and Limited options respectively at the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term of the options.
Summary of options outstanding A summary of the status of the Companies fixed share option plans at 31 December 2006, and changes during the year ended 31 December 2006, is presented below.

The fair value of each award on the day of grant was estimated using a lattice based option valuation model, including allowance for the exercise price being at a discount to market price.

The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity settled share based payment transactions.
The performance conditions in relation to Total Shareholder Return have been incorporated in the measurement of fair value for these awards by modelling the correlation between Rio Tintos TSR and that of the index.
The relationship between Rio Tintos TSR and the index was simulated many thousands of times to derive a distribution which, in conjunction with the lattice based option valuation model, was used to determine the fair value of the options.
The key assumptions are noted in the following table.

Share Ownership Plan The fair values of awards of Matching and Free Shares made by Rio Tinto are taken to be the market value of the shares on the date of purchase.
These awards are settled in equity.
The total fair value of shares awarded during the year was 988,000 2005: 877,000.

If any awards are ultimately settled in shares, the liability is transferred direct to equity as the consideration for the equity instruments issued.
The grant date fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award reduced by 50 per cent for anticipated relative TSR performance.
In addition, for the valuations after 2005 the market value is reduced for non receipt of dividends between measurement date and date of vesting excluding post 2003 awards for Executive Directors and Product Group CEOs.
Forfeitures are assumed prior to vesting at three per cent p. a. of outstanding awards.
In accordance with the method of accounting for cash settled awards, fair values are subsequently remeasured each year to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.

Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Valuations of these plans are produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.
Pension plans The majority of the Groups pension obligations are in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.
In the UK, the main pension arrangement is the Rio Tinto Pension Fund, a funded tax-approved plan.
The plan has defined benefit and defined contribution sections: the defined benefit section of the plan gives benefits related to final average pay and was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2005.
New employees are admitted to the defined contribution section.
In Australia, the Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund is the only significant plan.
This plan principally contains defined contribution liabilities but also has defined benefit liabilities.
The defined benefits are linked to final average pay and are typically paid in lump sum form.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US and Canadian entities, typically with separate provision for salaried and hourly paid staff.
Benefits for salaried staff include benefits linked to final average pay and benefits determined according to an accumulated cash balance.
Benefits for hourly paid staff are reviewed in negotiation with unions.
The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.
Post retirement healthcare plans Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria.
Plan assets The proportions of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset class at the balance sheet date were: 2006 2005 Equities 67.2% 66.4% Bonds 25.2% 24.5% Property 4.3% 2.8% Other 3.3% 6.3% 100.0% 100.0% The plans do not invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in the Groups own financial instruments.
Main assumptions rates per annum The main assumptions for the valuations of the plans are set out below: Other mainly UK Australia a US Canada Africa b At 31 December 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 5.1% 5.1% 3.9% 3.8% 6.8% Rate of increase in pensions 3.1% 3.1% 4.8% Discount rate 5.2% 5.0% 5.9% 5.0% 7.4% Inflation 3.1% 3.1% 2.4% 2.3% 4.8% At 31 December 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 4.8% 3.9% 4.3% 6.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.8% 2.8% 4.5% Discount rate 4.8% 4.4% 5.6% 4.8% 7.3% Inflation 2.8% 2.8% 2.4% 2.6% 4.5% a The discount rate assumed for Australia is after tax.
b The assumptions vary by location for the Other plans.
Assumptions shown are for Southern Africa.
The main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US, were: discount rate: 5.8 per cent 2005: 5.6 per cent, medical trend rate: 8.2 per cent reducing to 5.2 per cent by the year 2011 broadly on a straight line basis 2005: 9.4 per cent, reducing to 4.9 per cent by the year 2011, claims cost based on individual company experience.
For both the pension and healthcare arrangements the post retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality tables used for the main arrangements imply that a male aged 60 at the balance sheet date has an expected future lifetime of 24 years 2005: 24 years.

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as management's best estimate of the long term returns of the major asset classes equities, bonds, property and other weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return is calculated using geometric averaging.
The expected rates of return shown have been reduced to allow for plan expenses including, where appropriate, taxes incurred within pension plans on investment returns.
The sources used to determine managements best estimate of long term returns are numerous and include country-specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country-specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations as applicable.

Contributions to plans Contributions to pension plans totalled US$172 million 2005: US$192 million.
These contributions include US$12 million 2005: US$8 million for plans providing purely defined contribution benefits.
These contributions are charged against profits, and are included in the figures for current employer service cost shown above.
In addition, contributions of US$14million 2005: US$12 million were made to 401k plans in the US.
In addition, contributions of US$9 million 2005: US$5 million were made to an industry-wide arrangement that is principally defined contribution in nature.
Contributions for other benefits totalled US$19 million 2005: US$26 million.
Contributions to pension plans for 2007 are estimated to be around US$8 million higher than for 2006.
Healthcare plans are unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be predetermined.
Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and in the fair value of assets The amounts shown below include, where appropriate, 100 per cent of the costs, contributions, gains and losses in respect of employees who participate in the plans and who are employed in operations that are proportionally consolidated or equity accounted.
Consequently, the costs, contributions, gains and losses do not correspond directly to the amounts disclosed above in respect of the Group.

Note A explains the principal accounting Rio Tinto plc parent company amounted to US$2,694 million policies.
As permitted by section 230 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account for the Rio Tinto plc parent company is shown.
The Rio Tinto plc company balance sheet, and also its company profit and loss account, were approved by the directors on 23 February 2007 and the balance sheet is signed on their behalf by: Paul Skinner Leigh Clifford Guy Elliott Chairman Chief executive Finance director 154 Rio Tinto 2006 Annual report and financial statements RIO TINTO PLC 2006 846725 pp154 pp156 26 2 07 8:24 am Page 155 A PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES UNDER UK GAAP a Basis of Accounting The Rio Tinto plc entity financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The directors have reviewed the Companys existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Company has adopted the amendments to FRS 26 Financial Guarantee Contracts and Credit Insurance in these financial statements.
The impact of this has been to increase the value of investments in subsidiaries by US$36 million in the current year, with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The effect of adoption of the amendment is not material to the Companys profit after tax or to shareholders funds.
Therefore, prior period information has not been restated.
The Companys accounting policies are otherwise consistent with last year.
b Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis.
c Currency translation The Companys functional currency is the US dollar.
Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
d Investments Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment provisions.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Companys weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.
e Share based payments In 2006, most of the Companys share based payment plans were settled by the issue of shares from Treasury.
Previously they were settled through new issues.
The fair value of the grant is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work.
The fair value is recognised over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the profit and loss account reserve.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share based payments result in an adjustment to reduce the cost of the investment.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market based vesting conditions attached to the award eg Total Shareholder Return.
When market prices are not available, the Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries using a lattice based option valuation model.
Non market vesting conditions eg earnings per share targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
f Revenue recognition Interest is accounted for on the accruals basis.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
g Dividends Dividends payable are recognised when they meet the criteria of a present obligation.
h Treasury shares The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders funds through the profit and loss account reserve.
