Outlook 3 2006 has been a very satisfactory year for Inmarsat, with solid performance in our core business.
We are excited about the future opportunities to expand the BGAN service and the launch of our broadband services for aeronautical and maritime users later in 2007.
We believe that our broadband offerings will continue to drive demand for our services well into the future.
The near term prospect of providing a handheld satellite service on one of our Inmarsat-4 satellites in mid-2007, followed by a global service expected during 2008, gives us the opportunity to develop a new incremental revenue stream in an established and growing market.
We would like to thank our employees for delivering the strong performance during 2006, recognising that this was achieved against a major restructuring programme within the business.
Our distribution partners, service providers and manufacturing partners are an equally important part of our business and we value their expertise and innovation in delivering our services to a broad customer base.
We are particularly excited about the quality of distribution providers who will support our BGAN service and we look forward to extending our reach to new customers and partners in the future.

routes to market for our services are a key strategic objective for the Company.
We are therefore delighted to announce that on 19 March 2007, a subsidiary of Inmarsat plc, Inmarsat Finance III Limited Inmarsat III, entered into a loan facility commitment with CIP UK Holdings Limited CIP UK under which Inmarsat III will provide a loan of up to US$250.0m to CIP UK, to fund a recommended offer for the entirety of the issued share capital of Stratos Global Corporation Stratos by CIP UKs subsidiary, CIP Canada Investment Inc. On the same date, CIP UKs parent company, Communications Investment Partners Limited, granted an option to Inmarsat III to acquire CIP UK, which indirectly will own Stratos, exercisable not earlier than 14 April 2009 and terminating on 31 December 2010.
This transaction gives us more options available to shape the future of our distribution channels and provide diverse choice for our customers and distribution partners and service providers.
Inmarsat is well placed to continue to execute its strategy.
As outlined on page 2 in the Strategy Perspectives, we are focused on meeting the requirements of our customers, staff and shareholders in a targeted way, fulfilling specific objectives for each.
We have made solid progress during 2006 to achieve our goals and we look forward to continued growth in our business in 2007 and beyond.

In September 2006, we announced our intention to launch the third Inmarsat-4 satellite.
The launch of this satellite will be important to the success of a global handheld service, further enhances the BGAN service with global coverage and will provide us with incremental opportunities for new broadband maritime and aeronautical services.
In January 2007, under the contract for launch services with Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services Inc. we exercised our option to launch the Inmarsat-4 F3 on an Atlas V launch vehicle.
The exact launch date is yet to be finalised, and whilst we are hopeful that we may secure a launch slot in late 2007, it is more likely that this launch will take place in 2008.
On 4 September 2006, Inmarsat and ACeS International Limited ACeS announced collaboration arrangements to offer low-cost handheld and fixed voice services, initially in the Asian market with extended coverage expected subsequently over the Inmarsat-4 satellites.
Under the collaboration arrangements, Inmarsat assumed responsibility for ACeS satellite and network operations, wholesale service provision and product and service development.
ACeS now focuses on distribution of MSS Rick Medlock products in the Asian land and maritime markets and has Chief Financial Officer become a distributor of BGAN services.
As a result of these arrangements, Inmarsat took over the daily active base of approximately 10,000 terminals operated by ACeS, and 53 employees located at ACeS operational centre in Batam, Indonesia.
Inmarsat will pay ACeS a total of US$15.0m I am delighted to have the opportunity to review our financial over four years, of which an initial payment of US$4.0m was performance for 2006.
Last year, I commented that we were made on completion and a second payment of US$1.5m was laying the foundations both for future growth and to execute made in January 2007.
