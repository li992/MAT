Operating and Financial Review 13 Key Performance Indicators The following table sets out the key performance measures we monitor in order to evaluate progress against our three part strategy of winning, keeping and growing customers.
The relative focus on these three parts will vary from period to period which necessarily leads to trade-offs between the performance measures.
The over-reaching benchmark of the success of our strategy is our revenue growth.
For further details, see the Chief Financial Officers Review beginning on page 7.

c As a result of the progress in the US towards integrating our customer databases, we have been able to make improvements in the ways in which we capture, record and analyse customer information.
This has led to a significant overall elimination of duplicate records of unique advertisers.
We have not adjusted the previously reported figure for the year ended 31 March 2005 for any duplicated records in that year.
