Howden Kitchens Sourcing, design and manufacturing This is where we complete the circle between market and depot.
Again the key drivers are price, availability, quality and range.
In order to deliver this, Howden Kitchens brings components together as follows: I t is able to design kitchens that meet changing fashions and ever increasing sophistication I t is able to source products globally from the most appropriate supplier I t can handle large volumes of inter-dependent product with good pricing, quality and availability I t understands what needs to be made and what needs to be bought in.
Two examples: the cabinet and the frontal.
Cabinets need to be well made and available to work with a range of frontals.
We need the lowest range possible to keep stock under control.
Shipping boxes of air around the world and storing them is expensive and wasteful.
At our factory in the UK, we can make this element of our product more effectively.
We need greater flexibility to change product styling to meet changing fashions and suppliers that can deliver improved price and availability.
And the end result: our customers see design, speed to market and reliable service.
They trust us as a business they can do business with.
