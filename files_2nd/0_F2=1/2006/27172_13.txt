Notes to Performance Analysis Selection effect measures the effect of security selection within each category.
Allocation effect measures the impact of over or underweighting each asset category, relative to the benchmark weights.
Fixed Interest & Capital Structure measures the net impact of borrowing, cash and fixed interest instruments.
Management fees, expenses and tax these reduce total assets and therefore reduce performance.
