Election Re-election of Directors Kevin Hart resigned as a director on 17 November 2006.
Jann Brown and Simon Thomson were appointed as directors on 17 November 2006 as Finance Director and Legal & Commercial Director respectively.
Both are therefore due to retire at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2007 being the first AGM following their appointment and, being eligible, will offer themselves for election as directors.
Mark Tyndall and Malcolm Thoms retire by rotation at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2007 in accordance with the Companys articles of association and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election as directors.
Hamish Grossart and Ed Story have each served on the Board for more than nine years and in accordance with the Combined Code will therefore seek re-election as directors on an annual basis.
The Board has carried out a formal performance evaluation and confirms that, after rigorous review, it has determined that the performance of each of the directors who are subject to re-election continues to be effective and that each demonstrates commitment to the role.
An explanation of the performance evaluation procedure carried out by the Company is contained in the Corporate Governance Statement.
The directors biographies are on pages 34 and 35.
Share Capital Authorities Resolution 10 in the Notice of AGM seeks to give the directors authority to allot up to 43,455,715 unissued ordinary shares, being up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,674,197.85.
This maximum amount represents 33.33% of the Companys total issued ordinary share capital as at 27 March 2007.
As at 27 March 2007 the Company holds no shares in treasury, representing 0% of the total ordinary share capital calculated exclusive of treasury shares.
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on 16 May 2012, although the directors intend to seek the renewal of this authority on an annual basis.
The directors consider that the authority proposed to be given pursuant to resolution 10 is desirable to allow the Company to retain flexibility, although they have no present intention of exercising this authority.
Resolution 11 in the Notice of AGM seeks to give the directors power to allot unissued ordinary share capital and to sell ordinary shares held in treasury for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,674,197.85 in aggregate without first being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders but this authority is limited to: i the allotment of ordinary shares and sale of treasury shares avoiding legal or practical problems should there be an offer of shares or other securities to shareholders pro rata in the future: and ii the allotment and sale of up to 6,519,009 ordinary shares and treasury shares for cash for any purpose representing 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 27 March 2007.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 53 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Purchase of Own Shares Resolution 12 in the Notice of AGM will be proposed to authorise the Company to make market purchases of its own ordinary shares.
Shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to such authority may be cancelled or held in treasury and then either sold in whole or in part for cash or cancelled in whole or in part.
The directors intend to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by this resolution as they deem appropriate.
No dividends will be paid on treasury shares and no voting rights attach to them.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares that may be purchased pursuant to the authority shall be 14.99% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 27 March 2007, being 19,543,989 ordinary shares.
The maximum price which may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant to this resolution exclusive of expenses shall be the higher of an i amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the Companys ordinary shares for the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase and ii the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System SETS.
The minimum 2 price that may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant to this resolution exclusive of expenses shall be 6 13 pence, being the nominal value of an ordinary share.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company will not repurchase shares in the period of sixty days immediately preceding the preliminary announcement of its annual or interim results or, if shorter, the period from the end of the financial period concerned up to and including the time of a relevant announcement or, except in accordance with the Listing Rules, at any other time when, in terms of the Companys Dealing Rules, the directors would be prohibited from dealing in shares.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
This authority will expire on the earlier of 16 November 2008 or the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2008 unless previously revoked, varied or renewed by the Company in general meeting.
The directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
As at 27 March 2007, options to subscribe for shares were outstanding over an aggregate of 1,616,517 ordinary shares representing 1.01% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 27 March 2007.
If the outstanding amount of the existing buy-back authority granted at the 2006 AGM is utilised in full prior to the 2007 AGM and the new authority is granted at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2007 and is then utilised in full, the options outstanding at 27 March 2007 would represent 1.35% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Repurchase of Deferred Shares As a consequence of the return of cash to shareholders in April, approval will also be sought at the forthcoming AGM to repurchase the deferred shares resulting from the B Shares upon which shareholders elect to receive the single B Share dividend payable on 4 April 2007.
This proposal is detailed in resolution 13 of the Notice of AGM.
Amended Borrowing Powers Resolution 14 in the Notice of AGM proposes amendments to the Companys borrowing powers set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
In common with most listed companies, the Companys borrowing powers are restricted under its Articles of Association.
The borrowing limit is a multiple of Adjusted Capital and Reserves, which is calculated by reference to certain numbers extracted from the most recent consolidated balance sheet of the Group.
As from 1 January 2005, the Groups consolidated balance sheet has been required to be prepared in accordance with IFRS, consistently applied from year to year.
As a consequence of this, the Board believes that certain provisions in those parts of the Companys Articles of Association which establish the Companys borrowing powers require minor modification in order to now be clear and consistent with the bases under which the Groups consolidated balance sheet is now being produced.
Furthermore, the Board believes that certain provisions in those parts of the Companys Articles of Association which establish the Companys borrowing powers require minor modification to exclude from the calculation of monies borrowed any borrowings or indebtedness of Cairn India and its subsidiaries.
The Board believes this to be in the best interest of the Company because under the Indian Companies Act and in line with normal Indian regulatory practice Cairn India is permitted to borrow an amount up to the limit of its capital reserves.
As a matter of normal accounting practice, those reserves are significantly higher than the total equity of the Company and the directors of the Company believe it is appropriate for Cairn Indias borrowing limits to be excluded from the calculation of the borrowing limits of the Company.
54 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Accordingly, it is proposed that the borrowing power in the Companys existing Articles of Association be altered, the principal changes being: a to increase the ability of the Company to borrow money up to the greater of $2 billion and an amount equal to 2.5 times of the adjusted total equity total equity being the new terminology used by IFRS and appearing in the consolidated balance sheets of the Group prepared under IFRS.
The increase in the multiple to 2.5 times, from the previous multiple of 2 times, will provide headroom to compensate for any reductions that may arise as a direct result of the introduction of IFRS and the consequent change in definition of total equity.
The introduction of a fixed amount approximately equal to what the limit would currently be based on the total equity formula protects the Company against adverse fluctuations in the amount of total equity under IFRS and is in line with other market precedents: and b to exclude from the calculation of monies borrowed any borrowings or indebtedness of CIL and its subsidiaries.
The effect of resolution 14 will be to modify the wording of the Companys Articles of Association in so far as they relate to the Companys borrowing powers, such that the wording is clear and consistent with the Groups consolidated balance sheet now being prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These are technical amendments to the Companys borrowing powers as a result of accounting standards changes and the recent restructuring of the Group for the IPO and do not reflect any current intention to increase the level of borrowing.
Copies of the existing Articles of Association and of the revised Article 128 will be available for inspection by shareholders at the Companys registered office between 9.00 a. m. and 5.00 p. m. Monday to Friday other than public holidays from the date of the Notice of AGM to the conclusion of the AGM to be held on 17 May 2007.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors The directors of the Company who held office at 31 December 2006 confirm, as far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware.
In making this confirmation, the directors have taken appropriate steps to make themselves aware of the relevant audit information and that the Companys auditors are aware of this information.
Re-appointment of Auditors Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as auditors and their re-appointment at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2007 will be proposed in accordance with section 385 of the Act.
AGM 2007 The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2007 are set out in the Notice of AGM.
