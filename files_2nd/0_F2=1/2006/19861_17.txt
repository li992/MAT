They are also responsible for preparing the Directors Remuneration Report.
The directors consider that in preparing the financial statements on pages 63 to 106, the Company and the Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and have followed all applicable accounting standards.
The directors confirm their belief that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Company and the Group on the going concern basis.
