Deferred tax We recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
The key area of deferred tax accounting requiring judgement is the assessment of the expected timing and manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date.
In particular, assessment is required of whether taxable profits are more likely than not to arise against which the deferred tax can be utilised.
If our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income changes, or if there is a material change in the actual tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required either to write down our deferred tax assets further, resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on our financial results, or to recognise additional deferred tax assets, resulting in a decrease in our effective tax rate and a positive impact on our financial results.
At 30 June 2006, we have recognised a deferred tax asset of 100 million 2005: 105 million and have unrecognised deferred tax assets of 244 million 2005: 78 million in respect of tax losses arising from trading, and 354 million 2005: 354 million in respect of tax losses arising from capital disposals and provisions against investments.
The Directors consider that at 30 June 2006 there was sufficient evidence to support the recognition of our deferred tax asset on the basis that it was probable that there would be suitable taxable profits against which this asset could be utilised and from which future reversals of underlying timing differences could be deducted.
The net deferred tax asset recognised under US GAAP has primarily differed in respect of deferred tax on IFRS to US GAAP adjustments and in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of employee stock-based compensation expense see note 32 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.
