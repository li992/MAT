SVG Capital plc Corporate information Annual Report and Accounts 2006 32 Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2006 The Directors submit their report and the audited accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Companys business The Company carries on business as an investment trust and is an investment company within the meaning of Section 266 of the Companies Act 1985.
In order to obtain exemption from capital gains tax, the Company has conducted itself with a view to being an approved investment trust for the purposes of Section 842 of the United Kingdom Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 as amended.
The last accounting period for which the Company has been treated as approved by HM Revenue & Customs as meeting the qualifying criteria for investment trust status is the year ended 31 December 2005 and the Company has subsequently conducted its affairs so as to enable it to continue to qualify for such approval.
The Company is not a close company for taxation purposes.
A review of the Companys business and its likely future development is given in the Chairmans statement on pages 6 to 8, the Chief Executives review on page 9 and the Business review on pages 12 to 27.
Revenue and earnings As an investment trust and an investment company, it is important to distinguish between revenue profits and capital profits.
The consolidated revenue profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was 21,957,000 2005: 14,300,000.
The consolidated capital profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was 190,026,000 2005: 142,274,000.
Taking capital returns into account, the consolidated profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was 211,983,000 2005: 156,574,000.
The Companys profit for the year was 204,108,000 2005: 158,045,000. Dividend The Company is prohibited by its Articles of Association from distributing as dividends any capital surpluses that arise from the realisation of investments.
Accordingly, any dividends paid by the Company will be funded out of its revenue account.
The Companys investment objective is one of capital growth and it is anticipated that returns for shareholders will derive primarily from capital.
However, the Directors recommend that the Company should declare the payment of a final dividend of 7.5p per share for the year ended 31 December 2006 in order to meet the requirements to ensure that the Company continues to qualify as an investment trust.
Policy for payment of creditors It is the policy of the Company to settle all investment transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant markets in which it operates.
All other expenses are paid on a timely basis in the ordinary course of business.
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 December 2006.
Purchase of shares for cancellation The Directors have not used the authority given to them at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 24 April 2006 to purchase any of the ordinary shares of the Company.
The total number of shares in issue on 5 April 2007 was 138,813,795 shares.
To provide maximum exibility, the Directors wish to renew the authority to purchase shares for cancellation.
A resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to 14.99% of the share capital in issue on 5 April 2007 will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for which notice is given on pages 81 to 85.
This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2008, unless renewed earlier.
As at 5 April 2007, the Company held no shares in treasury.
Accordingly, the percentage gures in this and other sections of the report are all calculated exclusive of treasury shares.
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding at 5 April 2007 was 8,542,043, which represented approximately 6.2% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the Company were to purchase the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted by this resolution and by the existing buy-back authority given on 24 April 2006 for 19,268,983 shares then the options outstanding at 5 April 2007 would represent approximately 8.7% of the issued ordinary share capital.
However, the Directors do not presently intend to exercise the existing authority prior to its expiry on 10 May 2007.
Issue of new shares At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 24 April 2006, the Directors were given powers in substitution for the powers taken at the Annual General Meeting of the Company in April 2005 to allot relevant securities as if the pre-emption provisions in Section 89 1 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply.
A total of 71,957 shares were issued during the year in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and a further 3,658 shares were issued after the year-end.
The Directors wish to renew these powers at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Therefore, Resolutions 9 and 10 set out in the notice of the Annual General Meeting on pages 81 to 85 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
If passed, Resolution 9 will give the Directors the power to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of a 1,388,137 equivalent to 1% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 5 April 2007 in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the proposed SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan: and b 46,271,264 equivalent to one-third of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 5 April 2007.
If passed, Resolution 10 will give the Directors the power to allot equity securities as if the pre-emption provisions in Section 89 1 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply a up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,388,137 equivalent to 1% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 5 April 2007 in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the proposed SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan: b pursuant to rights issues and other pre-emptive issues: and c up to an aggregate nominal amount of 13,881,379 equivalent to 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 5 April 2007.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Corporate information 33 The Directors are seeking the authority referred to in paragraph c of Resolution 10 in order to provide exibility in raising monies to take advantage of opportunities arising through the launch of new funds, and for general corporate purposes.
It is the intention of the Board that any equity securities allotted under this authority will be allotted at an effective premium to the estimated net asset value per ordinary share at the date of pricing of the issue of the relevant equity securities.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph b of Resolution 10 generally to issue relevant securities whenever they believe it is advantageous to shareholders to do so.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph a of Resolution 9 and paragraph a of Resolution 10 to grant options under part D of the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the proposed SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan to individuals seconded to the Company or its subsidiaries which, for this purpose, include joint ventures.
Options granted pursuant to this authority will nevertheless count towards limits on the number of new ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options.
