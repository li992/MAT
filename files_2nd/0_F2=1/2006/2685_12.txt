Group matters Acquisitions, disposals and other corporate changes Acquisitions On 11 November 2005, we acquired the Energis business, for an initial net cash consideration of 608 million and assumed 33 million of finance lease obligations.
In the third year following completion, we have agreed to pay contingent consideration of between nil and 80 million, payable in cash or shares at our option, dependent on the level of our share price.
For further information on this transaction refer to note 38 of the financial statements.
Since acquisition Energis has generated revenues of 266 million and EBITDA of 35 million.
On 31 December 2005 Cable & Wireless Seychelles Limited acquired Atlas Seychelles Limited, a Seychellois company providing Internet services, for consideration of SR19 million 1.9 million.
Disposals On 7 April 2005, we completed the disposal of our Spanish retail business for consideration of 7 million 4 million, recognising a profit on disposal of 3 million.
On 13 July 2005, we completed the sale of our Sakhalin fixed and mobile businesses for a consideration, inclusive of the repayment of a loan from us of US$2.2 million, of US$44 million 25 million at the exchange rate on 12 July 2005.
The consideration, excluding loan repayment, was paid in cash on completion.
Our loan was repaid on 12 September 2005.
The profit on disposal was 17 million.
On 28 October 2005, a 51% owned subsidiary sold its 12.1% stake in MobileOne Limited M1.
The consideration was S$2.20 per share, or S$260.8 million in total 86.6 million at the closing exchange rate on 27 October 2005, of which we received 44 million after deducting the minority interest.
The profit on disposal was 70 million 36 million after deducting the minority interest.
Corporate changes We have previously maintained an ADR programme and listing on the New York Stock Exchange for US investors.
Given the very small percentage of shares that were held and traded through the ADR programme, we concluded that its additional cost of administration outweighed its potential benefits.
We therefore closed the programme in December 2005.
For the same reasons, we are in the process of deregistering our securities with the SEC which we expect to complete in June 2006.
This will ultimately remove our US reporting obligations.
