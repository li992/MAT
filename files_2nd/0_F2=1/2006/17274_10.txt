Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 28 January 2006 Incentives and bonuses Calculation of EPS in respect of share-based incentive plans, is in accordance with the individual plan rules.
Woolworths Group Incentive Plan The Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP was replaced by the Annual Incentive Plan described below in 2004.
Executive Directors previously had an opportunity to defer receipt of their declared bonus for three years, at the completion of which it is matched by 25 per cent in shares which are purchased in the market at the time of the election to defer.
The outstanding share awards made to Executive Directors are shown on page 25.
The Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan Executive Directors, Directors of subsidiaries and other senior employees participate in the Plan.
It operates on an annual basis and participants do not participate in any other annual bonus schemes.
The Plan provides for two types of Award: a Cash Award, which is paid after the end of the financial year and which, for Executive Directors is based on the achievement of financial targets and meeting personal objectives.
The main financial targets are Group profit, operating company profits, sales, cash targets, stock, margin and costs: a Share Award, which is made after the end of the financial year and which is based on the achievement of Group financial targets.
For Executive Directors the Share Award for achieving target performance is 30 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 60 per cent for exceptional performance.
A base profit level is set at which the Share Award is 10 per cent of salary.
No award is made if this base profit level is not achieved.
Shares comprised in a Share Award will be held in an employee share trust for a vesting period of three years.
At the end of the vesting period a multiplier will be applied if a performance target is met.
For on target performance the multiplier for Executive Directors will be 1.3 rising to a maximum of 2.0 for exceptional performance.
If a participant leaves the Company during the vesting period no multiplier will apply.
On a change of control of the Company, the Committee will determine whether the multiplier will apply, taking into account the performance from the Award date to the date on which the change of control occurs.
The Committee considers it important that Directors and senior employees focus on delivering annual targets set each year.
Cash Awards and Share Awards are based on the achievement of these targets.
The performance measure for the multiplier is growth in adjusted, diluted Earnings Per Share from continuing operations Plan EPS.
Awards for the year ended 28 January 2006 Awards are earned for the achievement of profit targets based on budgets and compared with broker estimates.
The Group profit was at the lower end of expectations and the performance of operating companies was mixed.
The Cash Awards for Executive Directors range between 15.2 per cent and 38.5 per cent of salary.
Share Awards at 10.8 per cent of salary are due to Executive Directors.
This may increase by a multiplier of between 1.3 and 2.0 provided that performance targets are met.
The Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to continue to use Plan EPS for these purposes but to reduce the targets in view of the challenging business environment.
If Plan EPS growth over three years is 2 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index then the multiplier will be 1.3 rising to a maximum of 2.0 if Plan EPS growth over three years is 5 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
No extra shares will be awarded if Plan EPS growth over three years is less than 2 per cent per annum and there will be no retesting if this is not achieved.
Awards for the year ending 3 February 2007 The Cash Award will be based on the achievement of financial targets and meeting personal objectives.
The main financial targets are Group profit, operating company profit, sales, cash targets, stock, margin and costs.
The Cash Award for the Chief Executive will be 60 per cent at target rising to a maximum of 120 per cent.
For other Executive Directors, the Cash Award will be 40 per cent at target rising to a maximum of 80 per cent.
Share Awards, to be made after the end of the financial year, will also be based on the achievement of Group profit targets with additional shares awarded on the basis described above.
For Executive Directors, the target Share Award will be 20 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 40 per cent.
Matching shares will also be subject to Plan EPS performance targets to be set when the Share Award is made.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Committee may consider it appropriate to waive the performance targets for the Chief Executives Awards so that the Chief Executive receives a cash bonus of up to 100 per cent of salary in lieu of any other Cash or Share Awards that may be payable for that year under the Plan.
The Woolworths Group Performance Share Plan Executive Directors and Directors of subsidiaries participate in this Plan.
It provides for participants to receive an Award of Shares every six months, after the announcement of annual and half-yearly results.
For Executive Directors the value of the shares comprised in each Award will be equal in value to 20 per cent of basic salary at the date the Award is made.
The shares will be held in an employee trust for a vesting period of three years.
For exceptional performance the Award may increase to 50 per cent of salary.
When the Plan was introduced two years ago, the Committee decided that Plan EPS was the most appropriate performance measure.
The growth in Plan EPS is calculated in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index and no Award will vest unless the growth in Plan EPS is 6 per cent per annum or more.
Targets for the Awards made to Executive Directors are as follows: Increase in Plan EPS Award as a % of salary Less than 6% nil 6% 10% 8% 20% 10% 30% 12% 40% 15% 50% Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 20 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 28 January 2006 The Woolworths Group Performance Share Plan continued There will be no retesting after the three-year performance period.
Awards made to Executive Directors during the year to 28 January 2006 are shown on page 26.
The Committee has reviewed the performance targets in the light of the challenging trading conditions and has decided that for Awards to be made before the next Annual General Meeting, there will be two performance criteria.
One half of the Awards will vest if Plan EPS targets are met and one half will be dependent on the TSR performance.
The minimum increase in EPS will be 2 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
Total Shareholder Return TSR will be measured against the FTSE General Retailers Index with vesting only if the Company is at the median or above.
The following tables illustrate the targets.
Increase in Plan EPS Award as a % of salary Less than 2% nil 2% 5% 3% 10% 4% 15% 5% 20% 6% 25% TSR performance Award as a % of salary Below median nil Median 60th percentile 5% 61st 70th percentile 10% 71st 80th percentile 15% Upper quintile 25% Special Arrangements for the Chief Executive Following consultation with major shareholders, the Company introduced a new incentive package for the Chief Executive.
This was considered appropriate following the decision by Apax Partners not to proceed with an offer for the Company.
It was a time of uncertainty for the Company and it was necessary to make new arrangements to retain the Chief Executive which are as follows: An opportunity to earn a cash bonus for the year ended 28 January 2006 of up to 120 per cent of salary.
The bonus is dependent on the attainment of a range of targets including profits, like for like sales, margin, reduction in costs, stock, external entertainment sales, cash, e-commerce and performance in refurbished stores.
The outcome is a bonus at 56 per cent of salary.
A three-year share-based Plan which could deliver shares equal in value to three times current salary in June 2008.
Two-thirds of the total award will be linked to the Companys TSR performance vs the General Retailers Index.
No vesting will occur unless this performance is at least at the median with a maximum award if the Company performs in the top 20 per cent of this peer group.
The remaining one-third of the total award will vest provided that the Chief Executive is still employed by the Company on 30 June 2008 and conditional on him retaining his existing shareholding in the Company until that date.
The number of shares awarded was based on a price of 36.2 pence per share being the average share price over the period of one month prior to 30 June 2005.
No new shares will be issued in respect of this Plan.
Management Investment Plan A new Management Investment Plan was established in June 2005, which provides the Directors of subsidiary companies and selected members of senior management 52 individuals in total with an opportunity to invest their own money in the Companys shares.
The maximum investment for each individual was dependent on their grade and the highest amount that a Director of a subsidiary company could invest was 20,000.
Over 500,000 was invested in total and participants will become entitled to awards of matching shares of one matching share for each purchased share each year for three years, provided that profit targets are met and that the participant does not dispose of any of the purchased shares before 30 June 2008.
All the share allocations will be released to participants who remain employed in the Group after three years and the Company will not issue any new shares in respect of this Plan.
