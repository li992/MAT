Directors Statement of Responsibility United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the EU: for the Company Financial Statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed: and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, hence, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information as defined by Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985 of which the Companys auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
Going Concern After reviewing the Groups and Companys budget for the next financial year, and other longer term plans, the directors are satisfied that, at the time of approving the financial statements, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
