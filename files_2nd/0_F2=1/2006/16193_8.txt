Business review: South Asia 2006 was a very successful year for Tullow in South Asia, with significant progress across the exploration and development portfolio, providing a foundation for further growth in 2007.
2006 highlights the data was processed and interpreted to define the appraisal well locations.
Average production of 1,690 boepd, 307% above 2005 levels As part of the appraisal programme, three First gas achieved from the Bangora field in May 2006 successful appraisal wells, Bangora-2, 3 and 4 were drilled during 2006.
The Bangora-5 well Drilling completed at the Chachar development, with first reached total depth in early 2007 and is also gas anticipated in April 2007 planned as a gas production well.
All wells to date have encountered good quality, Seismic acquisition completed at Kohat, with drilling gas-bearing reservoir sands, resulting in scheduled this year an upgrade in reserves.
In parallel with the ongoing appraisal activity, a production In India, seismic acquisition increased from 600 to 1,500km facility was installed to allow the discovery with a four well campaign planned for 2007 well, Bangora-1, to be put on a long-term production test, which commenced in May.
Since then gas from Bangora-2 was added to production in October and the combined South Asia is currently experiencing 311km of 2D seismic data were acquired in production is currently 60 mmscfd.
