I achieved eminence by sheer gravitation.
George Bernard Shaw, The Irrational Knot 1905 William Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway 18561937 Silver-plated copper electrotype, 1893, by Edward Onslow Ford The uniquely gifted William Martin Conway combined great eminence as an art historian with an insatiable appetite for mountaineering.
If this were not enough, he served as a Unionist MP from 1918 to 1931 and also put together a hugely important collection of early photographs.
These polymathic interests developed at Cambridge, where he was an academic high flier: it was only fitting, then, that during his 2,000 mile survey of the Himalayas in 1892 he should climb the 6,890 metres of Pioneer Peak and set a new world record for altitude a feat of which no other expert on early Flemish painting can boast.
