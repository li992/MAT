The home credit service is provided by two businesses.
The UK business serves the UK and the Republic of Ireland: markets where home credit has existed for over a century and is well known to millions of customers.
The international business applies the same model to emerging markets in other parts of the world, where home credit is a much newer concept and demand is growing rapidly.
Muriel Clark Home credit customer, Keighley Muriel is typical of our 3.3 million home credit customers throughout the UK, Central and Eastern Europe and Mexico in that she receives a visit from her agent every week at her home.
I like the quick service, the fact that there are no hidden extras and that I can manage the repayments.
