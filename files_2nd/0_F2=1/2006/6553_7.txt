A large rise in single person households, an increasingly ageing population and high levels of immigration 25 million input cost savings targeted in 2007 from Eastern Europe will boost demand for new homes to an estimated 209,000 homes per year.
In contrast, the supply of new homes remains limited to around 160,000 a year as a result of the current 14% increase in short term landbank regulatory environment and severe planning restrictions.

qxp:Layout 1 6 3 07 15:05 Page 23 Delivering on promises UK Housing KPI At the end of 2005 we put a series of actions in place to address the issues of underperformance in our Operating profit m business.
These actions have enabled us to deliver the planned growth in volumes, profits and margins this year.
500 At that time, a number of changes were made to senior management roles within our business.
400 Arriving new to George Wimpey and the industry I was delighted to be welcomed by such a wealth of housebuilding experience on the UK Board.
All four of my Divisional Managing Directors have been 300 promoted through the business and have over 82 years of George Wimpey experience between them.
In addition, 20 of our 28 regional business heads have been promoted from within the business.
200 Throughout the year we have added further expertise to key areas of the business.
To ensure we deliver maximum benefit from our scale, Peter Williams joined us from BPB as Head of Procurement to co-ordinate 100 all supply chain and purchasing initiatives.
Adding further value to our landbank and strengthening our position for the future remains a priority.
We have established two new senior land and planning positions, 0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Paul Churchouse has been promoted to Head of Land Development and a Head of Planning will be UK GAAP IFRS appointed shortly.
I am confident that we now have a strong team in place to drive through our strategy putting us in UK Housing KPI an excellent position from which to deliver our primary objective of margin growth going forward.
Operating margin % Financial review 20 In 2006 the revenue for the UK business increased by 11% to 2,391.2 million 2005: 2,157.6 millon benefiting from a 13% growth in completions.
Operating profit including joint ventures increased by 14% to 317.6 million 2005: 278.0 million.
Profit from joint ventures was 7.6 million.
For the full year 15 gross margins were 20.6% 2005: 21.5% and operating margins, excluding joint ventures, were 13.0% 2005: 12.9%.
Margins have shown strong growth through the year with gross margins increasing from 19.3% in 10 the first half to 21.5% in the second half and operating margins increasing from 11.2% in the first half to 14.3% in the second half.
This steady improvement has come through as planned as we see the benefit of a strong cost management programme across all areas of the business.
Gross margins on sales in the 5 second half show further progress on those achieved on completions during the same period as the benefit of an improving landbank and sales revenue comes through.
0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Outlets and completions UK GAAP IFRS The average number of outlets open during the year was 275, 10% below last year 2005: 307.
This is in part the result of strong sales rates throughout the year, however the planning environment still remains difficult UK Housing KPI and a number of planned site openings for the second half have been delayed.
We continue to work closely Completions with local planning authorities to try and improve the time taken for planning approvals to be gained.
Average visitor levels to sites were below last year as customers made greater use of the internet in the 15,000 initial stages of selecting a new home.
As a result we had a higher quality of customers visiting our sites resulting in good conversion rates.
Average sales rates for the year were 20% ahead of 2005.
12,000 The total number of completions was 13,616, a 13% increase on the prior year 2005: 12,100.

As well as allowing us to manage sales rates and build programmes more effectively we were able to achieve significant volume 6,000 growth.
Volumes in the first half increased by 28% to 5,854 2005: 4,576.

qxp:Layout 1 6 3 07 15:05 Page 24 Business Review UK Housing continued Prices and costs Average selling prices for the year at 175,400 were slightly lower than last year 2005: 178,000.
Private average selling prices at 186,400 also showed little change on a year ago 2005: 188,600 mainly as a result of a change in mix.
The selling prices for affordable homes reduced by 4% to 94,900 2005: 98,600.
Underlying private average selling prices on a per square foot basis have risen by 3%.
Throughout the year the market has remained price sensitive and although the use of incentives has reduced they have continued to be an important selling tool.
We estimate that underlying cost inflation for the industry has been running between 3% and 4%.
Against this backdrop, as a result of our extensive cost reduction programme introduced at the beginning of 2006, we have been able to offset more than the impact of inflation.
Build costs per plot have reduced by 3% over the year.
We have targeted input cost savings of 25 million in 2007 and are confident that the established cost reduction programmes and detailed benchmarking of all aspects of our business will enable us to identify further opportunities as the year progresses.
A key element of our business improvement initiatives and cost reduction programme has been the introduction of a preferred house type range.
This range of PPG3 compliant designs and floorplans has helped to reduce the number of bespoke house types required.
Throughout the year an increasing number of planning applications have been made using these house types.
As the number of these build and cost efficient schemes coming to the development stage increases, we will see further improvements in our cost base whilst continuing to deliver the same high standards of build quality for our customers.

With the average price of a house in the United Kingdom exceeding 185,000 by December 2006, 66% of our homes are priced at 200,000 or below and 84% are below 250,000, the level at which higher rate stamp duty is required.
The proportion of sales accounted for by four and five bedroom homes fell slightly during the year to 30% 2005: 32% with the proportion of apartments rising to 41% 2005: 36%.
The increase in the number of apartments has reduced the average square footage of our homes to 954 sq ft 2005: 994 sq ft.
In recent years, as rapid price inflation has affected the housing market, affordability has become an issue for customers of our smaller products.
During 2006 we established a new value brand, G2, with a product and price range specifically targeted at first time buyers.
After initial trials the first G2 development came Apartments 41% onto the market in Grantham in August.
With one bedroom apartments priced at 59,995 and two 2 3 bed houses 29% bedroom apartments at 85,000 all 60 apartments were sold on the first day.
G2 is a totally new concept 30% 4 5 bed houses for George Wimpey.
These developments are marketed solely via the internet and on site hoardings as there is no sales presence on site.
The sites are much smaller than standard George Wimpey sites and tend to be inner-city, infill brownfield sites.
The G2 business currently holds eight sites and is establishing its own landbank of typically stand alone sites.
Providing local authorities with affordable housing as part of our private developments continues to be a requirement.
In 2006 the number of affordable homes we built increased by 15% to 1,634 but continued to be approximately 12% of our total completions.
In April we were awarded 31.7 million by the Housing Corporation, which represents the largest funding award to a national housebuilder under the Corporations national investment programme.
This grant not only recognises the commitment of the 24 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Completions Business Review WP100 p22-25 vAW1 tp.
qxp:Layout 1 6 3 07 15:05 Page 25 company to provide high quality affordable housing, it also gives us greater control over the financing of these homes.
Quality and customers We continue to deliver industry leading levels of customer service and build on the fact that we were the only volume housebuilder in 2006 to be awarded 4 stars in the two key categories of the HBF Customer Satisfaction Survey.
In our independently monitored customer satisfaction survey, measured as would you recommend George Wimpey to your friends or family?
88% of our customers said they would.
In this years NHBC Pride in the Job awards, 49 George Wimpey site managers received Quality Awards, 14 of whom received Seals of Excellence and two became Regional Winners.
Landbank UK Housing KPI We have committed to improving not only the length of our landbank but also the underlying value of Landbank size plots the plots we hold.
By improving the value of the land we hold we can be certain of delivering steady growth in margins over the next few years.
60,000 Since the end of 2005 we have achieved a 14% increase in the number of plots in the landbank which 50,000 stood at 57,999 plots at the end of 2006 2005: 50,985 plots.
The average number of plots per site acquired during the year was 126, an increase on 94 plots per site in 2005 as we start to increase 40,000 the number of larger medium and long term added value sites we acquire.
30,000 As we entered 2007 we had planning permission on 100% of the plots required for anticipated completions for the year and 40% of those required for 2008 completions.
We currently hold 22,236 plots 20,000 with planning, a significantly stronger position than in recent years 2005: 21,353 plots.
10,000 The average cost per plot in the landbank is 47,300 2005: 46,500, below that of completions in the 0 period of 49,100.
The average plot cost as a percentage of average selling price on completions during 2004 2005 2006 the year was 28.0% 2005: 26.5% and the plot cost as a percentage of the average selling price in the owned landbank is 25.3%, slightly below last year 2005: 26.0%.
This is an excellent position from which to deliver further margin growth during 2007.
UK Housing KPI We changed the way we managed our strategic landbank a few years ago and during the year saw the Landbank quality benefit of those changes starting to come through.
In 2006 we were successful in bringing 4,837 plots cost per plot as a % of ASP into the short term landbank from the strategic landbank with 4,397 coming through in the second half.
30 Of particular note were 1,486 plots from Great Western Park in Didcot and 1,450 plots from Berryfields in Aylesbury, both of which we have been progressing through the planning system since the mid 1990s.
25 Following selective additions during the year, the strategic landbank now stands at 15,846 acres 20 2005: 14,169 acres.
15 Adding value to our landbank For our businesses to deliver consistent returns they need to hold a portfolio of land at different stages 10 in the planning and value chain.
Historically we have held a strong short term landbank however schemes 5 have become more complex and the time spent with planning authorities has been extending.
We therefore need to hold a range of land at different stages in the planning system and we need to look 0 at ways of using our capital more effectively.
2004 2005 2006 Over the next few years we will be seeking to grow our landbank, increasing the mix of medium and long term sites that we hold in our owned and controlled landbank.
The optimum mix we aim to achieve is 40% short term land to be developed within one to two years, 30% medium term land to be developed within two to five years and 30% long term land to be developed within five to ten years.
In addition we will continue to increase our strategic landbank.
Going forward In the UK the housing market has remained healthy during early 2007.
We are confident that the business plans established across our UK business will continue to deliver benefits throughout the year.
With a strong land position, an established cost reduction programme, a record order book position and a stable and experienced management team, we are confident that based on current market conditions, operating margins in George Wimpey UK will exceed 14% in 2007. www.
