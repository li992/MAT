The KPIs we use are likely to evolve as we move through our turnaround plan.
Customer strategy We have reduced the number of customers we serve from 30,000 to 21,000 since November 2005: our aim is to have 18,000 customers by 30 September 2006.
A relatively small proportion of our revenues currently come from IP products.
We envisage the future UK business being focused on 3,000 customers, with 60% of revenues being derived from IP and hosting products.
We have made good progress so far against this objective.
Operating model Our customer strategy enables us to simplify our business and therefore operate with a lower cost base.
We aim to reduce the monthly operating cost run rate by 5 million per month from November 2005 to 30 September 2006.
Progress to the end of March 2006 has already shown a 4.4 million per month reduction.
From an opening position of 5,528, headcount reduced by a net 647 people in the period leading up to the acquisition of Energis.
On 11 November 2005, as part of the acquisition of Energis, a further 1,560 people joined the business.
Since then, as a result of integrating the UK and Energis, a further 827 people have left the business, leaving headcount at 5,614 at 31 March 2006.
We expect to reduce headcount to 5,200 by 30 September 2006.
LLU capability Local loop unbundling is a fundamental part of our UK corporate access strategy, which we will leverage in the future as part of our move to Next Generation and IP networks.
At 31 March 2006 we had unbundled 411 exchanges and expect to have 800 unbundled by 30 September 2006.

26 2005 06 Annual report Customer care As the first full local loop unbundler in the UK we encountered significant challenges during the year as we grew our customer base.
Our provisioning process has now improved dramatically and we are provisioning 88% of customers on time compared with 32% last year.
The average time from order to delivery is now 14 days compared with 22 days last year.
Openreachs process accounts for at least ten of the current 14 days.
During the year, we made a number of changes to our provisioning, customer care and billing processes.
As a result, in October 2005, Ofcom closed the investigation it had launched earlier in the year following a number of customer complaints.
Our improvement in provisioning and support services has halved the level of faults per customer despite the ten-fold increase in customer numbers.
At the same time, we have invested heavily in our ability to resolve customers problems when they do arise and are now resolving more than 90% of faults within five days of them being reported.
