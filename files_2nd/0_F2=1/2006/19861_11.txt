Deep mines property in use has been fully written down.
Provisions Deep mining provisions of 93.5m 2005: 105.6m have been made for all future costs where an obligation exists at the balance sheet date.
Of these provisions, 39.7m 2005: 40.0m are funded by ring-fenced deposits, and 74.4m 2005: 71.3m are expected to fall due after more than one year.
Provisions have been made for: Employer and public liabilities for past insurance-related claims made against the Company of 19.9m 2005: 18.0m.
These are funded by ring-fenced deposits held with our captive insurance company totalling 19.6m 2005: 25.4m Surface damage relating to deep mines activities.
These are funded by secured deposits of 22.7m 2005: 26.8m which are lodged with the Coal Authority and are subject to annual review Restoration and closure costs of deep mines totalling 38.2m 2005: 42.0m.
This includes shaft and pit top restoration provisions of 17.6m 2005: 18.5m for their future treatment, spoil heap care obligations of 4.2m 2005: 5.0m, pumping costs of 6.6m 2005: 9.0m, and provisions to rectify ground or groundwater contamination of 9.8m 2005: 9.5m Redundancy provisions are made for all obligations only if they are announced before the balance sheet date, and amount to 15.6m 2005: 23.6m UK Coal 06 Report 12.3.
07. indd 36 12 3 07 18:50:53 Retirement benefit provisions The Group carries a deficit of 120.4m 2005: 142.3m on its dened benefit pension and retirement schemes held mainly for deep mining.
These comprise two funded industry wide schemes and an unfunded concessionary fuel scheme and are valued annually by independent actuaries applying International Accounting Standard 19 IAS 19.
Movements in the schemes in 2006 are set out below: Pension Concessionary fuel Total m m m 1 January 2006 118.0 24.3 142.3 Employers current service costs 14.2 0.4 14.6 Expected return on assets 20.6 20.6 Interest on deficit 19.9 1.1 21.0 Net actuarial gains 12.5 0.9 11.6 Gains on curtailments 3.0 1.3 4.3 Employers contributions 20.3 0.7 21.0 31 December 2006 95.7 24.7 120.4 Deferred taxation relief 28.3 7.4 35.7 31 December 2006 67.4 17.3 84.7 net deficit including tax asset The pension schemes deficits have reduced by 22.3m and the concessionary fuel deficit has increased by 0.4m.
The main movements are: Net actuarial gains of 11.6m 2005: 14.3m loss arising mainly from higher than expected asset returns.
The gains are reported within reserves in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE Additional payments to the pension and concessionary fuel schemes of 6.4m 2005: 6.5m representing the net difference between employer contributions payments made of 21.0m 2005: 19.8m and the actuarys calculation of the costs of benefits accrued in the year Gains on curtailments of 4.3m 2005: 5.2m as a result of redundancies.
These are reported in the income statement as Exceptional Items Actuarial valuation key assumptions The scheme has been valued under IAS 19 requirements, using the projected unit method and discounting future scheme liabilities on the basis of AA-rated corporate bond yields of over 15 years.
The discount rate net of inflation was 2.0% 2005: 2.0%.
Actuarial assumptions for demographics including life expectancy have been taken from the last triennial valuation available as at 31 December 2003.
The results of changes in assumptions and valuations from the triennial valuation at December 31 2006 are not yet known and are due later in 2007.
The Company will be discussing the 2006 valuation assumptions with the Trustees during 2007 and will consider the extent to which these should be reflected in the IAS 19 valuation results for the next year.

Taxation Deferred taxation assets of 35.7m 2005: nil are now recognised on the balance sheet.
This represents tax relief anticipated to be available from future payments into the pension scheme to reduce the deficit.
The full scale and origin of UK COAL deferred tax assets, recognised and unrecognised in the financial statements, is set out below.
Due to the availability of losses within the Group, there is no current tax charge for the period.
The Group has potential deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2006 of 367.6m gross representing potential future tax savings of 110.3m.
This is made up as follows: Gross m Tax value m Fixed asset timing differences 34.3 10.3 Other timing differences 76.0 22.8 Losses 138.3 41.5 Deferred tax assets not recognised in the financial statements 248.6 74.6 Retirement obligations and deferred tax recognised in the financial statements 119.0 35.7 Total deferred tax assets at 31 December 2006 367.6 110.3 Out of this total an asset, amounting to 35.7m, related to the retirement obligations has been recognised on the balance sheet.
This is on the basis that future profit projections indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
The balance of the deferred tax asset, amounting to 74.6m, has not been recognised in the 2006 financial statements, a position that will be kept under review in the light of profit forecasts.
While this has not been taken on to the balance sheet, it is important to appreciate the extent to which this provides a shelter against tax for future profits.
In effect, the Group has a tax shelter to cover 367m of future profits from the mining business.
The deferred tax assets referred to above are not available to shelter profits from the property business.
However, with regard to the property business, the Group has in excess of 400m of agreed capital losses which can be offset against profits arising on disposals of properties.
It is expected therefore that future disposals of properties can be made tax free.
The capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
These capital losses are sufficient to offset the vast majority of the deferred tax liability which would otherwise be required in respect of the investment properties leaving a small deferred tax liability which has been recognised in the financial statements of 1.2m.
07. indd 38 12 3 07 18:50:54 Deep mining net debt Deep mining net cash balances of 31.1m 2005: 34.8m include insurance and surface damage ringfenced deposits of 42.3m 2005: 52.2m.
Excluding ring-fenced deposits, net debt was 11.2m 2005: 17.4m which comprises mainly finance leases of 11.0m 2005: 14.5m.
Deep mining also has access to Group borrowing facilities as set out under Group net debt below.
SURFACE MINING NET ASSETS Surface mining xed assets of 25.7m 2005: 24.2m include pre-coaling development costs capitalised of 9.7m 2005: 4.1m.
Other xed assets of 16.0m 2005: 20.1m are mainly ground equipment used at active mines as well as mines under restoration.
A small amount of plant is utilised within the deep mines on a hired-out basis.
Restoration provisions are set up to the extent that an obligation exists to restore the land.
At the year end this amounted to 51.7m 2005: 66.4m of which 7.3m 2005: 15.8m is due within one year.
In 2006 surface mining liabilities were reduced by 14.6m 2005: 10.8m, with 11.2m 2005: 10.9m of work carried out restoring and rehabilitating former sites.
Surface mines are funded with 9.3m 2005: 5.0m on borrowings secured on certain of its plant assets, and finance leases.
PROPERTY NET ASSETS Property net assets of 248.1m 2005: 236.0m principally reect the property portfolio valuation net of debt secured against specic properties.
The property valuation at the year end amounted to 343.9m 2005: 274.2m.
Of this 326.3m 2005: 265.4m has been recognised on the balance sheet as investment properties at current market value of 311.7m 2005: 251.2m, or operating properties held at historic cost of 14.6m 2005: 14.2m.
All investment properties and some operating properties are held by the property business.
The Group borrows against the property on a secured basis and at the year end net debt amounted to 62.3m 2005: 19.2m.
HARWORTH POWER NET ASSETS Harworth Power holds 8.3m 2005: 4.6m of xed assets which consist of methane engines located at operating and closed mines.
GROUP NET DEBT The Group borrows against its property and operational assets.
In total across the four business segments this amounted to 145m of borrowing facilities, plus 14m of finance leases.
Borrowing facilities comprise a revolving credit facility of 54m, overdraft facilities of 10m, 73m secured on property and 8m on surface mining plant.
Average maturity of the facilities was 2.2 years 2005: 1.8 years.
Total borrowings of 97.7m 2005: 96.5m were drawn against debt facilities at the year-end, leaving borrowing headroom of 47.3m 2005: 9.0m.
Gearing at the year end has been reduced as a result of increased property asset values recognised on the balance sheet.
The gross debt to equity ratio improved to 40% 2005: 64%.
