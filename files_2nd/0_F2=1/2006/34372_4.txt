Sir Henry Rider Haggard 18561925 Sepia-toned platinotype print, 1902, by George Charles Beresford H Rider Haggard as his title pages proclaimed him was the doyen of adventure writers.
He penned a total of 34 ripping yarns set in such exotic places as Mexico, Iceland and Ancient Egypt.
Right through to the last page, his novels were chock full of action, derring-do and breathless heroism.
Born at Bradenham Hall in Norfolk, he went to South Africa as a young man and later served on official commissions that took him to all parts of the British Empire.
The landscapes and people that he encountered especially in the Dark Continent were his inspiration: a knighthood and a KBE were his reward.
