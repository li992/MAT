All 15th June 2007 unless renewed at the forthcoming other companies were permitted to adopt these AGM.
JPMorgan Fleming Japanese 19 Directors Report continued The Board will seek shareholder approval at the AGM to renew this authority, which will last until 18th June 2008 or until the whole of the 14.99% has been acquired, whichever is the earlier.
Repurchases will be made at the discretion of the Board, and will only be made in the market at prices below the prevailing net asset value per share as and when market conditions are appropriate.
The Directors consider that the renewal of the authority would be in the interests of shareholders as a whole as the repurchase of shares at a discount to their underlying net asset value NAV would enhance the NAV of the remaining shares.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
iii Authority to change the name of the Company resolution 9 The Directors recommend that the Companys name be changed to JPMorgan Japanese Investment Trust plc.
