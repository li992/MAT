Strategy Our strategy SABMiller has grown rapidly from its South African base and assembled a unique portfolio of businesses across five continents.
We remain alert to opportunities to make further acquisitions wherever they can add value to the group.
Our priority, however, is to gain maximum value from our existing businesses by capturing the opportunities presented in both emerging and developed markets and by constantly improving the performance of the group and its component parts.
Our success will depend on the rigorous implementation of four strategic priorities: Creating a balanced and attractive global spread of businesses We have a business portfolio that is balanced geographically and exposes us to markets at different stages of development one that offers long-term growth in the form of new, developing markets while generating cash from profitable, developed markets.
However, we expect global consolidation to continue and we will add to our portfolio of businesses when suitable value enhancing opportunities occur.
Developing strong, relevant brand portfolios in the local market By understanding the trends and preferences within each market, we have developed and continue to develop attractive brand portfolios that meet local consumer needs on a range of different occasions and which appeal to their specific tastes.
Constantly raising the performance of local businesses Good operational performance has always been a SABMiller strength, but one we know our competitors can replicate.
While operational standards are already high, we continue to push them higher in every part of the group in order to keep ahead of the rest of the industry.
Leveraging our global scale Where something is done well within the group, we ensure that all our businesses learn and apply the lessons.
This way, each operation benefits to the fullest extent from the skills, resources and experience of SABMiller as a whole.
