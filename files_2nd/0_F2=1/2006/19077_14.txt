Section 89 of the Act gives all shareholders the right to participate on a pro rata basis in all issues of equity shares for cash, unless they agree that this right should be excluded.
The effect of Resolution 9, which is proposed as a special resolution, is to give the Directors authority until the date of the next Annual General Meeting, firstly, to carry out a rights issue without having to comply with the detailed requirements of Section 89 and Section 90 of the Act and, secondly, to allot equity shares for cash otherwise than by an issue pro rata to existing shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,013,879, which represents 5 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of this report.
