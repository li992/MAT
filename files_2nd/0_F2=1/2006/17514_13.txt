Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 | 69 Operations The highlight of the 2006 financial year has been the acquisition and XCu integration of the Tintaya and Falconbridge copper assets within the Xstrata copper Copper business unit, contributing 74% or $2.7 billion to the business units EBIT growth of $3.6 billion for the year.
Pro forma average cash costs C1 for the combined copper businesses were particularly impressive, showing a reduction from 57.6 per pound to 57.2 per pound over the corresponding period.
The benefits of a favourable mix of byproduct credits and lower realisation costs helped to offset an increase in costs related to mining industry inflation.
This mining sector inflation continued to exceed CPI inflation during the year, with Xstrata Coppers mined copper significant pressures being experienced in production more than doubled the areas of labour, contractors, fuel and Copper cathode production at CCR refinery to over one million tonnes in Canada energy.
