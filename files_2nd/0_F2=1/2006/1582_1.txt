Dear Autonomy Investor, 2006 was an extraordinary year for Autonomy in every sense, and it is my great pleasure to present to you our results from another excellent year.
During 2006 Autonomy firmly established itself as the market number one, outpacing all others with leading revenue growth, profits, R&D investment, customers, employees, cash generation and market position.
Our growth and expansion has always been driven by the goal of establishing Autonomy as the key infrastructure for the automated handling of all forms of unstructured information such as text, audio and video.
Following this unwavering goal we have achieved sales success and proven our profitable business model, and have created a special software company which is leading the market.
In 2006 we produced record results in every area, which is enabling us to build on our position.
In this letter let me recap for you our successes during 2006, as well as comment on some of the trends we saw in our business during the year.
Financial Results: In 2006 revenues, operating profits, profit before tax and EPS all soared from our previous records in 2005, driven by a combination of strong organic growth and our strategic acquisitions in 2005.
Autonomys growth continues to outperform the sector despite our ongoing significant investment in research and development for the future.
2006 achievements included: Record revenues, up 161% from 2005, with strong organic growth and full year impact of acquisitions Profit from operations up 529% from 2005 Net profit up 337% from 2005 R&D investment up 136% year-on-year Cemented Autonomys position as the industry leader Strong positive cash flow throughout 2006, generating $46.9m of cash from operations in 2006 2005: $17.7m Cash balance of $121.1m at year end Received outstanding achievement award from the London Stock Exchange for our acquisition of Verity More than 50 OEM deals, including new and extended agreements with HP, IBM, Oracle and EMC Share price up 31% during 2006, outpacing the FTSE100 and FTSE250 and following a 163% rise in 2005 Accolades: Throughout 2006 Autonomy was recognized by industry analysts as the unmatched market leader.

Our strong R&D investment throughout the downturn, including an increase in R&D spend in 2006 of 136% from 2005, is seeing clear returns.
2006 saw significant Autonomy product developments, with the continued development of industry-leading new technologies, including IDOL 7.0, a major upgrade of our award-winning core product, and the launch of new divisional applications.
The results of our investment can also be seen in the continued success of our vertical divisions, including: Aungate, Autonomys awardwinning division specializing in compliance, litigation and risk technology: etalk, a leading provider of next-generation contact center technology: Virage, a leading provider of security and surveillance software and rich media content management software: and Cardiff, a leading provider of business process management software.
Each of these divisions is founded on Autonomys unique Intelligent Data Operating Layer, our core infrastructure for automating the handling of all forms of unstructured and structured information.
The business value of Autonomys infrastructure technology and its demonstrable ROI are ultimately borne out by our average selling price, which rose throughout 2006 to reach $380,000 in the fourth quarter.
The net result of all of the activity in 2006 was clearly reflected in Autonomys share price, up 31% during 2006, following Autonomys performance as the best performing stock in the FTSE250 in 2005.
Our two year performance is in the graph below: 420 380 340 300 260 220 180 140 100 60 20 01-Jan-05 01-Jul-05 01-Jan-06 01-Jul-06 01-Jan-07 Autonomy FTSE 350 Acquisitions: I am pleased to report that our acquisitions during 2005 have delivered significant results, following rapid and successful integrations.
The combination of Autonomy and Verity created the unmatched leader in the space.
Autonomy was awarded the Achievement of the Year Award 2006 at the techMARK Awards for the success of the acquisition.
The techMARK Awards, organized by the London Stock Exchange, are designed to reward outstanding achievement in the technology market.
The acquisition of etalk Corporation in 2005 further extended the adoption of Autonomys IDOL infrastructure into the contact center market.
Trends: In 2006 we saw a continuation of the trend towards corporate standardization.
Leading organizations continue to realize that their strategy for handling unstructured information is as fundamental as their decisions about the database.
Just as they may have made a decision to standardize on Oracle or SAP companies now standardize the handling of unstructured information and are choosing Autonomy to do it.
In this regard, I am pleased to note that a series of companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Bloomberg and Shell have all standardized on Autonomy.
The last few years have continued to see explosive growth in the use of unstructured information, which includes documents, emails, telephone conversations and multimedia.
More than 85% of all information inside an enterprise is now unstructured and this 'humanfriendly' information has traditionally been difficult for computers to understand and use.
As always, our position in the market is underpinned by our unique value proposition: to provide the software infrastructure that automates operations on all forms of information.
The unique nature of our technology delivers the only platform truly built around Meaning Based Computing, enabling computers to understand the relationships that exist between disparate pieces of information and perform sophisticated analysis operations with real business value, automatically and in real-time.
Through the understanding of information Autonomy empowers organizations to understand and capitalize on the information that really matters to their business by enabling computers to process human-friendly unstructured information, such as text documents, emails, voice and video, without the need for manual intervention.
The net result of a strong 2006 and our continued investments in research and development and people means we remain well placed operationally and financially to drive continued growth again in 2007.
I take this opportunity to thank once again our customers, shareholders, employees and partners for their continued support.
