From modest beginnings he rose without trace and suddenly his International Stores were everywhere 200 branches by 1890 alone.
His secret was buying direct from the producers and selling under his own brand label, much as the Co-operative Movement had done fifty years earlier.
The Grocer King was no socialist, however, and he was long remembered in Londons East End for the ruthlessness with which, as Chairman of the Port of London Authority, he broke the dockers strike of 1912.
After a decent interval, a grateful nation rewarded him with a Viscountcy in 1917.
