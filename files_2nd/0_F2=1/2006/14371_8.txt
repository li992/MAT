BUSINESS OVERVIEW Smith & Nephews operations are organised into four business units that operate globally: reconstruction, trauma and clinical therapies, endoscopy and advanced wound management.
Smith & Nephew believes that its businesses have the opportunities for strong growth due to its markets benefiting from an ageing population, an increase inactive lifestyles and trends toward less invasive medical procedures.
This is done by adjusting for the impact both of sales of products acquired in business combinations in the current year and the prior year, and of movements in exchange rates.
The Groups management uses this non-GAAP measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performanceonboth a business segment and a consolidated Group basis.
Underlying growth in revenue reconciles to growth in revenue reported in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the constant currency exchange effect and the acquisitions effect, described below.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure is that it excludes certain factors, described above, which 28 do ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues.
The Group measures the performance of local managers using underlying growth in revenue whilst the Groups management additionally considers GAAP revenue each quarter and further assesses the excluded items by monitoringagainst internalbudget amounts The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales.
This is measured as the difference between the increase in revenue translated into US Dollars on a GAAP basis i. e. current year revenue translated at the current year average rate, prior year revenue translated at the prior year average rate and the increase measured by translating currentyear revenue intoUS Dollars usingthe prioryear average rate.
The acquisitions effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired business combinations.
This is calculated by excluding the revenue from sales of products acquired as a result of a business combination consummated in the current year, with non-US Dollar sales translated at the prior year average rate.
Additionally, prior year revenue is adjusted to include a full year of revenue from the sales of products acquired in those business combinations consummated in the previous year, calculated by adding back revenue from sales of products in the period prior to the Groups ownership.
These sales are separately tracked in the Groups internal reportingsystems and are readily identifiable.

Smith & Nephews principal geographic markets are in the well-developed healthcare economiesof the US, Europe, Japan and Australia.
These markets are characterised by an increase in the average age of the population caused by the immediate post-World War II baby boomer generation approaching retirement, increased longevity, more active lifestyles, obesity and increased affluence.
Together these factors have created significant demand for more effective healthcare products which deliver improved outcomes through technology advances.
Furthermore pressure to resist increases in overall healthcare spending has led healthcare providers to demand products which minimise the length of hospital stays and the use of surgeonand nursingresources.
A recent trend has been increasing consumer awareness of available healthcare treatments through the Internet and .
29 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects In reconstruction, improvements in technology have lengthened the effective life of implants and have facilitated the implantation of knees and hips in relatively young patients thereby improving the quality of life for a new generation.
Management believes that the creation of separate global business units in 2006 for reconstruction and trauma and clinical therapies has increased focus and resulted in increased revenue growth for both businesses.
The endoscopy business is benefiting from the continued trend worldwide towards less invasive surgery but with particular focus on arthrosopic repair of the knee and shoulder using a broad range of technology.
The Group also expects to benefit from the demand for less invasive approaches to spinal disc repair and arthroscopic hip repair.
The advanced wound management business is focused on the treatment of chronic wounds of the older population and other hard-to-heal wounds such as burns and certain surgical wounds and is therefore also expected to benefit from demographic trends.
The market for advanced wound treatments is relatively unpenetrated and it is estimated that the potential market is significantly larger than the current market.
This increased penetration is expected to be driven by improved outcomes from new technology, health economic benefits, increasing nursing shortages, quality of life expectations and education of healthcare providers to convertfrom traditional to advanced treatments.
In order to take advantage of the expanding markets the Group must continually develop its existing and new technologies and bring new products to its customers.
Expenditure on research and development in 2006 represented 4% of Group turnover and products launched within the last three years represented 20% of Group turnover.
Currency Movements Smith & Nephews results of operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from revenue in a currency different from the related costs and expenses.
The Group attempts to manage the impact of exchange rate movements on cost of goods sold by a policy of purchasing forward all its foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed.
In addition, businesses are required to purchase forward a minimum of 50% of their forecast foreign currency requirements on a twelve-month rolling basis.
The Groups revenues, profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes.
This exposure is offset partly because the Group incurs interest in currencies other than US Dollars on its indebtness denominated incurrenciesother than US Dollars.
See FinancialPosition, Liquidityand Capital Resources.
Other Other than national governments seeking to control or reduce healthcare expenditure, see Risk Factors Reimbursement management is not aware of any governmental economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have materially affected, directly or indirectly, the Groups operations or investments by shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies The Groups significant accounting policies, and those elective exemptions taken by the Group on the adoption of IFRS in accordance with IFRS1, are set out in Note 2 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
Of those the policies whichrequirethe most use of managements judgment are as follows: Inventories A feature of the reconstruction and trauma businesses whose finished goods inventory makes up 54% of the Group total finished goods stock is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to reconstruction and trauma inventory to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage.
This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience, but it does involve management judgements on effectiveness of inventory deployment, length of productlives, phase-out of old products and efficiencyof .
30 Impairment In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible and tangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ or changes inexpectations arise impairmentcharges may be required whichwouldadversely impact operating results.
Retirement Benefits A number of key judgements have to be made in calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the Balance Sheet liability, trading profit and finance income.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
For example a 1% increase in discount rate would reduce the combined UK and US pension plan deficit by $155m whilst a 1% decrease would increase the combined deficit by $193m.
A 1% increase in discount rate would decrease profit before taxation by $3m whilst a 1% decrease would increase it by $1m.
A one year increase in the longevity of a 60 year old male pension plan member in both the UK and US would increase the combined deficit by $33m.
In making these judgements, management takes into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarksits assumptions against external data.
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
The Group selects its discount rate by benchmarking against published indices and by consultation with its actuaries.
The principal index used for benchmarking is the iBOXX Corporate AA index for bonds with terms consistent withthe estimated defined benefit payments.
See Note 33 of the Notes to the Group Accounts for a summary of how the assumptions selected inthe last three years have compared withactual results.
Contingenciesand Provisions The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcome will occurand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcomeof courtproceedingsand settlement negotiationsorif investigations bringto light new facts.
The estimation of the liability for the costs of the macrotextured product withdrawal for which coverage has been declined is dependent upon two main variables.
These are, the number of implant revisions that will ultimately be required and the average cost of settlements with patients.
 double the current estimate the cost would increase by approximately $20m.
If the average cost of settlement of the %$8m.
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.
Although it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take several years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amountof any tax chargemanagement takes intoaccountthe views of internaland external advisors and updates the amount of provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
2006YEAR The following discussion and analysis is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the Group Accounts of Smith & Nephew included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The Groups Accounts are prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted in the EU, which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Reconciliations reflecting the effect of the significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP are set forth in Note 40 of Notes to the Group Accounts.
Financial Highlightsof 2006 Group revenue was $2,779m for the year ended 31 December 2006, representing 9% growthcompared to 2005.
31 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects Profit before taxation was $550m, compared with $428m in 2005.
Attributable profit was $745m compared with $333m in 2005.
Adjusted attributable profit calculated as set out in Selected Financial Data, rose 7% to $425m from $397m.
Basic earnings per Ordinary Share were 79.2, a 123% increase compared to 35.5 for 2005.
EPSA as set out in Selected Financial Data was 45.2 compared to 42.3 for 2005, representing a 7% increase.
The loss of earnings from the divested BSN joint venture, net of interest income on the proceeds, reduced growth in EPSA by an estimated 3%, whilst losses, integration costs and interest expense arising from the acquisition of OBI reduced growth by a further 1%.
The loss of favourable interest rate differentials between US Dollar borrowings and Sterling cash deposits in2005 further diluted earningsby 3%.
ii In 2005 includes $53m ofrestructuring and .
iii In 2005 includes $7m ofrestructuring and .
iv In 2006 includes $20m of bid related costs and $14m of amortisation of acquisition intangibles 2005 $24m of restructuring and  and $11m  intangibles.
v Items detailed in ii, iii and iv are excluded fromthe calculation oftrading profit.
Transactional and Translational Exchange The Groups principal markets outside the US are, in order of importance, Europe, UK, Australia and Japan, and revenues in these markets fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on consolidation.
During the year the average rates of exchange against the US Dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro strengthened from $1.24 to $1.27 2% : the pound Sterling strengthened from $1.81 to $1.86 3% : the Australian dollar was unchanged at $0.76: and the Japanese yen weakened from 111 to 116 - 4%.
The Groups principal manufacturing locations are in the US reconstruction, trauma and endoscopy and in the UK advanced wound management.
The Groups selling and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase finished products from these locations in their local currencies whichare principally those outlined in the previous paragraph.
As a result of currency movements compared with the previous year purchases from the US became relatively cheaper whilst purchases from the UK became more expensive.
The groups policy of purchasing forward a proportion of its currency requirements mitigated the impact of these movements to some extent.
Overall there was a broadly neutral impact ontrading profit and trading margincompared withthe previous year.
32 Revenue Group revenue increased by $227m 9% to $2,779m from $2,552m.
Underlying revenue growth was 8% and favourable currency translation, reflecting the strength of the pound Sterling and Euro relative to the US Dollar, added 1%.
Reconstruction revenues increased by $90m or 11% of which 10% was underlying growth and 1% was due to favourable currency translation.
Trauma and clinical therapies revenues increased by $59m or 13% all of which was underlyinggrowth.
Endoscopy revenues increased by $59m or 10%, of which9% was underlyinggrowthand 1% was due to favourable currency translation.
Advanced wound management revenues increased by $19m or 3%, of which1% was underlyinggrowthand 2% due to favourable currencytranslation.
A more detailed analysis is included within the Revenue sections of the individual business segments that follow onpages 35-37.
The Groups sales force, which includes independent commissioned sales agents, increased by 5% to 3,292 during 2006.
Reconstruction increased by 2%, trauma and clinical therapies by 15%, endoscopy by 4% and advanced woundmanagement by 2%.
Cost of goodssold Cost of goods sold at $769m increased by $15m from $754m in 2005, which included $53m of restructuring and rationalisation costs related to the closure of the endoscopy factory and exit from tissue engineering.
Other movements were an improvement of $14m following the exit from tissue engineering and an additional charge of $10m due to an increase in inventory provisions.
Adjusting for these factors cost of goods sold grew broadly in linewithrevenue.
Further margin analysis is included within the Trading Profit sections of the individual business segments that followonpages 35-37.
Marketing, sellingand distribution expenses These expenses increased by $101m to $1,092m from $991m in 2005 which included $7m of restructuring and rationalisation costs.
The increase was principally due to increases in selling and marketing costs in reconstruction in support of three major product launches in the year, the LEGION and JOURNEY knees and the BHR inthe US and headcountadditions inendoscopyto accelerate revenue growth.
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses were $4m lowerthan in2005.
Costs of $20m, relating to the failed bid to acquireBiomet Inc. are included.
In 2005, $24m of restructuring and rationalisation costs were incurred in impairing the intangible assets of the tissue engineering business which was to be exited.
In 2006 the charge for amortisation of acquisition intangible assets was $14m and in 2005, $11m, with the increase largely attributable to the acquisition of OBI.
Expenses decreased by $3m which was due to effective expense management in reconstructionand a reductioninthe Groups insurancecosts.
Research and Developmentexpenses Expenditure as a percentage of revenue fell from 4.8% to 4.3% caused by sales leverage as expenses were held flat.
The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate itself from competitors and, in2006, 20% of the Groups revenue was from products introducedinthe last three years.
BSN Medical agency and management fees Agency and management fees of $25m were received in respect of services provided to BSN Medical for sales force resource, physical distribution and logistics and administration in certain countries.
The calculation of the fees is designed to result in a neutral, cost-recovery position for Smith & Nephew and is intended to be for a transitional period only.
Fees were lower than 2005 by $2m due to a further reduction in the number of shared service agreements somewhat offset by a small translation benefit from the strengthening of the Euro against the US Dollar.
Operating profit Operating profit increased by $115m to $537m compared with $422m in 2005, comprising increases of $4m in reconstruction, $11m in trauma and clinical therapies, $14m in endoscopy and $86m in advanced wound management.
33 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects Net interest receivable The receipt of proceeds from the BSN Medical disposal enabled borrowings to be repaid in 2006 whilst the change to US Dollar reporting and functional currency resulted in the repayment from cash balances of borrowings used for net asset hedging.
Overall net interest receivable moved favourably by $1m from $9m to $10m.
Interest income fell by $8m from $27m in 2005 to $19m in 2006.
Net interest income benefited by $26m from the proceeds of the disposal of BSN Medical but suffered by $20m from the loss of favourable interest rate differentials between US Dollar borrowings and Sterling cash deposits received in 2005.
Interest on the cost of OBI was $2m.
Other finance income costs Income of $6m compares with expense of $5m in 2005 with the improvement due to the increase in defined benefit pension plan assets created by special funding contributions in 2005, further funding payments in 2006 and highermarket values.
Loss gain on the hedgeof the sale proceedsof the joint venture A financial instrument was purchased in December 2005 to hedge the anticipated proceeds of the BSN Medical disposal from Euros into US Dollars.
This matured in 2006 on completion of the disposal of the joint venture resulting ina loss of $3m compared witha fair value gainrecognisedin2005 of $2m.
Taxation The taxation charge rose by $30m to $156m in 2006.
The effective rate of tax before discontinued operations was 28.9%, compared with 29.3% in 2005.
The taxation charge was reduced in 2006 by $6m as a consequence of the taxation benefit on bid related costs and in 2005 by $29m as a consequence of the restructuring and .
Discontinued operations net profit on disposal of the Joint Venture On 23 February 2006 the Group sold its 50% interest in the BSN Medical joint venture for cash consideration of $562m.
The net profit of $351m on the disposal of the joint venture is after a credit of $14m for cumulative translation adjustments, charges of $27m for transaction and associated costs, provision for indemnity of $3m and a credit from the release of unutilisedtaxation provisionsof $23m.
Intangible assets increased by $158m of which $81m related to the acquisition of OBI, $61m came from additions to other intangibles and currency translation added $35m.
Amortisation reduced the balance by $24m.
Property, plant and equipment increased by $46m comprisingadditions of $170m, currencytranslation of $30m less depreciation of $142m and net bookvalue of disposals of $12m.
$195m of this increase was as a result of cash and bank balances increasing as a consequence of selling the BSN Medical joint venture for net cash proceeds of $562m the balance was used to reduce long-term borrowings within  and borrowings within current liabilities.
Translational exchange on inventories and receivables added $50m.
The remaining increase in current assets was as a result of an increase in inventories of 7% and an increase in receivables of 10% whichreflect the 9% increase inGroup revenue.
34 The investment in joint venture BSN Medical that was held for sale at the end of 2005 was sold on 23 February 2006.
$196m of this decrease was as a result of long-term borrowings decreasing as a consequence of selling the BSN Medical joint venture.
The retirement benefit obligation decreased by $52m principally as a result of funding payments of $26m, actuarial gains of $30m less exchange translation of $10m.
Provisions decreased by $14m due to lower macrotextured liabilityprovisions.
Current liabilities decreased by $196m from $1,012m in 2005 to $816m in 2006.
$42m of this decrease was as a result of net utilisation of provisions relating to the macrotextured claim and restructuring and rationalisation.
$108m of this decrease was as a result of borrowings decreasing as a consequence of selling the BSN Medical joint venture.
Total equity increased by $739m from $1,435m in 2005 to $2,174m in 2006 principally from $745m of attributable profit, $59m of translational exchange and $30m of actuarial gains on retirement benefit obligations less $96m of equity dividends paid inthe year.
The principal factors in the underlying growth in revenue were the growth in the global orthopaedic reconstruction market which was estimated to be 8% in the year and the launch of new products inthe US.
35 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects In the US, revenue increased by $44m to $514m 9% all of which was underlying growth.
The main factor was the launch of the LEGION knee in mid 2005 and the JOURNEY knee and BHR in 2006.
These new products contributed$45m of incrementalrevenue.
Outside the US, revenue increased by $46m to $405m 13%, of which 12% was underlying growth and 1% due to foreign currency translation.
Japan revenue grew by 24% of which 30% was underlying growth and 6% unfavourable currency translation.
The main driver was the full year effect of the enlarged sales force following the acquisition of Leading Medical in 2005 which enhanced market coverage in Japan.
Revenue growth in Europe was 11% of which8% was underlyinggrowthand 3% favourable currencytranslation.
Global knee revenue increased by $55m 11% to $509m, of which 1% was due to foreign currency translation and 12% was underlying growth.
This compares with the estimated global market growth of 8%.
Global hip revenue increased by $35m to $378m 10% all of which was due to underlying growth.
The global hip market grew by an estimated 6%.
Growth in other reconstruction products, mainly shoulder implants and cement was flat.
Products broughtto market inthe last three years comprised16% 2005 16% of revenues.
Trading Profit Trading profit rose by $27m 13% from $206m in 2005 to $233m in 2006.
This resulted in an increase in trading margin from 24.8% to 25.4%.
The principal factors were sales leverage of administration and research and development expenses partly offset by new productlaunchand support costs and .
Operating Profit Operating profit increased by $4m of which $27m was trading profit less $20m due to the bid related costs in 2006 and $3m due to an increase inthe chargefor amortisationof .
Trauma and Clinical Therapies Revenue Revenue increased by $59m, or 13% all of which was underlying growth.
The translational impact of currency in this business is less than in others since it has a higher proportion of revenues arising within the US.
Growth in fixation products was 9%, all of which was underlying growth.
Growth in clinical therapies was 23%, all of which was underlying growth of which 1% came from the sales of DUROLANE hyaluronic acid product outside the US, the rights to whichwere acquiredinJune 2006.
In the US, revenue increased by $41m to $357m representing 13% growth.
The main contributory factor in the underlying growth rate was 20% growth in clinical therapies.
The US market for joint fluid therapy products is believed to have grown by 12% in 2006 whilst SUPARTZ revenues grew by 21%.
The US market for long bone stimulation products is estimated to have grown by 5% during the year whilst EXOGEN revenues grew by 19%.
These market share gains are believed to result from continuing additions to the US clinical therapies sales force.
Fixation revenue growth was 8% all of which came from the continued growth of the PERI-LOC compression plate system, launched in 2005, and from the launch of the INTERTAN nail but this was lower than the estimated market growthof 14% Outside the US, revenue increased by $18m to $140m 15% all of whichwas underlyinggrowth.
Revenue growth was driven by market growthand by DUROLANE whichrepresented 2% of growth.
Products broughtto market inthe last three years comprised26% 2005 19% of revenues.
Trading Profit Trading profit rose by $11m 12% from $90m in 2005 to $101m in 2006 resulting in a trading profit margin decrease from 20.5% to 20.3%.
This was due to additional investment in selling and marketing resource following  to positionthe business for enhancedfuture revenue growth.
Operating Profit Operating profit increased by $11m all of whichwas trading profit.
36 Endoscopy Revenue Endoscopy revenue increased by $59m, or 10%, to $665m, comprising 1% favourable currency translation and 9% underlying growth.
The global arthroscopy market is estimated to have grown 9% in the year.
In the US, revenue increased by $25m to $355m 8%, of which 7% was underlying growth and 1% due to the acquisition of OBI inJuly 2006.
In the US the main driver of growth was the knee and shoulder repair sector at 23% due to market sector growth and new products, and Digital Operating Room revenue which grew 31% due to additions to the sales force.
Resection revenues grew 2%, in line with the trend of recent years and visualisation products declined by 7% as customers anticipate the release of the new HD660camera in2007.
Outside the US, revenue increased by $34m to $310m 12%, of which 11% was underlying growth and 1% due to favourable .
Global revenue of knee and shoulder repair products increased by $39m to $220m 22%, of which 19% was underlying growth, 1% due to foreign currency translation and 2% due to the OBI acquisition.
Revenue in the global resection products sector increased by $9m to $245m 4%, of which 3% was underlying growth and 1% due to foreign currency translation.
Global visualisation and Digital Operating Room revenue increased by $7m to $127m 6%, of which5% was underlyinggrowthand 1% was due to favourable currency.
Products broughtto market withinthe last three years comprised28% 2005 24% of total revenue.
Trading Profit Trading profit fell by $2m 2% from $125m in 2005 to $123m in 2006 resulting in a trading profit margin decline from 20.6% to 18.5%.
This was due to higher inventory write-offs 0.8% points, losses and integration costs of OBI 0.6% points and additional investment in the sales force for Digital Operating Room equipment in order to gainmarket share inthe US.
Operating Profit Operating profit increased by $14m of which $16m was due to the restructuring and rationalisation expenses in 2005 less the $2m reductionintrading profit.
Advanced Wound Management Revenue Revenue increased by $19m, or 3%, to $698m, comprising2% favourable currencytranslation and 1% underlying growth.
Compared with 2005, $20m of tissue engineering revenues were lost following the exit from the business, representing 3% of total revenues.
In the US, revenue decreased by $5m to $139m 3%, of which $17m was due to the loss of tissue engineering revenues.
Outside the US, revenue increased by $24m to $559m 4%, of which 2% was underlying growth and 2% due to foreign currency translation.
Continental Europe revenue increased by 4% of which 2% was favourable currency translation and underlying growth was 2%.
Revenues in the UK increased by 2% of which 2% represented favourable currency translation.
Underlying growth was flat caused by funding constraints which reduced purchases by the NHS, the Groups largest customer.
Similar funding constraints in the German market resulted in a revenue reduction of 4% of which 6% was an underlying reduction and 2% favourable currency translation.
Growth in Japan was 6% of which 11% was underlying growth and 5% unfavourable currency translation.
Products broughtto market withinthe last three years comprised13% 2005 14% of total revenue.
Trading Profit Trading profit rose by $18m 19% from $96m in 2005 to $114m in 2006.

Transactional and Translational Exchange The Groups principal markets outside the US are, in order of importance, Europe, UK, Australia and Japan and revenues in these markets fluctuate when translated into US dollars on consolidation.
During the year the average rates of exchange against the US dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro weakened from $1.25 to $1.24 -1% : the pound Sterling weakened from $1.84 to $1.81 -2% : the Australian dollar strengthened from $0.74 to $0.76 3% : and the  -3%.
The Groups policy of purchasing forward a proportion of its currency requirements mitigated the impact of these movements to some extent.
38 Revenue For the year ended 31 December 2005 Group revenue increased by $251m 11% to $2,552m from $2,301m.
Underlyingrevenue growthwas 11% and there was noimpact from translation of foreigncurrency.
Reconstruction revenues increased by $107m or 15% of which 14% was underlying growth and 1% arose from the full year effect of the revenues of MMT, compared with nine months in the previous year.
Trauma and clinical therapies revenues increased by $75m or 20% all of which was underlying growth.
Endoscopy revenues increased by $44m or 8% which comprised underlying growth.
Advanced wound management revenues increased by $25m or4% .
A more detailed analysis is included within the Revenue sections of the individual business segments that follow onpages 40-43.
The Groups sales force, which includes independent commissioned sales agents, increased by 10% to 3,140 during 2005.
The biggest increase was 21% in reconstruction and trauma and clinical therapies where the most significant increase was in the US.
The size of the endoscopy sales force increased by 4% whereas the advanced woundmanagement sales force was broadly unchanged.
Cost of goodssold Cost of goods sold at $754m, increased by $90m, compared to 2004.
This included a charge of $53m for the costs of exiting tissue engineering and the closure of the Andover, Massachusetts endoscopy manufacturing facility.
Adjusting for this factor cost of goods sold increased by $37m compared to 2004.
The main factor in this improvement was the 0.7% margin effect of business mix caused by the higher rate of revenue growth of , comparedwiththelower growth rates of endoscopy and advanced wound management.
