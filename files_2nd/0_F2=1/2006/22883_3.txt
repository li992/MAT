209183 Absolute pp01-pp17 4 5 07 14:00 Page 3 Managers Report The following provides an overview of the performance in US dollar terms of Dexion Absolutes investments by hedge fund strategy in 2006 performance is shown net of underlying managers fees and expenses only.
Long Short Equities Long short equities, the largest strategy allocation in the Companys portfolio, returned 12.7% in 2006.
Following a strong start to the year, managers were impacted by a sharp downturn in global equity markets and surrendered a portion of their first quarter gains during the second quarter.
In the second half of 2006, managers regained their footing and generated the majority of their returns during the year in this period.
Many managers produced alpha in both their long and short equity positions, and each of the subgroups was profitable.
Non-US equity markets outperformed the US equity markets throughout 2006, allowing the Companys geographic specialists to deliver outsized contributions to performance.
Strong M&A activity added fuel to European markets in 2006.
In the region, financial services longs were a notable source of profits throughout the entire year, while positions in mining companies and UK tenanted pubs also added to returns.
Elsewhere, the Companys Asian specialist produced a considerable return in 2006, as did a global ex-US manager, who captured gains from long positions in diverse geographic regions, such as Latin America, Asia, and Europe.
While generalist and sector specialist managers produced positive performance during the year, their returns lagged their non-US counterparts.
These managers extracted gains from long positions in the financial services, healthcare, technology, and transportation sectors.
The sharp volatility in energy markets during much of 2006, but particularly in the second quarter, led to mixed results for the Companys managers active in that sector.
Fundamental Opportunistic The fundamental opportunistic strategy generated a 10.9% return for 2006.
An ongoing abundance of corporate transaction activity, including share repurchases, mergers, acquisitions, hostile takeovers and restructurings, provided a range of profitable trading opportunities in both the US and Europe.
Several hostile takeover attempts led to escalating bidding wars, benefiting the Companys managers long positions in the acquisition targets.
For instance, manager holdings across several international natural resource companies were well-rewarded as those names became subject to lengthy bidding wars.
Elsewhere, spin-off activity initiated by successful corporate activism and deep value plays in a number of turnaround situations also added to manager returns.
Corporate restructuring positions in select retail companies were similarly profitable as reports of robust revenues and share repurchase plans drove valuations higher.
Long Short Credit Despite narrow credit spreads and a rising US interest-rate environment, the Companys long short credit managers delivered a strong return of 18.0% for the year.
Impressively, the strategy produced positive performance in each quarter.
A leading contributor to performance throughout the year was managers exposure to US and European power generators, as the global demand for energy persisted, lifting valuations higher.
Several managers extracted returns from positions in a bankrupt energy company that continued to liquidate assets to satisfy creditors and meet regulatory obligations.
Holdings in distressed airlines involved in operational restructurings also added to returns throughout much of the year.
Favourable news highlighting progress in the reorganisation of certain carriers was well received by the markets, and one airlines emergence from bankruptcy earlier in the year rewarded investors holding that companys securities.
During the latter part of 2006, these positions experienced marked appreciation as falling energy prices, increasing capacity utilisation, and news of industry consolidations propelled gains across the airline industry.
In one of the most difficult years ever for US auto manufacturing, managers investments in a number of distressed auto-related companies proved lucrative as favourable developments resulted in higher security valuations.
3 209183 Absolute pp01-pp17 4 5 07 14:00 Page 4 Managers Report continued Macro In a mixed year for macro trading, the strategy ended 2006 with a positive return of 7.7%.
Managers started auspiciously with one particular manager delivering a substantial return after taking advantage of the strength in metals prices, especially copper and steel, in both the underlying commodities and in the equities of companies involved in their production.
Another manager reaped large gains from fixed income trading, specifically in directional yield curve positions in the US, Europe, and Japan.
The middle portion of 2006 proved much less accommodating for the strategy.
Surprisingly benign growth and inflation figures in the US and abroad led to a difficult environment for the Companys managers, who were positioned for an economic slowdown.
Losses were reported in commodities, foreign exchange, and fixed income trading during this period.
Fortunately, the strategy staged a strong recovery at the end of the year to finish solidly in the black.
In the fourth quarter, managers captured gains as a result of a sell-off in the dollar, the European Central Bank and Bank of England holding firmly to their rate increase plans, sharp volatility in base and precious metals, and robust performance in emerging market equities and debt.
Activist The activist strategy posted a 19.8% gain during 2006.
Amid a flurry of favourable company-specific developments during the year, the strategy continued its run of delivering robust, idiosyncratic returns.
The Companys managers achieved these results with less correlation to the equity markets than one may expect given the inherently long-biased orientation of their portfolios.
In the second quarter, for example, the strategy posted a gain amid a sharp drawdown in most US and non-US equity markets.
Highlighting some examples of the Companys managers value creation, a position in a manufacturer and marketer of processed foods contributed to returns after one manager championed a plan to enhance shareholder value through cost reductions, increased share repurchases, and refocusing management on the companys core brands.
Another position, shared by two of the Companys managers, in a South Korean tobacco company also contributed to returns.
Actions taken by these managers to reshape the firm included making a tender offer for the company and eventually securing a seat on the companys board.
A couple of managers also waged high-profile proxy battles during the year, leading to the acquisition of seats in corporate boardrooms, where these activists expect to contribute to unlocking shareholder value by bringing to bear their operational expertise, financial sophistication, and independence from management influence.
Finally, a Scandinavian-focused manager added to the portfolio during 2006 has demonstrated early signs of success implementing an activist strategy in that region, where the legal and regulatory environment is extremely favourable for the strategy.
Portfolio Hedge Amid a challenging environment for dedicated short selling, the portfolio hedge strategy incurred a loss of -5.6% during 2006.
Adding to the difficulties of the period, managers hefty exposure to the consumer discretionary sector and emphasis on small-cap stocks detracted from performance as these groups outperformed the broader equity markets.
Despite the drawdown, the Companys managers stock selection did add value, and their results exceeded the inverse returns of each of the major US equity market indices.
Underscoring the important role of this hedging strategy in the portfolio, short sellers were especially strong performers in the second quarter, a difficult period for most financial markets and hedge fund strategies.
In spite of the aggregate price increase in managers short positions during 2006, the company-specific, fundamental factors upon which managers have based their decisions have not substantially improved, and managers report that they remain optimistic about the downside potential for their portfolio holdings.
4 209183 Absolute pp01-pp17 4 5 07 14:00 Page 5 Managers Report continued Relative Value Opportunistic Relative value opportunistic gained 26.2% during 2006, a strong return, albeit on a small portion of the Companys portfolio since few managers in the area currently meet the Investment Advisors investment criteria.
Throughout the year, energy and commodities trading contributed to performance as managers captured abundant opportunities emanating from persistent price volatility.
Elsewhere, performance in global convertible bond arbitrage and equity derivative strategies rebounded in 2006 following several years in the doldrums.
Although credit spreads remain at historically tight levels, managers benefited from a stable credit environment and favourable company-specific developments in select distressed situations, particularly in the auto, airline, and energy sectors.
Finally, event-driven and global equity strategies delivered solid results.
These strategies benefited from robust merger activity and a sustained surge in equity prices.
Effective 1st January 2007, the Investment Advisor has combined the Fundamental Opportunistic, Relative Value Opportunistic and Event Driven strategies into Multi-Strategy Opportunistic.
These changes do not represent a change in the underlying investment philosophy or manager selection process.
Outlook for 2007 Dexion Absolute begins 2007 with 791 million of capital allocated to 50 investment managers in six investment strategies.
Looking ahead, the Investment Advisor anticipates that many hedge fund strategies will continue to offer attractive opportunities and believe the Companys portfolio is well-positioned to capture them.
In long short equities, which remains the Companys largest allocation, they continue to be impressed with the abundance of talent in the sector.
The Companys long short equities managers employ uniquely different approaches across a range of sectors, market caps, and geographies, which should serve the strategy well in navigating any equity market environment in the months ahead.
Elsewhere, the Investment Advisors conviction in, and increased exposure to, the activist strategy were well-rewarded in 2006.
They maintain a favourable view towards the environment for the activist trading style and the abilities of managers to continue unlocking value in their portfolio companies.
Bolstered by a healthy global economy and modest interest rates, M&A and corporate activity in the US and Europe reached robust levels in 2006.
Given that the macroeconomic picture remains largely intact and the prospects for renewed bidding wars between cash-rich corporations and private equity investors, a plethora of event-driven situations are likely to present themselves, benefiting the managers in the Companys recently consolidated opportunistic strategy.
Although historically tight spreads continue to dampen opportunities in long short credit, the Investment Advisor believes that managers research will continue to exploit mispricings within the capital structures of companies that will be sufficient to generate attractive returns.
Following the run-up in the equity and credit markets in 2006, the Investment Advisor believes the Companys portfolio hedge managers will have more attractive opportunities to continue delivering alpha and provide protection during challenging periods in the markets.
Lastly, while the macro strategys results in 2006 were slightly disappointing, they remain optimistic that managers research will yield ample opportunities to profit from global macroeconomic dislocations.

8 209183 Absolute pp01-pp17 4 5 07 14:00 Page 9 Managers Report continued Whilst it is generally considered best practice to disclose the full portfolio of an investment company, the composition of the Companys investment portfolio is the subject of confidentiality provisions with the Investment Adviser.
The Board believes that such disclosure could be disadvantageous to the Company and its shareholders, for instance by increasing competition for the limited investment capacity in underlying hedge funds and hedge fund strategies.
Accordingly, in common with several other funds of hedge funds, and, in compliance with current UK Listing Authority requirements, the Company intends to disclose only its ten largest investments.
