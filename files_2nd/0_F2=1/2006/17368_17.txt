What we think The Advertising & Marketing Services Industry: China and the internet WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell reports s expected, 2006 was a strong year.
It was a miniquadrennial boosted by political spending around the mid-term Congressional elections in the US bigger than expected, at around $1.6 billion, the Winter Olympics in Turin somewhat disappointing and soccers World Cup in Germany better than expected.
2006 followed a stronger than expected 2005, all of which maintained the strong recovery from the internet bust of 2000.
In theory, 2005 should have been the weakest year of the four-year cycle to 2008, with no big events to boost advertising and marketing services spending.
Following on, 2006 was WPPs best year ever measured by all metrics.
It achieved record billings, revenues, gross margin and operating margins of 14.5%.
2007 has already shown more improvement.
It should be an even better year with continued growth in the US, Asia Paci c, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe, buttressed by a mild recovery in Western Continental Europe and even Britain.
The rapid changes in technology continue to be an opportunity.
But if we do not respond quickly, they will become a threat.
