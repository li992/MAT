T he Skilled Tradesperson Howden Joinerys partner The key drivers in our market are price, availability, quality and range.
How does our model meet these demands?
It starts with the skilled tradesperson and their own network.
We help this group of people do what they need to do which is make a living.
In return the skilled tradesperson acts as our sales force.
Our model, where local knowledge, the skills to fit a kitchen, coordination of the different trades needed, all combine with the opportunity to make the sale, would be almost impossible to replicate with an employed workforce.
Howden Joinery builds relationships with the skilled tradesperson by offering what we call our four aces: A good range of well No call back quality, designed products with skilled tradesperson supported by excellent returning to us time and sales literature.
Products that are always in stock locally.
