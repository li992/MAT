12581 Text 8 6 06 1:47 pm Page 8 Managers Report Chris Turner Fund Manager 23 May 2006 It has been another remarkable year in global property capital markets.
Investment demand for commercial real estate has continued to be enormous.
In many locations and particularly in the UK and Europe, initial income yields have fallen into uncharted low territory.
Whether this territory is unsustainable or whether current yields herald a new order in propertys status in the investment world, is the riddle.
Last year I commented that investor demand for high initial income was the primary driving force behind the surge in capital trying to find a home in real estate.
Over the year we have seen property initial yields fall across all markets.
In the UK the average is down from 5.8% to 5.1% and in some other markets the yield compression has been even greater.
At the same time across the world the trend has been for base rates and bond yields to rise.
As property yields have fallen and as fixed income yields have risen, so the healthy yield advantage that property and REITs offered over fixed interest has shrunk rapidly.
Logically this should have translated into a reduction in demand for real estate as investors switched capital back into bonds.
Furthermore, a reduction in demand ought, by now, to be doubly obvious as leveraged investors are forced out of the market as income yields from property assets are now, on average, lower than the cost of borrowed money.
As yet, this has not occurred and we have seen no let up whatsoever in investor demand.
The German Performance was strong over the year, and the underweight was our biggest error as property share Benchmark return was exceeded by a wider than usual prices there rose by 81% over the twelve months.
