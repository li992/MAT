Despite a natural gas price increase from $7.77 per dekatherm Dth in 2005 to $10.28 per Dth in 2006, the impact on conversion costs was offset by improvements in energy efficiencies.
Conversion programmes at the Huntingdon plant combined to produce an 8% year-on-year reduction in energy consumption per pound of product.
Norandal USA Inc. and the United Steelworkers agreed to a new three-year contract at the Salisbury Plant in November Port facilities at St. Ann bauxite mine, Jamaica 2006.
The union membership ratified the contract on 20 November 2006, which runs to 20 November 2009.
Developments The New Madrid primary smelter is currently progressing four projects at a cost of $22 million to achieve improved energy efficiency and increase metal production by 10,000 tonnes per annum by 2011.
