During the year we acquired two properties, the first of which was part of a co-ownership building in rue Goubet, Paris comprising 1,268 sq m 13,649 sq ft and was purchased for a3.2 million.

31 WE HAVE BUILT A GERMAN PORTFOLIO OF 13 PROPERTIES VALUED AT 135 MILLION.
HIGHLIGHTS of 2006 GERMANY Established a professional, local team Exchanged or completed on 135.2 million of property Investments in Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Berlin and Dsseldorf STEP 9, Stuttgart 32 GERMANY NET RENT BY LOCATION m Dsseldorf 0.2 Stuttgart 0.5 Hamburg 1.4 Munich 4.1 Berlin 2.2 The German economy grew by 2.0 per cent in 2006 and GDP is expected to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2007.
Unemployment is still relatively high at 11.7 per cent for 2006 but is expected to decrease to about 10 per cent by the end of 2007.
The commercial investment market activity grew by 109 per cent in 2006 with a68.5 billion changing hands.
Activity was boosted not only by an influx of foreign money but a rediscovered confidence from domestic investors.
Take-up in the letting market has increased by 17 per cent over 2005 and average rents have edged up.
The renewed interest in the German property investment market has pushed down yields particularly in the principal German cities.
Consequently our rate of acquisition of new properties has slowed.
However we acquired 11 new properties at a cost of 116.6 million in 2006 of which 7 were purchased in the second half at a cost of 76.2 million, bringing our total investment to 13 properties valued at 135.1 million.
Furthermore we are very close to completing two further properties at a cost of 20 million in the next few weeks.
We are actively reviewing substantial further property acquisitions and working closely with our existing assets to ensure that the current vacancy rate of 2.0 per cent is maintained or reduced.
33 WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE SEE POTENTIAL FOR ADDED VALUE.
Vnerparken, Vnersborg HIGHLIGHTS of 2006 SWEDEN Sale of Lvgrdet for 40.5 million Sale of Solna for 267.0 million 34 SWEDEN The strong demand in the investment market from both local and foreign investors has stimulated record investment activity of 12.9 billion SEK 175 billion in 2006, against 10.5 billion SEK 142 billion in 2005, putting yields under further downward pressure.
The Swedish economy has performed well with growth in GDP of 4.6 per cent in 2006 and 3.8 per cent expected for 2007.
The unemployment rate in 2006 was 5.4 per cent and is set to fall slightly.
Despite the strengthening economic situation, letting market rents have remained stable, influenced by an average vacancy rate in the Greater Stockholm area of over 15 per cent.
While central Stockholm remains a stronger market with a vacancy rate of around 5 per cent it is expected that the letting environment in secondary areas will improve only very slowly.
We therefore took advantage of the very strong investment market to sell our six buildings at Solna Business Park comprising 138,000 sq m 1,485,000 sq ft of commercial space to Fabege AB, a well known real estate group listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.
The properties were originally acquired for 43.2 million and having totally refurbished the properties at a cost of 118.0 million we sold them via a corporate sale at a value of 267.0 million.
After provisions for discounts and rent guarantees on vacant space we have generated a surplus in excess of 65 million since acquisition in June 1999.
Since completing on the sale in August 2006 we have substantially reduced our rental guarantee liabilities by reducing vacant areas from 11,000 sq m 118,000 sq ft to 5,600 sq m 60,000 sq ft and have now completed the majority of the tenant fit-out works.
Our remaining Swedish property at Vnerparken near Gothenburg currently has a vacancy rate of 1 per cent.
We are currently working on plans with the local authority to fulfil their requirements after the university, occupying 11,783 sq m 126,831 sq ft, vacates in July 2008 We will continue to assess investment opportunities in Sweden where we see potential for added value.
