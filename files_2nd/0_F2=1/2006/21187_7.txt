Norwich Union NU is a leader in the UK.
Every week we collect 360 million customer premiums, pay out 94 million in insurance claims, pay 100 million to pensioners and attend over 50,000 breakdowns.
Our financial performance this year once again shows our strength as a well-managed, disciplined composite insurance business.
Now that Norwich Unions business units operate more closely together, we are poised to deliver additional benefits that were not available before.
Our 17 million customers expect us to deal with them in a joined up way, and closer working will enable us to meet this challenge.
One example is bringing together our IT functions into one unit.
This has removed overlap and enabled us to move forward with a new infrastructure to meet the demands of our customers in the emerging e world.
We have already taken action to improve the efficiency of our UK business, following our announcement in September 2006 that we plan to deliver 250 million of annualised cost savings by the end of 2007.
This programme will enable us to strengthen our competitive position and take advantage of customer self-service.
2006 performance Our UK life business has taken advantage of both improving market sentiment and pensions A-Day in the UK.
Our focus has been on capturing our share of market growth, thanks to our unique combination of product range and broad distribution.
Our combined businesses delivered an exceptional performance, with operating profits of 1,813 million 2005: 1,571 million, and our general insurance business produced a combined operating ratio of 95% 2005: 96%.
Forward thinking 2007 will see us continue to place our customers at the very centre of everything we do, in particular by making Norwich Union easy to do business with.
This is already occurring following the launch of our make sense of it website in NU life, which gives customers sound and simple financial advice.
Our newly launched web-enabled fund centre offers comprehensive information for IFAs.
Our simplified life cover product, also launched in 2006 and sold over the web, makes it easier to take out life cover and so helps tackle underprovision in the UK.
Within our general insurance business, we launched our Pay As You Drive proposition in October, partly in response to growing concerns about how, when and where people drive.
Our aim is to bring down the cost of motoring and encourage safer driving, especially by young people at night time.
We believe Pay As You Drive will also encourage motorists to cut the number of miles they drive and help reduce carbon emissions.
In fact, Norwich Union is playing a leading role helping to mitigate the effects of global warming.
We are involved in a number of activities, from high profile lobbying the Government to further invest in flood defences, to customer marketing via our portfolio of ethical investments, to keeping our own house in order giving our employees assistance in buying bicycles.
