RISING FROM JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA Dimension Data started in South Africa at the inception of networked communications.
Using our knowledge and expertise in networking, Dimension Data has grown into a progressive and dynamic IT services and solutions provider.
Our grasp of technology and the optimum business value that technology can create has driven our remarkable success story.
We were founded over twenty years ago, by three young, ambitious South Africans who had a simple vision of wanting to do great things.
Today, our vision has evolved into becoming the world leaders in the provision and management of specialist IT infrastructure solutions that help our clients achieve their business goals.
Present in 35 countries around the world, Dimension Data is a world-class organisation that delivers technology-based business solutions to roughly 6,000 clients.
Dimension Data employees are spirited entrepreneurs who focus their energies on exceeding their clients expectations.
Our nearly 10,000 employees represent the brightest and best talent in the industry.
They are our greatest asset and their energy, commitment, and expertise contribute highly to our success in the market.
We are consistently told by our clients that we have great people and our corporate mythology is filled with examples of how our employees have gone above and beyond to help a client.
