MARKET OVERVIEW: COAL 2006 saw the highest coal burn at power stations since 1996, as record gas prices, coupled with a low carbon price, made coal a fuel of choice for generators for most of the year.
NW Europe steam coal price In response to demand, international coal prices rose throughout the year, from $53 tonne in January to around $68 tonne by the end of 2006.
In addition to this 28% rise during the year, the forward curve has also strengthened as shown below: UK steam coal market 80 70 60 50 40 30 $ tonne 20 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 Actual to 2006.

The Groups share of the market has reduced in line with our deep mines output.
07. indd 12 14 3 07 11:51:50 Since 1 January 2005, UK power stations have been required to participate within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
Generators therefore have to take into account the price of carbon allowances, together with the relative price of coal and gas, when determining which station to run.
The high price of gas combined with a low carbon price has encouraged generators to run their coal stations ahead of their gas plant.
In 2006, UK power stations consumed some 58 million tonnes 2005: 52 million tonnes of coal and steam coal imports increased by 11% from 37 million tonnes to 41 million tonnes.
Electricity supply industry As the table below shows, coal recently overtook gas in the fuel mix for electricity generation: 2006 2005 % % Coal 41 34 Gas 29 38 Nuclear 21 19 Oil, hydro and renewables 9 9 Total 100 100 source: Dti Energy Trends During 2006 the Groups total coal sales to the power station market were 8.8 million tonnes 2005: 9.1 million tonnes, reecting lower than expected production.
The contract cover for supply obligations with all customers at the end of 2006 was 17.9 million tonnes.
The directors believe there remains an appetite among UK COAL customers for price certainty and secure supply, which the Group is able to satisfy.
However, any future contracts must be based on sales prices that allow UK COAL to recover the investment and production costs needed to mine the coal, develop further faces and provide adequate risk adjusted returns.
The Groups discussions with its customers are informed by this stance.
Industrial and domestic In April, UK COAL launched a 50:50 joint venture company with Hargreaves Services plc, called Coal4Energy C4E, to jointly market UK COALs large and graded coal in the domestic and general industrial markets and build mutually on this market position.
CUSTOMERS The prole of UK COALs business customer base is summarised below, and the directors do not expect any material change in the mix of the Groups coal sales in the foreseeable future.
