Charitable donations Drax Group has continued to support community initiatives and charitable causes.
The total charitable donations made by the Group in the year were 45,872 2005: 37,500.
Details of the charitable donations made are contained within the Corporate and social responsibility review on page 34.
Political donations No political donations were made in the UK or elsewhere during the year 2005: nil.
It is the Boards policy not to make donations to political organisations or for political causes.
The Corporate and social responsibility review explains that the Groups activities in the political sphere are aimed only at the promotion of its business interests.
However, the definitions of EU political expenditure are broad and there is widespread doubt about the extent to which normal business activities, which might not be thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could be considered to be political expenditure within the meaning of the legislation.
The Board wishes to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the legislation and is therefore seeking the authority of shareholders to incur annual expenditure, for each of the Company and its subsidiary Drax Power Limited, for such purposes of 100,000 during the next 12 months.
Resolutions to that effect appear on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting.
The Board does not believe that the Group has incurred any political expenditure in the past year.
Creditor payment policy and practice Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers when negotiating each transaction and the policy is to abide by those terms and pay creditors when sums owing fall due for payment, provided that the suppliers also comply with all relevant terms and conditions.
Drax Group plc, the holding company of the Group, has no trade creditors.
In respect of Group activities, the amounts due to trade creditors at 31 December 2006 represented approximately 26 days of average daily purchases through the year 2005: 32 days.
