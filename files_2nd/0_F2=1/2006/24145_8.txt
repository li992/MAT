qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 13 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our view of the market Total UK Life & Pensions market A strong stock market performance and the continued movement from final 2006 12.0bn salary to defined contribution group pension schemes helped the UK life and pension industry to grow by 28% in 2006.
The pensions market received a boost 2005 9.3bn as the result of the pension legislation changes that came into effect in April 2006.2004 8.4bn 2003 8.2bn Despite the increased public awareness of pension issues following the release of the Turner Report, and the widely reported need for saving, we believe that The graphs represent total industry sales in the UK market as collated by the Association of British Insurers.
the market will remain predominantly supply led for the foreseeable future.
Only These are calculated using the traditional Annual mortgage protection and annuity sales are likely to be consumer led to any great Premium Equivalent basis, which calculates new business as 100% of regular premiums and 10% of extent.
Financial intermediaries remain key to the future growth of the market.
Our primary measure of new business is now the Present Value of New Business Premiums, which is defined on page 16.
Protection The housing market defied many experts predictions in 2006, setting Protection 2006 0.8bn records for both price increases and mortgage advances.
The protection market reflected this only to a limited extent with a 2% increase in sales.
The market seems 2005 0.8bn to have shrugged off recent interest rate rises.
However, there remains the possibility 2004 0.9bn of further interest rate rises, and with the growing issue of first-time buyer affordability, 2003 1.0bn a slowdown or even a significant downturn cannot be discounted.
We expect a more subdued market in 2007, either flat or slightly negative.
Investments Investments A strong stock market performance in 2006 built on the recovery of 2005.
2006 3.0bn This drove a 27% increase in sales of investment bonds, which offer investors a simple, 2005 2.4bn tax-efficient investment vehicle, as well as being a useful Inheritance Tax mitigation 2004 2.2bn vehicle.
The growth in the demand for account aggregation and open architecture for 2003 1.8bn funds has led to the development of wrap, a new form of investment trading platform.
We believe that use of these platforms will grow steadily and support the growth of investment bond products.
We expect market growth in 2007 to be in the range of 5-10%, although market turbulence, as seen recently, may concern retail investors.
Risks to this growth expectation are therefore largely on the downside.
Group pensions Group pensions The regulation changes in April had a significant impact in 2006.
2006 3.3bn Also, the financial risks and open ended obligations associated with defined benefit arrangements have led many employers to move to defined contribution plans either 2005 2.7bn for all scheme members or just for new members.
This continuing trend points to 2004 2.4bn significant growth potential within new defined contribution schemes over the coming 2003 2.3bn years.
The trend away from trust to contract based arrangements is also continuing.
We expect market growth in 2007 to be in the range of 7-12%.
Individual pensions Individual pensions There is undoubtedly greater public awareness of the need for 2006 3.1bn adequate pension planning following the media coverage of Lord Turners report on UK 2005 2.1bn pensions, and a significant part of the 47% growth in the individual market in 2006 was 2004 1.9bn triggered by A-Day in April.
Whilst we believe that a major change in Government policy will be needed to encourage the UK public to take pension planning more seriously, 2003 2.0bn we do expect the market for individual pensions to grow steadily.
We expect market growth in 2007 to be in the range of 10-15%.
Post-retirement Post-retirement The post-retirement market is currently not a significant area of focus 2006 1.2bn for Friends Provident, although we continue to be mindful of potential opportunities and 2005 0.9bn risks within it.
In general terms, the next 10 years will see the post war baby-boom 2004 0.9bn generation reaching retirement age, and this will lead to growth in new and existing post-retirement products.

qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 16 ANNUAL REVIEW CHAIRMANS STATEMENT GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW ABOUT THE FRIENDS PROVIDENT GROUP UK LIFE & PENSIONS Our trading performance and outlook Total UK new business UK total new business increased 30% to 4,162m and our share of this market 2006 30% 4,162m increased from 5.2% to 5.5%.
Our trading performance reflected in particular our growing reputation in the pensions arena, and the trend towards this business, 2005 3,192m both group and individual, continued throughout the year.
2004 2,641m 2003 2,535m Protection new business Protection new business increased by 8% to 432m at a margin of 7.4%, up from 2006 8% 432m 5.4% in 2005.
As anticipated, we slightly increased our share of this very competitive 2005 400m market, up from 7.6% to 7.8%, as the impact from some of the already secured distribution agreements began to be felt.
As well as exploring further distribution 2004 437m opportunities, we intend to continue to grow our share in the group protection segment.
2003 402m We expect to grow our market share in the second half of the year as the outlined initiatives begin to take effect.
We will remain price competitive, which may bring downward pressure on margin.
Investments new business Investments new business increased by 2% to 687m at a margin of 1.5%, slightly 2006 2% 687m down from 1.6% in 2005.
Bearing in mind the 15% growth we achieved in 2005, we 2005 672m lost some ground in 2006, which we hope to regain this year in this increasingly competitive market.
In early 2007 we re-entered the guaranteed bond market, 2004 582m reflecting growing customer interest.
Additionally, a number of product enhancements 2003 473m are planned for 2007, and we are on track to launch our wrap proposition by the end of the year, which is an important element of our future growth prospects in this segment.
The outlook for sales remains positive for the year as a whole, particularly over the second half.
Group pensions new business Group pensions new business increased by 46% to 2,298m at a margin of 1.6%, up 2006 46% 2,298m from 1.1% in 2005, and accounted for well over half of our total UK new business.
Our 2005 1,577m performance in 2006 reflected the quality and flexibility of our proposition and lifted our 2004 1,065m market share to 12.8%, bolstered by the effect of the Pensions A-Day regulation changes in April.
Underlying growth, both for our business and the group pensions market generally, 2003 1,046m looks set to continue over the medium term and we will continue to benefit from the transition in the market away from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes.
We will also increasingly benefit from incremental business forming a greater proportion of future new business volumes, thereby reducing volatility.
Individual pensions new business Individual pensions new business increased by 63% to 490m.
Excluding 2006 63% 490m contracting-out rebate payments from the Department of Work & Pensions DWP, new 2005 301m business increased 74% to 336m.
This reflected the heightened public interest in pensions and primarily comprised the more profitable single premium business, which 2004 277m we target.
Margin was 1.3%, slightly down on the 1.4% achieved in 2005.
We have 2003 322m achieved good growth since relaunching into this market in 2005, which we expect to continue into 2007.
Beyond this, we expect future growth to be steady.
DWP rebate payments will steadily decline through to 2012.
Annuities new business Annuities new business increased by 5% to 255m at a strong margin of 5.3%, up 2006 5% 255m from 2.8% in 2005.
Our approach to this market segment remains cautious, primarily 2005 242m serving our existing customers only, although we continue to keep the balance of risk and reward under active review.
2004 280m 2003 292m The new business figures on this page are reported on the Present Value of New Business Premiums PVNBP basis, defined as single premiums plus the expected present value of new regular premiums.
The 2003 bars on the charts have been estimated on this basis to indicate a comparison.

qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 17 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our financial performance EEV underlying profit UK Life & Pensions EEV underlying profit before tax decreased by 4% to 315m 2006 -4% 315m 2005: 328m with the increase in new business profits being more than offset by lower returns on the in-force business and shareholders net assets.
2005 328m EEV underlying profit comprises figures in m : 2006 2005 Contribution from new business 108 64 Profit from existing business 183 209 Development costs 26 25 Expected return on shareholders net assets 50 80 Return on embedded value The return on embedded value, based on underlying profit after tax, decreased to 2006 -16% 7.9% 7.9% 2005: 9.4% with largely unchanged profits on an increased embedded value.
2005 9.4% Contribution from new business The contribution from new business has increased by 69% to 108m 2005: 64m with group pensions amounting to 35% and protection 30% of the total.
The contribution 2006 69% 108m is stated net of the cost of solvency capital of 6m 2005: 5m and share based 2005 64m payments of 2m 2005: 2m.
The overall margin has increased from 2.0% to 2.6% as a result of the gearing effect of higher volume and relatively flat expenses.
Individual product margins are shown on page 16.
The Internal Rate of Return IRR has increased to 10.3% pa during 2006 2005: 8.6% pa, again primarily as a result of operational gearing.
The overall payback period discounted has reduced from 17 years to 12 years.
Profit from existing business The profit from existing business reduced by 12% to 183m 2005: 209m.
The expected return on the value of the in-force book increased by 2% to 173m 2006 -12% 183m 2005: 170m, reflecting the increase in the value of the in-force business offset by 2005 209m lower discount rates.
The profit includes positive experience variances of 9m 2005: 20m and positive operating assumption changes of 1m 2005: 19m.
Within operating assumption changes and experience variances, the total UK in-force charge for persistency is 53m and this has been offset by profits from a change in morbidity and mortality assumptions of 27m and a reduction in the cost of burnthrough of 36m.
Development costs have increased to 26m 2005: 25m, reflecting continued Development costs investment in our market leading protection and group pensions e-commerce 2006 4% 26m propositions, infrastructure to support our strategic distribution relationships and the 2005 25m development of a wrap platform.
Development costs in 20072008 are expected to be higher than in 2006 in the range of 30m 40m per annum in support of our growth strategy.
Expected return on shareholders net assets The expected return on shareholders net assets decreased by 37% to 50m 2006 -37% 50m 2005: 80m, partly due to a reduction in the expected rates of return on equities and fixed interest securities and changes in the mix of assets.
Part of this decrease 2005 80m results from a change in the tax gross-up basis.
Operating expenses Operating expenses have increased by 4% to 253m 2005: 243m.
Since 2003, operating expenses have increased by only 2% against an increase in PVNBP of 64% 2006 4% 253m over the same period.
This demonstrates the efficiency of our processes and power of 2005 243m our technology to deliver substantial new business growth whilst maintaining excellent levels of service, with only a small increase in cost.
We believe there are further opportunities to leverage future efficiencies due to the scalability of our solutions and the continued development of our self-service offering.
Operating expenses exclude: commission, deferred acquisition cost adjustments, non-recurring items, investment fees, amortisation and impairment of intangibles and expenses of policyholder investments which are consolidated under IFRS.
The 2005 comparative has been adjusted principally to remove corporate costs.
