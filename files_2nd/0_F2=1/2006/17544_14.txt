Until 5 April 2006, under that Section, he accrued a pension of 180th of his Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of Pensionable Service.
In addition, he accrued a one-off cash sum of 380th of his Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of Pensionable Service.
As a result of changes in the taxation of pensions after 5 April 2006, John Condron has chosen to cease accrual in the Yell Pension Plan after that date, although his pension and cash sum remain linked to his Final Pensionable Earnings at leaving, retirement or death.
After 5 April 2006, he will receive cash payments of 27% of Basic Salary per annum: this rate has been calculated to be broadly equivalent to Yells costs of his future benefits had he continued accrual in the Yell Pension Plan.
b John Davis is a member of both Sections 1 and 3 of the Yell Pension Plan.
Until 5 April 2006, under each of those Sections, he accrued an annual pension of 160th of his Final Pensionable Earnings up to the HM Revenue and Customs Earnings Cap for each year of Pensionable Service total accrual of 130th each year.
As he was subject to the Earnings Cap, Mr Davis also received part of this pension through an unfunded unapproved pension promise.
This increased his overall entitlement to 130th of his Pension Scheme Salary for each complete year of Pensionable Service and in proportion for a part year.
To determine the transfer value of the unapproved pension we have used the standard cash equivalent transfer basis adopted by the Yell Pension Plan.
As a result of changes in the taxation of pensions after 5 April 2006, John Davis has chosen to move his unapproved pension promise into Section 3 of the Yell Pension Plan and then cease accrual in the Yell Pension Plan after that date, although his pension remains linked to his Pension Scheme Salary at leaving, retirement or death.
After 5 April 2006, he will receive cash payments of 48% of Basic Salary per annum: this rate has been calculated to be broadly equivalent to Yells cost of his future benefits had he continued accrual in the Yell Pension Plan.
With effect from 1 March 2005, both John Condron and John Davis participated in SMART pensions.
This is an option available to all members of the Yell Pension Plan, whereby members accept a reduction in their pay, in return for non-contributory membership.
The reduction in each members pay is equal to the contributions that the member would otherwise have paid.
Yells contributions are increased by a corresponding amount.
