The Chairmans Statement and Financial Review should be read in conjunction with this report.
1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES The principal activities of the Group during the year were the investment in, development and management of commercial properties in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden.
2 REVIEW OF BUSINESS The Consolidated Income Statement for the year is set out on page 52.
A review of results for the year and prospects for the future are included within the Chairmans Statement, Financial Review and Property Review.
Details of use by the Group of financial instruments are set out in the Financial Review on pages 20 to 22 and in Notes 2.23 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 62 and 63.
3 DIVIDENDS In lieu of paying an interim cash dividend in 2006 the Company distributed 40,295,523 to shareholders equivalent to 51.6 pence per share by way of tender offer buy-back completed in November 2006 2005: distribution of 6,920,236 or 8.5 pence per share.
The Directors have decided to recommend a further tender offer instead of paying a final cash dividend for 2006.
It is proposed, therefore, that the Company offers to buy 1 in 41 of the shares registered in the name of each eligible shareholder at a price of 750 pence per share.
This compares with a mid-market price of 715 pence per share on 28 March 2006 2005: 1 in 42 shares at 640 pence per share.
The resulting distribution to shareholders will be 13,281,345 or 18.3 pence per share, which will be made in May 2007 subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
When added to the distribution made under the November tender offer, shareholders who take advantage of both tender offers in respect of the financial year 2006 will have received a total return of 69.9 pence per share 2005: 23.8 pence per share.
4 PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS SHARES During the year the Company has made market and tender-offer purchases totalling 262,204 of its own shares at a cost of 1,406,509, a weighted average of 536 pence per share.
This represents 65,551 in nominal value, or 0.33 per cent of the issued share capital.
Shares purchased during the May tender offer and through the market have been retained as Treasury shares.
Shares purchased during the November tender offer have been cancelled.
The Directors considered that the purchases were in the best interests of the shareholders given the cash resources of the Company and the discount in the market price of the Companys shares to their net asset value.
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting the Company was authorised to make market purchases of up to 7,812,446 ordinary shares.
Since last years Annual General Meeting the Company has made market purchases of 234,458 shares and therefore still has authority to purchase 7,577,988.
A resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to give the Company authority to make market purchases of up to 7,083,382 shares.
5 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO A valuation of all the properties in the Group as at 31 December 2006 was carried out by Allsop & Co for the UK and Sweden, and DTZ Debenham Tie Leung for France and Germany which produced an open market value of 1,143.5 million 2005: 1,096.4 million.
On the basis of these valuations adjusted net assets per share amounted to 824.4 pence 2005: 606.9 pence.
In view of the policy of re-valuing properties bi-annually, in the opinion of the Directors there was no significant permanent difference between market and book values of the properties at 31 December 2006.

The Board has determined that, apart from Bengt Mortstedt and Tom Thomson, the Non-Executive Directors are independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances which could materially affect or interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Board recognises that Keith Harris and Thomas Lundqvist, having served for more than 9 years as Directors, no longer meet the criteria for independence set out in the Combined Code.
After careful review, it is the opinion of the Board that they remain independent of the management of the Company, having regard to their financial independence and other commercial interests.
It is the Boards view that they add significant value to the operation of the Company through their combined wisdom and varying experience and as such it is currently not appropriate to change a successful team.
However, as recommended under the Combined Code, Keith Harris, Bengt Mortstedt and Thomas Lundqvist will retire annually and, being eligible, they will seek re-election to the Board at the Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Sten Mortstedt will retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, will seek re-election to the Board.
The Board recommends to the shareholders the re-election of the retiring Directors who have all contributed to the continuing financial success of the Company.
