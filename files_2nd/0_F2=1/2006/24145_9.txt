qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 19 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our view of the market Our international business is conducted across the globe, with specific emphasis on four key regions: Asia, the Middle East, the UK and Continental Europe.
The business mix includes regular premium savings and protection plans, alongside single premium savings, investment and estate-planning propositions.
Customers are attracted by our innovative solutions, wide-ranging investment opportunities, the portability of the products and the long-term confidence of strong currency investments.
Friends Provident International FPI FPI has followed a deliberate strategy of market diversification, ensuring that it does not limit itself to a single region or jurisdiction.
From its base in the Isle of Man, FPI operates in all the four key regions, with a product mix that ranges from regular savings and protection business to investment contracts, including highly personalised portfolio bonds.
Distribution partners are primarily Independent Financial Advisers.
FPI has also actively developed distribution relationships with a number of institutional partners.
Asia remains FPIs largest generator of new business volumes, with the bulk of that business coming from regular premium savings.
The overall Hong Kong market grew strongly over the first half of 2006 before slowing over the second half.
FPI continues to be confident in, and committed to, the region.
The Continental European strategy centres on the targeting of a small number of specifically selected territories, including the launch of a series of personal pension products in Germany, alongside a German distribution partner.
Business from the Middle East has benefited from the establishment of a local presence.
The UK remains an exclusively single premium investment market with particular emphasis on tax and estate planning.
2006 saw no lessening of market activity and competitiveness, with a number of companies expressing a renewed interest in the Asian region, but we maintain a robust position, based on strong relationships with distribution partners and a demonstrable commitment to the market.
The successful development of a new branch office in Singapore, and the continuing demand for high quality wealth management solutions, adds to our confidence.
HNWI financial wealth forecast by region Lombard The provision of tailor-made financial and estate planning solutions for high 20032010 estimated Figures in trillions US$ net worth individuals HNWIs and ultra HNWIs in Europe and beyond remains the focus of the Lombard business.
Lombard operates primarily across eight EU member states, 2010 44.6 while continuing to explore new opportunities in other regions.
Geographic diversification Allowing for 6%pa global growth is supported by a unique multi-jurisdictional expertise.
This expertise is critical in meeting 2005 33.3 the planning needs of many clients and the business needs of international private banks, 2004 30.7 and has led to writing rapidly increasing volumes of new business.
2003 28.5 Lombards approach is to partner with leading specialist advisers, which enables the combining of Lombards financial expertise with the relationship and asset management Annual growth rate 20052010 estimated capability of the distribution partner.
As the very large market for HNWI ultra HNWI Africa 5.2% continues to grow, so does the requirement for effective protection of private wealth.
Lombard has been able to increase its penetration of this market year-by-year and Middle East 8.0% intends to deepen this penetration further as the business develops.
Latin America 5.9% Asia-Pacific 6.7% The HNWI sector in particular continues to attract the attentions of governments North America 7.4% seeking to increase tax on private wealth.
This intensifies the pressure on traditional Europe 3.7% tax planning structures and offshore tax havens, and increases the relative attractions of life assurance being used as a tax shelter and estate planning solution, such that Source: Capgemini Lorenz curve analysis May 2006 experts increasingly recognise life assurance as an important financial planning tool.
Lombard competes through the provision of enhanced value-added services and administration rather than on price.
Competitors are mainly those that have established subsidiaries in Luxembourg and Dublin, primarily to sell back to their home country although some are increasing their international diversification, and generally offer a lower priced, less value-added service.

qxp 31 3 07 01:49 Page 22 ANNUAL REVIEW CHAIRMANS STATEMENT GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW ABOUT THE FRIENDS PROVIDENT GROUP UK LIFE & PENSIONS Our trading performance and outlook Total International new business International new business, achieved through Friends Provident International 2005 2006 311% 32% 2,205m 2,912m and Lombard combined, increased by 32% to 2,912m, representing more than 40% of the Friends Provident Groups total life and pensions sales.
2005 2005 311% 2,205m 2,205m 2004 537m Over the longer term, we continue to expect the pace of growth in our 2003 510m International operations to exceed that of the UK Life & Pensions business, with future trend growth rate for new business profit expected to be in double digits.
Friends Provident International New business increased by 16% to 823m at an Friends Provident International new business unchanged margin of 3.1%, with sales higher in Asia, the Middle East, and 2006 16% 823m Continental Europe.
2005 708m Sales are not generally seasonal and therefore the new business profile for 2006 is not 2004 537m typical.
The strong growth that characterised 2005 continued over the first half of 2006, 2003 510m with a marked slowdown over the second half of that year.
Hong Kong is FPIs biggest contributor to new business and our performance mirrors the strong market growth seen in Hong Kong in the second quarter, followed by a market downturn in the second FPI new business by region half.
Other factors were the sale of fewer large bonds in 2006, the weakening of the dollar which had the effect of lowering average premiums for business sold in Asia and the Middle East, and the impact of unexpected changes to UK trust and tax rules.
2006 2005 The market remains a very competitive environment.
Marketing focus throughout 2006 was primarily on the setting up of a new office in Singapore, successfully achieved, and delivering three new personal pension plans Region 2006 2005 into the German market.
During 2007 we plan to review and enhance our core Asia 49% 45% propositions as well as introducing specifically designed products to the Singapore UK 13% 17% market.
The new personal pensions for the German market were introduced in late Continental Europe 19% 17% 2006, with early indications of their success being encouraging.
We expect to build on Middle East 10% 10% this throughout 2007.
Other 9% 11% For 2007, we do not expect sales in the first half to match the exceptionally strong sales in the first half of 2006, although we do anticipate sales in the second half of 2007 to be higher than in the first half.
Prospects for medium term growth are attractive.
Lombard new business Lombard New business increased by 40% to 2,089m with particularly strong 2006 40% 2,089m performances in the UK, Italy and Mexico.
The geographic diversification of the Lombard business is a major strength, with emphasis varying from year to year - often as a 2005 1,497m result of tax changes, as was the case in Italy in 2006.
The UK market is the one most 2004 1,300m sensitive to prevailing investment markets, and sales more than doubled over 2006 as 2003 690m investment sentiment continued to improve, and as partnerships with those serving the Lombard became part of the Friends Provident Group in January 2005 HNWI-sector developed.
Although the pattern of new business was, as always, skewed towards the fourth quarter, Lombard has achieved higher than usual growth throughout the year.
A major Lombard new business by region factor in this was the increased proportion of large cases written in 2006.
Writing larger cases generates greater profits, although generally at a lower margin, and the overall margin reduced to 3.4% from 3.9% in 2005 as a result.
2006 2005 In the latter part of 2006, a number of significant adverse tax changes were announced, particularly in Mexico where a legal change seriously reduced the attractiveness of Region 2006 2005 foreign life policies and where the position remains uncertain.
Whilst Lombards short Belgium 14% 20% term prospects are likely to be impacted, we expect the growth trend in new business Germany 14% 19% to continue, albeit that 2006 was above trend and 2007 will be below it.
This outlook UK 12% 8% recognises Lombards ability to deepen its penetration in European markets, with our Other Europe 43% 38% new Swiss office further supporting the increasing number of our quality Swiss-based Other 17% 15% partners.

qxp 28 3 07 22:02 Page 23 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our financial performance EEV underlying profit International Life & Pensions EEV underlying profit before tax increased by 12% to 2006 12% 119m 119m 2005: 106m.
This increase has mainly been driven by strong new business volume growth and follows on from an 80% increase in 2005 which 2005 2005 106m 106m included the impact of the acquisition of Lombard in January 2005.
EEV underlying profit comprises figures in m : 2006 2005 Contribution from new business 96 80 Profit from existing business 22 25 Expected return on shareholders net assets 1 1 Return on embedded value The return on embedded value, based on underlying profit after tax, reduced to 2006 -7.9% 19.8% 19.8% 2005 21.5%.
The lower ROEV in 2006 has resulted from the significantly 2005 21.5% higher opening embedded value which included the impact of Lombard.
Contribution from new business The contribution from new business has increased by 20% to 96m 2005: 80m.
2006 20% 96m The contribution is stated net of the cost of solvency capital of 1m 2005: 1m.
The Lombard contribution is 70m 2005: 58m and the FPI contribution is 26m 2005 80m 2005: 22m.
The overall margin has reduced from 3.6% to 3.3% with Lombard achieving 3.4% 2005: 3.9% and FPI 3.1% 2005: 3.1%.
The Lombard margin has, as anticipated, fallen slightly as a result of higher case sizes written, which have lower margins.
Low new business strain results in a high IRR of 25.7% pa 2005: 28.3% pa and a relatively short payback period discounted of 4 years 2005: 4 years.
Profit from existing business The profit from existing business reduced by 12% to 22m 2005: 25m.
The expected return on the value of the in-force book increased by 31% to 34m 2006 -12% 22m 2005: 26m, reflecting the increase in the value of the in-force business, offset by 2005 25m lower discount rates.
The in-force profit includes a charge for operating assumption changes of 10m 2005: 3m charge.
The main item in 2006 was a change in persistency assumptions on legacy with-profits bond business resulting in a charge of 13m.
Development costs within our International businesses during 2005 and 2006 were not significant.
Development expenditure is expected to be in the order of 10m per annum in 2007 and 2008 as we seek to exploit opportunities for further growth and to deliver our award winning e-commerce solutions to the wider international market.
The expected return on shareholders net assets amounts to 1m 2005: 1m.
This comprises the return on the shareholders net assets held within the business consistent with the investment return assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the start of the period.
Operating expenses Operating expenses have increased by 17% to 63m 2005: 54m against an 2006 17% 63m increase in PVNBP of 32%.
The growth in expenses reflects the less mature nature of 2005 54m our International business, which is still building critical mass to support the growing portfolio of products, markets and customers.
There is a firm focus on cost efficiency, with a number of initiatives under way which will contribute in 2007 and beyond.
These include greater use of technology to improve service and reduce costs across the international markets in which we operate.
Operating expenses exclude: commission, deferred acquisition cost adjustments, non-recurring items, investment fees, amortisation and impairment of intangibles and expenses of policyholder investments which are consolidated under IFRS.
