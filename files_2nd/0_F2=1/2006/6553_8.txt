Market conditions in California, Florida and Arizona experienced a downturn in activity whilst Texas remained solid due to the Morrison Homes performance Strong first half performance continued affordability of housing in that state.
Although demand softened, the number of homes for sale but market conditions impacted continued to rise, as investors dumped properties back on the market leading to an oversupply of both second half new and second-hand homes.
As a result, housing starts decreased and by the end of the year inventory Firm actions taken to deal with levels had started to show signs of reducing.

Today we have focused our operations in 13 markets which are supported by strong long term demographic trends.
Our satellite operations in Reno, Nevada and Fort 15 Myers, Florida have now achieved stand alone status and have operated independently since the end of 2006.
In 2006 Texas, Florida, California and Arizona experienced the highest levels of employment growth in the US, with the growth in Texas at twice the national average.

The impact of reducing sales prices and increased incentives had a knock-on effect on operating margins which fell to 15.5% 2005: 20.0%.
To offset some of the market impact we have renewed our focus on costs and are seeking to actively manage our cost base across all areas of the business with $20 million of input cost savings targeted in 2007.
Detailed benchmarking will measure costs across all operations and we continue to renegotiate contracts with all suppliers, targeting cost savings of around 5%.
A number of other cost reduction initiatives are also underway which will seek to reduce costs in sales, legal and administrative functions.
As part of this programme by January 2007 we reduced employee numbers by 145, reducing full time staffing levels by around 20% across the business.
This enables us to operate at appropriate staffing levels without affecting our ability to grow as market conditions improve.
The net impact of changes in the exchange rate was limited.
The weakening Dollar resulted in an average exchange rate for 2006 of $1.84:1 compared with $1.82:1 used in 2005.
In Sterling terms revenue was 756.2 million 2005: 845.5 million, pre-exceptional operating profits reduced to 116.9 million and post-exceptional operating profits were 56.2 million 2005: 169.4 million.
US Housing KPI Sales, product and prices Benefiting from a strong order book at the beginning of 2006, we were able to deliver a record Completions performance in the first half of the year which supported the full year results.
Total completions for the 5,000 year were 4,347, 12% below last year 2005: 4,921.
Excluding Atlanta completions were 4,341, 10% below last year 2005: 4,797.
As was predicted, total average outlets for the year increased to 107 2005: 95 with 4,000 the actual number open at the year end increasing to 114.
In line with the industry and compared to a very strong market for most of 2005 average visitor levels 3,000 per site for 2006 decreased by 28%.
The weak market conditions had a significant effect on average sales rates as sales per outlet per week reduced to 0.56 2005: 1.05.
We took action to combat this by raising 2,000 the bar on our sales processes and people and by using increased incentives to gain competitive advantage.
Cancellation rates averaged 38% as investors responded to the high inventory levels by 1,000 cancelling contracts very late in the purchasing process.
This is more than double our average cancellation rate for the previous four years of 18%.
0 2004 2005 2006 Average selling prices for the full year were $319,600 2005: $312,700 benefiting from strong price appreciation on sales in the second half of 2005 completed in the first half of 2006.

Prices in the US Housing KPI order book are currently at similar levels to those achieved in the first half of 2005.
Landbank size plots In response to market conditions we have introduced ranges of townhomes and other higher density 25,000 products in several markets.
This type of product has enabled us to maintain our position in the volume market with the attached townhome representing 23% of the Florida Divisions completions in 2006.
20,000 The growth in sales from the townhome product range, has led the average size of our homes to fall slightly to 2,274 sq ft 2005: 2,299 sq ft. 15,000 Land The challenges of the market in 2006 led us to make a change in our land strategy.
The strong landbank 10,000 built up over the past five years allowed us to temporarily stand back from land purchases during the second half of the year in all our weakening markets.
We carried out a detailed review of all optioned and 5,000 pipeline land and renegotiated or exited all contracts not expected to deliver economic returns.
As a result 0 of these actions the owned and controlled landbank was reduced by 20% to 18,737 plots 2005: 23,514 2004 2005 2006 plots.
Just over one third of the landbank is currently held under option which provides opportunities to renegotiate terms and conditions to ensure maximum value is delivered from our landbank.
Our current landbank places us in a strong position for the future, with land carrying values having been reduced to reflect the current market conditions.
We either own or have options on all the plots required US Housing KPI for 2007s expected volumes and a significant proportion of those required for 2008.
Landbank quality Customer service cost per plot as a % of ASP Morrison Homes has built its brand on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction.
During the 15 year our would you recommend customer satisfaction score averaged 86% 2005: 85%, with 30% of customers who bought a Morrison home in 2006 coming from referrals from satisfied customers 12 2005: 27%.
Centralised Signature Selection Centers continue to add value for our customers.

Morrison Financial and Morrison Title have continued to contribute to our financial performance with an income of $4.9 million and $1.4 million respectively.
65% of customers 6 arranged their mortgages through us and in Texas and Florida approximately 90% of customers used our title service.
We have focused on improving the efficiency of our mortgage business and from April 3 2007 our Florida joint venture mortgage partner will operate across our business under the new name Morrison Home Funding.
We believe this will improve profitability as well as customer satisfaction with 0 2004 2005 2006 our customers receiving priority service.

This proposed extension of the Morrison Homes website will provide customers with a communication aid before and after the purchase of their home.
Going forward In the US there have been signs that market conditions have stabilised in the first few weeks of 2007 with cancellation rates reducing dramatically and sales rates increasing.
Given our low order books we expect volumes and margins in 2007 to be signficantly below 2006.
However if current trends continue, the market will improve during the year leading to a strong 2008.
Our deliberately cautious approach to land acquisition and valuation, the firm actions we have taken to address costs and overheads along with our position in markets with strong long term demographic trends, give us confidence that Morrison Homes is well placed to return to growth as conditions improve.
