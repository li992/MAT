Property review and store locations Serious About Locations During the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006, we have opened 11 combined health club superstores, 7 high street superstores, 7 stand-alone out-of-town superstores, 3 small icon stores and one golf store.
During the same period, we closed 15 small high street stores and 14 superstores.
Of the 14 superstores which have been closed, 7 are as a result of re-locations and 7 were stores that were not performing satisfactorily.
At 29 January 2006, we operated from 438 stores comprising 194 out-of-town superstores, 109 high street superstores, 108 smaller high street stores, 23 icon stores and four golf stores.
The retail selling space totalled approximately 4,398,000 square feet, an increase of 3.9 per cent compared to the selling space in operation at 30 January 2005.
The number of superstores referred to above includes 32 combined health club superstores which are part of the Leisure Division.
These operating units compare to 438 stores in operation at 30 January 2005, comprising 189 out of town superstores, 102 high street superstores, 123 smaller high street stores, 20 icon stores and 4 small golf stores, representing 4,234,000 square feet of selling space.
We have continued to pursue a policy of migrating from smaller high street stores to both high street superstores and out-of-town superstores where a more complete range of clothing, footwear and equipment can be displayed.
Our store migration strategy provides customers with a more pleasant shopping experience and we expect this policy to maximise store profitability.
In order to mitigate the impact of 5 year rent reviews on out-of-town sites which regularly exceed the rate of inflation, we shall continue the roll out of the combined health club superstores format where, by negotiation with the landlord, a cap is placed on all future rent reviews.
