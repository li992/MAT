Resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting, inter alia: Renew the directors general authority to allot the companys ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 4,500,000.
This authority shall expire on whichever is the earlier of the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the company to be held in 2008 or the date falling 15 months from the passing of this resolution.
The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority, which represents 24.93% of the present issued share capital: Approve a limited disapplication of pre-emption rights on allotments for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of 900,000, representing 4.99% of the present issued share capital: Authorise the directors to make purchases of the companys ordinary shares in the market for cancellation or to be held in treasury when the directors consider that it would be in the best interests of the company to do so, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,805,000, representing 10% of the present issued share capital.
Following the introduction of The Companies Acquisitions of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003, companies are now able to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase in treasury, rather than cancelling them.
The company may consider holding any of its own shares which it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred by the relevant resolution as treasury shares.
This would allow the company to sell shares out of treasury, providing the company with the ability to replenish its distributable reserves.
No dividends will be paid on any shares held in treasury and no voting rights will attach to such shares.
It will also be possible for the company to transfer shares out of treasury, pursuant to an employee share scheme.
At 7 March 2007 the company held no shares in treasury.
This is a renewal of the authority granted by shareholders at the 2004 annual general meeting, since when no shares have been re-purchased: A resolution to approve the savings-related share option plan for US employees as described on page 43 and in appendix one of the circular: A resolution to approve changes to the companys LTIP regarding the eligibility of employees to participate in the plan and the ability of participants to exercise options early upon ceasing employment by reason of retirement with the agreement of the company as described in appendix two of the circular: and A resolution to adopt new articles of association to allow the company to communicate with its shareholders using electronic and website communication and to allow for electronic proxy voting.
At 7 March 2007 there are outstanding options to subscribe for 10.0m ordinary shares pursuant to employee share schemes, representing 2.9% of the issued share capital.
If the authority to purchase shares were exercised in full, these options would represent 2.7% of the enlarged issued share capital.
Auditors A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit plc as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
