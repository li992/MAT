The UK business remains a strong, cash-generative operation and is now seeking to evolve its business by modernising the offer, winning customers in new ways and operating more efficiently.
The newer, international business continues to grow profit in its established markets, develop its newer markets in Mexico and Romania, and look for new countries into which to expand in future.

The impact of this in 2006 is to reduce profit in UK home credit by 12.0 million and reduce the interest cost held centrally by 12.0 million.
2005 results have been restated on to a comparable basis resulting in a reduction in UK home credit profit in 2005 of 16.3 million and a reduction in the interest cost held centrally by 16.3 million.
These changes have had no impact on reported group profits in either 2006 or 2005.
