SEGRO Annual Report 2006 Why REIT status works for SEGRO 09.
SEGRO is well suited to REIT status due to its strong focus on a single asset class Flexible Business Space on a pan-European platform.
With a conversion charge of 82 million, REIT status has allowed us to release some 416 million of provisions for deferred tax, which is no longer payable, and exempts us from tax on the eligible UK income.
We expect to save a significant annual sum from this tax exemption alone.
SEGROs growth plans are development led and the structure of UK REITs complements and facilitates the execution of SEGROs major development programme, because development gains will generally be tax free.
SEGROs pan-European focus is a key differentiator as the Group pursues superior returns for its shareholders.
The UK REIT structure, combined with the tax rules in most other European jurisdictions, facilitates the creation of a tax efficient international structure.
The Board has announced a new REITs dividend policy with a high income pay-out ratio, to take effect on dividends paid in relation to 2007 performance and beyond.
