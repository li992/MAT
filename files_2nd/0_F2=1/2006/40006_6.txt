Ready to Reap the REIT Dividend WHAT ARE REITs?
REITs are Real Estate Investment Trusts they are companies that have elected to adopt a tax status which is now open to eligible UK companies.
Slough Estates plc now trading as SEGRO became a REIT on the earliest possible date, 1 January 2007.
WHY ARE REITs A GOOD THING?
REIT status offers exemption from UK corporation tax on profits and gains from an eligible UK portfolio, and also, therefore, a greater flexibility to undertake asset disposals, since tax on capital gains is no longer an issue.
Development gains on investment properties are also exempt from corporation tax on capital gains, subject to certain conditions.
REITs are required to distribute to their shareholders at least 90 per cent of the profits from the part of the business that is within the REIT ringfence.
