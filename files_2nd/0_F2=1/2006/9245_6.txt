In addition, information on the Laird Risk Management Group RMG is given on page 28.
Overall growth and demand for products The overall demand for products is influenced by the level of customers commercial activity, which in turn is affected by the general economic climate, market conditions and consumer confidence generally.
This demand can be volatile and is dependent on a number of factors including the macroeconomic climate, the rate of change in the regulatory environment and in industry consolidation, the adoption of new technologies and customer spending patterns.
Lairds markets are highly competitive and the Group must be able to respond to technological change The Group operates in market sectors which are characterised by a high level of competition between suppliers, and which are driven by technological change.
The Group must continue to respond promptly and effectively to technological change and customers and competitors innovations in order to be successful.
The markets for some products are characterised by continual technological development and innovation, often involving joint collaboration and close working relationships with customers around the world.
This requires Laird to put together multi-national, multi-functional teams which are essential to the development of new products in high growth markets.
The ability of the Group to meet the demands of the market and to compete effectively is, to a large extent, dependent on the skills, experience and performance of its employees and their relationships with customers.
Political, economic and regulatory factors Having a global reach does involve certain risks for the Group.
The Group is exposed to political risk and to the effects of possible terrorist action and natural catastrophe.
Changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, price or exchange controls, composition or changes in taxation or other governmental policies could limit its operations and make the repatriation of profits difficult.
In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit the Groups ability to enforce its rights.
Dependence on a small number of large customers The loss of a major contract or customer could adversely affect the Groups financial condition and prospects.
It may also have wider profit and cash flow implications if Laird has sited its manufacturing plants in close proximity to theirs.
Reliance on a limited number of suppliers The Groups ability to deliver according to market demands depends in large part on obtaining timely and adequate supplies of components and raw materials on competitive terms and in line with product quality and safety standards.
Failure could interrupt its product supply, limit sales and increase costs, as well as affecting the Groups reputation and brand value.
Exposure to increases in the prices of commodities and raw materials The raw materials used in the business include commodities such as copper and beryllium copper, steel, aluminium and zinc.
These commodities experience price volatility caused by changes in supply and demand, market fluctuations and governmental attitudes.
Loss of key management or personnel The Group is highly reliant on the continued services of its senior management, including Executive Directors, and other key personnel, who have skills critical to the continued successful operation of the business.
Failure to retain such individuals, or to attract and retain strong management and technical staff in the future, could have an adverse affect upon the business and the results of its operations.
Financial risks The Group is subject to various financial and fiscal risks by virtue of its global operations and customer base.
Further information on Taxation, Currency Exposures and Credit Risk are given in notes 10 and 28 to the financial statements.

24 The Laird Group PLC Substantial equity interests With effect from 20 January 2007, section 198 of the Companies Act 1985, which required the notification of interests in shares, was replaced by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules DTRs issued by the Financial Services Authority, whereby notifications relate to control over exercising voting rights attached to shares.
Categories of notifiable interests include direct interests holdings of shares with voting rights attached, indirect interests those with access to voting rights and financial instruments which give the holder the formal entitlement to acquire shares with voting rights attached.
Notification must be made of each category, and also the aggregate of combined holdings, which exceed or fall below the notifiable threshold.
The requirements of the DTRs specify that notifications of holdings of over 3% only have to be made when a full percentage point increase or decrease occurs.
The Company has only one class of shares, and does not hold treasury shares, so the total number of voting rights under the DTRs is equivalent to the number of shares in issue.
Pursuant to the requirements of the DTRs, as at 16 March 2007, the Company had received the notifications of control of 3% or more over the Companys total voting rights and capital in issue as set out below.
