For the first time in seven years, In the year to 30 September 2006, Electras net asset value increased from 1,197p to the total value of the investment 1,545p per share, an increase of 29%.
This compares to an increase of 31% and 20% portfolio increased as a result of in the previous two years.
Over the last three years the net asset value per share has new investment and value risen by 103%.
The performance continues to be driven by buoyant market conditions for realisations, which have enabled Electra to successfully realise investments for cash proceeds exceeding 900 million in the three year period, generating profits of over 300 million.
Partly as a result of the exceptional level of cash receipts in the past three years, Electra has become increasingly liquid and at 30 September 2006 held net liquid assets, primarily in the form of floating rate notes, of 238 million.
The total portfolio at 30 September 2006 thus comprised 380 million of investments, excluding accrued income, and 238 million of net liquid assets.
The restrictions on new investments which have been in force since 2001 have also contributed to the position of relatively high liquidity.
Over the year, investments were completed to a value of 131 million, compared to 82 million in the previous year.
At 30 September 2006 there were outstanding commitments to invest of 133 million.
Realisations from the portfolio amounted to 257 million, generating proceeds equivalent to 73% of the opening value of the portfolio.
On average, realisations were achieved at prices which exceeded book value by 95%.
For the first time in seven years, the total value of the investment portfolio increased as a result of new investment and value increases exceeding realisations.
At 30 September 2006, the portfolio comprised direct investments in 55 companies with a value of 313 million together with investments in 34 private equity funds with a value of 67 million.
Of the direct investments, those with an aggregate value of 63 million were quoted on a recognised stock exchange but subject to restrictions on sale.
Geographically, 78% of the portfolio was situated in the UK and Europe, 13% in the USA, 7% in Asia and 2% in South America.
Current Operations and Outlook The year has seen significant changes in the composition of Electras portfolio.
Although the level of investment continues to increase, cash generated from realisations gave rise to an increase of 53 million in short term liquidity after funding investment of 131 million and returns to shareholders of 73 million in the form of a special dividend and on-market share buybacks.
With the removal of restrictions on new investment, it is anticipated that the rate of investment will increase further in contrast to the level of realisations, which will fall as a result of the change in age profile of the portfolio.
This will lead to a reversal in Electras current liquid position as the investment portfolio increases.
