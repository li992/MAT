Unilever is changing from the way we are structured and the way we operate, to the choices we make and the priorities we set.
We have a reformed governance, a new structure and a One Unilever programme creating consistency, delivering cost savings and enabling us to leverage our global scale.
We are developing and implementing brilliant consumer marketing.
We are strengthening our relationships with retail customers.
And we are outsourcing transactional operations in IT, finance and HR so we can focus on growing global brands.
In supporting our growth strategy, these changes are all making an impact on performance.
2006 was a year of progress, showing consistent broad-based growth, with all regions and all categories contributing, and savings programmes delivered ahead of plan, helping to offset higher input costs.
Our investment priorities personal care, developing and emerging markets, and Vitality are fuelling this growth.
