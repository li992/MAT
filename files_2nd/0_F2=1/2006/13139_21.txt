131 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2006 Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax payable on the current year taxable profits, adjustments in respect of prior year taxable profits and the movements on deferred tax that are recognised in the income statement.
Tax arising in joint ventures is included in the share of results of joint ventures.
The tax payable on current year taxable profits is calculated using the applicable tax rate that has been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax arising on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, based on current forecasts, it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Full provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits from foreign subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures.
Movements in deferred tax are charged and credited in the income statement, except when they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective Recently issued standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have any significant impact when adopted.
