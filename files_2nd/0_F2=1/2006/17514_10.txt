Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 | 57 Chrome | Operations with cost savings contributing $8 million Revenue for 2006 was 6% lower than in 2005, predominantly driven by to EBIT.
Efficiencies were achieved through XA weaker market and pricing conditions in the first quarter.
Market conditions more stable reductant prices, improved alloys resulted in the suspension of production at a total of seven furnaces for metallurgical performance and sound varying periods of time.
Routine maintenance stoppages also occurred at a number of energy management.

Four furnaces remained commissioning of the Lion plant in 2007 suspended at the end of 2006, two of which have been returned to production in is expected to have a significant positive the first quarter of 2007. impact on unit operating costs, primarily due to increased energy efficiency from Xstratas Premus technology.
Attributable saleable production of 958,600 tonnes of ferrochrome was Developments 15% lower than in the previous year, The new Lion ferrochrome smelting although stockpiled material was used to complex was commissioned on schedule supplement sales volumes, which were and within budget in the third quarter of only marginally lower than in the previous 2006.
The plants design criteria was met year.
Improved availability of quality ores within the first three months of operation, resulted in improved metallurgical and full commissioning remains on track efficiencies in the furnaces, particularly for completion in the second quarter in the Western operations.
EBIT decreased by 17% year on year, The Bokamoso pelletising project remains due to lower average prices and standing within budget and commissioning is due charges associated with idled capacity, to begin in the second quarter of 2007. together with the impact of ongoing Construction started in May 2006 and mining sector inflation.
