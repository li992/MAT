Top rents at the park are now 42.50 per sq ft. L. Frank Baum 18561919 Bromide print from original negative, 1908.
From The Library of Congress Baum was a childrens author, a playwright, a journalist and an inveterate believer in better things.
For one year only he managed, without conspicuous success, a New York opera house: he wrote an equally forgettable melodrama, The Maid of Arran: he became a theosophist: he embarked on a series of commercial ventures, all of which failed.
One day his mother-in-law heard him trying to explain to his children why a mouse would run up a clock or a cow jump over the moon.
Being more concerned with the familys precarious finances than keeping her grandchildren entertained, she nagged him into writing it all down and finding himself a publisher.
The outcome was Mother Goose in Prose 1897, which was a surprise best-seller: two years later came the sequel, Father Goose, and Baum was all but swamped under the pile of royalty cheques and the fond kisses of his mother-in-law.
In 1900 he penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the first of 14 hugely successful Oz titles which have, with mind-numbing inevitability, now been deemed politically incorrect and banned from schools and libraries.
