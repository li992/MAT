Future Group Strategy In November last year, we announced our intention to separate Fiberweb from BBA.
Over the last few years both businesses have been grown, both organically and by acquisition, so that each of them have achieved the critical mass that now allows them to stand alone as strong, independent companies in their own right.
Each business has an excellent market position, with leadership in several areas, and they are increasingly international in their presence.
We believe both businesses have a strong sense of focus and are well positioned to grow further, acting as consolidators in their markets.
These are the reasons why we have decided that it is the correct time to separate Fiberweb from the BBA Group and we are convinced that this will deliver more shareholder value in the long-term.
As we proceed with the separation of Fiberweb we are also accelerating the efforts to improve our operational performance, particulary in our Fiberweb North American Hygiene and our Aviation Engine Repair businesses.
The growth of our Aviation businesses both organically and by acquisition remains a priority.
We therefore look forward to a challenging year with confidence.
