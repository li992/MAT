Outlook UK and Europe The commercial property market is still in a good space and we are co-investing alongside quality professionals as opposed to direct participation.
We are beginning to look at overseas markets for co-investment where more value is perceived than exists currently in the UK.
South Africa Activity in the property market is favourable given the low interest rate environment and we expect to continue to perform well, leveraging off our market share and dominant positioning.
There is opportunity to continue to realise our trading portfolio given the buoyancy in the market.
There is a reasonable pipeline of property projects and developments.
We are actively and continually reviewing opportunities to grow the fund business.
