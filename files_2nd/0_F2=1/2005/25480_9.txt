The increase in net fees and commissions receivable is attributable primarily to the growth in retail fees due to strong flows into the retail fund ranges.
Total net inflows into the onshore funds amounted to 347 million whilst the offshore funds had net inflows of 76 million supported by strong sales from Asia.
Although the institutional book suffered net outflows due to the loss of a large low margin insurance client, institutional revenue increased on the back of a shift to higher margin pension business.
Southern Africa Operating profit of the Southern African operations in Rands approximately R372.0 million is 36.2% higher than the prior year.
Net fees and commissions receivable benefited from strong equity and bond markets.
This coupled with excellent investment performance in the specialist propositions and a subsequent increase in performance fee revenue of R91.4 million 7.9 million 2004: R19.0 million 1.6 million, resulted in a significant increase in institutional fees.
Retail fees also benefited from net inflows of R1.7 billion 148 million.
Costs remain a priority The increase in costs is attributable to one-off costs associated with the outsourcing of the administration function, active recruitment and an increase of variable remuneration in line with business performance.
