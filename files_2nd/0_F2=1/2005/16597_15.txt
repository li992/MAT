RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL Reserves Assessment and Reporting The companys technical staff are highly skilled with average industry experience of over 20 years.
The company relies primarily on its internal technical expertise, augmented by third party engineers, to ensure objective estimates of the companys reserves.
The company mitigates the risks associated with reserve estimation through the adherence to a company wide reserves policy & procedure that outlines the process transparently from technical staff to senior management.
One of the main constituents of the procedure is that 100% of the companys total reserves are reviewed annually.
In addition to the reserves estimation carried out by the companys engineers, an independent engineer DeGolyer and MacNaughton conducts a report on the proved and probable reserves annually as part of the companys obligations to its bankers.
Venture has separately engaged Scott Pickford to provide an independent third party review of the companys procedures and methods for reserves estimation.
The purpose of the review was to verify that the reserves estimates prepared by the companys technical staff are in accordance with the guidelines and definitions of the SPE WPC reserves classification March 1997 using accepted engineering principles.
A variety of assets in various stages of development were evaluated and Scott Pickford confirmed that the procedures and methods utilised by the companys technical staff were appropriate and met the SPE WPC guidelines.
