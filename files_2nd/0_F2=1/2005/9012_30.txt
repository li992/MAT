Regulatory Financial Review Kingston Kingston Wholesale Market : Call Origination on Fixed Public Narrowband Networks in the Hull Area The call origination market includes the origination of local, fixed-to-mobile, national 01 02 numbers, number translation services, narrowband internet and international calls.
Call origination volumes rose in 2004-05 to 1.5 billion minutes 2003-04: 1.3 billion minutes driven by an increase in volumes for 07--, 08-- and 09-- voice minutes.
Internal revenues remained constant year-on-year however external revenues increased in the period.
Operating costs showed a small increase in line with volumes however M. C. E. declined substantially as indexation of exchange assets combined with annual depreciation decreased their carrying value by 13%.
This reduced M. C. E. led to internal revenues required to earn a return on M. C. E. of 13% to fall by 1%.
