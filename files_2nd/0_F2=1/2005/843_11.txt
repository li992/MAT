Business and financial review continued Project Solutions continued In the Wind Energy business we continue to invest in the development of our onshore portfolio of around 1,400MW including third party shares.
Offshore, we are leading a 75MW development near Aberdeen and are providing services to Centrica on projects with a potential output exceeding 1,000MW.
The large Isle of Lewis project received local authority support at the end of June 2005 but this, and other proposed developments, remain subject to planning consents.
Continued investment in this business resulted in a small loss in 2005.
However, once planning consents are secured, we expect to be able to realise substantial value quite quickly.
The order book in Project Solutions was 1.0 billion at the year end, down slightly on the previous year 2004: 1.1 billion and reflecting the changed focus of this segment.
