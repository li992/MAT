INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our view of the market Total UK Life & Pensions market Due to the gradual erosion of State support, consumers have to take more responsibility for their own financial well-being.
One of the biggest issues 2005 10% 9.3bn currently facing consumers is the growing pensions crisis and the report of the 2004 8.4bn Pensions Commission, published in November 2005, proposes a number of 2003 8.2bn measures to address the future of pensions provision.
2002 9.6bn We have yet to learn the outcome of this report but we believe that new market The graphs represent total industry sales in the UK opportunities, such as those linked to the increasing need for private pension market as collated by the Association of British Insurers.
These are calculated using the traditional provision, will lead to significant prospects for market growth in the medium Annual Premium Equivalent basis, which calculates term.
In 2005, the overall market grew by 10% and we forecast market growth new business as 100% of regular premiums and 10% of single premiums.
Our primary measure of new of 8-10% in 2006. business is now the Present Value of New Business Premiums basis, which is defined on page 16.
Protection Protection Many life protection products are bought in conjunction with a property purchase or re-mortgage, and this is a highly competitive market.
However there are 2005 -12% 0.8bn some encouraging signs in the housing market.
The Bank of England reported 2004 0.9bn consistent increases in the number of mortgage approvals in the later months of 2005 2003 1.0bn and several lenders have reported increases in property prices in the early months of 2002 1.0bn 2006.
This suggests that we should start to see a more buoyant market for protection products emerging in the year ahead.
Investments Investments Life assurance bonds have, for many years, provided consumers with tax efficient ways to invest for growth and income and to provide inheritance tax mitigation 2005 12% 2.4bn vehicles.
However, the investment market is changing.
There is an increased focus on 2004 2.2bn asset allocation and many consumers with the wealth to invest have less time to manage 2003 1.8bn their investments.
This is leading to a trend for account aggregation for high net worth 2002 2.5bn clients.
With market growth traditionally linked to stock market confidence and increases in personal disposable income, we anticipate modest growth for 2006.
Group pensions Group pensions Consumers increasingly look to their employers for retirement provision.
It is now clear that the most efficient way to encourage greater private 2005 13% 2.7bn provision, and therefore less dependence on the State, is through workplace pensions.
2004 2.4bn The Governments pensions reform agenda will need to address consumer concerns 2003 2.3bn and, we believe, have the full support of the industry if this is to have optimum impact 2002 2.4bn on the growing pensions crisis.
We expect employer-sponsored schemes to experience growth and attract new members over the medium term.
Individual pensions Individual pensions Consumers who are ineligible to join an employer-sponsored pension scheme will need to provide for their retirement with individual arrangements 2005 9% 2.0bn as the Government continues to erode State support other than for those who benefit 2004 1.9bn from means testing.
With debate over the Governments pensions reform agenda likely 2003 2.0bn to increase awareness of the importance of private provision, we anticipate steady 2002 2.6bn growth in the individual pensions marketplace.
Post-retirement Post-retirement With the percentage of adults over retirement age set to increase, 2005 3% 0.9bn the need for post-retirement income solutions is anticipated to grow.
Following changes in legislation, it is no longer compulsory for consumers to convert their 2004 0.9bn pension fund into an annuity and this change is expected to reverse the recent trend of 2003 0.9bn a declining income drawdown market.
The risks associated with annuity business can 2002 0.9bn be considerable, as future profits depend on accurate assumptions regarding, for example, longevity.
This market is expected to grow in 2006, although it is currently not an area of focus for Friends Provident.
