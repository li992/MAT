Acquisitive growth Although part of the same overall strategy, there were three distinctive elements behind the acquisitions made in the year.
a Market Entry The acquisition of Score Press took the Group into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for the first time.
The strong economy in the Republic of Ireland in particular makes this a faster growing market than the UK and the relatively fragmented ownership structure provides potential for further consolidation.
b Consolidation The acquisition of Local Press and the Leinster Leader Group consolidated our position in these new markets and has provided the critical mass to enable the integration of these separate operations into two new divisions which in turn will improve efficiency.
The acquisition of The Scotsman Publications Ltd significantly increases our presence in the Scottish market and has enabled the Scotland division to be reorganised around a substantial daily centre.
c Add ons Although much smaller in scale, the acquisitions of the Thorne Gazette, Ashwell Associates and Best Asian Media were all in areas or contiguous to areas where we already have a publishing presence.
Significant margin improvement can be obtained in these businesses by leveraging off the infrastructure we already have in place.
