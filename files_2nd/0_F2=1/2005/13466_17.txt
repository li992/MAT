Sales of Diavik diamonds continued to attract a high level of interest with prices remaining steady.
Production in 2005 exceeded that in 2004 with good operational and plant performance achieving a new volume record.
Ore blending strategies were employed to increase throughput which allowed the process plant to comfortably exceed design capacity on a consistent basis.
Grades also steadily improved as mining continued deeper into the orebody, improving understanding of the resource.
