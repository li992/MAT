One of the largest US producers, KEC sells its ultra low sulphur coal to electricity generators predominantly in mid western and southern states.
Sales are made under multiple year contracts and on a spot basis for one year or less.
The domestic US market for low sulphur coal continues to grow due to its competitive cost per delivered energy unit and restrictions on sulphur emissions by utilities.
For example, the price of sulphur emission allowances a reward for higher specification coal increased during the period from US$800 to US$1,700 per tonne of emissions.
Continued strong demand for low cost and low sulphur western coal is expected to increase with the announcement of numerous new coal fired generation projects and increased utilisation of existing coal generation capacity in the US.

Balancing System, which will continue at least through 2007, enables producers to swap and trade surplus capacity.
In April 2005 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission granted authorisation for a similar queue management system at DBCT.
The queue system allocates the scarce capacity at the port and associated rail system until 2008 when new capacity is expected to become available.
Production decreased at Blair Athol from 12.2 million tonnes to 10.6 million tonnes primarily as a result of shifting limited port capacity to Hail Creek product.
Kestrels production increased 13 per cent to 3.7 million tonnes in 2005 including 2.9 million tonnes of coking coal.
At Tarong, production decreased by eight per cent to 6.5 million tonnes in line with decreased demand from Tarong Energy Corporation.
Hail Creek production was 5.9 million tonnes of which 5.2 million tonnes were shipped.
At Hunter Valley Operations production decreased from 13.3 million tonnes to 12.4 million tonnes while sales were 12.8 million tonnes.
The integrated Mount Thorley Warkworth operations held production at 10.3 million tonnes while sales were 10.9 million tonnes.
At Bengalla, production increased from 5.3 million tonnes to 6.0 million tonnes while sales were 5.4 million tonnes.

Rssing Uranium Rio Tinto: 68.6 per cent Rssing produces and exports uranium oxide from Namibia to European, US and Asia Pacific electricity producers.
In December 2005, approval was granted to extend the life of the operation until at least 2016 and restore annual production capacity to 4,000 tonnes per annum at a total incremental and sustaining capital cost of US$112 million.
2005 operating performance In 2005 production increased by four per cent to 3,700 tonnes of uranium oxide as a result of higher plant availability and improved market conditions.
Higher realised prices were somewhat offset by the further strengthening of the Namibian dollar against the US dollar resulting in a US$2 million underlying earnings contribution in 2005.
In 2005, Rssing regrettably suffered a fatality at the operation.
Rssing continues to put a significant effort and management focus on safety.
The focus is to eliminate all injuries from the workplace and to have an embedded safety culture and systems that identify and rectify potential safety incidents.
The lost time injury frequency rate for 2005 rose to 0.48 from 0.08 in 2004.
