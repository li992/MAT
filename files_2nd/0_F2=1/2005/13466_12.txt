Demand for iron ore continued to be extremely strong across the product range throughout 2005, driven by continued strong growth in global steel production and improvements in steel demand.
Chinese iron ore imports rose 30 per cent year on year, and Hamersley, Robe, IOC and Corumb all achieved record production in 2005.
The first phases of major expansions to the Pilbara infrastructure Dampier port to 116 million tonnes per annum, Yandi mine to 36 million tonnes per annum and West Angelas mine to 25 million tonnes per annum were completed in 2005, and substantial progress made on the brownfields mine expansion projects announced in April 2005.
In October 2005 RTIO announced the next phase of expansion, which will increase Dampier port capacity to 140 million tonnes per annum and Yandi mine capacity to 52 million tonnes per annum.

Rio Tinto 2005 Annual report and financial statements 41 OPERATIONAL REVIEW 200 5 81795x 1140a 1 3 06 4:27 pm Page 42 Operational review continued HIsmelt Rio Tinto: 60 per cent The HIsmelt iron making project at Kwinana in Western Australia is a joint venture between Rio Tinto 60 per cent interest through its subsidiary, HIsmelt Corporation, US steelmaker Nucor Corporation 25 per cent, Mitsubishi Corporation ten per cent, and Chinese steelmaker Shougang Corporation five per cent.
The project has received approval for Australian federal government support of A$125 million.
The HIsmelt process is a direct iron smelting technology developed largely by Rio Tinto that converts iron ore fines into high quality pig iron 96 per cent iron content without the use of coke ovens and sinter plants.
Notably, the technology allows efficient processing of ore fines with higher levels of impurities.
A pilot plant to demonstrate the technology has been expanded to commercial scale at a cost of US$200 million.
During 2005 the plant moved into operating phase and will now ramp up production.
It is expected to reach its full production rate of 800,000 tonnes per year over the next three years.
The iron produced will be sold as pig iron once sufficient stocks have been built up.
Hot commissioning began in April 2005, with the first quantities of hot metal produced in mid June 2005.
Production of the first 1,000 tonnes triggered the release of A$50 million in federal government assistance for joint user infrastructure at the Kwinana site, in November 2005.
The plant has produced more than 13,000 tonnes of hot metal to date.
HIsmelt has signed two process licence agreements with Chinese steelmakers to allow for the development of ironmaking facilities using HIsmelt technology, using the facility at Kwinana as a template.
IRON ORE GROUP PROJECTS Orissa, India Rio Tinto: 51 per cent Orissa is one of the key iron ore regions of the world.
RTIO has a 51 per cent interest in Rio Tinto Orissa Mining, a joint venture with the state owned Orissa Mining Company.
The joint venture holds rights to iron ore leases in Orissa, which it is seeking to develop.
Rio Tinto is keen to participate in the development of the Indian iron ore sector through its joint venture, and has appointed a project director to expedite the development of operations in India.
With economic growth in India forecast to continue strongly, supporting a growing domestic steel industry, discussions have continued with major domestic steel companies.
Simandou Rio Tinto: 100 per cent The Simandou deposit in Guinea, west Africa, is a greenfields discovery with potential to host significant resources of high grade iron ore. Simandou moved from Rio Tinto Exploration to full project status as part of RTIO in October 2004.
A prefeasibility study, scheduled for completion at the end of 2006, will assess mining and transport options necessary to bring Simandou into production as quickly as possible.
