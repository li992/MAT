Candovers investment approach Candover is an independent company investing principally in larger European buyouts.
Private equity investment has consistently shown good quality returns over recent years, and Candovers performance has consistently ranked it among the leaders.
Our success is underpinned by an emphasis on quality management both our own and in investee companies.
Candover works with ambitious, entrepreneurial people whose vision matches our own.
Our approach is to work in close partnership with management teams and to create an environment where they can perform at their best.
To that end, managers always have an equity stake in the businesses we back, with the potential to produce substantial rewards.
There is no set Candover formula we treat every business as unique but there is a clear guiding philosophy.
We look for the fundamentals: a good team and good growth prospects.
Once we have identified an opportunity, we pursue it rigorously.
The scale of Candovers resources means that we can support portfolio companies growth plans with follow-on funds as appropriate, and increasingly our strategy is to focus on companies that can be built rapidly through add-on acquisitions.
When the time is right and with managements support we seek an exit that rewards all participants fully for their time, capital and risk.
