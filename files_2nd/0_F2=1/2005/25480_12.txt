The positive macro economic factors in South Africa have resulted in ongoing demand for imports and strong retail sales, supporting both the Trade Finance and Factoring businesses.
The strong Rand has also resulted in an increased demand for imported manufacturing equipment resulting in continued good business for the Asset Finance division.
We will continue with our strategy of pursuing organic growth and exploiting opportunities in existing target markets.

During 2004 we added desks for Institutional Equities and Institutional Options which provides some level of diversification.

78 Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained.
Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the specific financial and strategic requirements it faces at the relevant point in time.
The funds raised are applied towards the making of acquisitions, the funding of central services and debt obligations and the purchase of corporate assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

This performance was partially offset by a net increase in interest costs in the UK division following an issue of Tier II subordinated debt of 200 million in March 2004.
The growth in the return on shareholders funds in the long-term assurance business conducted through IEB is as a result of the substantial increase in the average long-term assurance assets attributable to the shareholder from 186.9 million to 248.1 million, supported by favourable capital market conditions.
In the prior period other operating income had been positively affected by the profit realised on a share buy-back concluded by Insinger.
Furthermore, the division has recorded a more moderate performance on certain investments held directly by the group.
Central Costs We have a policy of allocating costs that are housed in the centre that are in effect performing a function for the divisions of the group.
There are certain costs that are strategic in nature which have not been allocated for pure segmental disclosure amounting to 30.3 million 2004: 25.7 million.
However, a portion thereof 20.8 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
