4 The Companys benchmark is the MSCI World Index in sterling terms.
Comparison of the Companys performance is made with this benchmark.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not track this index and, consequently, there may be some divergence between its performance and that of the Company.
5 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments and performance fee expressed as a percentage of average net assets over the year.
The total expense ratio including the performance fee for 2005 is 0.45% 2004: 0.41%.
6 The fair value of the 200,000 debenture issued by the Company has been calculated with reference to a similar dated gilt plus a margin.
All other debt where drawn upon is deemed to be at market value and, therefore, no adjustment is necessary.
