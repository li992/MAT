Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Directors Interests 29 Directors Interests continued Executive and savings-related options continued c Options granted under the Yule Catto Performance Share Plan at 200 pence total exercise price which have lapsed due to failure to meet a performance target.
d Options granted under the Yule Catto Performance Share Plan at 200 pence total exercise price conditional upon a performance target that has still to be achieved.
Performance targets are as follows: i For awards made in 2003 an award was to vest in respect of 100 per cent of the shares only if the companys adjusted earnings per share over a three year period ending on 31 December 2005 has increased by more than the annual rise in RPI plus 6% per annum compound compared with the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2002 with adjusted earnings per share to be calculated on a consistent basis.
The award was not to vest in respect of any shares unless the companys earnings per share over the same period had increased by at least the annual rise in RPI plus 3% per annum compound at which point the award was to vest in respect of 30 per cent of the shares under the award.
The proportion of the award which was to vest for an increase in the companys earnings per share over the same period between these points was to be calculated on a straight line basis.
ii When setting the performance conditions for awards made in 2004 the Remuneration Committee was conscious that in setting such conditions it must take into account the fact that the companys results in 2003 were boosted by the launch of generic omeprazole in the USA.
Accordingly the conditions in 2004 were based upon the 2003 adjusted earnings per share figure of 27.6p reduced by 7.6p to take account of this highly unusual factor but otherwise in accordance with the performance conditions for 2003.
As a result of the adoption of IFRS adjusted earnings per share figures for the years ended 31 December 2005 and the year ending 31 December 2006 calculated on a consistent basis with those for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 respectively will not be available.
The Remuneration Committee has addressed this issue in the manner described in the body of this Remuneration Report.
iii For awards made in 2005 an award will vest in respect of 100 per cent of the shares only if the companys basic earnings per share for underlying performance over a three year period ended on 31 December 2007 has increased by more than the annual rise in RPI plus 6% per annum compound compared with the companys basic earnings per share for underlying performance for the year ended 31 December 2004 with basic earnings per share for underlying performance to be calculated on a consistent basis under IFRS.
The award will not vest in respect of any shares unless the companys earnings per share over the same period had increased by at least the annual rise in RPI plus 3% per annum compound at which point the award will vest in respect of 30 per cent of the shares under the award.
The proportion of the award which will vest for an increase in the companys earnings per share over the same period between these points will be calculated on a straight line basis.
