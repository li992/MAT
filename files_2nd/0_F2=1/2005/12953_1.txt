Corporate profile Mission Randgold Resources focus is on the creation of Randgold Resources is an African focused gold mining and exploration value through the discovery and development of business incorporated in the Channel Islands in 1995 and listed on the world class gold projects.
London Stock Exchange in 1997 and on Nasdaq in 2002.
Its discoveries to date include the 7.5 million ounce Morila deposit in southern Mali, the plus 6 million ounce Yalea deposit at Loulo in western Mali and the 3 million ounce Tongon deposit in the Cte dIvoire.
The company financed and developed the Morila mine which was brought into production in October 2000 and since then has produced 3.8 million ounces of gold.
It also financed and developed the Loulo mine, which was officially opened in November 2005.
Loulos gold production is planned to exceed 250 000 ounces per year over six years from an open pit operation, but the development of an underground operation, scheduled to start in 2006, will significantly enhance the value and extend the life of this mine.
A prefeasibility study has been completed on the Tongon deposit and work on this project will resume during 2006 subject to the political situation in Cte dIvoire progressing.
Randgold Resources has been put together piece by carefully considered piece, selected not at random but always with a clear and consistent strategic aim.
Each part meshing smoothly with the next.
Every detail adding depth and dimension to the big picture.
This process was designed to develop an integrated gold company capable of generating superior returns through a unique combination of exploration success, operational effectiveness and entrepreneurial flair.
The process is far from complete, but it has already built a business that can justifiably claim to have set the gold standard for value creation in its industry.
