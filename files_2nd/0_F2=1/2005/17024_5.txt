REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS Statement of directors responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements the directors are required to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information as defined by section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985 of which the Companys auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Westbury website is the responsibility of the directors: the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Westbury plc Annual Report 2005 33 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS Authority to allot shares Resolution 9 The directors authority to allot securities in the capital of the Company expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, Resolution 9, which will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution, is to renew that expiring authority and to give the directors general authority to allot, pursuant to section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, up to 34,824,480 ordinary shares representing the Companys unissued ordinary share capital as at 28 February 2005, which is less than one third of the Companys issued share capital.
This authority would, unless previously renewed by shareholders, remain in force up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2006.
The directors have no present intention of issuing any shares other than in respect of the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights Resolution 10 The directors authority, pursuant to section 95 of the Companies Act 1985, to issue equity securities for cash as if section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 does not apply, expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The directors consider it appropriate for a further authority to be granted and to remain in force up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2006.
Accordingly, Resolution 10, which will be proposed as a Special Resolution, is to give the directors authority to issue ordinary shares for cash to holders of ordinary shares on a pre-emptive basis subject to special arrangements relating to fractional entitlements or practical problems.
In addition, the directors will be authorised to issue ordinary shares for cash otherwise than on a pre-emptive basis up to an aggregate nominal value of 573,377, representing approximately 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 26 April 2005.
For the purpose of Resolution 10, the sale for cash of any shares held in treasury by the Company under the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003 will be treated as an issue of equity shares.
Authority to purchase own shares Resolution 11 Resolution 11, which will be proposed as a Special Resolution, gives the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Companies Act 1985.
The authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to a maximum of 11,467,552 representing 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 26 April 2005.
The maximum price per share for any purchase exclusive of any expenses would not be more than 5% above the average of the middle market values for an ordinary share of the Company derived from the Stock Exchange Daily Official List for each of the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the ordinary shares are purchased.
The minimum price exclusive of any expenses would be 10 pence, being the nominal value of each ordinary share.
This authority will expire at the end of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company in 2006.
The directors have no present intention of exercising such authority and would only exercise such authority if in their opinion the expected effect would be to result in an increase in earnings per share and would benefit shareholders generally.
Any purchase of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange.
Should the directors exercise such authority, any shares so purchased may be placed into treasury in accordance with the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003 and subsequently cancelled or sold for cash as provided for by the Regulations.
For information, as at 26 April 2005, there were options over 1,054,190 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which represent 0.9% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 1.0% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital excluding shares held in Treasury.
The Company has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares.
