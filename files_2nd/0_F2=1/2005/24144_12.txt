Our trading results reflect our focus on pensions, both 2005 21% 3,192m group and individual, protection and investments, although 2005 saw a marked 2004 2,641m change in mix, away from protection and towards group pensions.
2003 Note: The new business figures on this page are reported on the Present Value of New Business Premiums PVNBP basis, replacing the Annual Premium Equivalent basis used previously.
PVNBP is defined as single premiums plus the expected 2002 present value of new business regular premiums.
The 2004 numbers have been restated on the new basis and the 2002 and 2003 bars have also been estimated on this basis to indicate a comparison.

The subdued housing market coupled with a fiercely competitive marketplace has been, and will remain, challenging.
Our overall offering is a strong 2004 437m one.
We intend to ensure that our service remains a differentiator and our pricing is 2003 competitive.
As 2006 progresses, the numerous distribution agreements secured 2002 last year should help us build our share of a market expected to expand.

Tendering opportunities, particularly from fee-based Employee Benefit Consultants, and the 2005 48% 1,577m quality of schemes under review increased as the year progressed.
Our success in 2004 1,065m winning new schemes and increasing our market share from 6.8% to 8.8% is based 2003 on our capability to customise scheme design, without compromising good service.
2002 The A-Day changes will add further impetus to an already strong market and to the drive towards defined contribution and contract-based schemes, which plays to our position in the market.
We are very well placed to continue to grow our market share throughout 2006, maintaining our focus on larger schemes.
Individual pensions new business Individual pensions new business increased by 9% to 301 million.
Excluding 2005 9% 301m contracting-out rebate payments from the Department of Work & Pensions, new business increased by 36% to 193 million.
This is a result of our effective relaunch 2004 277m into this market in April 2005 after the Government reconsidered its stance on charging 2003 structures.
We are successfully targeting the more profitable single premium market.
2002 Although competitor activity is intensifying, we expect to maintain growth at least in line with the steady growth expected in this market.
Annuities new business Annuities new business decreased by 14% to 242 million.
Our approach to this 2005 14% 242m market segment remains one of caution, and we follow a strategy of prioritising margins over volumes.
