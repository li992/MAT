The significant growth in net fees and commissions receivable is attributable to increased lending turnover in all operations.
Furthermore, we continued to benefit from our diverse nature of activities, with strong contributions from Structured Property Finance, Specialised Lending, Growth and Acquisition Finance and Investment Management activities.
Dealing profits are largely revaluations and realisations of equity stakes held as a result of Growth and Acquisition Finance transactions.
The increase in expenses is mainly as a result of a rise in variable remuneration in line with strong growth in profitability and an increase in personnel costs in South Africa, given an increase in average headcount.
Provisions increased as a result of book growth: however, the variance is distorted by a reduction in provisions made against certain loans in the prior years that are no longer required.
We established a leading facilitation role among providers of specialised lending products for high net worth individuals.
Our Growth and Acquisition Finance brand was entrenched in the market and we concluded 12 transactions.
We succeeded in attracting talented investment practitioners.

We raised private client money of A$172 million into the Investec Wentworth Specialised Property Trust and Private Equity Fund.
Outlook We have set ourselves a growth target of 20% earnings growth.
This should be seen in the context of current year growth of 57% and three-year compound annual growth of 48%.
This is supported by carefully planned growth strategies in each jurisdiction, which include increased distribution capability and a pipeline of new initiatives and existing deal flow that will support this momentum.
Although the Structured Property Finance specialisation had strong growth over the last three years, we have reduced our dependency on this specialisation by developing scale in Growth and Acquisition Finance, Investment Management and Specialised Lending activities.
The quality of our book remains sound.
Non-performing loans, net of collateral, are fully covered by specific provisions.
General provisions are 71 basis points of core loans and advances.

Outlook UK and Europe While the quantum of revenue is dependent, to an extent, on the level and performance of global equity markets, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaites operating cost base will, following the merger with Rensburg Plc, reduce materially as a result of the variation of remuneration arrangements and infrastructural costs.
In addition to maintaining a high level of client service and winning new mandates, a significant amount of time and effort will be devoted to the integration with Rensburg Plc and the achievement of the synergies outlined in the Listing Particulars for the transaction.
South Africa Prospects remain good.
We anticipate continued private client interest in the market as well as significant corporate activity, which will benefit both our corporate broking and private client activities.
