Unemployment remained low, with two million new jobs created during the year.
Consumer confidence ended the year at 103.8, comfortably in positive territory.
Long term interest rates rose modestly with 30 year mortgage rates rising to an average of 5.9%, well below the long term average.
2005 was another record year for the new homes market in the US, with an estimated 1.3 million new single family home sales 2004: 1.2 million and 1.72 million single family home starts 2004: 1.6 million.
House prices in a number of markets in particular on the Eastern and Western seaboards showed strong growth, though these had generally slowed by the end of the year.
In much of the rest of the country price growth was modest.
US home ownership rates US home ownership rates % As shown in the chart to the right, a projected home ownership 70 rate of 70% in 2010 would imply the creation of circa 1.28 million 68 households each year from 2004 2010 compared to the 800,000 created annually from 66 1999 2004.

An average of one million immigrants have entered the US every year since 1990 which, in addition to a positive underlying birth rate and increasing levels of home ownership see chart above is creating the record levels of demand currently being observed.
These trends have been particularly strong in California, Arizona and Florida which are continuing to benefit from strong job growth and immigration as well as migration from other parts of the US.
The longer term outlook for the total US housing market remains very positive.
These demographic trends are set to sustain demand at historically high levels for a number of years.
The Joint Centre for Housing Studies at Harvard has predicted that an average of two million annual housing starts will be made every year for the next three decades.

Immigration from overseas and migration from elsewhere in the US has been particularly strong in Northern California, Phoenix and Florida.
The states with the highest levels of job growth have remained California, Florida, Texas and Arizona.
As a result, the markets in which Morrison Homes operates across Florida, Phoenix and Northern California were again particularly strong during 2005, though the rate of price increases moderated during the course of the second half.
Denver and, in particular, Texas saw more muted market conditions, with amongst the lowest rates of price growth in the US.
Houston, Austin and Dallas are now amongst the most affordable housing markets in the US.
Financial overview US housing Over the past five years, Morrison Homes has developed a consistent strategy to achieve organic growth.
Operating margin It has focused its operations in some of the strongest housing markets in the US supported by continuing % employment growth and immigration.
The business has developed a successful business model of 20 growth into new markets through satellite operations, building on existing relationships and experience in neighbouring markets.
Since 2001, three successful divisions have been formed in this way and three 16 new satellites were established during 2005 in Reno, Nevada, Fort Myers and Daytona Beach, Florida.
To increase its share of these markets, and to ensure its product range remains competitive and affordable as 12 prices have risen, Morrison Homes has developed ranges of attached townhome and other higher density products.
The townhome product first introduced in Orlando in 2003 represented 13% of the Florida regions total completions in 2005.
8 The planned exit from the Atlanta market has now been completed, with the Division making only a 4 modest contribution to completions in 2005.
The management plan to improve the performance of the Texas divisions is making encouraging progress, despite the continued slow market.
Both volumes and margins grew in 2005.
0 01 02 03 04 04 05 The benets of this organic growth strategy and the strength of the US housing market can be seen in UK GAAP IFRS Morrison Homes strong financial performance over the past few years, which continued in 2005.
Turnover restated for IFRS www.
Average selling prices were up 8% to $312,700, with the growth in more affordable products offsetting to some degree, price ination.
Over the past three years turnover has increased by 91% and completions by 54%.
With this price growth, together with this volume growth and continuing tight cost control, operating margins grew from 14.7% in 2004 to 20% in 2005.
As a result, operating profits grew to $308.3 million, 64% higher than last year 2004: $188.3 million.
Operating profits have grown by 3.7 times over the past three years.
The net impact of changes in the exchange rate were very limited.
Although the Dollar weakened in the first half of 2005, it recovered in the second half.
As a result, the average exchange rate for the year was $1.82:1, compared with $1.83:1 in 2004.
In Sterling terms turnover increased 21% to 845.5 million 2004: 698.0 million and operating profits rose 65% to 169.4 million 2004: 102.9 million.
An important element of George Wimpeys strategy for Morrison Homes has been to maintain a high asset turn.
This ensures that an improved operating margin results in a higher return on capital and, critically, that a high rate of organic growth can be nanced without substantial injections of cash.
This remains a key benefit of our focus on growth within the US housing market as a means of creating shareholder value.
As a result, return on capital grew even further in 2005 to 44.2% 2004: 33.9%.
Sales, product and prices Total completions for the year increased 11% to 4,921 2004: 4,422 although completions excluding Atlanta rose by 17% to 4,797 2004: 4,110.
Despite the devastating effect of the hurricane season across the US, the only direct impact on Morrison was a modest loss of completions in Florida.
Total completions were also affected by supply constraints in some of the stronger markets.
These included shortages of materials and, especially, labour as well as delays in processing permits.
Over the past few years, the geographic mix of Morrisons business has changed.
Volume growth has been stronger in Florida and Phoenix, where job growth has been strongest and affordability has remained US housing healthier.
The proportion of both completions and profits derived from Northern California has reduced.
Landbank plots Total average outlets for the year fell to 95 2004: 100 although excluding Atlanta, average outlet numbers were similar to 2004 at 93.
However, these grew through the year and Morrison entered 25,000 2006 with 98 outlets open.
Average outlets for 2006 are expected to be around 10% higher than 2005.
20,000 Visitor levels per outlet remained strong throughout 2005, with average visitor levels similar to 2004.
Improved conversion rates led to a 13% increase in average sales per outlet per week rising from 0.93 to 1.05.
15,000 The average selling price of a Morrison home increased by 8% to $312,700 2004: $288,900.
In California, Florida and Phoenix prices rose by more than 10% during the year.
This was influenced by growth in the sales of more affordable products in Florida and the increased contribution from the Texas Divisions, where 10,000 selling price ination has been modest.
With the growth in sales from the townhome product range, the average size of a Morrison home fell slightly to 2,299 sq ft 2004: 2,386 sq ft. 5,000 Landbank Morrison Homes growth has been supported by strong and consistent investment into its landbank.
0 01 02 03 04 05 During 2005 we continued to add to the landbank at a rate of around 1.5 plots for every one plot used.

The landbank is spread appropriately across all regions and already represents all the land required to achieve our growth targets for 2006 and the majority of that required for 2007.

Going forward The housing market in the US is underpinned by continuing demographic factors as well as economic With a solid land position, a well designed product range that enables growth and low interest rates.
Job growth remains strong over 600,000 jobs have been created across it to remain affordable in the core of the US during the last three months consumer confidence in January was at its highest level since June the market and three new satellite 2002, and unemployment at 4.7% is at its lowest level for four and a half years.
The market is therefore businesses in neighbouring markets, expected to remain healthy in 2006, although at levels below the record achieved in 2005.
The National Morrison Homes is well placed to Association of Home Builders is projecting a reduction of 7% in national single family home starts to achieve further growth during 2006.
1.6 million and a 6% reduction in new single family home sales to 1.2 million.
If achieved, this would equal the very strong performance in 2004.
Over the medium term, strong demographic trends and a stable economy will support the continuing growth of home ownership and Morrison Homes is well positioned in the markets expected to benefit from this trend.
The strong rate of price growth in Florida, Arizona and Northern California during 2004 and 2005 slowed towards the end of the year, with the market in parts of Northern California slowing sharply.
Morrison put in place action plans during the second half of the year to strengthen its forward sales position across these markets.
We therefore entered 2006 in a strong position with over one third of the years anticipated completions in the forward order book.
The selling prices and margins in this order book compare favourably to those achieved during 2005.
These action plans have continued to support a good sales performance during the first weeks of 2006, with particularly encouraging sales growth in Texas.
With a solid land position, a well designed product range that enables it to remain affordable in the core of the market and three new satellite businesses in neighbouring markets, Morrison Homes is well placed to achieve further growth during 2006. www.
