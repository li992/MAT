The production increase was driven by the continuous programme of workovers and development drilling, with fourteen new development wells drilled, thirteen of which were put on production 1 2 1 A NYA NIKItINA 3 General Director, BESt Samara 2 SIMON MOY Reservoir Engineering Manager 3 A KHtAR SHARIF General Director of turkmenistan Operations 2005 AChIEVEmEnTS 2006 OBJECTIVES Incr ease of 24% in average Burun gross production to Drill at least 10 exploration wells on shallow and deep 9,240 bopd 2004: 15,500 prospects outside Burun field 14 new development wells of which 13 put on production Continue programme of workovers and development drilling on Burun field Commissioning of new three-phase separation units and gas compressors Start-up of pilot water injection project on Burun field Completed mapping of exploration prospects following Progress discussions with government and other operators interpretation of 3D seismic on joint gas export scheme 11 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Review of operations 1 2 1 JuStIN MORRISON 3 Exploration Manager 2 KEVIN JAGGS Geophysicist 3 D OMINIquE PICARD Burren Representative Congo Brazzaville 2005 AChIEVEmEnTS 2006 OBJECTIVES Gr oss average MBoundi production increased by 132% to Drill up to six exploration wells within Kouilou and Noumbi 46,070 bopd 2004: 19,850 bopd licence areas 24 new development wells of which 22 found oil Continuation of MBoundi development drilling programme using four rigs Reduction of uS$6.00 bbl in sales discount to Brent from January 2006 Start-up of 20,000 bwpd pilot water injection project on MBoundi field Identified several exploration prospects within Kouilou licence area following interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic upgrade of infield processing facilities to 60,000 bopd working interest 12 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Burrens entitlement production from Congo was 10,100 bopd, up 106% over 2004 4,870 bopd West Africa Congo Operations during year The main focus of activity was development drilling on the MBoundi field, where 24 wells were drilled during 2005 compared with 17 in 2004, with four rigs in operation during the year.
20 of these wells are on production and two are awaiting workover the remaining two were non-commercial.
Gross MBoundi field production during the year averaged 44,400 bopd, an increase of 137% over 2004 18,720 bopd.
Production in December was 57,250 bopd with 39 wells on production at year end.
Burrens entitlement production from Congo, including a contribution of 340 bopd from the Kouakouala and Pointe Indienne fields, was 10,010 bopd, up 106% over 2004 4,870 bopd.
The slower growth rate for entitlement production compared with gross production was due to the MBoundi field reaching payback i. e. full recovery of historic costs in mid year, as a result of which the state share of the gross oil has increased.
Work began on the expansion of the processing facilities to increase their capacity from 60,000 bopd to 90,000 bopd with the addition of a third processing train, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2006.
The throughput agreement at the Djeno terminal, operated by Total, has been renegotiated so that Burrens crude now forms part of the NKossa blend rather than the Djeno blend.
NKossa API 41 is a lighter crude than Djeno, and the result is expected to be an improvement in the sales price to Brent less around US$1.00 bbl compared with Brent less US$6.90 bbl in 2005.
Interpretation was largely completed of the 3D seismic acquired over the potential extensions of the MBoundi field and the 2D seismic acquired over certain other targets within the Kouilou licence area.
During 2005, two exploration wells were drilled along the Mengo reservoir trend some 25 km south-west of the MBoundi field.
One of these, Diosso, was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole whilst the other, Tchianimbi, although initially put on long-term production test, was unable to sustain production at commercial rates and was suspended.
The small Kouakouala field saw minimal activity during the year.
As at March 2006, production from the field had declined to about 1,000 bopd from four wells.
Finally, Burren has entered into an agreement for the sale of its 35% interest in the Pointe Indienne field to the field operator, Maurel & Prom, subject to government approval.
The field, which produced last year at a gross rate of 150 bopd from two wells and is immaterial to the Group.
Future plans Activity this year will comprise continued development and appraisal drilling on MBoundi coupled with exploration drilling within the Kouilou licence area.
A fifth rig has been contracted for the exploration programme which, spudded an exploration well in March 2006 in the Kouakouala area targeting the Djeno reservoir formation.
A sixth rig is scheduled to arrive in mid 2006 and up to six exploration wells are planned over the year.
Preparations are under way for a 60,000 bwpd pilot water injection project on the MBoundi involving the drilling of water source and injector wells, with the aim of increasing well productivity.
The project is scheduled to start operation towards the end of 2006.
13 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Review of operations Middle East Egypt, Yemen and Oman Egypt Following evaluation of the existing 2D and 3D seismic and well data on the East Kanayis block several attractive Cretaceous prospects at depths of between 6,000 and 9,000 ft have been identified.
Drilling was originally scheduled to commence in Q4 2005, but difficulty in securing a rig delayed the start.
A rig has now been contracted for the entire programme.
The first well, Washka Southwest, was spudded in early March 2006, but was found to be water-bearing and was plugged and abandoned.
The second well, Washka South, targeting the same trend, spudded at the end of March.
The acquisition of 3D seismic over a 540 km area along the Qattara ridge to the south of the block has commenced and is expected to be completed by the end of May.
This will assist in determining targets in the deeper Jurassic horizons for drilling in 2007.
The PSC for the offshore North Hurghada Marine block in the southern Gulf of Suez was signed in September and planning is under way for the acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic over the licence area.
The North Lagia block, onshore in the northern Gulf of Suez, is awaiting parliamentary ratification which is anticipated in Q2 of this year.
Yemen In January of this year Burren signed a PSA on Block 6, an onshore area 2 of 3,911 km, as operator with a 92% working interest.
Parliamentary ratification is expected before mid year.
Block 6 is located in the prolific Shabwa Basin and lies between the major oil and gas producing areas to the west, previously operated by Hunt, and Block S2 to the east, where OMV is developing a 170 million barrel oil field in fractured basement reservoirs.
Our focus will be on the basement potential in Block 6 which has not been explored by previous operators.
We intend to acquire 3D seismic over the most prospective area in 2006 and target the basement structures for drilling in 2007.
Oman Also in January 2006 Burren signed a farm-in agreement with Oman Hunt, a subsidiary of Hunt Oil, on offshore Block 50 to acquire a 40% non-operated interest.
The assignment is awaiting government approval.
Block 50, which has water depths of up to 100 metres, covers 16,680 km of the offshore Masirah Basin which demonstrates similarities to the prolific oil and gas basins onshore Oman.
Previous drilling in Block 50 demonstrated the presence of an active petroleum system, but poor seismic data quality has prevented the confident definition of drillable structures in the potentially prospective part of the basin.
In 2006 the partners intend to acquire detailed, high quality 2D seismic over potentially large structures in order to prepare for a decision regarding a drilling programme at the end of the year.
