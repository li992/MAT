Directors Report The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2005. Review of the Business A review of the Companys operations and its prospects is given in the Chairmans Statement on pages 10 and 11 and in the Investment Managers Report on pages 19 to 21.
Principal activity and status The Company is an investment company within the meaning of Part VIII of the Companies Act 1985 and carries on business as an investment trust.
In the opinion of the Directors of the Company, its affairs have been conducted in a manner to satisfy the conditions to enable it to continue to obtain approval as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The Inland Revenue will grant Section 842 status, if requested, provided that the Companys affairs have been conducted in such a manner as to satisfy the conditions of that section.
Inland Revenue approval for such status has been given for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Results and dividends The total return attributable to equity Shareholders for the year amounted to 124,668,000.
A final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 5.95p per Ordinary share was paid on 20 May 2005.
Three interim dividends of 3.55p each were paid on 15 August 2005, 16 November 2005 and 15 February 2006 making a total distribution to Ordinary Shareholders of 14,357,000.
The Directors now recommend a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 6.65p per Ordinary share payable on 19 May 2006 to holders of Ordinary shares on the register at close of business on 21 April 2006.
The Directors also recommend: 1 that three interim dividends each of 3.80p per share on the Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in issue on 24 June 2006 be paid on 14 August 2006, 15 November 2006 and 14 February 2007 to the persons who at close of business on 21 July 2006, 20 October 2006 and 19 January 2007 respectively, are the holders of such shares.
2 a capitalisation of 8,219 being part of the sum outstanding at credit of the realised gains reserve and the distribution to B Ordinary Shareholders of 3.02225 B Ordinary shares credited as fully paid for every 100 B Ordinary shares held at close of business on 21 April 2006.
This capitalisation issue is in accordance with the dividend provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company and is equivalent in asset value to the final and interim dividends now recommended on the Ordinary shares but excluding any tax credit thereon.
Subject to the approval of Shareholders, definitive certificates in respect of the capitalisation issue will be posted on 19 May 2006.
Fractional entitlements will be sold for the benefit of shareholders.
The new B Ordinary shares will rank equally with the existing B Ordinary shares.
Applications will be made to the UK Listing Authority for 32,876 B Ordinary shares of 25p each to be admitted to the Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for admission to trading.
Dealings are expected to commence on 22 May 2006.
8 to approve the above distribution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting, as printed in the Notice of Meeting.
The Net Asset Value per Ordinary and B Ordinary share at 31 December 2005 was 597.5p 2004 restated 471.8p.
Share Repurchases and Issue of shares At the Annual General Meeting held on 3 May 2005, Shareholders approved the renewal of the authority permitting the Company to repurchase its Ordinary shares.
The Directors wish to renew the authority given by Shareholders at the previous Annual General Meeting.
The principal aim of a share buyback facility is to enhance Shareholder value by acquiring shares at a discount to Net Asset Value, as and when the Directors consider this to be appropriate.
The purchase of shares, when they are trading at a discount to Net Asset Value per share, should result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders and if it is in the best interests of Shareholders generally.
Any purchase of shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
It is proposed to seek Shareholder authority to renew this facility for another year at the Annual General Meeting.
Under the Listing Rules, the maximum price that may be paid on the exercise of this authority must not exceed 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the shares over the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase.
The minimum price which may be paid is 25p per share.
28 Murray International Trust PLC It is currently proposed that the purchase of shares by the Company will be made from the realised capital reserve of the Company.
The purchase price will normally be paid out of the cash balances held by the Company from time to time.
The Resolution seeking authority to buy back shares will permit the Company to hold shares bought back as Treasury shares rather than cancel them immediately.
The Company would only sell on Treasury shares at a premium to net asset value.
When shares are held in treasury, all voting rights are suspended and no distribution either by way of dividend or by way of a winding up is permitted in respect of Treasury shares.
If the Directors believe that there is no likelihood of re-selling shares bought back, such shares would be cancelled.
11 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting will renew the authority to purchase in the market a maximum of 14.99% of shares in issue on 10 March 2006 amounting to 12,974,762 Ordinary shares and 163,061 B Ordinary shares.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means in effect that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting or earlier if the authority has been exhausted.
During the year ended 31 December 2005 and from the date of renewal of the authority on 3 May 2005 to 31 December 2005, no share repurchases have taken place.
Issue of shares In terms of the Companies Act 1985 the Act the Directors may not allot unissued shares unless so authorised by the Shareholders.
9 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, if passed, will therefore give the Directors the necessary authority to allot the unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,095,549 equivalent to 4,327,806 Ordinary shares and 54,390 B Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued share capital at 10 March 2006, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of the passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting.
When shares are to be allotted for cash, section 89 1 of the Companies Act provides that existing Shareholders have pre-emption rights and that the new shares must be offered first to such Shareholders in proportion to their existing holding of shares.
However, Shareholders can, by special resolution, authorise the Directors to allot shares otherwise than by a pro rata issue to existing Shareholders.
10 will, if passed, also give the Directors power to allot for cash, equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,095,549 equivalent to 4,327,806 Ordinary shares and 54,390 B Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued share capital at 10 March 2006, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report, as if Section 89 1 of the Companies Act does not apply.
This is the same nominal amount of share capital which the Directors are seeking the authority to allot pursuant to Resolution No.
This authority will also expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months, whichever is earlier.
This authority will not be used in connection with a rights issue by the Company.
The Directors intend to use the authority given by Resolutions No.
10 to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights only in circumstances where this will be clearly beneficial to Shareholders as a whole.
As such, issues will only be made where shares can be issued at a premium of 0.5 per cent or more to Net Asset Value.
At present, shares are available under the savings plans operated by the Manager.
In circumstances where the share price of the Company stands at a premium of 0.5 per cent or more to Net Asset Value, it may be advantageous for the Company to allot new shares directly to participants in the savings plans or to other prospective purchasers.
Such issues would only be made at prices greater than Net Asset Value, and would involve no dilution for existing shareholders.
The issue proceeds would be available for investment in line with the Companys investment policy.
No issue of shares will be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without the prior approval of Shareholders in general meeting.
Resolution 10 will also disapply pre-emption rights on the sale of Treasury shares as envisaged above.
Once again, the pre-emption rights would only be disapplied where the Treasury Shares were sold at a premium to net asset value of 0.5 per cent.
The Directors consider that the above authorities are in the interests of the Company and shareholders taken as a whole and recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as the Directors intend to in respect of their own beneficial holdings of Ordinary shares amounting in aggregate to 39,258 shares, representing approximately 0.045% of the Companys issued share capital.
Share Capital The issued Ordinary share capital at 31 December 2005 and 10 March 2006 amounted to 86,556,123 Ordinary and 1,087,799 B Ordinary shares.
