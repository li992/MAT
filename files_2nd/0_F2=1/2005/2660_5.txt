The amount of rake charged varies depending on the pot size, but is capped at a maximum of $3 or $5 for the very high limit tables.
Tournaments Tournaments work slightly differently.
Rather than playing with money as in ring games, players buy chips in a tournament which they then use to play against other players.
The player with the most chips at the end of the tournament is the winner and receives a prize, normally in cash.
We earn revenue by charging a commission for organising the tournament and this varies depending on the size of the buy-in and the number of players participating in the tournament.
On PartyPoker, players can choose from a wide variety of different tournaments offering different prize levels for single-table tournaments as well as multi-table tournaments.
In 2005 over 1 billion hands of real money poker were played on PartyPoker, with a total amount wagered of over $45 billion or $125 million per day.

Poker represents the majority of players with 1.6 million registered real money players, of which 1.3 million were active in 2005.
Geographic split The majority of the Groups customers reside in the United States although as a percentage of both active customers and new player sign-ups, this has been declining steadily over the past year.
Customer dynamics vary depending upon the game being played.
In poker, on average, customers tend to play between eight and ten times each month, playing approximately 21 hands of poker and playing for around 18 minutes each time they play.
By comparison in casino, players on average play between three and five times each month.
Two of the most important metrics for both poker and casino are i the level of player activity, measured by the number of active player days calculated as the daily average number of active players in a given period, multiplied by the number of days in the period and ii the spend per customer, measured as the yield per active player day calculated as the revenue in the period divided by the number of active player days in the period.

Historically, whilst the Group has continued to grow the number of active real money players each quarter, the rate of growth in registered players tends to fluctuate throughout the calendar year reflecting the impact of marketing campaigns as well as the inherent seasonality of the business.
Both factors in turn influence the overall level of player activity.
PartyPoker began to experience a substantial uplift in real money sign-ups in 2003.
Management believe that this was due in part to the Groups decision to begin advertising on television in the US, as well as an increase in the popularity of poker generally.
A number of TV campaigns were conducted by the Group at the same time as the airing of a number of major poker tournaments on television in the US and this increased the awareness of poker as an exciting form of entertainment for adults.
The impact on the number of real money sign-ups added each month was dramatic.
In 2005, the Groups 1.3 million Since then, the number of new real money sign-ups has active poker customers were continued to increase over time although there are seasonal mostly male 90% with the largest fluctuations affecting quarterly growth rates.
The Group hit an all age group being the 25 34 age time high of 82,005 new real money sign-ups for poker in one group which represented approximately 38% of the total.
The level of real money sign-ups continues to fluctuate with the level of advertising conducted by the Group and also by coverage of major poker tournaments on television.

Thereafter, the attrition rates are relatively low and after 48 months 23% remain active.
The trend since 2003 has been that the rates of attrition have continued to increase slightly over time.
Management believe that this is due to the increasing proportion of new players that are more recreational in nature and for whom online poker is not their main leisure activity.
Despite this trend, the number of unique active players and the overall level of player activity has continued to increase every quarter since the launch of PartyPoker.
In addition, while the number of players who originally signed-up in a particular period and who continue to play declines over time, the total revenue generated by that group of players remains relatively stable.
In other words, players that continue to play over time increase their spend, thereby mitigating the impact of those players that leave the site or become inactive.
The result is that each group of poker players that sign-up adds an incremental layer of revenue.
On top of this will be any additional revenue generated by the cross-selling of other games.
In 2005, the Group invested in a data mining tool that allows the Group to provide individual players with targeted promotions and incentives, thereby increasing the effectiveness of overall retention spend.

continued As with many other online businesses, the first and fourth quarters are typically strong with the second quarter being the weakest.
As daylight hours increase and the weather in the Groups main markets improves, people typically spend less time online.
The third quarter is usually better than the second but not as strong as the first or fourth quarters.
As well as affecting new player sign-ups and player activity, seasonality also affects yield per active player day.
Casino player activity As with poker, levels of new player sign-ups are an important driver for the casino business, particularly as attrition levels tend to be higher in casino than in poker.
In 2005 the Group had a total of over 444,000 unique active players playing its casino games.
The level of player activity, as measured by active player days, was totally transformed following the introduction of blackjack on PartyPoker in October 2005 as illustrated by the substantial increase in player activity in the final quarter of 2005.
Casino yield Given the smaller number of active players in casino, player yields can be more volatile than in poker the playing patterns of high-rolling players, or whales as they are known in the industry, can influence the overall player yield.
In addition, it is worth noting that the yield per active player day in casino is higher than in poker.
This is partly due to the fact that casino games tend to take less time to play than a game of poker and also because one player can generate revenue whereas in poker there may be as many as ten players involved in generating rake from one hand of poker.
The fall in yield per active player day in the final quarter of 2005 was due largely to the impact of blackjack, which tends to attract smaller bet sizes per game and has a lower margin than other casino games.
Overall, the introduction of blackjack had a substantial and positive impact on the Groups performance and at the same time created the worlds largest online casino.

The Group operates from three locations.
The first is the Group headquarters in Gibraltar where all senior management are based and all key operational decisions are made.
However, the majority of the Groups employees are based in Hyderabad, India where the Group has established a business process outsourcing operation BPO which supports a number of the Groups systems, software development and customer service activities.

The Groups track record in growing its business over a relatively short period is a testament to the scaleability of the Groups systems, which historically have seen month on month growth rates of up to 90%.
The Group seeks to ensure that there is always headroom for additional customer traffic and so is continuously adding capacity as the business expands.
Software development From the very beginning, the Group has recognised the value in owning and developing its own gaming software and now has a dedicated team of over 200 software engineers based at its BPO operation in Hyderabad, India.
This team is charged with delivering systems upgrades and developing new games as well as maintaining the existing systems architecture.
India is renowned for being a centre of excellence as far as software development is concerned and the Group has been fortunate in being able to attract staff of the highest quality to this important area of its business.
Software development We have over 200 software engineers with an average of five years experience.
As we roll out more games, our technical expertise is expanding even further and remains a core element of our intellectual property.

PartyGamings marketing prowess has been a major factor behind the Groups success to date and has been built around three main marketing channels: direct both online and offline marketing : affiliates third parties that drive traffic to the Groups sites in return for a fee and through the use of bonuses that are offered to attract players to the Groups sites.
As well as seeking to recruit new players, the Group also has a broad variety of player retention initiatives, such as a VIP club and a reward scheme called PartyPoints.
These initiatives seek to encourage existing players to continue to play and ensure that they remain loyal and are not lured to other sites.
The direct channel is dominated by the use of television advertising and promotion.
Historically this has proved to be one of the most effective methods to drive new player sign-ups and has become the Groups preferred marketing tool.
In 2005, the Group invested in a number of television promotions, predominantly in the US, but also in several international territories.
Other forms of direct marketing include radio and billboard advertising, sponsorship, direct mail software on CDs, print media as well as online campaigns such as banner advertising and search engine promotions.
