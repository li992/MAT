8 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 Based on its peak potential Mangala has RAJASTHAN BLOCK RJ-ON-90 1 the ability to be one of the top 100 oil IN GREATER DETAIL producing fields in the world.
Sir Bill Gammell, Chief Executive SUCCESS IN RAJASTHAN Cairn first came into Rajasthan in 1997 but despite some The total of oil and gas discoveries on the block have now early technical success, it was only in mid 2003 when we had reached 17 with more than 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place.
acquired the full 100% of the equity that we were able to control the pace and extent of our exploration effort.
From Mangala, Bhagyam and Ashwariya in the northern section of the beginning we believed that the key ingredients for the block will form the focus of the future development with commercial success were present but it took perseverance the other discoveries feeding into the development system and more than a dozen wells to zero in on the oil fairway that will be put in place in the coming years.
which enabled us, more than two years ago, to discover first the Mangala eld, and then the Aishwariya and Bhagyam Cairns efforts over the past two years have demonstrated elds which collectively will underpin a project that could the world class potential of its Rajasthan acreage.
We now believe there is in excess discoveries in Rajasthan are continuing to get bigger and of 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place on our acreage, with the now have the potential to produce 150,000 bopd.
Production from Mangala is the first step in the process and In 1997 Cairn acquired a 10% interest in a large block in Cairns development team are focused on realising this Rajasthan, as part of a wider transaction including interests potential in due course.
Cairn increased its stake to 27.5% prior to the drilling of the first exploration well in 1998.
Cairns partner was discouraged by the result, but Cairn saw additional potential and increased its stake to 50% and drilled a second well which proved to be a discovery.
This discovery was approximately 200 miles away from any previously known oil, a classic high risk, wildcat well.
Between 1999 and 2001 Cairn sought unsuccessfully to persuade its partners to drill additional wells although one additional well which was a discovery was drilled in 2001.
In 2003 Cairn successfully acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Rajasthan for $7.25m.
During 2003 Cairn drilled 14 wells of which 10 successfully encountered hydrocarbons although none were of signi cant commercial value.
It was with the 16th well drilled in this basin, after a total expenditure on the licence of approximately $100m, that Cairn discovered Mangala: the biggest discovery in India for more than 20 years.
