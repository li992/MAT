Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 125 Financial review Capital management and resources Capital Ratios Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision the Basel Committee and European Union Directives, as implemented by the Financial Services Authority FSA for supervisory purposes.
These techniques include the risk asset ratio calculation, which the FSA regards as a key supervisory tool.
The FSA sets ratio requirements for individual banks in the UK at or above the internationally agreed minimum of 8%.
The ratio calculation involves the application of designated risk weightings to reflect an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with broad categories of transactions and counterparties.
Regulatory guidelines define three tiers of capital resources.
Tier 1 capital, comprising mainly shareholders funds and including Reserve Capital Instruments and Tier One Notes, is the highest tier and can be used to meet trading and banking activity requirements.
Tier 2 includes perpetual, medium-term and long-term subordinated debt, general provisions for bad and doubtful debts and fixed asset revaluation reserves.
Tier 2 capital can also be used to support both trading and banking activities.
Tier 3 capital also comprises short-term subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of two years.
The use of tier 3 capital is restricted to trading activities only and it is not eligible to support counterparty or settlement risk.
The aggregate of tiers 2 and 3 capital included in the risk asset ratio calculation may not exceed tier 1 capital.
