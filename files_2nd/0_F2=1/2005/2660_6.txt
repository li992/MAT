Gaming, in all its different guises of lotteries, poker, sports betting, casino gaming and so on, has continued to increase in popularity with consumers all over the 3 world.
In a recent study, GBGC reviewed 195 different countries and a total of 274 different jurisdictions and found there to be some form of licensed gaming activity in 254 of them.
Online gaming has proved to be one of the fastest growing segments of the overall gaming market, having grown at a compound annual growth rate since 1998 of over 50%.
Over the next few years it is estimated that the online gaming sector as a whole will grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 14%, reaching $25.2 billion by 2010, when it is forecast to represent some 7.7% of the global gaming market.
North America is the largest gaming market and its residents are estimated to have accounted for approximately 47% of global gross gaming yield in 2005, followed by Europe 28% and then Asia and the Middle East 16%.
The online gaming sector Online gaming is a subset of the global gaming market.
As there are no geographical or physical boundaries, customers can log on from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.
As such, given the potential, online gaming has attracted a large number of operators and despite being a young industry, is already a market that is highly competitive.
In 2005, it is estimated that there were over 2,400 online gaming websites 1 around the world as at February 2006, CasinoCity.
com, an independent casino and gaming directory, listed over 2,300 online gaming sites.
Whilst the barriers to entry for new entrants may appear to be low, the reality is that there remain significant challenges to delivering long-term success in this highly competitive market challenges to which PartyGaming has risen.
As a result, GBGC is predicting that the number of online gaming sites will decline in 2006 and also in 2007 and 2008.
This is partly due to anticipated consolidation in the sector, but also through the withdrawal of a number of smaller operators who are unable to make satisfactory returns.
The online gaming sector can be subdivided into different segments, with the largest individual segment being online sports betting, which in 2005 was estimated to have represented around 36% of total online gross gaming yield, followed by online 1 casinos 25% and poker 20%.
The two most important segments for PartyGaming are online poker and online casino.

North America probably has the most poker players in the world 4 and according to the American Gaming Association, nearly one in five American adults played poker during the previous 12 months a more than 50% increase over the number who indicated they had played during the previous year.
Online poker has a much shorter history and really began to 5 appear in a meaningful way in 1998, following increased broadband penetration around the world, but especially in the US, where a number of play for free sites were launched.
Since then, the popularity of poker and the suitability of the internet as a medium for allowing people to play games against each other have combined to deliver strong growth in both the number of people playing online poker and the total amount of revenue captured by the operators.

Player liquidity is therefore very important for attracting and retaining customers.
It also means that the larger sites have a greater variety of tournaments, starting on a regular basis and can offer larger cash prizes.
Control of software being able to upgrade, augment and add new features to software means that an operator can keep pace with changing consumer tastes, stay ahead of the competition and, should they arise, fix problems quickly.
Payment processing expertise offering a broad variety of mechanisms which are both easy to use as well as safe and secure is also key.
Gaining the trust of the consumer can only be achieved by executing payments quickly and safely.
Excellent customer service looking after the customer is a high priority and simply providing a product online is not enough.
Todays consumers expect to be able to speak to someone at a personal level to address issues that they may have with the service offered, as well as to help them complete their transactions online.
