Reserves The Groups proved and probable reserves by region on a working interest basis as at 31 December 2005 were 214.2 million barrels, compared with 245.4 million barrels at 31 December 2004.
The composition of these reserves and changes during the year, which are based on managements estimates, are shown in the table below.

Entitlement reserves represent the Groups share of future production net of government share in that production under the terms of the PSAs in question.
Government share is impacted inter alia by assumptions as to future oil prices.
Burrens PSAs all provide for the Operators costs to be substantially recovered via a priority allocation of oil production the Cost Oil.
As oil prices increase, so the amount of Cost Oil required to recover past costs reduces, thereby reducing the Operators share of production and so entitlement reserves.
Entitlement reserves are the basis on which the Groups depreciation charge is calculated.
The Groups entitlement reserves at 31 December 2005 were 104.2 million barrels compared with 145.7 million barrels at 31 December 2004.
Entitlement reserves at 31 December 2005 were computed using an assumed long term Brent oil price of US$40 bbl, compared with a long term price assumption of US$25 bbl at 31 December 2004.
The effect of this increase in assumed oil prices has been to significantly reduce Group entitlement reserves although the potential future monetary value of those reserves has increased as a result.
In 2005 the Group entered into an agreement with Socit Nationale des Petroles du Congo SNPC to sell to SNPC a 3.5% participating interest in the MBoundi field, thereby reducing its participating interest from 35% to 31.5%, subject to certain conditions among which was an increase in the term of the development license.
Although as at 31 December 2005 these conditions had not been met, it is managements expectation that they will be met in the foreseeable future.
The reserves in the table above have therefore been calculated on the basis of a 31.5% interest in MBoundi, assuming the transaction had been completed with effect from 31 December 2005.
The above table does not include any reserves attributable to the Groups 26% holding in HOEC.
As at 31 March 2005, according to HOEC management estimates, HOECs proven and probable reserves were 40 million boe and 34.0 million boe on a working interest and entitlement basis respectively.
