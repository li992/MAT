Resolution 9 That, the definition of adjusted capital and reserves in article 103 C i of the Companys Articles of Association be amended by the addition of the following article 103 C i f : f excluding the effect on the reserves of any retirement benefits scheme deficit or surplus net of associated deferred tax which would otherwise be included in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Board of the Company is required to restrict the borrowings of the Group such that they do not exceed twice the Companys share capital and consolidated reserves.
The implementation and application of IAS 19 and the International Financial Reporting Standards impacts upon accounting for retirement benefits scheme deficits and surpluses when calculating reserves.
