Going concern The Directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they have a reasonable expectation that Kingfisher has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.
Employee involvement The Board continues to emphasise high standards of customer care and service in each operating company.
The commitment of employees to this principle is crucial, and each operating company has developed channels of communication to help people to expand their knowledge of, and involvement with, Kingfisher.
These channels include attitude surveys, briefing groups, internal magazines and newsletters that report on business performance and objectives, community involvement and other issues.
Kingfishers intranet systems are also used to communicate results announcements to employees throughout the Group and to distribute information about other important business developments.
To supplement our existing communication vehicles within each business, the Kingfisher European Forum was established in 2003.
The Forum provides information and consultation with employee representatives from Kingfishers businesses in EU countries on specified trans-national business issues affecting those countries.
Training and links with the educational sector reinforce Kingfishers commitment to employee involvement and development.
Employees are also represented on the trustee board of Kingfishers UK pension arrangements.
All UK employees are entitled to participate in Kingfishers long-standing Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave, regardless of number of hours worked, provided they meet certain service conditions.
In addition, save as you earn plans operate in other countries along similar lines to the UK scheme, but taking account of different tax and legal requirements in each country.
Diversity Kingfisher is committed to treating employees and customers with dignity and respect, and to valuing the differences people bring to the business.
It is Kingfishers policy to: ensure that there is no discrimination in employment on grounds of race, gender, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or belief: implement measures in stores to ensure a level of customer service for disabled people equivalent to that offered to non-disabled people: and maintain a mechanism which customers and employees can use to give feedback on our performance, and ensure that all customer comments are analysed, responded to and acted upon.
Kingfisher and its businesses apply employment policies that are fair and equitable and which are designed to ensure that entry into, and progression within the Group, is determined solely by application of job criteria and personal ability and competence.
Progression has been made in a number of areas, such as training, flexible working, employment of mature people, employment of disabled people and striving to ensure that our employees reflect the cultural diversity of the communities where we operate.
