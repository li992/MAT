Investment Banking Super-boutique strategy targeting specific clients and market niches Outlook UK and Europe The pipeline is looking positive as a result of an increase in the number of planned IPOs and fundraisings as clients look to raise equity capital.
However, optimism should be tempered by a concern that a high level of fundraisings in the market may reduce investor demand.
Generally the client list is looking more active.
We have also gained traction in the market, shown by our pitching for syndicate roles on large floats as well as pitching and winning brokerships in larger corporates.
South Africa The corporate finance pipeline is reasonable which will maintain the current momentum and we expect black economic empowerment transactions to continue to drive activity.
Institutional Securities is well positioned to take advantage of the current buoyant market and we are leveraging our position as the top local securities house.
Furthermore, our focus will be on distributing the South African product into the UK and the USA markets.
The outlook for private equity remains positive based on the quality pipeline in place.
We continue to look for value creation opportunities.
We remain active in looking for direct investment opportunities while continuing to unlock further value from the portfolio and building quality black economic empowerment platforms.
Australia With strong recognition and brand building, the expanding Australian platform will provide growth opportunities in future.
