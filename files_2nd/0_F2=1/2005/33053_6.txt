Review of operations continued Hanson Aggregates North America Hanson Aggregates North America is one of the leading aggregates producers in the USA, operating in 17 states and Mexico.
The division is subdivided into four regions, namely the West, Southwest, Mideast and Northeast, each reporting into the divisional head office based in Dallas, Texas.
The largest state by group turnover in this division is California.
In 2005, California, Texas and Arizona accounted for around half of the divisions group turnover.
In addition, approximately one-third of 2005 group turnover was attributable to New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.
The division sold 129m metric tonnes of aggregates in 2005, and has approximately 11.1bn metric tonnes of mineral reserves and resources, either owned or leased, available for future extraction.
All major aggregates operations have at least 10 years of remaining mineral reserve life based on current production levels.

Group turnover increased to 980.6m in 2005 897.3m, an increase of 9.3%.
23.7m, or 2.6%, of this increase was due to acquisitions made in 2005.
Group operating margin was held at 14.1%.
Excluding property profits, the margin increased by 1.3ppts, from 12.5% to 13.8%.
Operating profit before impairments increased by 8.5% to 138.4m 127.6m.
Excluding property profits and acquisition earnings, this increase was 22.9m, or 20.2%.
Average price increases of 7.8% were achieved in aggregates, which offset increases in input costs, in particular fuel and power.
The price increases ranged from 5.8% in the Mideast to 13.9% in the West.
Total market demand across the USA is estimated to have increased in 2005 compared to 2004.
There can, however, be significant variation in regional demand patterns.
In our markets in 2005, aggregates volumes in California in 2005 were below those in 2004, while Arizona and south Texas showed strong demand, driven by high levels of residential construction and a recovery in industrial and commercial activity.
Reduced activity was experienced, however, in parts of the Shown at the New Bridgeport facility are Mideast and Northeast regions, most notably in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio Jim Kitzmiller, President and Chief Executive, and Indiana.
In certain markets, we selectively declined to compete for high volume Hanson Aggregates North America left, Thomas contracts at low margins.

the growing Dallas Fort Worth area.
Raw material cost pressures were significant in the downstream ready-mixed concrete and asphalt operations.
Average selling price increases of 12.8% in ready-mixed concrete recovered cost increases, in particular higher cement costs.
Average selling price increases of 11.5% in asphalt in part offset increases in the cost of bitumen and aggregate raw materials.

Review of operations continued Hanson Aggregates North America In common with aggregates, similar regional variations in demand were experienced in those markets where we have downstream products, except for ready-mixed concrete volumes in Arizona which were adversely affected by shortages of cement in the second half of the year.
As a consequence, heritage ready-mixed concrete volumes for the year declined by 5.3% and heritage asphalt volumes declined by 5.8%.
Demand for cement in California remained strong in 2005 and volumes increased by 6.3%.
Operational efficiencies at the plant offset part of the significant increases in the cost of fuel and power.
A number of major one off repair and maintenance programmes were undertaken in 2005.
Average price increases of 15.4% were achieved which, together with the volume increases, offset the increase in costs.
Capital expenditure initiatives progressed well in 2005, with total spend of 69.4m 74.6m.
Projects included a processing upgrade at Sylvania, Ohio, which should increase productivity and reduce costs.
In addition, we completed the replant, including the construction of a new rail terminal, at our Bridgeport quarry near Dallas, Texas and acquired land in Arizona which should allow us to expand operations in the Phoenix market.
Good progress was made this year with our acquisition strategy.
The integration of the Mission Valley Rock acquisition, bought in June 2005, is proceeding according to plan.
This acquisition significantly strengthens Hansons position in the strategically important San Francisco Bay area, with an additional 54m metric tonnes of reserves resources secured in this market.
In addition, the division acquired a group of aggregates operations in southern Indiana in December, providing access to over 115m metric tonnes of reserves resources and strengthening our position in the Louisville, Kentucky, market area.
An additional 80m metric tonnes of mineral reserves resources were secured in Irwindale, California, in 2005.
Outlook Market demand is expected to remain strong in 2006.
Further real price increases for 2006 were notified to customers in late 2005.
Such increases are required to recover higher input costs and to recognise the increasing scarcity of well-located mineral reserves and long-term history of below inflation price increases in previous years.
We intend to continue our growth initiatives in 2006, through a combination of capital investment to improve operating cost profiles and acquisitions to improve the asset portfolio and to ensure the supply of high quality product to our customers.

The division is subdivided into four Pipe & Precast regions, and the Brick & Tile group, each reporting into the divisional head office based in Dallas, Texas.
Texas is the largest state for this division by group turnover, followed by Florida, Ontario Canada and California.
In total, these four areas accounted for approximately 60% of the divisions group turnover.

Group turnover increased to 753.7m in 2005 647.4m, an increase of 16.4%.
28.8m, or 4.4%, of this increase was due to acquisitions made in 2005.
Group operating margin reduced from 17.2% to 16.5%.
This decline is due to changes in product mix through expansions of our precast operations, the impact of acquisitions and increases in costs and turnover, which reduce calculated margin, even when earnings have increased.
Operating profit before impairments increased by 13.0% to 125.7m 111.2m.
4.3m, or 3.9%, of this increase was due to acquisitions, mainly the Sherman Pipe facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
Excluding acquisitions and property profit of 0.5m nil, the increase was 8.7%.
The impact of foreign exchange was a benefit of 2.6m.
Operating profit before impairments for Pipe & Precast increased by 14.7m, or 19.3%, to 90.8m 76.1m, of which 4.3m was due to acquisitions.
Average price increases of 12.0% combined with effective cost control and good operating efficiencies offset input cost inflation in steel, cement and energy.
Heritage volumes for concrete products increased by 3.1% during 2005.
The strongest markets for concrete products in 2005 were in the south east principally Florida and the north east principally South Virginia, Washington DC and Ontario.
Volumes in key Texas markets were disrupted by the most active hurricane season on record and by delays on several major pipe projects in south Texas in the second half.

Review of operations continued Hanson Building Products North America The division achieved notable success in 2005 with its acquisition growth initiatives, completing three acquisitions in the year and one in early 2006.
The largest of the three acquisitions was Sherman Pipe which has ten facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
These plants are an excellent strategic fit with the existing heritage facilities in the south east region.
Two smaller strategic acquisitions were completed in Ohio and Rhode Island to complement the heritage facilities in the north east region.
Initial integration of these acquisitions has gone very well and all three are performing ahead of pro forma expectations.
In January 2006, the division acquired PaverModule which is one of the top two suppliers of concrete pavers in Florida.
Building Products other major growth initiative is a significant programme of greenfield capital investment and upgrades to existing pipe and precast and brick and tile facilities.
Three new precast plants were successfully commissioned in 2005, two in Texas and one in California, which have enhanced our existing product offerings in key markets.
Approval has recently been given for the construction of three new concrete products facilities in Texas, Arizona and Florida, and for the construction of a new greenfield roof tile plant near Jacksonville in Florida.
Commissioning of these facilities should occur during the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007.
Outlook Demand is expected to remain robust overall during 2006.
The order backlog remains strong, at good prices, and was $450m at December 31, 2005 $400m.
