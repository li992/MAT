9 Financial instruments The Group uses a limited number of financial instruments to manage the financial risks faced by the Group comprising cash, short-term deposits, bank overdrafts and various items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from operations.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are those of interest rate, exchange rate and liquidity.
The Group manages interest rate risk by placing Interest Rate Swap Agreements against at least 75% of loan debt, the rest being liable to interest at the prevailing rate.
Foreign exchange risk is minimised by a purchasing goods for resale in local currency and b utilising the European cash flows to settle loan repayments required in Euros.
In respect of liquidity risk, the Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with our bankers at commercial rates, all accounts having at least a double-A rating.
At 30 April 2005 the Group held overdrafts net of cash balances of 4.2 million 1 May 2004: 7.8 million net cash balance.
10 International Financial Reporting Standards The Group will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for its report and accounts for the year ending 29 April 2006.
The Groups full year results for the year to 30 April 2005 were prepared under UK GAAP.
It is planned to publish the unaudited restatement of these results under IFRS on 27 September 2005.
11 Creditors payment policy While the Group does not follow any formal code or standard on payment practice, it agrees terms and conditions for its business transactions when orders for goods and services are placed, and includes the relevant terms in contracts where appropriate.

The number of trade creditor days outstanding at the period end for the Company was 52 days 2004: 57 days.
12 Purchase and cancellation of Ordinary shares At the 2004 Annual General Meeting shareholders gave the Company renewed authority to purchase a maximum of 6,962,632 shares of 1p each, ie up to 10% of the issued share capital.
During the year under review, the Company purchased for cancellation 1,829,000 Ordinary shares of 1p each under the authority 2004: 3,997,000 representing 2.6% of the shares in issue at the end of the period and the total cost, including fees and taxes, was 17.8 million.
The purchase by the Company of its own shares demonstrates the Companys continued commitment to ensuring that its balance sheet is managed in the long-term interests of the shareholders.
A resolution seeking renewal of the authority will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
13 Annual General Meeting In addition to resolutions to adopt the accounts, declare a final dividend, approve the Directors remuneration report, re-elect Directors and reappoint the auditors, five further resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The first is to give the Directors general power to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 225,991 equal to approximately 33.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority, which will lapse at the 2006 Annual General Meeting, but retain the authority to do so.
The second is to disapply the statutory rights of pre-emption contained in section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to rights issues and issues for cash not exceeding 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power which will terminate at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
The third resolution will renew an existing authority which gives the Company power to purchase its own shares within limits as to number of shares and price.
The Directors will only exercise the authority if they are satisfied that any purchase will increase the earnings per share of the Ordinary share capital in issue and will be in the interests of the shareholders.
Options over 385,560 Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company were outstanding as at 22 June 2005 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report representing 0.57% of the issued share capital of the Company as at that date.
If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under the proposed resolution, the options outstanding as at 22 June 2005 would represent 0.63% of the Ordinary share capital in issue following such exercise.
The fourth resolution is to consider and, if thought fit, approve adjustments to the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2005 20 The fifth resolution is to approve a change to the Companys Articles of Association to reflect new statutory provisions relating to the indemnification of directors by the Company.
Article 175 of the Companys current Articles of Association provides that every Director or other officer of the Company shall be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all losses and liabilities incurred in the execution of the duties of his office provided that the indemnity shall only have effect in so far as its provisions are not void under section 310 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
With effect from 6 April 2005, the Act has been amended under the provisions of the Companies Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise Act 2004.
New sections 309A to 309C and 337A of the Act have introduced a new, more relaxed regime for directors indemnities, and section 310 is no longer relevant to directors indemnities.
Amongst other things, the new regime has introduced a new power for companies to indemnify their directors against certain liabilities to third parties and permit companies to pay directors defence costs as they are incurred.
To enable the Company to take advantage of the new regime, a change is required to this Article.
The proposed new article 175 replicates the indemnity for directors which is currently in place and gives new powers to the Company to extend the scope of the indemnity and pay directors defence costs, at its discretion, on the terms permitted by the new sections 309A to 309C and 337A of the Act.
Any indemnity to be granted pursuant to the new provisions will be subject to board approval and will be disclosed in the annual Directors Remuneration Report.
Resolution 13 relates to the approval of this change.
14 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Long-Term Incentive Plan was introduced in 2004 to reward the Executive Directors and senior managers on the basis of achievement of long-term profit performance.
The Company wishes to amend the limits applicable to possible awards to Directors.
Details of the proposed changes to the LTIP are included in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 30.
The Company will seek approval of the shareholders to the amendments to the LTIP at the forthcoming AGM.
Resolution 12 relates to the approval of these changes.
A copy of the draft revised rules of the 2004 LTIP will be available for inspection at the Companys registered office and at the offices of Travers Smith at 10 Snow Hill, London EC1A 2AL during normal business hours on any weekday from the date of this report until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for a period of 15 minutes prior to that meeting until the close of that meeting.
15 Post balance sheet event On 27 June 2005 Carpetright plc entered into a contract to purchase Mays Holdings Limited, trading as Mays Carpets from three stores at Abingdon, Cheltenham and Swindon.
Details are given in the Operating review on page 9.
16 Auditors During the year KPMG Audit plc resigned as the Companys auditors and  LLP were appointed as auditors.
 LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company and, in accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing its re-appointment will be put to the members at the Annual General Meeting.
