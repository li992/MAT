The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU IFRS, which differs in certain respects from the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia Australian IFRS.
The transition to EU IFRS as at 1 January 2004 was based on the Group's previous UK GAAP financial statements.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998 was eliminated directly against equity.
Under IFRS 1, goodwill previously recognised as a reduction in equity is not reinstated on transition to IFRS.
The Australian equivalent, AASB 1, does not include this relief provision.
As a consequence, shareholders funds under Australian IFRS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$743 million at 31 December 2005.
Also, the profit on disposal of certain operations in 2004 is reduced by US$129 million under Australian IFRS as a result of the balance of goodwill relating to those operations.

Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss for instance, when the forecast sale that is being hedged takes place.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting: Certain derivative contracts entered into by the Group in order to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates against the US dollar are not located in the entity with the exposure.
Such contracts, and any other derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are marked to market at the balance sheet date.
In respect of currency swaps, the gain or loss on the swap and the offsetting gain or loss on the financial asset or liability against which the swap forms an economic hedge are shown in separate lines in the income statement.
In respect of other derivatives, the mark to market will give rise to charges or credits to the income statement in periods before the transaction against which the derivative is held as an economic hedge is recognised.
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to their host contracts.
Prior to 1 January 2005, derivative financial instruments were accounted for as follows: Amounts receivable and payable in respect of interest rate swaps were recognised as adjustments to net interest over the life of the contract.
Derivative contracts which had been entered into by the Group in respect of its firm commitments or anticipated transactions, in order to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates against the US dollar or to fluctuations against commodity prices, and which were located in the entity with the exposure, were accounted for as hedges: gains and losses were deferred and subsequently recognised when the hedged transaction occurred.
Where such contracts were not located in the entity with the exposure they were fair valued at the balance sheet date.
This gave rise to charges or credits to the income statement in periods before the transaction against which the derivative was held as an economic hedge was recognised.
Where contracts and financial instruments contained embedded derivatives, the derivative element was not treated as a separate derivative.

5 IMPAIRMENT CHARGES 2005 Impairment charges There were no significant impairment charges or reversals in 2005.
2004 Impairment charges Against a background of adverse financial results, including limited production from the underground mine and the strengthening of the rand against the US dollar, an assessment of the recoverable amount of Palaboras copper business was undertaken in the second half of 2004.
This resulted in a provision for asset impairment of US$398 million US$161 million after tax and outside shareholders interests which aligned the balance sheet value of the assets with their recoverable amount, based on an assessment of fair value less costs to sell.
In line with market practice, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.
The price assumption for copper was based on prevailing market prices for the first two years and long term forecast prices thereafter.
The rand exchange rate was forecast principally based on an historical average.
The cash flow forecasts were discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent.
A detailed review of the mine plan and projected cash flows of the Colowyo coal business was undertaken in June 2004.
This cash generating unit is part of Kennecott Energy.
The review indicated that future operating and development costs would be substantially higher than previously expected.
As a consequence, a provision for asset impairment of US$160 million was recognised, based on an assessment of value in use.
The pre-tax cash flows were estimated in real terms and discounted at five per cent per annum.
The major area of uncertainty affecting the write down related to the future operating and development costs of the Colowyo operation, which were estimated over the next 18 years.

The amounts disclosed above as at 31 December 2005 include Australian Iron Ores carrying amount of goodwill of US$366 million, the Argyle Diamonds balance of US$218 million and goodwill of US$236 million relating to Kennecott Energy.
Australian Iron Ore comprises the business units located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia that mine iron ore, namely Robe River and Hamersley Iron.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill relating to Australian Iron Ore, Argyle Diamonds, and Kennecott Energy have been assessed based on value in use calculations.
The valuations are based on cash flow projections that incorporate best estimates of selling prices, ore grades, production rates, future capital expenditure and production costs over the life of each mine.
In line with normal practice in the mining industry, the cash flow projections are based on long term mine plans covering the currently expected life of each operation.
The projections therefore generally cover periods well in excess of five years.
The valuations are particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions about selling prices, exchange rates and discount rates.
The future selling prices for iron ore and coal have been estimated in line with the policy in note 1 i.
The long term average selling prices of iron ore and coal were forecast from analysis of the costs of the producers in each industry sector, except that certain customers receive coal under fixed price contracts, in which case the contracted prices are used.
Forecast diamond prices are based on current market prices with modifications based on specific understandings with major customers.
Exchange rate assumptions were based on the spot rates as of the time of the annual goodwill impairment review.
The exchange rate of most significance to these impairment reviews was the Australian dollar exchange rate, for which a rate of US$0.73 was used.
Discount rates represent an estimate of the rate the market would expect having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
The Groups weighted average cost of capital is used as a start point for determining the discount rate with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the individual cash generating unit.
Australian Iron Ore, Argyle Diamonds and Kennecott Energy have all been valued using a pre-tax discount rate which is equivalent to a post tax discount rate of 5.5 per cent.
The valuation for Argyle Diamonds is also particularly sensitive to the capital and operating cost assumptions associated with the recently announced block cave underground project and related open pit cutback.
These assumptions are based on the best estimates of costs available at the time of approval of these projects.
Impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions Australian Iron Ore and Kennecott Energy It does not appear that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions on which Australian Iron Ore or Kennecott Energys recoverable amounts are based would cause their respective values to fall short of their carrying amounts at 31 December 2005.
Argyle Argyles recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value amount by approximately US$100 million.
If any of the following changes were assumed, Argyles recoverable amount would equal its carrying amount: An increase of three percentage points in the discount rate: A strengthening of the Australian dollar exchange rate to US$0.76 from US$0.73: The use of a diamond price that was five per cent lower than current market prices in real terms throughout the life of the operation rather than the current assumption: and An increase of 19 per cent in capital costs or ten per cent in operating costs related to the underground development and open pit extension, from the current assumptions.
Other Under IAS 36, goodwill is no longer amortised but reviewed annually for impairment.
The Groups business relates to the mining and processing of finite resources and it is therefore likely that impairments of certain elements of the goodwill may occur at some stage in the future as resources are depleted.

They are a fundamental tenet of the Groups long term strategy.
The Groups business is mining and not trading.
The Group only sells commodities it has produced.
In the long term, natural hedges operate in a number of ways to help protect and stabilise earnings and cash flow, obviating the need to use derivatives or other forms of synthetic hedging for this purpose.
Such hedging is therefore undertaken to a strictly limited degree, as described below.
The Group has a diverse portfolio of commodities and markets, which have varying responses to the economic cycle.
The relationship between commodity prices and the currencies of most of the countries in which the Group operates provides further natural protection.
In addition, the Groups policy of borrowing at floating US dollar interest rates helps to counteract the effect of economic and commodity price cycles.
Rio Tinto does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes: nor does it believe that it has exposure to such trading or speculative holdings through its investments in joint ventures and associates.
Derivatives are used to separate funding and cash management decisions from currency exposure and interest rate management.
The Group uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with longer term funds raised in the capital markets to achieve a floating rate obligation which is consistent with the Groups interest rate policy.
Currency swaps are used to convert debt or investments into currencies, primarily the US dollar, which are consistent with the Groups policy on currency exposure management.
Foreign exchange risk Rio Tintos shareholders equity, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a wide variety of currencies due to the geographic diversity of the Groups sales and the countries in which it operates.
The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the great majority of the Groups sales are denominated.
Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where the Groups mines and processing plants are located and also by those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
The Australian and Canadian dollars are the most important currencies apart from the US dollar influencing costs.
Details of the derivative financial instruments entered into to manage the Group's exposure to currencies other than the US dollar are provided in Note A below.
Given the dominant role of the US currency in the Groups affairs, the US dollar is the currency in which financial results are presented both internally and externally.
It is also the most appropriate currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of surplus cash may also be held in other currencies, most notably Australian dollars, in order to meet short term operational and capital commitments and dividend payments.
The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars, either directly or using currency swaps, and a substantial part of the Group's US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having functional currencies other than the US dollar.
The Group does not generally believe that active currency hedging would provide long term benefits to shareholders.
Currency protection measures may be deemed appropriate in specific commercial circumstances and are subject to strict limits laid down by the Rio Tinto board.
As set out in Note A below, as at 31 December 2005 there were forward contracts, including synthetic forwards, to sell US$512 million in respect of future trading transactions.
A significant part of the above hedge book was acquired with North Limited.
North held a substantial hedge book on acquisition which has been retained but is not being renewed as maturities occur.
Interest rate risk Rio Tintos interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates.
Short term US dollar rates are normally lower than long term rates, resulting in lower interest costs to the Group.
Furthermore, cyclical movements of interest rates tend to compensate in the long term, to an extent, for those of commodity prices.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
At the end of 2005, US$703 million of the Groups debt was at fixed rates after taking into account interest rate swaps.
Based on the Groups net debt at 31 December 2005, and with other variables unchanged, the approximate effect on the Groups net earnings of a one percentage point increase in US dollar LIBOR interest rates would be a reduction of US$4 million.
Commodity price risk The Groups normal policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices.
Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid down by the Rio Tinto board and to rigid internal controls.
Rio Tintos exposure to commodity prices is diversified by virtue of its broad commodity spread and the Group does not generally believe commodity price hedging would provide long term benefit to shareholders.
During 2005, forward contracts to sell 509 million pounds of copper at a fixed rand price per pound were entered into as a condition of the refinancing of Palabora.
Credit risk No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non performance of the counterparties to financial instruments, other than trade and other receivables held by the Group.
Given the large number of internationally dispersed customers the Group has limited concentration of credit risk, with regard to its trade and other receivables, which is closely monitored.

For 2004, financial instruments were not marked to market except in the case of exchange rate derivatives that did not qualify as hedges under IAS 21.
The adoption of IAS 39 resulted in a US$90 million increase in equity attributable to Rio Tinto shareholders at 1 January 2005.
This was net of consequential increases in deferred tax liabilities of US$24 million, and outside equity shareholders interests of US$19 million.
This represents the net gain on marking to market of qualifying hedges, embedded derivatives, available for sale investments and certain derivatives that do not qualify as hedges.
The major balance sheet line items affected were financial assets: increase of US$287 million, financial liabilities: increase of US$66 million, and borrowings: increase of US$69 million.
The net impact on other balance sheet items was a reduction in total assets of US$19 million.
Financial instrument disclosures Except where stated, the information given below relates to the financial instruments of the parent companies and their subsidiaries and jointly controlled assets, and excludes those of jointly controlled entities and associates.

This results in an accounting exposure to exchange gains and losses as the financial assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency of the subsidiary that accounts for those assets and liabilities.
These gains and losses are recorded in the Group income statement except to the extent that they can be taken to equity under the Groups accounting policy which is explained in Note 1.
After taking into account relevant derivative instruments, almost all of the Groups net debt is either denominated in US dollars or in the functional currency of the entity holding the debt.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.

Access to the mine site has not been possible and an accurate assessment of the condition of the assets cannot be determined.
Considerable funding would be required to recommence operations to the level which applied at the time of the mines closure in 1989 and these funding requirements cannot be forecast accurately.
The directors do not have access to reliable, verifiable or objective information on BCL and the directors have therefore decided not to consolidate BCL information in the financial statements.
BCL reported a net profit of nil for the financial year 2004: profit of US$0.6 million.
This is based upon actual transactions for the financial year.
The aggregate amount of capital and reserves reported by BCL as at 31 December 2005 was US$112 million 2004: US$106 million.
The Group owns 214,887,966 shares in BCL, representing 53.6 per cent of the issued share capital.
The investment of US$195 million was impaired in 1991.
At 31 December 2005, the market value of the shareholding in BCL based on the quoted share price was US$102 million.
48 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS At 31 December 2005, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have a number of share based payment plans, which are described below.
These plans have been accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2, Share based Payments, which means that IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of employee share based payments that had not vested as at 1 January 2004.
The compensation cost and related liability that have been recognised for Rio Tintos share based compensation plans are set out in the table below.

The significant assumptions used in the valuation model are disclosed below.
Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of Rio Tintos share returns under the UK and Australian listings.
Historical data were used to estimate employee turnover rates within the valuation model.
Under the Fixed Share Option Plans and the Performance Based Share Option Plans, it is assumed that after options have vested, 20 per cent p. a. of participants will exercise their options when the market price is at least 20 per cent above the exercise price of the option.
The implied lifetime of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk free rate used in the valuation model is equal to the yield available on UK and Australian zero coupon government bonds for plc and Limited options respectively at the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term of the options.
Fixed share option plans The Rio Tinto Share Savings Plan is open to all employees.
Employees who participate save a fixed amount from pay to a savings account for a term of between two and five years depending on their location of employment and local legislation.
At the end of the savings term, the employees have a choice of using the money to buy shares in the Company, withdrawing the money, or a combination of both.
The option to buy shares is based on a fixed exercise price which is equal to the market price of the Companys shares on the day of grant less a 15 or 20 per cent discount depending on location.
The awards are settled in equity.
The fair value of each award on the day of grant was estimated using a lattice-based option valuation model, including allowance for the exercise price being at a discount to market price.
The key assumptions used in the valuation are noted in the following table.

Performance-based share option plans Under the Rio Tinto Share Option Plan 1998, Rio Tinto Share Plan 2004 and Rio Tinto Inland Revenue Approved Share Option Plan 2004, the Company grants selected executives and other key employees share option awards.
For pre-2004 awards, vesting is contingent upon achieving increases in the Groups earnings per share above certain predetermined target levels over a three year performance period.
There is an annual retest on a three year rolling basis until options fully vest or lapse at the end of the option period.
This is a non market condition under IFRS 2: as such, a best estimate of the service period over which compensation cost is recognised is made at the grant date and revised to reflect changes in the Groups earnings per share and market expectations for future earnings per share growth.
For awards granted prior to 2004, the fair value is calculated assuming the performance conditions will be achieved.
If such conditions are not met, the previously recognised compensation cost is then reversed.
For awards granted from 2004, vesting is contingent on the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR equalling or outperforming that of the HSBC Global Mining Index over a three year period.
Vesting is based on a sliding scale with zero vesting for performance below the index up to full vesting for performance of five per cent p. a. above the index.
For grants made before the end of 2006, a single fixed base retest will be made five years after the date of the grant.
No retest will be made for grants made after 2006.
These market conditions have been incorporated in the measurement of fair value for these awards by modelling the correlation between Rio Tintos TSR and that of the index.
The relationship between Rio Tintos TSR and the index was simulated many thousands of times to derive a distribution which, in conjunction with the lattice based option valuation model, was used to determine the fair value of the options.
The Group has a policy of settling these awards in equity, although the directors at their discretion can offer a cash alternative.
The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

Employee share purchase plan The Rio Tinto Share Ownership Plan is a UK Inland Revenue approved share incentive plan which was approved by Rio Tinto plc shareholders at the 2001 annual general meeting and introduced in 2002.
Under this plan, eligible employees may save up to 125 per month, which the plan administrator invests in Rio Tinto plc shares Partnership Shares.
Rio Tinto matches these purchases on a one for one basis Matching Shares.
In addition, eligible employees can receive an annual award of Rio Tinto shares up to a maximum of five per cent of salary, subject to a cap of 3,000 Free Shares.
The fair values of awards of Matching and Free Shares made by Rio Tinto are taken to be the market value of the shares on the date of purchase.
The minimum service requirement for employees to benefit from Matching Shares is one year after they are awarded: there is no minimum service requirement to be able to benefit from the award of Free Shares.
For accounting purposes, both Matching and Free Shares are assumed to vest immediately.
These awards are settled in equity.
A summary of the shares awarded under the Companys employee share purchase plan during the year ended 31 December 2005 is presented below.

Under this plan, eligible senior executives and other key employees are annually awarded a conditional right to receive shares.
These rights only vest if the performance conditions approved by the Remuneration committee are satisfied.
The current performance condition compares Rio Tintos TSR against a comparator group of 15 other international mining companies over a four year period.
For executive directors and product group CEOs, vesting is based on a sliding scale from zero vesting for TSR performance below that of the company ranked eighth in the comparator group, up to 150 per cent vesting for first or second place TSR performance.
A different scale applies for other employees.
Awards are released to participants in the form of shares or an equivalent amount in cash, as selected by the participant.
For executive directors and product group CEOs, a cash payment will be made equivalent to the dividends that accrued during the vesting period in relation to awards made from 2004.
The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to cash settled share based payment transactions.
If any awards are ultimately settled in shares, the liability is transferred direct to equity as the consideration for the equity instruments issued.
The grant date fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares including dividends expected to be payable during the vesting period at the date of award reduced by 50 per cent for anticipated relative TSR performance.
In accordance with the method of accounting for liability awards, fair values are subsequently remeasured each year to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
It is assumed all senior executives remain in current employment.

Some of these plans are defined contribution, but the majority are funded defined benefit plans, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Valuations of these plans are produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.
Pension plans The majority of the Groups pension obligations are in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.
In the UK, the main pension arrangement is the Rio Tinto Pension Fund, a funded tax approved plan.
The plan has defined benefit and defined contribution sections: the defined benefit section of the plan gives benefits related to final average pay and was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2005.
New employees are admitted to the defined contribution section.
In Australia, the Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund is the only significant plan.
This plan principally contains defined contribution liabilities but also has defined benefit liabilities.
The defined benefits are linked to final average pay and are typically paid in lump sum form.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US and Canadian entities, typically with separate provision for salaried and hourly paid staff.
Benefits for salaried staff include benefits linked to final average pay and benefits determined according to an accumulated cash balance.
Benefits for hourly paid staff are reviewed in negotiation with unions.
The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.
Post retirement healthcare plans Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria.

For both the pension and healthcare arrangements the post retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality tables used for the main arrangements imply that a male aged 60 at the balance sheet date has an expected future lifetime of 24 years 2004: 24 years.
b The assumptions vary by location for the Other plans.
Assumptions shown are for Africa.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long term returns of the major asset classes equities, bonds, property and other weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return is calculated using geometric averaging.
The sources used to determine managements best estimate of long term returns are numerous and include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations as applicable.

These contributions are charged against profits, and included in the figures for current service cost shown above.
In addition, contributions of US$12 million 2004: US$11 million were made to 401 k plans in the US.
Contributions of US$5 million 2004: US$4 million were made to an industry wide arrangement that is principally defined contribution in nature.
This arrangement, which has defined benefit assets of approximately US$20 million, exposes the participating entities to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employees of other entities, with the result that there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligation, plan assets and cost to individual entities participating in the plan.
Consequently, this plan has been accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
Surpluses or deficits in this arrangement are not expected to have a material effect on the Group.
In relation to pensions, there are currently no significant regular employer or employee contributions to the UK plans.
The next formal valuation of the Rio Tinto Pension Fund is due on 31 March 2006, after which contributions into the Fund may be required.
Contributions are made to the main Australian plan according to the recommendation of the plan actuary and are primarily to a mixed defined benefit defined contribution arrangement included in the above figures.
In North America, contributions are agreed annually in nominal terms.
Whilst contributions for 2006 are yet to be determined, contributions in the UK, Australia and Africa are expected to be broadly in line with 2005 contributions.
Contributions for 2006 are expected to be around US$20 million higher than in 2005 for Canadian plans and around US$40 million lower than in 2005 for US plans.
Healthcare plans are unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be predetermined.
Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and in the fair value of assets The amounts shown below include, where appropriate, 100 per cent of the costs, contributions, gains and losses in respect of employees who participate in the plans and who are employed in operations that are proportionally consolidated or equity accounted.
Consequently, the costs, contributions, gains and losses do not correspond directly to the amounts disclosed above in respect of the Group.
Pure defined contribution plans and industry-wide plans are excluded from the movements below.

50 RECONCILIATION OF PROFIT FOR 2004 AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY UNDER UK GAAP TO EU IFRS The previously published financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 were reported under UK GAAP.
The analysis below shows a reconciliation of shareholders equity and profit as reported under UK GAAP, as at 31 December 2004, to the revised shareholders equity and profit under IFRS as reported in these financial statements.
In addition, there is a reconciliation of shareholders equity under UK GAAP to IFRS at the transition date for this Group, being 1 January 2004.

The principal differences between UK GAAP and EU IFRS impacting on the Groups financial statements are explained as follows.
Reversal of goodwill amortisation The systematic amortisation of goodwill under UK GAAP, by an annual charge to the profit and loss account, ceased under IFRS.
The carrying value of goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Rio Tinto 2005 Annual report and financial statements 159 NOTES TO THE 2005 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 200 5 81795x 2070 n 27 2 06 9:57 PM Page 160 Notes to the 2005 financial statements continued 50 RECONCILIATION OF PROFIT FOR 2004 AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY UNDER UK GAAP TO EU IFRS CONTINUED Post retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group applied SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension Costs, under which post retirement benefit surpluses and deficits were spread over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
Under IAS 19 the basis of calculating the surplus or deficit differs from SSAP 24.
In addition, IAS 19 permits three alternative ways in which the surplus or deficit can be recognised.
The Group has chosen to recognise actuarial gains and losses directly in shareholders equity via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
The annual service cost and net financial income on the assets and liabilities of the Groups post retirement benefit plans are recognised through earnings.
Share based payments Under UK GAAP, no cost was recognised in respect of the Groups share option schemes.
IFRS requires the economic cost of share option plans to be recognised by reference to fair value on the grant date and charged to the income statement over the expected vesting period.
Deferred tax on fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions IFRS requires deferred tax to be recognised on all fair value adjustments, other than those recorded as goodwill.
The profit under IFRS will benefit as the additional deferred tax provisions are released to the Income Statement in line with the amortisation of the related fair value adjustments.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the increase in deferred tax provisions was reflected as a reduction in opening shareholders equity.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2004, these additional deferred tax provisions are offset by increases to the value of goodwill or other acquired assets.
Deferred tax on unremitted earnings Under UK GAAP, tax was only provided on unremitted earnings to the extent that dividends were accrued or if there was a binding agreement for the distribution of earnings at the reporting date.
Under IFRS, full provision must be made for tax arising on unremitted earnings from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies, except to the extent that the Group can control the timing of remittances and remittance is not probable in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax related to closure costs Under IFRS, deferred tax is not provided on the depreciation of capitalised closure costs, except to the extent that the capitalised amount was first recognised in accounting for an acquisition.
Profits on disposal of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and undeveloped properties In 2004, the majority of additional profit on disposals under IFRS arose because under UK GAAP goodwill that had been eliminated against reserves at the time of the acquisition was reinstated and charged against earnings at the time of disposal.
Such reinstatement does not apply under IFRS.
Exchange differences on net debt The Group finances its operations primarily in US dollars.
A substantial part of the Groups US dollar debt is located in subsidiaries having functional currencies other than the US dollar.
Under IFRS, exchange gains and losses relating to such US dollar debt and also certain intragroup financing balances are included in the Group US dollar income statement, whereas under UK GAAP they were taken to reserves.
Mark to market of derivative contracts Some derivative contracts that qualified for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, for example because the instrument is not located in the operation which carries the exposure.
These contracts are marked to market under IFRS, thereby giving rise to charges or credits to the income statement in periods before the hedged transaction is recognised.
Exchange differences on capital expenditure hedges Some of the derivative contracts that were taken out to fix the non US dollar component of capital expenditure in previous periods do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.
The adjustment to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, that under UK GAAP had been stated net of realised exchange gains and losses on forward contracts hedging capital expenditure, increases shareholders equity by US$93 million.
Dividends Under IFRS, dividends that do not represent a present obligation at the reporting date are not included in the balance sheet.
Hence, the Companies proposed dividends are not recognised in the Group accounts until the period in which they are declared by the directors or approved by shareholders.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates The basis for determining the presentation of partly owned operations in the Groups financial statements differs in certain respects between IFRS and UK GAAP.
The Group has decided to adopt equity accounting for all jointly controlled entities.
Adjustments to the cash flow statement The pre-tax cash flows from operations for the year ended 31 December 2004, including dividends from jointly controlled entities and associates, were similar to those under UK GAAP.
Some operations equity accounted under UK GAAP are proportionally consolidated under IFRS, and viceversa, with the effect that the increase in cash flow from subsidiary operations is largely offset by lower reported dividends from jointly controlled entities and associates.
Changes between proportional consolidation and equity accounting also resulted in an additional US$52 million being recognised in the Group cash flow statement for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and a US$33 million reduction in the funding of joint ventures and associates capital expenditure.
In addition to the effect of changes between proportional consolidation and equity accounting, the Groups capital expenditure was increased by a further US$78 million as the result of the separate presentation of realised gains on currency forward contracts related to the purchase and construction of fixed assets.
These gains are presented in the restated cash flow statement within cash flows relating to derivatives.
In accordance with IAS 7 Cash flow statements, cash equivalents include certain bank deposits with a maturity of greater than 24 hours.
These were previously shown as current asset investments, as they did not fall within the definition of cash according to UK GAAP.
The effect of this reclassification was a US$67 million decrease in cash and cash equivalent inflows for the year ended 31 December 2004, and an additional US$103 million being categorised as cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.

As permitted by section 230 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account for the Rio Tinto plc parent company is shown.
The Rio Tinto plc company balance sheet, and also its company profit and loss account, were approved by the directors on 24 February 2006 and the balance sheet is signed on their behalf by: Paul Skinner Leigh Clifford Guy Elliott Chairman Chief executive Finance director 164 Rio Tinto 2005 Annual report and financial statements RIO TINTO PLC 200 5 81795x 2070 p 27 2 06 10:08 PM Page 165 A PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES UNDER UK GAAP a Basis of Accounting The Rio Tinto plc entity financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The directors have reviewed the Companys existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies.
The following new standards have been implemented: FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, FRS 20 Share-based Payments, FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation, and FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement.
The Companys accounting policies are otherwise consistent with last year.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 17, the Company applied SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under which pension surpluses and deficits were spread over the average remaining service lives of relevant current employees.
Under FRS 17, the contributions paid to the Rio Tinto Pension Fund are accounted for as if the scheme is a defined contribution scheme, as the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Rio Tinto Pension Fund on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been restated following the implementation of FRS 17, which has reduced shareholders funds by US$87 million.
The restatement comprised a decrease in prepayments of US$133 million and a decrease in deferred tax provisions of US$46 million.
The adoption of FRS 17 has also reduced profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by US$2 million.
There is no charge or credit to the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 20, the Company did not recognise share based payments to Group employees such as share option schemes other than the issue of shares and the related receipt of cash.
FRS 20 requires that where the Companys shares, or rights to the Companys shares, are granted to Group employees, an increase should be recognised in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the employees reside.
The increase in cost is based on the fair value of the share based payment at the date of grant, which is recognised over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the profit and loss account reserve.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share based payments result in an adjustment to reduce the cost of the investment.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been restated following the implementation of FRS 20, which has increased shareholders funds by US$42 million.
The adoption of FRS 20 has had no impact on the Companys profit.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 21, dividends were recognised in the period to which they related.
Under FRS 21, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid, and final dividends are recognised when they are approved by shareholders.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been restated following implementation of FRS 21, which has increased shareholders funds by US$481 million, representing the final dividend payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.
Under FRS 21, this dividend has been recognised in 2005, when it was approved by shareholders.
This change in accounting policy has not affected the Companys dividend income for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2005, and so has not affected the net profit for either year.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 23, the Company applied SSAP 20 Foreign Currency Translation.
The adoption of FRS 23 has resulted in the reclassification of US$194 million of reserves arising from a change in functional currency to the US dollar, to reflect the retranslation of the Companys share capital, share premium and profit and loss account reserve at the historic exchange rate on the date of change.
Under previous accounting rules, the translation adjustment was accounted for within other reserves.
The restatement comprised an increase in share capital of US$17 million, an increase in share premium of US$172 million, and an increase in profit and loss account reserve of US$5 million offset by a decrease in other reserves of US$194 million.
There is no impact on the Companys net assets or profit and loss account from the adoption of FRS 23.
The adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 has not impacted on the amounts reported in the Companys financial statements.
b Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis.
c Currency translation The Companys functional currency is the US dollar.
Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
d Investments Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment provisions.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Companys weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.
e Share based payments Most of the Companys share based payment plans are settled by the issue of shares.
In such cases, the fair value of the grant is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work.
The fair value is recognised over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the profit and loss account reserve.
The fair value of these share based payments is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market-based vesting conditions attached to the award eg Total Shareholder Return.
When market prices are not available, the Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries using a lattice based option valuation model.
Non market vesting conditions eg earnings per share targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
