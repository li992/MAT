It accounted for 41 per cent of underlying earnings in 2005.
Tom Albanese, chief executive Copper and Exploration, is based in London.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2005 compared with 2004 The Copper groups contribution to underlying earnings was US$2,020 million, US$1,160 million higher than in 2004.
The average price of copper was 166 US cents per pound compared to 130 US cents in 2004.
The average price of molybdenum was US$30.70 per pound compared to US$14.60 per pound in 2004.

Mined production of copper was up five per cent.
The underlying earnings contribution from the Grasberg joint venture increased by US$200 million to US$232 million chiefly as a result of the continuation of full production after the material slippage in October 2003.
Palabora recorded a profit of US$19 million in 2005 due to improved performance of underground production.

In order to take advantage of the strong market for molybdenum, mine production was optimised and an expansion of the molybdenum plant, which is designed to increase recoveries, was completed in June 2005.
Molybdenum production was 130 per cent higher than in 2004.
The focus on maximising molybdenum production enhanced overall margins notwithstanding a rise in associated costs.
Refined copper production was six per cent lower than in 2004.
In addition to the lower copper grades as a result of optimising molybdenum production, production was also affected by a 17 day planned smelter maintenance shutdown.
A further 45 day shutdown is planned for the second half of 2006, drawing on lessons learned from the successful shutdown in 2005.
