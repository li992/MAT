16 Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust plc Report of the Directors continued Assessment of the Investment Manager A regular annual review of the management contract is undertaken by the Management Engagement Committee: however, the performance of the Manager in its role of investment manager, secretary and administrator is subject to continual review by the Board.
The objective of the Company is to generate capital growth with a higher than average income from investment in the UK equity market.
Overall the investment process is aiming to achieve absolute return through a genuinely active fund management approach.
As the Managers philosophy does not seek to regard the FTSE All-Share Index the Index as the benchmark for portfolio construction, the portfolio may look substantially different from the Index.
This may lead to periods of under performance as well as periods of out performance.
The Board has reviewed the Managers performance and taking into account the performance of the portfolio, the other services provided by the Manager and the risk and governance environment in which the Company operates, the Board considers that the approval of the management contract is in the best interests of shareholders.
