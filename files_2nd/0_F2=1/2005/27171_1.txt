Corporate Summary The Company Murray International Trust is an investment trust traded on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index.
Some 25,000 of its Shareholders are private investors.
Murray International Trust is differentiated from other investment trusts in that it offers the advantages of exposure to world markets while maintaining the higher income generally associated with the UK equity market.
The Company will be invested in a diversified portfolio of international equities and fixed income securities.
Objective The primary aim of Murray International Trust is to achieve a total return greater than its benchmark by investing predominantly in equities worldwide.
Within this objective the Manager will seek to increase the Companys revenues in order to maintain an above average dividend yield.
History Murray International Trust started its life in 1907 as The Scottish Western Investment Company Limited.
The Scottish Western of the early days was very highly geared but it was mainly invested in bonds, though the international spread was just as great with countries such as Argentina, China, Japan, Canada and many others appearing in the portfolio.
Although the range of currencies was much smaller, multi currency or even gold-backed bonds were all the rage, as many of the eras bond certificates show.
The big move into equities came after the 1930s slump, when bond defaults forced the purchase of higher yielding equities to fund the costs of the trusts gearing.
The Managers were not slow to spot an opportunity, but it started as Hobsons choice, and was only later trumpeted as brilliant foresight.
In 1929 just under 20% of the assets were in equities, in 1940 38%, in 1948 51% of the assets, which were still only 2.65 million.
After deducting the preference shares which were repaid in 1999 and debentures, the Company was effectively over 100% geared into equities by the start of the great post war boom.
After a number of amalgamations, the Company emerged as a generalist investment trust.
However, there was an excess of trusts with a similar broad remit, so towards the end of the 1970s the Board defined the investment brief more narrowly as growth in income and capital through a well diversified portfolio.
Symbolised by the name change from Murray Western to Murray International Trust in 1984, the focus has since been on a relatively high yielding portfolio of equities in a well diversified mix of overseas markets supported by a substantial UK component.
Benchmark The Companys benchmark is a composite index made up as to 40% of the FTSE World-UK and 60% of the FTSE World exUK.
Capital Structure The Companys issued share capital as at 10 March 2006 consisted of 86,556,123 Ordinary shares of 25p each and 1,087,799 B Ordinary shares of 25p each.
The difference between the rights of the B Ordinary Shareholders and that of the Ordinary Shareholders is contained in the glossary on page 72.
Total Assets and Net Asset Value At 31 December 2005, the Company had Total Assets of 609.2 million and a Net Asset Value per Ordinary and B Ordinary share of 597.5p.
Murray International Trust PLC 1 Corporate Summary continued Borrowings The borrowings at 31 December 2005 of 82.8 million represent 15.9% of Net Assets.
Committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities to the Company are detailed in Note 14.
Financial covenants contained within the relevant loan agreements provide, inter alia, that borrowings shall at no time exceed 50% of Net Assets and that the Net Assets must exceed 250 million.
The Net Assets were 523.6 million at 31 December 2005.
If any of the financial covenants were to be breached the Lender is entitled, following the serving of notice to the Company, to declare the loans and all accrued interest, fees and other sums owed under the agreement to be immediately due and repayable.
Duration The Company does not have a fixed life.
Risk Many of the stocks in which the Company invests are exposed to the risk of political change, exchange controls, tax or other regulations which may affect their value and marketability.
Currency fluctuations may also affect the value of the Companys investments and the income derived therefrom.
Companies in emerging markets are not always subject to the equivalent accounting, auditing and financial standards of those in the United Kingdom.
There may therefore be less supervision and regulation in this respect.
Currently 70% of the investment management fee and finance costs and 100% of the performance fee are taken out of capital.
This increases distributable income at the expense of capital growth, which will either be eroded or constrained.
Maintaining a high level of dividend may also diminish capital value.
In common with most investment trusts, Murray International Trust is able to borrow for investment purposes.
The use of gearing is likely to lead to volatility in the Net Asset Value NAV, meaning that a relatively small movement either down or up in value of the Companys total assets will result in a magnified movement in the same direction of that NAV.
There is no guarantee that the market price of shares in investment trusts will fully reflect their underlying NAV.
The market prices of fixed interest stocks and, to a lesser extent, convertibles may be affected by changes in interest rates.
