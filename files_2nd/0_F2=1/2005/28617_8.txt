Oliver Corbett and Mark Robertshaw have been appointed to the Board since the last Annual General Meeting and therefore require election by the members.
Executive directors The directors with executive responsibilities are Mark Powell, Andy Pomfret, Sue Desborough, Ian Buckley, Paul Chavasse, Richard Lanyon, James Lifford, Andrew Morris, Peter Pearson Lund and Richard Smeeton.
Their biographies are on pages 14 and 15.
Peter Pearson Lund was appointed to the Board on 5 January 2005 whilst Paul Egerton-Vernon retired from the Board on 31 December 2005.
Non-executive directors The directors with non-executive responsibilities are Giles Coode-Adams, James Barclay, Caroline Burton, Jamie Cayzer-Colvin, Oliver Corbett, Roy Morris and Mark Robertshaw.
Oliver Corbett and Mark Robertshaw were appointed to the Board on 7 March 2006.
Their biographies are on page 15 and 16.
Giles Coode-Adams is the senior independent director, and any comment or enquiry regarding the affairs of the company may be addressed to him.
The Board considers that, with the exception of Roy Morris, all non-executive directors are independent.
Whilst Jamie Cayzer-Colvin is a director of a significant shareholder, Caledonia Investments plc, he is not their representative on the Board.
Corporate responsibility The Groups Social & Environmental S&E policy aims to ensure that social, environmental and ethical considerations are taken into account in all aspects of the Groups activities.
The Social & Environmental Committee SEC oversees the continual development and implementation of the Groups environmental, social and community policies.
Through this work, the SEC is also able to identify and communicate any potential areas of non-financial risk.
Accordingly the Committees membership is representative of core areas of the business, including board level representation.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 20 Directors report continued The SEC has responsibility for ongoing development of the Groups S&E policy framework, and its implementation, improvement, management and monitoring.
It meets on a quarterly basis and reports to the Board.
The implementation of the S&E policy is managed on a day-to-day basis by committee members and an evolving network of site-based personnel.
In November 2005, the Group was pleased to learn that its efforts in addressing social, environmental and ethical challenges had been recognised by the FTSE4Good policy committee, and that the company had been admitted to the FTSE4Good Index Series.
Socially responsible investment SRI Rathbones acknowledges that the Groups most significant social and environmental impacts arise indirectly as a result of its investment activities.
While the primary consideration is to maximise risk-adjusted returns to clients, the Group recognises that non-financial considerations can impact the long-term value of companies.
Although general investment activities are not covered by a formal SRI policy, social, environmental and ethical SEE considerations are taken into account for specific mandates managed by the Groups specialist ethical investment unit, Rathbone Greenbank Investments.
The Group has a policy in place on proxy voting which ensures that it votes on all AGM EGM issues for companies in the FTSE 100 and those where it holds 3% or more of the issued share capital.
Voting is also undertaken on any company if requested by an underlying shareholder.
The Group also remains actively engaged in issues regarding non-financial reporting and the impact of significant SEE issues on investment through its membership of the UK Social Investment Forum.
In 2005, Rathbones participated as a signatory to the Carbon Disclosure Projects third request for information from the worlds largest companies about their greenhouse gas emissions, together with the risks and opportunities presented by climate change.
Along with other institutional investors, Rathbones lent its support to the fourth iteration of this project in February 2006.
Environment Environmental policy Rathbones aims to reduce the environmental impact of its operational activities through a reduction in consumption and the conservation of resources.
Efficient resource usage to deliver environmental benefits and cost savings will be achieved through using energy and natural resources economically and efficiently, and by reducing emissions and waste levels.
Where reducing consumption is not a viable option, the Group aims to utilise materials derived from sustainable or recycled sources.
Rathbones recognises the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and supports the UK Governments commitment to do this.
The Group is demonstrating its commitment to this in its aim to develop systems to monitor energy use, promote more efficient use of energy in all buildings and encourage practices which reduce energy consumption.
Environmental management system Rathbones continues to work towards the establishment of a formal Environmental Management System EMS to ensure the implementation and communication of S&E policies across the organisation.
Access to appropriate expertise within the SEC is facilitating policy implementation and the development of new ideas.
During 2004, the SEC established a group-wide network of regional office contacts as one of the first steps towards adopting a systematic approach to the challenges of managing environmental risks and impacts.
Progress was made during 2005 to clarify the roles of appointed individuals, and feedback has been received on local activities: these will be used to improve future coordination and reporting from Group regional offices.
In 2004, Rathbones collated baseline data against which future performance could be measured.
Continued monitoring of energy and water consumption and recycling volumes for the London office during 2005 has revealed improvements in the areas of resource usage.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 21 Environmental performance Waste management and recycling In 2005, Rathbones continued to recycle significant quantities of paper and other types of waste.
At present, volumes of recycled waste as provided by Paper Round Ltd. are only available for the London office: total volumes of waste streams are not available, so it has not been possible to calculate an actual recycling rate.
London office recycling kg Type of waste 2005 2004 Mixed and white paper 27,945 27,877 Security shredding 4,680 5,812 Cardboard 2,325 2,370 Cans and plastic bottles 218 Glass 3,120 2,212 Total kg 38,288 38,271 During 2005, Rathbones encouraged the extension of recycling schemes to other offices in the Group.
All offices have arrangements in place for the shredding of confidential waste as required by the Data Protection Act with the additional benefit that this office grade paper is sent for recycling.
Several offices have also made local arrangements for the collection of recyclable waste streams.
Where possible, Rathbones continues to recycle fluorescent tubes, printer toner cartridges, mobile telephones and batteries.
Redundant IT equipment is returned to our Liverpool office for data cleaning and refurbishment by specialist third parties prior to being donated, where appropriate, to deserving causes.
Where desktop printers are still required, those capable of double-sided duplex printing are purchased as standard.
However, a usage audit of network printers throughout the Group has led to the decision to phase out the use of desktop printers and replace them with shared multi-functional devices.
This will enable a considerable saving on printer consumables and maintenance, as well as a reduction in energy consumption.
Over the year Rathbones has continued to work towards ensuring future compliance with regulations relating to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 22 Directors report continued Resource usage For the first time we are able to publish comparative data on electricity, gas and water consumption for our London office which houses some 40% of the Groups UK-based staff.
Collating data on energy use has enabled our facilities management team to identify the need for, and implement, changes to heating control settings which have resulted in greatly reduced use of gas at this key Group location.
Overall carbon emissions from energy fell by 10.6% in 2005 from 394 tonnes to 352 tonnes.
London office: electricity usage London office: gas usage 1,000,000 2,000 25,000 20.0 800,000 20,000 1,500 15.0 600,000 15,000 1,000 10.0 400,000 10,000 500 5.0 200,000 5,000 0 0 0 0 2004 2005 2004 2005 Year Year Units kWh Units kWh CO2 emissions per person kgs CO2 emissions per person kgs London office: water consumption 2,500 12.0 10.0 2,000 8.0 1,500 6.0 1,000 4.0 500 2.0 0 0 2004 2005 Year 3 Units m 3 Consumption per person m Business travel Rathbones acknowledges that one of its major direct impacts within its own control is the use of company-owned cars for business travel and commuting.
We believe that the use of such vehicles for business purposes, together with the need for air and rail travel, has been greatly reduced by the use of teleconferencing and the introduction of videoconferencing facilities, which now extend to the Groups London, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Jersey, Winchester, Bristol and Geneva offices.
These systems are widely used for internal meetings, client conferences, analyst presentations and staff training.
In 2006, the Energy Savings Trust will carry out a health check to assess the efficiency of the Groups vehicle fleet.
Ethical purchasing The most significant use of paper within Rathbones is in the production of investment management reports for clients, such as valuations, tax packs and annual regulatory reports.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, all such reports to clients accounting for some 2.5 million sheets of paper per annum were printed using 100% recycled paper.
Several marketing publications and investor communications including the Groups report and accounts are now produced using paper containing a high percentage of post-consumer waste and the Group is now using recycled copier paper.
Rathbones supports the use of Fairtrade products with several offices regularly purchasing tea, coffee and sugar from certified sources.

com Report and accounts 2005 Page 23 Objectives for 2006 It is intended that data collection for resource usage will be extended during 2006 to the Groups Liverpool office where some 45% of UK staff are located, and thereafter to regional offices.
Our new office in Jersey will be completed shortly and is due for occupation during 2006: we will report in more detail on its energy-saving features and green travel policy in next years report and accounts.
Employees Our employees are vital to the Groups continuing success.
We continue to build on the review of employment and social policies carried out during 2004, when significant changes were implemented in the areas of communication and work-life balance.
Progress in developing indicators and collecting data has also been made.
The Group is mindful of changing legislation, especially in the area of age discrimination, and continues to be aware of its responsibilities under the Information and Consultation Directive.
Health and welfare Rathbones is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment in which its employees can work.
Upon completion of a qualifying period, all UK employees are eligible for private medical cover provided by the Company, which extends to direct family members of employees.
Additionally all UK staff have the opportunity to attend an annual medical examination and a biennial eye test.
Rathbones also provides an independent and confidential employee helpline offering advice on employment, personal and legal concerns.
We will invest further in health and safety in 2006 by engaging professional advisors to carry out a full review of the Groups health and safety policy and procedures, and providing relevant training for employees.
Diversity and opportunity Rathbones is an equal opportunities employer and it is its policy to ensure that all job applicants and employees are treated fairly on merit regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, marital status, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin, disability or religious belief.
It is the policy of the Group to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment by disabled people.
If employees become disabled during their service with Rathbones, wherever practicable, arrangements are made to continue their employment and training.
We continue to work to ensure that policies apply equally across all staff.
The progress made within the area of work-life balance also works to support diversity within the organisation.
Work-life balance Rathbones has made significant progress in reviewing and implementing new work-life balance policies.
During 2005, the Group introduced a childcare voucher scheme.
Maternity benefits remain considerably in excess of those required under statutory provisions.
In 2005, only 2 women out of the 15 on maternity leave failed to return to work.
Career breaks of up to two years are also available for those with childcare responsibilities.
Flexible working policies are offered with a high number of successful applications, and following the trial of a holiday day purchase scheme in 2005, this has again been offered to UK staff for 2006.
The Group operates policies which reflect the statutory requirements for the provision of parental and dependants leave and in 2005 we revised our adoption policy to bring it into line with our company maternity policy.
Data to monitor the uptake and effectiveness of these policies, together with other indicators of staff satisfaction levels, such as average annual sickness rates and staff turnover, are regularly reported and reviewed.
In 2005, our staff turnover rate returned to the 2003 level of 11% up from 8% in 2004.
However, over 88% of UK employees have more than one-years service and over 55% have worked for the Group for more than five years.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 24 Directors report continued Training and development Rathbones recognises that training, competence and development have a clear benefit for the business and encourage personal growth.
The Group is committed to the training and development of all employees and will support participation in appropriate programmes, whether externally or internally provided.
Over the past year, training events have taken place to assist investment staff in keeping up to date with their Continuing Professional Development and competence.
A general review of job-related training needs forms part of the annual appraisal process and these needs are being addressed either in-house or on public courses.
Trainee programmes continue to be set up for all new client-facing staff covered under FSA regulations to ensure appropriate qualifications, skills and knowledge are provided for those concerned.
Rewards and benefits Employees are encouraged to identify, and to become involved with, the financial performance of the Group.
In 2001, Rathbones was one of the first companies in the country to launch a Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Under the scheme, which is open to all employees, the Company matches every share purchased by individual employees with another free of charge.
In relation to 2005, in recognition of continuing outstanding performance across the Group, staff will receive another allocation of free shares in 2006, worth 2,060 to full-time employees 2004: 1,930.
In 2006, the Group will introduce a new, long-service award for staff with over twenty years service.
To encourage the use of public transport, the Group offers interest-free loans for season tickets to all staff on satisfactory completion of their probationary period.
Pension The Group recognises its responsibility to assist in the financial welfare of its employees when they reach retirement age and pays contributions to provide benefits on retirement.
It has encouraged staff to review their personal arrangements in light of Pension Simplification rules due to come into effect in April 2006.
The Group believes that the benefits provided are generous and worthwhile and are valued by all permanent employees eligible to join the companys scheme.
Death in service and widows widowers pension benefits exist for UK staff.
The Group continually monitors this area to ensure the provision of benefits and practices remain up to date and in line with rapidly changing legislative requirements.
Communication Communication with staff is effected via internal email, a document library and an internal newsletter which is published quarterly and to which all staff are invited to contribute.
It contains regular features focusing on social, environmental and community issues.
In addition to playing a key part in the Groups environmental management strategy, SEC regional contacts provide an important communication channel for social and community issues around the Group.
Community The Group continues to review community activities, both on a group and local scale, and supports employees participation in a wide range of activities involving both local and international charities.
The Group encourages employees to take up voluntary and charitable positions, and the Board leads participation in such activities.
For example, the chairman is deputy chairman of the British Eye Research Foundation and the chief executive is involved with an educational charity.
Other staff are involved with schools, colleges, charities, civic, youth and religious groups in various capacities.
Donations and fundraising During the year, the Group made charitable donations of 58,000 representing 0.16% of pre-tax profits 2004: 44,000, representing 0.15% of pre-tax profits.
Mid-way through 2005, the Multiple Sclerosis Society was selected as our charity of the year.
Employees were encouraged to support the charity through participating in events such as raffles and a Beaujolais Nouveau breakfast, while the Company also made a donation to MS through its charity Christmas card scheme.
For 2006, a different charity will be chosen from a selection of local, national and international charities nominated by employees.
This will be the focus of a range of group-wide activities during the year.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 25 Staff are encouraged to donate to charity in a tax efficient manner through the Give As You Earn GAYE payroll giving scheme.
In 2005, Rathbone staff gave a total of 29,640 2004: 18,485 through this scheme, which is administered by the Charities Aid Foundation.
Since October 2004, the Company has matched staff donations of up to 50 per month made through GAYE and has allocated 20,000 per annum for this purpose.
In 2005, the Company donated 19,190 OctoberDecember 2004: 3,600 to causes chosen by employees through this method.
During 2006, the matched giving scheme will be improved as the ceiling for the Groups maximum contribution has been raised to 30,000.
Sponsorships As well as direct charitable donations, the Group provides support in the form of sponsorship, advertising and attendance at events organised by charities and arts organisations.
Rathbone Greenbank Investments continues to support Schumacher UK in its aims to promote sustainable development through its co-sponsorship of the organisations Bristol series of lectures.
Rathbone Greenbank has also developed a constructive relationship with The Funding Network our Bristol and Edinburgh offices have supported this UK-based organisation which brings people together in a marketplace to help fund charitable projects.
Political donations No contributions were made for political purposes during the year 2004: nil.
Policy on the payment of creditors Rathbones does not follow a published code or standard on payment practice.
Its policy is to fix terms of payment with each supplier in accordance with its requirements and financial procedures.
Rathbones ensures that suppliers are aware of those terms and abides by them subject to the resolution of any disagreement regarding the supply.
In the majority of cases, the terms agreed with suppliers are for payment within 30 days of their invoice date.
Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2005 represented 17 days of annual purchases 2004: 13 days.
The Company itself has no trade creditors.
Financial instruments and risk management The risk management objectives and policies of the Group are set out in note 30 to the accounts on pages 73 to 78.
Share price The mid market price of the companys shares at 31 December 2005 was 992p 2004: 852.5p and the range during the year was 725p to 1015p 2004: 607.5p to 863.5p.
Annual General Meeting The 2006 Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday 3 May 2006 at 12.00 noon at 159 New Bond Street, London, W1S 2UD.
The notice of the meeting is on pages 97 and 98.
It is anticipated that all directors, including the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees will be at the AGM and available to answer questions.
The ordinary business includes resolutions to elect two directors appointed to the Board since the last AGM.
Both are currently finance directors of major public companies outside the speciality and other finance sector but both have a good deal of experience of the sector gained earlier in their careers.
The Board are confident that their knowledge and wide-ranging experience will prove invaluable.
The ordinary business also includes resolutions to re-elect J M B Cayzer-Colvin, J G S Coode-Adams and R A Morris.
All directors are required to seek re-election every three years.
Following formal performance evaluation of the Board and individual appraisal by the chairman, all three continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment to the role.
Shareholders will see that they are asked to consider, and if thought fit, pass one ordinary resolution and two special resolutions regarding the allotment and purchase of shares.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 26 Directors report continued The ordinary resolution, number 11, occurs annually in order to provide a measure of authority to the directors to allot ordinary shares in circumstances defined by the resolution.
The authority sought for allotments is for up to an aggregate nominal amount of 680,000, representing approximately 33% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2005.
The first special resolution, number 12, seeks authority regarding allotments, other than to members proportionately to their respective shareholdings and for which payment is to be wholly in cash.
Such allotments are to be limited to 100,000, representing approximately 5% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2005.
Additionally, resolution number 12 seeks authority for the company to sell or otherwise deal with treasury shares being shares acquired and held by the company without necessarily involving shareholders.
Over the three years to 31 December 2005, shares with a nominal value of 66,531 were allotted for cash, representing 3.2% of the issued share capital at that date.
For transactions of a substantial nature involving the allotment of shares, it is normal for the UK Listing Authority or company law to require shareholder approval for the specific transaction notwithstanding the general authority.
The second special resolution, number 13, is to renew the authority granted to the directors at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2005 to purchase the Companys own ordinary shares under certain stringent conditions.
The authority will be used only when the directors consider that it would be advantageous to the Company and the effect would be to enhance earnings per share.
Auditors In accordance with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the company is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
