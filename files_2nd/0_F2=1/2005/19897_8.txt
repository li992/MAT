A special resolution will also be proposed to dis-apply statutory pre-emption rights in respect of the allotment of shares in connection with any rights issue or other issue by way of rights and otherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,522,147 representing five per cent of the issued share capital of the Company as at 16 March 2006.

The Directors consider this fee level to be appropriate in view of the increased size of the Board since that date.
