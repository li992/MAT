PEARSON ANNUAL REVIEW 2005 Left: Technology is changing the way that teachers teach and students learn.
In US Higher Education, Pearson has pioneered a series of online learning resources such as MyMathLab.
The system allows college maths students to practice problems and submit assignments online, and the software intervenes and provides assistance if the student is struggling.
Last year students submitted 11 million assignments online through this programme, and colleges using the system are reporting significant increases in student pass rates.
In many other markets around the world, demand is growing for materials to improve reading and maths skills and to help students learn English as a second language.
Looking ahead, these trends in school education and the strengths in these very areas built into our business give us plenty of scope for long-term growth.
We think our school business will continue its growth in sales and profits as it helps teachers teach and students learn.
