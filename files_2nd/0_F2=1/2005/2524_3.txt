PRODUCT INNOVATION Sky is constantly evolving to offer a greater range of products and packages to meet the needs of our subscribers and encourage new consumer take-up.
The penetration of Multiroom and our Sky box has continued to increase as customers choose to enjoy even more choice and control of their television viewing.
In 2005, we unveiled the Sky Gnome, a wireless receiver that will allow customers to listen to their favourite television or radio channels in any room of the house or even in the garden within a typical range of 30 metres from the Sky box.
We also introduced our freesat service which offers customers around 200 television and radio channels, and access to interactive services without a monthly subscription.
In 2006 Sky plans to launch the most comprehensive HDTV service in Europe.
