several successful initiatives were implemented during the year with good progress made in consumer credit and with customer support agreements relaunching successfully in the fourth quarter.
A new management team is now in place.
During the year, UniEuro continued to restructure its operations, moving from a decentralised buying model to a centrally managed operation better equipped to leverage Group synergies.
Over a three year period, every store will be either refurbished, resited, or, if under performing, closed.
During the year, seven new stores were opened and one store closed.
UniEuro has also embarked on a cost reduction plan with a focus on the supply chain platform, stock management and central costs.
UniEuro is proposing to restructure its distribution network over the next two years.
In September, the Group acquired a controlling stake in Kotsovolos, the leading electricals retailer in Greece, and the business has since been delisted from the Athens Stock Exchange.
Total sales were 160 million, with a first time contribution to Group operating profit before goodwill amortisation of 8.1 million.
Since the Group acquired the controlling stake, a new management team has been appointed, a central cost reduction programme has been implemented and a major store ret and resite programme is under way.
