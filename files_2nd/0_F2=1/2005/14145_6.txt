annual report 2005 report of the directors.
The Directors present their annual report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005.
1 Annual General Meeting The notice of the Annual General Meeting is set out on pages 64 to 68.
Resolution 11 Replacement SAYE Share Option Scheme The 1995 All Employee HM Revenue and Customs approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme expires in August 2005.
It is proposed to adopt a new HM Revenue & Customs approved SAYE scheme to replace the expiring scheme.
This new scheme will be similar to the previous scheme.
Options would be granted during the ten year period to July 2015 to acquire up to 10% of the issued capital of the Company including options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 or the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Options would be granted at the higher of nominal value and an amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being not less than 80% of market value.
The Directors believe that the proposal to implement a new Savings Related Share Option Scheme as set out in resolution 11 is in the best interest of the Company and recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 11 will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution.
Resolution 12 Authority to purchase own shares The Company has the authority to purchase up to 23,400,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
The authority remains valid until the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 28 January 2006.
The Directors recommend that shareholders renew the Companys authority to purchase its own ordinary shares as permitted under Article 10 of its Articles of Association.
Accordingly, resolution 12 will be proposed as a special resolution seeking authority to make such purchases in the market.
The Directors have no immediate intention of using such authority and would do so only when they consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any ordinary shares purchased under this authority will be cancelled and the number of ordinary shares in issue will be reduced accordingly.
The Company did not purchase any of its ordinary shares during the year.
Resolution 12 specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased representing approximately 10% of the Companys existing issued ordinary share capital and the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought, reflecting the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and the UK Listing Rules.
The Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
As at 2 June 2005 being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document there were outstanding options to subscribe for a total of 6,682,914 ordinary shares in the Company, representing 2.9% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date.
If the share buy-back authority referred to above is exercised in full, the outstanding options as at 2 June 2005 would represent 3.2% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Resolution 13 Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights The Directors consider it advisable to renew their authority to allot equity securities for cash, other than to existing shareholders pro-rata to their holdings, which is due to expire on 28 October 2005.
This authority will enable the Directors, at any time until 27 October 2006, to allot equity securities wholly for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,170,000 or otherwise in connection with a rights issue.
This limited disapplication will allow the Directors to allot up to 11,700,000 ordinary shares, representing just under 5% of the issued equity share capital of the Company as at 2 June 2005.
Resolution 13 will be proposed as a special resolution.
Resolution 14 Amendment to Article 96 Directors Fees The maximum aggregate total remuneration of the Directors excluding payments for executive duties under article 96 is currently 250,000 per annum.
This maximum has not been changed for many years.
The Directors fees for the present Board are expected to total 235,000 in the 2005 6 year and therefore the Directors consider it advisable to increase the maximum aggregate total remuneration to 400,000.
Resolution 14 will be proposed as a special resolution.
