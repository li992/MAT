Managers Report Chris Turner Fund Manager 24 May 2005 Introduction It has been a remarkable year in global property capital markets.
Investment demand for buildings and for property securities has been dominated by investors with an insatiable desire for high initial income.
Money flows have been extraordinary and reports suggest that a significant quantity of allocated funds exist which their owners have been unable to invest.
The parlous state of occupational demand seems to have been entirely ignored.
Only empty buildings have been unloved, and even they have often found ready buyers for residential conversion.
Initial yields have fallen everywhere for both commercial property and property shares, and, as in the bond market, yield spreads have narrowed so that junk has outperformed prime.
I cannot recall any previous period when time spent on analysis of the longer term risk and reward was apparently so wasted.
W e succeeded in beating our benchmark last year.
W e were overweight UK shares throughout the year believing that the UK direct property market returns would be stronger than European returns correct and that this, combined with the hopes for a UK REIT, would lead to UK stocks outperforming wrong.
W e held overweight positions in the leading retail property owning companies thinking that, however poor consumer confidence became, it could not be worse than office tenant demand correct and that this would lead to these stocks outperforming wrong.
This was also wrong: appropriate.
That way we can capture the discount to our generally across Europe the higher the initial yield offered asset value that the weakest seller of the moment is by a share, the higher the premium to asset value that the prepared to accept, and share the gain created amongst share rose to.
Our portfolio turnover was again modest.

Equally we had no disasters, and over 99% of commercial property investments has persisted throughout the portfolio showed share price gains on the year.

Buying interest has come from a multitude of sources institutions, Shareholders funds rose by more than 25% even after share repurchases and totalled more than 500m for the pension funds, private investors, venture capital funds etc.
and from all corners of the globe.
The UK was the best first time, while gross assets approached 600m.
While size has its advantages greater liquidity in the shares, performing country with a total return for calendar 2004 of 18.3% of which 12% was capital growth.
March to March more resources etc.
it also has its disadvantages.
TR Property is now one of the top twenty UK investment total returns have slackened slightly to 18% p. a. but initial yields, which have fallen over the period from 6.4% to trusts by size, but its mandate is to invest in only a very small specialist sector of Pan-European stock markets.
5.7%, continue to decline and there is still a significant weight of capital awaiting investment both here and on the Many of our best long term investment opportunities have been in smaller companies and illiquid stocks.
Meanwhile UK rental growth is still very muted with current year on year figures of 3.9% for retail, 1% the fund the harder it becomes to make such investments on a scale that makes a difference.
Our size would not be for industrials and 0.3% for offices.
W e suspect that the momentum of yield shift is beginning to flag, particularly for a problem if our investment universe had grown at the same pace as the portfolio.
Unfortunately the opposite has second rate assets, and we are forecasting a total return from UK property assets of 12% in the current year, happened.
Over the last five years a constant flow of quoted real estate companies have been taken off UK implying a much lower rate of capital growth in the second half of 2005.
On the Continent, property market total and European stock markets via takeovers.
While our performance has benefitted from these takeovers, each returns in 2004 were markedly below the UK result with only Ireland 11.5% and France 10.1% getting into one only served to narrow the choice for reinvestment.
As the Chairman has noted, we think the best way to avoid double figures, and the other countries where statistics are available all showed returns in the 5% to 10% range.

Looking ahead we expect the search for yield with potential inflation protection which improvement in specific markets to be closely tied to bonds do not provide, the desire for portfolio economic activity and to job creation.
In the City of diversification away from equities and, dare I say it, the London and M25 markets, vacancy rates are stable and desire to follow an investment fashion.

Paris interest rates increase due to a rise in inflationary should be an early gainer, as it has one of the lowest expectations, the positive yield gap between real estate office vacancy rates at just over 6%, but job creation there and bonds will be diminished or expunged unless property is still weak and there are signs that rental values may yields also rise.
