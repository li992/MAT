For the year ended 29 January 2005 Non-Executive Directors were paid an annual fee of 42,000 for their services as members of the Board plus, where appropriate, the following additional fees: Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director John Nelson 13,000 Chairman of the Audit Committee Phil Bentley 10,000 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee John Nelson 8,000 Chairman of the Social Responsibility Committee Margaret Salmon 3,000 The fees for services as members of the Board for the year ending 28 January 2006 will be 42,000.
The Non-Executive Directors fees increased on 1 February 2004 and will be reviewed again for February 2006.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of engagement instead of service contracts.
The Chairmans letter of engagement allows for six months notice up to the age of 65 when the appointment ends without the need for notice.
Other Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years.
Their position can be revoked without compensation at any time at the discretion of the Company.
The letters of engagement for the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman were renewed in 2004 05, following completion of their first three-year term.
In addition, the arrangements with Mr Hepher were updated to reflect the fact that his services are now provided through a different management company.

The other points are plotted at the values at intervening financial year ends.
The Company chose the FTSE 100 Index as an appropriate comparator for this graph because the Company has been a constituent of that index throughout the period and its constituents are used as the comparator group for the multiplier awards under the KIS Shares scheme.
