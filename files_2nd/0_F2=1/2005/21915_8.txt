qxp 10 11 05 5:59 pm Page 17 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 member states of Central Europe have been re-rated and are on multiples consistent with Western Europe.
The trust now trades on a modest discount of 5%.
Liquidity 15.6% Liquidity has increased from 11.5% last year to 15.6% in line with our increased caution on valuations.
Our liquidity is currently held in the form of short-dated British Government securities and cash deposits with banks.

Outlook We have become more cautious on the outlook for equity markets and have increased our liquidity as a result.
The imbalances in the global markets continue to expand and this increases the vulnerability of the markets to unforeseen shocks.
The valuations on offer have less downside protection.
Many of our stocks have followed a similar pattern since the market bottomed out in early 2003.
Discounts have narrowed and earnings multiples have expanded.
We have been taking profits in stocks that have rallied sharply whilst liquidity has increased as there is presently a scarcity of new compelling investment opportunities.
