By order of the board T. P. Haywood Secretary 13th February 2006 Directors responsibilities in relation to financial statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditors Report to the Members set out on page 45, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been applied: prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the accounts comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
