This is the MFI we will become: A leading provider of domestic kitchens, bedrooms and related products sold in ways that most customers want to buy.
This gives us a clear focus as we go forward.
We have reorganised into three separate businesses.
Trade in the form of Howden Joinery which concentrates on marketing and selling our products to the small builder.
Retail which concentrates on marketing, selling and delivering our products to consumers.
Supply which concentrates on design expertise, flexible outsourcing and manufacturing excellence.
