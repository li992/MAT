Cost of revenues excluding amortisation of purchased intangibles in 2005 totalled $5.9 million, up 103% from $2.9 million in 2004.
The increase from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increased support staff, together with small increases in hardware purchases and consulting services which are more common with etalk sales, each of which increased as a result of increased revenues.

Sales and marketing expenses totalled $40.3 million in 2005, up 18% from $34.2 million in 2004.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increased advertising, additional headcount and an increase in sales commissions due to an increase in sales and a change in the geographic and size-of-transaction mix, all of which also increased with the expansion of the group to include etalk.
General and administrative expenses totalled $11.1 million in 2005, up 37% from $8.1 million in 2004.

Gain on foreign exchange totalled $0.2 million in 2005, up 86% from $0.1 million in 2004.

Profit from operations before post-acquisition restructuring costs totalled $15.4 million in 2005, up 248% from $4.4 million in 2004.
