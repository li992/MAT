INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK The Life & Pensions operating surplus improved to 100 million 2004: 89m deficit, split 94 million UK and 6 million International.
Both businesses generated surplus on the in-force business to broadly fund the new business strain.
In addition the UK business has a tax credit of 102 million due mainly to the utilisation of life and pension tax losses built up in prior years against the increased investment return in 2005 and the amount received from Group non-life companies for the surrender of current year tax losses.
The tax credit is expected to recur in 2006 but at a significantly lower level.
The other operating deficit includes mainly corporate costs net of tax.
Total cash generated before dividend and capital items was substantially increased on 2004 at 206 million 2004: 1m negative.
Dividends paid amounted to 157 million 2004: 134m and capital items included 39 million in respect of the acquisition of Lombard, representing the negative net assets acquired and expenses incurred.

The Groups long-term borrowings, including STICS which are treated as equity in IFRS, have increased to 1,940 million 2004: 1,217m, principally because of the issue of 500 million STICS in June 2005 less issue expenses of 5 million.
These will be used to pre-fund the redemption of the 215 million undated subordinated guaranteed bonds in 2006 and to support future growth.
In addition, 230 million secured bonds were issued by the F&C Commercial Property Trust a policyholder investment in February 2005 and some borrowings acquired as part of the Lombard acquisition.
The convertible bonds are separated into a liability component and an embedded derivative, being the option to convert to equity.
At December 2004 the embedded derivative was treated as liability and included at fair value within the overall value of the convertible bonds.
In May 2005 we renounced our right to redeem the convertible bonds in cash.
This removes the need to reflect any further changes to the option value in the IFRS income statement.
Thereafter the embedded derivative is classified as equity and is held at its fair value at May 2005.
Of the 280 million class A-1 securitisation notes, 82 million is expected to be repaid in April 2006 as a result of surplus emergence in 2005.
