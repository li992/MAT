How were doing The ongoing project of integrating our network into a Global Studio is a key task, one that has seen considerable success this year, with more of our studios working together, Fitch sharing clients, data and staff.
This is also the case within the WPP community, where, by collaborating with sister agencies, we were able to win the annual WPP Worldwide Partnership Program award.
Our global network was greatly enhanced in Asia when we acquired the successful Singapore brand communications agency Spring, whilst also absorbing most of the Underline Fitch network.
We now have four studios in the region and look forward with confidence to growing our presence and portfolio, not least in India, where we have won our first projects.
We also continue to grow our international reach elsewhere with new projects in Russia, Thailand, the Middle East and Latin America and, to build on these opportunities, we have established a Fitch presence in Moscow and Dubai.
Our endeavours on the creative, client and integration fronts have helped deliver better than expected financial results for 2005.
In 2006 we have ambitious plans, the year has started well and we remain confident and optimistic.
Rodney Fitch Rodney Fitch Chairman Fitch itchs second year as part of the WPP community has lived up to the expectations anticipated in my report last year.
We have enjoyed a very satisfactory year on all fronts: If industry recognition is a bellwether, then the quality of our work continues to improve.
Notable amongst the many awards our studios collectively won were an IDEA Gold for our Gerber Sippy cup in the US and Store of the Year for Aquascutum.
We have continued to serve longstanding clients such as Microsoft, HSBC, Vodafone, BAT, GE and GM, whilst also growing business with a host of new clients such as Central Markets in Bangkok, Nokia in Europe and Levis in the US.
