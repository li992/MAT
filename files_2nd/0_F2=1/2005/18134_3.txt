The calculation of this deferred tax liability has been carried out on the basis that the revaluation gains on the properties will be realised through receipt of net rents for the properties owned.
As such the amount provided represents the maximum potential tax liability.
Your Board considers it unlikely that this theoretical liability will ever crystallise because it takes no account of the way in which the Group would realise these gains.
In particular the deferred tax provision takes no account of the way in which properties are expected to be sold, of the indexation allowance available when calculating a taxable capital gain in the UK or of elections available to ensure that deductions claimed previously for capital allowances are not reversed.
The Board has complied with pronouncements from the APB and the UK Listing Authority in showing NAV and Earnings per share including the IAS 12 provision with equal prominence as the adjusted figures.
The effect of IAS 12 has been excluded from those statistics that are indicated by an asterisk.
At 31 December 2005 the IAS 12 deferred tax charge included in the profit and loss account was 21.9 million and the cumulative reduction to net assets was 132.1 million 31 December 2004: charge to tax of 16.0 million and reduction in net assets of 114.1 million respectively.
In line with UK property industry practice adjusted earnings per share does not include gains on revaluations and deferred taxation.
