Resolutions relating to the following items of special business will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting: By order of the Board JM Latter, for and on behalf of i Repurchase of the Companys Shares JPMorgan Asset Management UK Limited, At the Annual General Meeting held on 28th July Secretary 2004, shareholders gave authority to the Board to 9th June 2005 enable repurchases of up to 14.99% of the then issued share capital.
At that time shareholders were informed that this authority would expire on 27th January 2006 unless renewed at the forthcoming AGM.
A proposal is to be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to renew this authority.
The Directors consider that the renewing of the authority would be in the interest of shareholders as a whole as the repurchase of shares at a discount to the underlying net asset value NAV enhances the NAV of the remaining shares.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution.
