The Board believed the inclusion of the cash element 3 Following the sale of Emap USA, the comparator group was amended with effect from 20 September 2001 when Primedia Inc. was replaced by SMG plc.
of the annual bonus in pensionable salary was valid for two reasons.
Firstly, Flexiplan is a defined contribution rather than a defined benefit The TSR comparator group used for determining one half of the PRP pension plan, and the maximum bonus payable to Executive Directors performance award includes all the companies in the FTSE 350 was 50% of salary with only half of this payable in cash the other Media & Entertainment sector index, which currently comprises the half being payable in shares.
Consequently the maximum additional following institutions: contribution from the Company was only ever 10.5% the rate of company pension contribution of 25% i. e. 2.6% of the relevant 1 Aegis Group plc Directors salary.
Secondly, the exclusion of half of the annual bonus 2 BSkyB Group plc from pensionable salary would have required an increase in the 1 3 GCap plc Companys contribution level to maintain the pensions package 4 Chrysalis Group plc at a competitive level.
This increase would have led to an additional 5 Daily Mail & General Trust plc fixed and permanent cost to the Company, whereas under Flexiplan 6 EMI Group plc as it stood, pension contributions only increased if performance targets 7 Euromoney Institutional Investors plc attached to the annual bonus were met.
The additional cost only arose 8 HIT Entertainment plc in the year the bonus was earned and was only incurred if the bonus 9 ITV plc was paid, so increasing the element of Directors at risk remuneration.

Executive Directors have contracts that continue until their contractual retirement age of 60 unless terminated earlier by either party in During the year, Hay was commissioned to conduct a benchmarking accordance with the contract.

Where the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice, a Director will therefore effectively receive a maximum of 12 months salary and benefits on termination.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these arrangements strike a fair balance between the interests of shareholders and the need to provide suitable terms of employment to attract and retain the key executives upon whom the success of the Group depends.
Policy on external appointments Emap recognises that exposure of its Executive Directors to other Boards can broaden their experience and knowledge.
Executive Directors are therefore allowed to accept one non-executive appointment subject to the Boards approval and, on 1 January 2005, Gary Hughes was appointed to the Main Board and Audit Committee of J Sainsbury plc as a Non-Executive Director.
This was the only Non-Executive Directorship that Gary Hughes held at the time of his resignation from the Emap Board.
Consistent with the Companys policy, throughout the period of Mr Hughes employment by Emap, his fees for fulfilling this non-executive role were payable to the Company.
