A review of the business of the Group is given on pages 3 to 24.
Investment Trust Status The principal activity of the Company throughout the year was that of an investment trust.
HM Revenue & Customs has approved the Company as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for the accounting period to 30 September 2004.
The Directors are of the opinion that, since that date, the Company has conducted its affairs in a manner which will satisfy the conditions for continued approval as an investment trust under that section.
Investment Strategy The Company has specialised in investing in the private equity market since 1976.
In 2004 the Board reviewed the Companys investment strategy and confirmed that it should remain unchanged from that approved by shareholders in 2001.
Under this strategy, up to one third of realisation proceeds in respect of investments made prior to June 2001 are available for new investment together with all realisation proceeds from investments made subsequently.
As the proportion of realisation proceeds in respect of investments made after 2001 rises, increasing funds will be available for investment.

As detailed in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 30 to 33, the Board reviews the activities of Electra Partners on an ongoing basis and believes the continuing appointment of Electra Partners on the terms agreed is in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
