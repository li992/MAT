Source: HSBC Baillie Gifford & Co Contributions cannot be added together, as they are geometric: for example, to calculate how a return of 8.2% against an index return of 3.6% translates into a relative return of 4.5%, divide the portfolio return of 108.2 by the index return of 103.6 and subtract one.
The above returns are calculated on a total return basis with net income reinvested and debentures valued at par.
Monks figures represent the returns on the Companys portfolio and the index figures for each geographical area represent the return on the appropriate FTSE World Index.
Asset allocation includes the contribution attributable to currency movements.
Equities include warrants, limited partnerships and OEICs.
