Current Operations and Outlook The year has seen a further significant change in Electras portfolio and financial position.
The cash generated from the portfolio has been used to finance investment of 82 million and share buy-backs of 30 million, with the balance increasing short term liquidity.
At the end of the year, Electras portfolio contained relatively few investments as a result of the active realisation programme and the restrictions on making investments.
However, with more funds for investment now becoming available under the existing investment policy, it is anticipated that the rate of investment will increase.
With the flexible approach to investment adopted by Electra, the chances of identifying good opportunities to replenish the portfolio are increased, even though the private equity market currently remains highly competitive.
As far as the existing portfolio is concerned, good opportunities remain to add value and cash generation should continue at a reasonable level if the market remains in its current buoyant condition.
