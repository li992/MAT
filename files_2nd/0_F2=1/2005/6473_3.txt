Significant Shareholdings At 6 May 2005 the Company had been notified of the following interests of 3% or more in its Ordinary Shares: Number of Ordinary Shares % Fidelity Investment Services 12,688,456 14.84 Morgan Stanley Investment Management 8,576,541 10.03 AXA Investment Managers 5,034,303 5.89 M&G Investment Management 4,554,008 5.33 Taube Hodson & Stonex Partners 3,975,393 4.65 SG Asset Management 3,632,626 4.25 Legal & General Investment Management 3,215,193 3.76 Share Allotment and Pre-Emption Rights In accordance with the Companys normal practice, a resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew the Boards authority to allot unissued Ordinary Shares up to a maximum amount of 1,373,741 which will be 33% of the issued share capital of the Company upon the completion of the Merger.
This authority will expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of the resolution.
A resolution will also be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew the Boards authority to issue shares for cash without first being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
The authority will expire on the earlier of 20 April 2007 and the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and is limited to Ordinary Shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to 206,061 which is equivalent to approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the Company upon the completion of the Merger.
Save in connection with the allotment of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of options under the Companys employee share schemes, the Directors have no present intention of issuing any Ordinary Shares.
The Company does not hold any Treasury Shares.
Authority to Buy-In Shares Under Article 9 of its Articles of Association, the Company is empowered to purchase its own shares.
The Directors consider that it is prudent to maintain the power to make purchases in the market of the Companys own shares and the necessary special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The maximum number of shares which may be acquired pursuant to the authority is 16,484,900 which will be equivalent to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company upon the completion of the Merger and the maximum price exclusive of expenses payable for each Ordinary Share is the higher of i 105% of the average closing middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share as derived from the Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the purchase and ii from 1 July 2005, an amount equal to the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid as derived from the Stock Exchange Trading System SETS.
The authority will expire on the earlier of 20 April 2007 and the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
The Board has no immediate intention to exercise the authority and purchases will only be made if the Board believes that to do so would increase the earnings per share of the Company and be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders generally.
The authority granted at last years Annual General Meeting has not been used in the past year.
11 Report of the Directors continued Under the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003, companies are allowed to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares, rather than having to cancel them.
If any purchases of ordinary shares are made pursuant to this authority, it is intended that such ordinary shares will either be cancelled or held in treasury in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
No dividends will be paid on, and no voting rights will be exercised in respect of, shares held in treasury.
Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on the London Stock Exchange.
Upon completion of the Merger there will be options outstanding over 4,040,479 Ordinary Shares, representing 2.45% of the Companys then issued share capital.
If the authority given by this resolution was to be fully used, these options would represent 2.72% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital upon completion of the Merger.
There are no warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding.
Amendments to the Companys Articles of Association The Directors propose two amendments to the Companys Articles of Association: namely, to Article 108 and Article 112.
Article 108 Under the existing sub-paragraph h of Article 108 of the Companys Articles of Association, a Director shall vacate his office on the day immediately before that on which he attains the age of seventy, unless the prior written consent of OFCOM is obtained to his continuing as a Director.
In addition, section 293 of the Companies Act 1985 provides, among other things, that, unless shareholders otherwise agree and special notice has been given to both the Company and shareholders, a Director of a public company must vacate his office at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting following his seventieth birthday and that no person can be appointed as a Director of a public company once they have attained that age.
Under section 293 7 of the Companies Act 1985, companies are allowed to disapply the provisions of section 293.
The Companys Articles of Association currently do not do so.
The Board considers that the existing provisions of sub-paragraph h of Article 108 do not reflect current market practice in this area and that a Director should be permitted to be appointed and to continue in office beyond the age of 70 provided that any Director who has attained the age of 70 shall retire at each Annual General Meeting and, if appropriate, offer himself for re-election.
The new Article 108 A will enable a Director to do so subject to the amended provisions of Article 112 of the Companys Articles of Association, which, among other things, will require any Director who has attained the age of 70 to retire at every Annual General Meeting without special notice being given.
Article 112 Under the existing Article 112 of the Companys Articles of Association, up to but not more than one-third of the Directors shall retire each year by rotation.
This could mean that, where the total number of Directors is not a multiple of three, not every Director will have offered himself for re-election every three years.
In practice, all Directors usually have done so but it was felt that Article 112 should be amended to reflect this practice.
It was also felt that Article 112 should be amended so that, in addition, all Directors who have attained the age of 70 years or more must retire each year by rotation.
Supplier Payment Policy Community involvement is a mainstay of the Groups radio operations and the Group considers that this extends equally to its position in the business community.
The Group does not follow a code but operates a payment policy to agreed terms in settling outstanding debts.
For certain types of regular contracted services, the Group encourages direct debit or standing order arrangements.
Most other supplies are on an ad hoc basis and the terms of payment are agreed when the order is placed.
The majority of payments are made by electronic transfer direct to suppliers bank accounts.
The amount of trade creditors shown in the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 represents 42 days 30 September 2004: 41 days of average purchases during the period for the Company and 68 days 30 September 2004: 52 days for the Group.
12 Directors Shareholdings, Share Options and Conditional Share Awards The beneficial interests of the Directors of Capital Radio plc at 1 October 2004 or date of appointment if later and 31 March 2005 the end of the financial period were: At 31 March 2005 At 1 October 2004 Conditional Conditional share share Shares Options awards Shares Options awards D Mansfield 144,923 290,917 307,170 120,823 315,017 220,900 P Davies 45,321 186,646 185,320 45,321 185,827 133,370 P Harris 36,640 153,675 162,590 36,640 153,675 115,860 L Smith 14,492 145,776 160,280 14,492 145,776 110,910 P Cawdron 3,200 3,200 A Illsley 4,200 4,200 T Mason P Mitchell 1,000 1,000 B Thomas 2,414 2,414 P W Williams 2,500 1,500 In addition to the individual shareholdings set out above, the Directors are for Companies Act purposes deemed to be interested in the 606,370 Ordinary Shares held in the Capital Radio Employee Trust.

There were no changes in the Directors registered interests in the shares of the Company during the period from 31 March 2005 to 9 May 2005.
None of the Directors had any interest in the shares of any subsidiary company.
Further details of options and conditional share awards held by the Directors at 31 March 2005 are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Directors and Officers Insurance The Company maintains insurance cover for all directors and officers of group companies against liabilities which may be incurred by them whilst acting as directors or officers.
As at the date of this report, the Directors are granted an indemnity, in accordance with Article 171 of the Articles of Association of the Company, in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office.
Environmental Policy The Group recognises the importance of environmental responsibility and, where practicable, has an environmental policy in place for the relevant business areas of the Group.
The nature of its activities has a minimal effect on the environment but, where it does, the Group acts responsibly and is aware of its obligations at all times.
Treasury The Groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources, and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The principal risk arising from the Groups financial instruments is interest rate risk.
The Board has reviewed and agreed policies for managing this risk and this is summarised below.
This policy has remained unchanged since the beginning of the year.
Short-term debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial asset or liability under Financial Reporting Standard 13 have been excluded from the disclosures as permitted by the Standard.
13 Report of the Directors continued Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Groups operating activities are principally financed by floating rate borrowings, whereas significant investment and acquisition activities are generally financed through fixed interest borrowings.
Liquidity risk Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
The Groups operations are typically cash generative, so exposure to liquidity risk is considered insignificant.
Foreign currency risk The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk as it has no significant investments or financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS The Group is required to adopt IFRS when preparing its report and accounts for the year ending 31 March 2006.
The first financial results announced under IFRS will be the unaudited interim report for the six months to 30 September 2005.
In preparation for this, the Company has performed an evaluation of the accounting impact of adopting IFRS.
Based on this evaluation the Directors have identified the provisions of IFRS which are expected to have the most significant impact.
IFRS2 Share based payment requires the fair value of any share based awards to be expensed over the period to which they relate resulting in a lower profit than under UK GAAP.
IFRS3 Business Combinations requires the allocation of the acquisition price across various intangible assets which will be amortised over the period that they deliver economic benefit.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition will be net of these identified intangibles and will not be amortised but will be subject to an annual impairment test which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value.
This treatment will apply to all existing goodwill held on the Group balance sheet at 1 October 2004.
IAS19 Employee benefits requires the net valuation of a companys defined benefit pension schemes to be reflected in the balance sheet and the values of the assets and liabilities of the schemes to be based on market values at the balance sheet date.
IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements is unlike UK GAAP, as it only recognises the liability to pay the final dividend when it has been approved by shareholders.
It is unlikely, therefore, that a final dividend will be accrued in the Groups accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006 which will result in the value of net assets at that date being correspondingly higher than it would have been under UK GAAP.
This report was approved by the Board shortly before completion of the Merger on 9 May 2005.
