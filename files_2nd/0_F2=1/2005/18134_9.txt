DIRECTORS REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2005 The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The Chairmans Statement and Financial Review should be read in conjunction with this report.
1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES The principal activities of the Group during the year were the investment in, development and management of commercial properties in the UK, Sweden and Continental Europe.
2 REVIEW OF BUSINESS The Consolidated Income Statement for the year is set out on page 60.
A review of results for the year and prospects for the future are included within the Chairmans Statement, Financial Review and Property Review.
3 DIVIDENDS In lieu of paying an interim cash dividend in 2005 the Company distributed 6,920,236 to shareholders equivalent to 8.5 pence per share by way of tender offer buy-back completed in November 2005 2004: distribution of 6,412,286 or 7.5 pence per share.
The Directors have decided to recommend a further tender offer instead of paying a final cash dividend for 2005.
It is proposed, therefore, that the Company offers to buy 1 in 42 of the shares registered in the name of each eligible shareholder at a price of 600 pence per share.
This compares with a mid-market price of 600 pence per share on 24 March 2006 2004: 1 in 41 shares at 485 pence per share.
The resulting distribution to shareholders will be 11,432,844 or 14.3 pence per share, which will be made in May 2006.
When added to the distribution made under the November tender offer, shareholders who take advantage of both tender offers in respect of the financial year 2005 will have received a total return of 22.8 pence per share 2004: 19.3 pence per share.
4 PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS SHARES During the year the Company has made market and tender-offer purchases totalling 3,843,835 of its own shares at a cost of 18,857,977, a weighted average of 491 pence per share.
This represents 960,959 in nominal value, or 4.58 per cent of the brought forward called up share capital.
Shares purchased during the November tender offer and through the market have been retained as Treasury shares.
The Directors considered that the purchases were in the best interests of the shareholders given the cash resources of the Company and the discount in the market price of the Companys shares to their net asset value.
At the 2005 Annual General Meeting the Company was authorised to make market purchases of up to 8,183,707 ordinary shares.
Since last years Annual General Meeting the Company has made market purchases of 434,746 shares and therefore still has authority to purchase 7,748,961.
Included within these market purchases was one transaction since the year end, being 27,746 shares at 550.0 pence per share on 14 March 2006.
A resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to give the Company authority to make market purchases of up to 7,812,446 shares.
5 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO A valuation of all the properties in the Group as at 31 December 2005 was carried out by Allsop & Co for the UK and Sweden, and DTZ Debenham Tie Leung for France, which produced an open market value of 1,096.4 million 2004: 1,022.5 million.
On the basis of these valuations net assets per share amounted to 606.9 pence 2004: 522.3 pence.
In view of the policy of re-valuing properties bi-annually, in the opinion of the Directors there was no significant permanent difference between market and book values of the properties at 31 December 2005.

The Board has determined that, apart from Bengt Mortstedt and Tom Thomson, the Non-Executive Directors are independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances which could materially affect or interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Board recognises that Keith Harris and Thomas Lundqvist, having served for more than 9 years as Directors, no longer meet the criteria for independence set out in the Combined Code.
After careful review, it is the opinion of the Board that they remain independent of the management of the Company, having regard to their financial independence and other commercial interests.
It is the Boards view that they add significant value to the operation of the Company through their combined wisdom and varying experience and as such it is currently not appropriate to change a successful team.
However, as recommended under the Combined Code, Keith Harris, Bengt Mortstedt and Thomas Lundqvist will retire annually and they will seek re-election to the Board at the Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Steven Board and James Dean will retire at the Annual General Meeting and seek re-election to the Board.
The Board recommends to the shareholders the re-election of the retiring Directors who have all contributed to the continuing financial success of the Company.

Combined Code The Board supports the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code 2003 and incorporated into the rules of the UK Listing Authority.
Save as identified and explained below, the Board considers that it has complied with all the provisions of the Combined Code.
The Board The Board currently comprises four Executive Directors, including the Chairman, and five Non-Executive Directors.
On 1 January 2006 Tom Thomson ceased to be an Executive Director and became a Non-Executive Director.
The Board notes that the Combined Code guidance recommends that at least half the Board should comprise independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has determined that James Dean, Keith Harris and Thomas Lundqvist are independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances which could materially affect of interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Board is satisfied with the balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors which allows it to exercise objectivity in decision making and proper control of the Companys business.
The Board considers its composition is appropriate in view of the size and requirements of the Groups business and the need to maintain a practical balance between Executives and Non-Executives.
Due to the structure of the Company it is considered that it is not appropriate to change the successful Board composition at present.
During the year, the Chairman has conferred with the Non-Executive Directors without the other Executive Directors present, and the Non-Executive Directors have met without the Executive Directors or the Chairman present.
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment, and are subject to re-election at least every three years.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a specific term of office which provides for their removal in certain circumstances, including under section 303 of the Companies Act.
The Board does not automatically re-nominate Non-Executive Directors for election by shareholders.
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors can be obtained by request to the Company Secretary.
The Board has appointed Keith Harris to be the Senior Independent Director.
As recommended by the Combined Code, Keith Harris is available to shareholders who cannot appropriately approach either the Chairman or the Chief Executive about a Company matter.
As Senior Independent Director, Keith Harris is also involved in succession planning and advises the Chairman as required.
The Boards primary objective is to focus on adding value to the assets of the Group by identifying and assessing business opportunities and ensuring that potential risks are identified, monitored and controlled.
Matters reserved for Board decisions include strategic longterm objectives and capital structure of major transactions.
The implementation of Board decisions and day to day operations of the Group are delegated to Management.
In making commercial assessments the Directors review detailed plans including financial viability reports that, among other things, detail the impact of proposals in respect of return on capital, return on cash and the likely impact on the profit and loss account, cash flows and gearing.
Strategy is determined after having taken due regard of forecast domestic and international developments.
The views of shareholders are sought in meetings held variously by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and are reported back to the Board.
The Board is also advised of the views of shareholders as received by the Companys brokers.
Group and divisional budgets and quarterly financial forecasts including net assets and cashflow projections are formally reviewed by the Board on a quarterly basis.
In addition the Executive Directors monitor cashflows on a weekly basis.
The Board met five times during the year and is responsible to the shareholders of the Company for the strategy and future development of the Group and the management of its resources.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision, which has been updated during the year: other decisions are dealt with as day-to-day matters by management.
Directors are, where necessary, able to obtain independent professional advice at the Companys expense and have access to the services of the Company Secretary.
They are given appropriate training and assistance on appointment to the Board and later, if and when required.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Non-Executive Directors met formally during the year without either the Chairman or the Executive Directors present.
During the year, the Chairman has undertaken a process of review of the Board, its Committees and Directors as recommended by the Combined Code.
This process included assessing the contribution to the Group of each individual Board member.
The results of this review have been discussed with the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and reported to the Board.
The performance of the Chairman was reviewed by the Non-Executive Directors.

There is a division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman, who is responsible for the overall strategy of the Group, and the Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for implementing the strategy and day to day running of the Group.
He is assisted by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
The Board has approved a written statement of the division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Non-Executive Directors fulfil a key role in corporate accountability.
The remits and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees of the Board are set out below.
The terms of reference of the Committees can be obtained by contacting the Company Secretary at the Registered Office.
The Board is assisted by the following Committees: The Audit Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors Keith Harris Chairman, James Dean and Thomas Lundqvist and has met three times during the year.
The principal duties of the committee are to review the half-yearly and annual financial statements before their submission to the Board and to consider any matters raised by the auditors.
The Committee also reviews the independence and objectivity of the auditors.
The terms of reference of the Committee reflect current best practice, including authority to: Recommend the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor Ensuring the objectivity and independence of the auditors including occasions when non-audit services are provided Ensure appropriate whistle-blowing arrangements are in place The Non-Executive directors may seek information from any employee of the Group and obtain external professional advice at the expense of the Company if considered necessary.
Due to the relatively low number of personnel employed within the Group, the nature of the business and the current control and review systems in place, the Board has decided not to establish a separate internal audit department.
The Remuneration Committee comprises two Non-Executive Directors, James Dean and Keith Harris.
The Board has considered the Combined Codes recommendation that the Remuneration Committee should be formed of three Non-Executive Directors, however it believes that the purposes of the Committee are best achieved by the current two independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee has met twice during the year.
The Committee considers the employment and performance of individual Executive Directors and determines their terms of service and remuneration.
It also has authority to grant options under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme and Company Share Option Plan.
The Committee meets at least once a year.
Full details of the Committees work is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 58.
The Board of Directors has considered the appointment of a separate Nomination Committee, as recommended by the 2003 Code, however due to the size and nature of the Company, this function is carried out by the members of the Remuneration Committee with the Executive Chairman.
52 DIRECTORS REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2005 9 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED Internal Control The Board acknowledges that the Directors are responsible for the Groups system of internal control and have established procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss.
These procedures have operated for the entire financial year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the period.
The Directors have recognised that such a system can only provide a reasonable and not absolute assurance that there has been no material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the process by which the system of internal control is monitored are as follows: The risks which the Group faces or is likely to face are reviewed on an ongoing basis in Board and executive meetings The control mechanisms for each identified risk are reviewed regularly Problems which arise are reviewed to determine whether they could have been avoided or their effect mitigated through improved control procedures The risk and control features of new projects are assessed as they arise The Audit Committee considers any internal control issues raised by the external auditors or management.
Set out on pages 7 to 27 is the description of the Groups operations and the strategy which it employs to maximise returns and minimise risks.
Quarterly and annual budgets are prepared for each area and monitored.
Parameters have been established for investment decisions to be referred to the Board for approval.
Three-yearly rolling cash flows are updated and distributed weekly and appropriate expenditure authorisation procedures have been adopted.
Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss for the year.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that the Financial Statements comply with the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors also have a general responsibility for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the CLS Holdings plc website.
Uncertainty regarding legal requirements is compounded as information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements relating to the preparation and dissemination of financial statements.
Shareholder Relations The Group issues full annual accounts to each of its shareholders and at the half-year an Interim Report is sent to all shareholders.
In addition, all press releases are included on the Companys website.
The Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management have regular meetings with institutional shareholders.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Companys Annual General Meeting and to arrange individual meetings by appointment.
The views received at such meetings are fed back to the Board.
Business Ethics The Board recognises the importance of the Companys responsibilities as an ethical employer and views matters in which the Company interacts with the community both socially and economically as the responsibility of the whole Board.
Health & Safety It is a primary concern of the Board that the Company manages its activities in such a manner as to ensure that the health and safety of its employees, tenants, advisors, contractors and the general public is not compromised.
53 DIRECTORS REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2005 9 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED Environmental Issues The Board is aware of the Companys environmental impact and therefore seeks to both minimise adverse effects and enhance positive effects.
The Company encourages recycling and energy conservation.
Our major refurbishment project in Sweden received a P mark award thereby ensuring our tenants receive a quality system for air, temperature, light, damp, noise, emissions from materials, static electricity and magnetic fields.
Non compliance with the Combined Code With the exception of the absence of a Nominations Committee, that the Remuneration Committee consists of two independent Non-Executive Directors as explained in further detail above, and that the Chairman is not independent, the Company has complied throughout the financial year with the provisions of the Combined Code.
10 EMPLOYEES The Directors believe that the Groups employees are a source of competitive advantage.
The Directors recognise that continued and sustained improvement in the performance of the Group depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain employees of the highest calibre.
The Group is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in employment.
It seeks to ensure that no employee or applicant is treated less favourably on the grounds of gender, marital status, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion, disability or sexual orientation or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements, including age limits, which cannot be objectively justified.
Entry into and progression within the Group are solely determined by the application of job criteria, personal aptitude and competence.
It is the Groups policy to apply best practice in the employment of disabled people.
Full and fair consideration is given to every application for employment from disabled persons whose aptitude and skills can be utilised in the business and to their training and career development.
This includes, wherever possible, the retraining and retention of staff who become disabled during their employment.
All staff are informed of matters concerning their interest as employees and the financial and economic factors affecting the business.
Established management communication channels have been supplemented by direct presentations to staff by Directors to explain developments of particular significance.

At 31 December 2005 there were share options for 595,000 shares outstanding 2004: 585,000.
