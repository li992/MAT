Barclays PLC 64 Annual Report 2005 Risk management Allowances for Impairment Total impairment allowances at the end of 2005 increased by 27% 739m to 3,450m over the provisions balances for the prior year 2,711m.
Of this increase, 545m is in regard to the acquisition of Absa.
Furthermore, due to the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1st January and the consequent restatement of the impairment allowance, the period end value at 31st December 2004 does not correspond to the opening value at the beginning of 2005 which was restated as 2,637m.
Excluding Absa, the increase from the opening to closing balances in 2005 was 10%.
An analysis of all the movements in the impairment balances is shown in the following chart.

Including Absa, the NPL and PCRL coverage ratios increased to 66.2% and 56.2% respectively at the end of 2005.
These ratios are higher than those excluding Absa due to the fact that Absa has a higher proportion of retail lending which, in general, tends to carry a higher level of coverage than corporate lending.
Excluding Absa, coverage of NPLs and PCRLs by the stock of impairment allowances, at 64.8% 2004: 66.9% and 55.5% 2004: 56.0% were broadly in line with those reported at 31st December 2004.
