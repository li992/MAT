Sensing In centres of excellence across the group, Meggitt makes sensors to measure virtually every physical , speed, pressure, force, temperature, distance, position, vibration and level without fail, long term and in severe conditions.
They function on engines at high temperatures: on heart muscles and in the blood stream: on anthropomorphic dummies fixed to ejector seats: immersed in jet fuel: at missile and satellite launches: on offshore wind turbines: on helicopter rotor heads in the desert.
We deploy a wide array of technologies, which include piezo electric, piezo resistive, capacitive, resistive, inductive, magnetic and optical sensors, to address our customers key challenges: high temperature, high shock, limited space and weight, biocompatibility and communications.
In-house and with universities and national labs in Europe and the United States, we are developing our already considerable high temperature sensing capabilitya key enabler for future jet engines and power generationand investing substantially in our microelectronic mechanical systems MEMS facility, ready to make silicon carbide sensors for next generation gas turbines.
Sophie Ramo Innovation Engineering Leader Endevco, California After a Bachelors in Mathematics and implantable material for miniaturised Computer Science from UCLA, a Masters medical devices.
Our work on networked in Computer Science and an MBA, I led sensors could revolutionise current software development at several private sensor instrumentation by size, weight, companies.
Now I lead innovation heat and cost in unmanned applications.
My job is to Despite the inevitable highs and lows fire the imagination but keep feet on of product innovation, working with firstthe ground, managing risk, balancing rate scientists hereall racing to meet resource.
Were working on stable market demandis on a par with the sensing materials that can withstand exhilaration I feel when surfing each day, temperatures up to 1000C for turbine catching a wave at sunrise.
