co. uk 9 Operating and Financial Review UK Housing Taking action to strengthen results UK housing market Peter Redfern Chief Executive George Wimpey UK During 2005 the UK experienced the most challenging housing market for a number of years.
Peter was appointed of interest rate rises over the course of 2004 and concerns over house price ination saw greatly reduced Deputy Group Chief Executive activity levels.
According to the Land Registry, total housing market transactions reduced by 17% compared in February 2006. with the previous year.
Despite widespread concerns at the start of the year, overall prices remained broadly stable, with modest ongoing increases in some markets offset by similar declines elsewhere.
The new build market generally saw a significant increase in the use of incentives in order to keep total volume declines to a minimum.
The long term outlook for the The long term outlook for the new home market remains positive.
The fundamental supply demand new home market in the UK imbalance remains.
A steadily increasing, aging population, reduced average household size and an aging remains positive.
The demand housing stock are driving demand for new homes to an estimated 220,000 homes per year.
In contrast the for new homes is estimated regulatory environment, and in particular the restrictive planning system, is constraining the supply of new to be 220,000 per year.
Since the General Election in May 2005, the Government has repeatedly indicated its support for the findings of the Barker Review carried out in 2004, which looked at the causes of undersupply of housing in the UK.
The findings of the review called for a step change in housing output through widespread release of land for new housing and reform of the planning system.
Much of the detail of how these recommendations will be implemented is not planned until the completion of the 2007 Spending Review.
In the meantime, the Government has asserted its intention to achieve a steady growth in annual housing starts and is consulting the industry and other interested parties on a range of policy initiatives.
George Wimpey is actively involved in these discussions with the Government, both directly and through its membership of the Home Builders Federation and the CBI.
We hope that a favourable outcome will be achieved which is in the interests of both the Company and the industry as well as meeting the Governments public policy objectives.
At the same time, we have been seeking to reassure the Government and others that George Wimpey and the wider industry are well placed to step up to the challenge of delivering high quality housing in the quantities demanded.
George Wimpey market conditions Market conditions weakened considerably during the second half of 2004.
Although the first few weeks of 2005 started encouragingly, the recovery was short lived and George Wimpey experienced challenging market conditions across all its businesses throughout most of 2005.
The traditional key spring selling season remained subdued and the market remained slow, but steady, for much of the year.
Customers were generally cautious, taking longer to commit to their purchase and, as a result of the material reduction in total housing transactions, often experiencing delays in selling their existing home.
This problem was exacerbated by the unrealistic price expectations in much of the second hand market as some sellers and agents projected continued price increases.
10 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Operating and Financial Review In line with the industry, our visitor levels were below those achieved in 2004.
Sales rates were well below It remains our strategy to deliver the prior year during the first half.
As a result of the impact of market conditions on our sales rates through longer term volume growth in the UK and we believe the long the second half of 2004 and first half of 2005, our forward sales position was unusually low at the end of term fundamentals of the UK June.
We therefore took action by raising the bar on our sales processes and people, and by using our housing market are in place for standard forms of incentives, both to deliver our full year volume targets and to rebuild our order book.
As a result, sales rates during the second half were well above prior year levels.
Towards the end of the year there was some evidence of the market stabilising, particularly in the south of the country, as confidence started to return after interest rates were cut in August.
Strategy It remains our strategy to deliver longer term volume growth in the UK and we believe the long term fundamentals of the UK housing market are in place for us to achieve this.
However, the market conditions over the past 18 months have had an inevitable impact on the financial performance of our business.
In addition there have been some areas of our business that have not performed at the levels we demand.
We have taken a number of actions to address these.
At the end of 2005 we introduced a new UK operating structure which will manage all of our businesses At the end of 2005 we introduced a new UK operating structure which within a simplied structure of three geographical divisions.

Going forward all our businesses will have the opportunity to use We have strengthened a number both brands.
This will allow better use of larger sites, provide greater returns on future land purchases of senior management roles within and improve our overhead efficiency.
Over the past two years, in light of a competitive environment and the risk of over-development, we have limited our exposure to high-rise, inner-city developments.
We have reduced our risk exposure to this market further through joint ventures for three developments in London and Manchester.
After further review we feel the skills and capital intensity required for this business are in many cases too different from our core business to justify further investment.
Where this is the case, we will therefore be withdrawing from this market, building out current projects as planned.
We have taken other actions on our product range and order book which are set out below.
Financial review In 2005 turnover for the UK business was 2,157.6 million, 5% below last year 2004: 2,277.9 million.
Operating profits were impacted by the more challenging market conditions requiring greater use of incentives, which had the effect of reducing net prices during the year at a time when land costs were continuing to increase.
Operating profits reduced to 278.0 million 2004: 409.4 million with operating margins falling to 12.9% 2004: 18.0%.
Operating margins have been adversely affected by a number of issues.
Lower average selling prices and the impact of a changing mix, with a greater proportion of smaller private products and affordable housing, has reduced margins by around 2%.
The impact of higher land costs driven by land ination has reduced margins by another 3%.

Of 21 planning appeals heard during the year, we were successful in 18.
The total number of completions was 12,100 just 1% below the prior year 2004: 12,232.
The total number 12 of private development completions was 10,678, 5% below last year as a result of the reduced order book at the start of the year and the slower market conditions experienced throughout the year 2004: 11,274.
8 The number of affordable completions rose 48% to 1,422 2004: 958, largely as a result of increased planning requirements.
4 George Wimpey maintained an even geographic spread across the UK market.
We intend to continue to do so, and focus our activities on those markets with the opportunity to maintain consistent sales rates.

Average selling prices on private completions fell by 2% to 188,600 2004: 193,400, largely caused by the increased use of incentives which were used throughout the year at slightly higher levels than previously.

We were able to achieve this by an even greater increase our sales rate.
As a result focus on promotion and sales presentation as well as by the use of targeted incentives.
The range of second half reservations increased incentives used continues to be varied, plot specic and tailored to individual customers requirements.
The decision to strengthen our order book has had a short term impact on margins, which we estimate to be 1% on sales taken in the second half of 2005.
However we are now strongly placed to start reducing incentives and increase prices, as well as grow volumes in the first half of 2006.
This will enable us to begin to rebuild our margin position.
Build costs have been broadly at, with most of the effects of ination offset by our own actions.
At the beginning of 2005 we announced a programme to reduce our cost base by 20 million, of which 17 million would be achieved in 2005.
We have achieved 18 million of savings in 2005, with the balance expected in the early part of 2006.
We have reduced our overheads year on year, with cost savings more than countering ination and restructuring and redundancy costs of 5.2 million.
Maintaining a tight control of costs has always been a major focus within our business.
We seek to gain maximum benefit from our scale and work in partnership with a number of suppliers to ensure mutual benets and lower build costs.
We have worked further to improve our environmental management systems on-site, which is helping to reduce the amount we pay in landll tax and in other costs associated with removal of waste materials 12 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 12.4 14.5 16.5 17.9 18.0 12.9 Operating and Financial Review from browneld sites as well as ensuring we achieve industry leading environmental performance.

has grown as we have been required to build a high proportion of bespoke products.
As a result, costs have increased signicantly, with many bespoke products often exceeding our original expectations.
We have therefore reviewed our product range with the objectives of reducing and controlling costs whilst still delivering products the customer wants and meeting the aspirations of local and national planners.
As part of this, we have developed a preferred house type range as a benchmark across our organisation.
This incorporates a comprehensive product range from one bedroom apartments through to large detached houses and enables us to establish common oorplans, which are efficient to build and meet our customers requirements for space usage, whilst at the same time enabling us to modify elevations and exterior design to meet the requirements of local planners.
Product mix UK housing Product mix The proportion of sales accounted for by 4 5 bedroom homes fell during the year to 32% 2004: 37% with % the proportion of apartments rising to 36% 2004: 31%.
As the proportion of apartments has increased, the average square footage of our products fell slightly to 994 sq ft 2004: 1,033 sq ft as the proportion of affordable homes as well as apartments grew at the expense of 4 5 bedroom homes.
As a volume housebuilder we continue to build a mix of products that meets the needs and requirements of our customers and provides a wide range of products to satisfy a broad market.
However, in recent years, following rapid price inflation, affordability has become an issue for customers of our smaller products.
These are now all too often outside the price range of the first time buyer and the key worker.
We have therefore reviewed the market for first time buyer products and identied an opportunity for George Wimpey to introduce a new range of compact, affordable homes which will meet currently unsatisfied demand.
This range, initially of one and two bedroom apartments, has been trialled on sites in the Apartments 36% Midland region and the first developments will come on sale during the first half of 2006.
We will 2 3 bed homes 32% 4 5 bed homes 32% use some restrictive covenants to ensure we are benefiting the target customer groups.
We believe these products will meet many of the housing concerns of both local and central Government and with the support of such authorities, we hope to extend this product range across the country during 2006.
In October it was announced that George Wimpey had been chosen as one of the nalists in the Design for Manufacture Competition, the Governments initiative to provide good quality, cost effective housing built using modern methods of construction.
The first of these homes are being built at Oxley Park in Milton Keynes.
Quality and customers All our businesses aim to provide industry leading levels of customer service which set us apart from our competitors.
We use an independently administered survey to monitor our customer satisfaction.

co. uk 13 Total CSM scores Recommendation rates Operating and Financial Review UK Housing continued Landbank During recent years we have made progress in improving both the length and quality of our landbank and have increased the focus on securing planning on more of our longer term strategic land sites.
Nevertheless our landbank remains relatively short when compared to our peers, with the majority of homes sold coming from sites acquired within the past two years.
The total owned and controlled landbank at the end of 2005 was 50,985 plots, similar to the number at the end of 2004, 51,119 plots.
We have made a number of improvements in our landbuying which is reected in the fact that our average cost per plot in the landbank of 47,200 2004: 45,600 is slightly lower than that on completions during the year of 47,300 2004: 44,300.
We believe that the operational changes we made during 2005 will continue to improve this position.
The average coverage of sites excluding high-rise inner-city developments was 15,448 sq ft per acre 2004: 17,902 sq ft per acre.
The number of plots coming into the short term landbank from the strategic landbank has increased during the year to 1,568 plots 2004: 1,079 plots.
The strategic landbank now stands at 14,169 acres 2004: 17,571 acres.
The land market traditionally lags the product market, so the slowing down in house prices from the middle of 2004 has been only gradually reected in the land market.
As a result during 2005 we took the decision to slow the growth in our landbank until both the housing and land market conditions became more certain.
However, we have continued to focus our attention on larger sites where we have some competitive advantage from our scale and reputation for corporate social responsibility.

Although we would anticipate public policy will aim to ensure house prices increase by no more than earnings for a period of time, the interest rate reduction in August and the indications of improved customer confidence in the early weeks of 2006 give some cause to anticipate a better market environment in the coming year.
