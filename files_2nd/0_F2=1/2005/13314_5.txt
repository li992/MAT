Another important area of attention is our administration efficiency and our responsiveness to customers.
We are in the early stages of planning process changes to make the company more efficient in terms of its administration costs.
We believe that we can improve responsiveness to customers and the quality of our processes, meaning less errors, at the same time as reducing costs.
While a significant part of this will be enabled by a better use of technology, there is quite a bit that can be achieved by questioning and modifying the way we do things now.
Market conditions in 2006 are unlikely to be helpful in the groups major European markets.
Revenue growth and contract retention are both expected to improve in 2006 as the operational turnarounds take effect and the investment made in sales and service begins to bear fruit.
There will be significant organic investment and one-off costs in the first half of the year which will impact prior year comparisons.
Although we do not expect to achieve full year adjusted PBTA growth before 2007, we do expect to exit 2006 on a rising trend in the second half.
We are unlikely to increase the dividend in 2006.
Beyond 2006, we expect to take a cautious approach to dividend growth until a recovery is well established.
While continuing to run the business and improve customer and business performance we have asked our managers to take on a massive project load as we seek to turnaround the companys performance.
I have said that turning our company around is all about people and I want to thank all our people for their hard work and dedication during the year.
As you can see, we have a lot to do.
We are fully engaged and I firmly believe it can be done.
