1 Performance share plan The committee awarded shares under the PSP conditional upon the achievement of corporate performance targets over a period of three years.
Performance is assessed against two criteria: by comparing the growth in TSR, in terms of share price growth and dividends, to that of the TSR of the FTSE Food Producers Index, excluding Unilever: and by assessing the underlying performance of Northern Foods by reference to the real growth in earnings per share over the same period.
Vesting of the PSP is triggered by real growth in earnings per share in excess of 3 per cent per annum over a three-year period.
If this condition is met the proportion of the award vesting is assessed by comparing the growth in TSR, in terms of share price growth and dividends, to that of the TSR of the companies comprising the FTSE Food Producers Index, excluding Unilever.
The TSR performance is assessed by reference to a vesting scale, whereby for the full award to qualify for vesting, the total return to the companys ordinary shareholders during the three-year performance period places it in the top quartile of the comparator group.
If the groups performance is ranked at 50 per cent or lower, all of the conditional awards will lapse.
Where the company is placed between 50 per cent and the top quartile, the maximum number of shares available for vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis with 25 per cent of the award being available when the company is placed at 51 per cent and the entire award being available where the company is placed in the top quartile.
The companies comprising the comparator group at the start of the performance period were: ABF Northern Foods Arla Richmond Cadbury Robert Wiseman Cranswick Sygen Dairy Crest Tate & Lyle Devro Uniq Geest Shares Maximum Beneficial released by potential award Beneficial Conditional interest at the nominee granted interest at interest at 31 March 26 July 17 December 2 April 2 April 1 2 4 5 4 2004 2004 2004 2005 2005 Table 5 Performance share plan Notes number number number number M S Christie resigned 22 October 2004 53,450 26,962 26,488 M T Gribbin 3 28,273 14,396 13,877 P A ODriscoll 4 173,130 173,130 H R Sims resigned 30 June 2004 3 34,358 17,481 16,877 116,081 58,839 173,130 57,242 173,130 Notes to Table 5 Note 1 The interest in shares at 31 March 2004 comprised vested shares in respect of the awards made on 9 September 1999 and 7 September 2000 held by the nominee for the two-year retention period.
