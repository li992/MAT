Responsibilities of the Directors HALMA United Kingdom Company Law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for that period.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that proper accounting records are maintained which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors also have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities and are responsible for the system of internal control.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the financial statements on pages 48 to 73 and the disclosures on pages 39 to 45 relating to the remuneration of the Directors, appropriate accounting policies have been used, which have been consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
