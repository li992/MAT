Boots Group PLC annual report and accounts 2005 01 welcome Boots has taken enormous strides forward in the past 12 months.
We have been talking about change for more than two years now.
But the progress made in 2004 05 has really moved the business on.
We have, among other things, cut prices on a further 2,000 lines by about 14%, changed opening hours, put more stores in places where customers want to shop and relaunched key lines.
We have re-engineered our supply chain, rebuilt our IT systems and shut a major manufacturing plant.
We have been working to put the chemists back in Boots a recognition that healthcare has always been at the heart of our business and will continue to be.
It has not all been straightforward.
The changes have been made as the trading environment has worsened and our sales line did not perform as well as we hoped in the last quarter of the year.
But nothing that has happened has knocked our faith in our strategy.
We are in the process of Building a better Boots: one that is true to its heritage, a company trusted by successive generations because it is The Health and Beauty Expert.
