Annual Report & Accounts 2005 48 Kazakhmys PLC Directors Report The Directors have pleasure in presenting their report for Kazakhmys PLC and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Results and dividend Group profit for the year, after taxation and minority interests, amounted to $538.8 million.
Turnover and profit before taxation, finance items and negative goodwill increased by 106.2% and 45.6% respectively, compared to the year ended 31 December 2004 principally due to rising commodity prices and the acquisition of MKM.
More information concerning the Groups results is set out in the Review of Operations on pages 16 to 19 and the Financial Review on pages 20 to 35.
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 20.6856 pence per ordinary share to be paid, subject to the passing of the Resolution at the AGM relating to the adoption of revised articles of association, in US dollars at 36.0 US cents per ordinary share.
Subject to shareholders approving this recommendation at the AGM, the dividend will be paid on 26 May 2006 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 28 April 2006.
Shareholders may elect to receive their dividends in UK pounds sterling.
The interim dividend paid on 5 July 2005 of $6.8120 per ordinary share of 5 each or the equivalent of 27.0 US cents per ordinary share of 20 pence each after the share split which took place on 23 September 2005 at a total cost of $110.0 million was paid out of profits available for distribution as shown in the accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2004 but was charged against retained earnings for the year ended 31 December 2005 in accordance with IFRS.
Principal activities and review of the business The Group operates in the mining industry.
Its principal business is the mining, processing, smelting, refining and sale of copper and copper products, including copper cathode and copper rod, zinc and other metal by-products carried on primarily through the Companys main subsidiary, Kazakhmys LLC, which is the largest producer of copper in Kazakhstan.
Its operations are vertically integrated: it mines all the ore it processes, produces substantially all the copper concentrate it processes and generates sufficient electricity to meet its own requirements.
It operates five open pit and 12 underground mines and two copper smelting and refining complexes in various parts of Kazakhstan.
It also owns significant rail infrastructure in Kazakhstan.
The Group also owns MKM, a copper fabricating business.
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the profits or net assets of the Group are listed in note 55 to the financial statements.
A full review of the Groups operations giving a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the development and performance of the business of the Group during the financial year and setting out the position of the Group at the year end, consistent with the size and complexity of the business, is contained in the Review of Operations on pages 16 to 19 and the Financial Review on pages 20 to 35.
Additional information relating to community and employee welfare issues is contained on pages 36 to 39.
Events since the balance sheet date On 31 January 2006, the Company made a capital contribution of $185.7 million to Kazakhmys LLC.
The offer period for subscribing shareholders to take up the right of minority interests who did not participate in the capital contribution, as permitted by legislation, closed on 14 March 2006.
The Companys interest in Kazakhmys LLC resulting from this capital contribution increased from 98.68% as at 31 December 2005 to 99.08%.
On 14 March 2006, the Company announced that a vehicle wholly owned by the Companys executive Chairman, Mr Kim, had agreed to acquire a 25% stake in ENRC Kazakhstan Holding B. V. EKH, the holding company for certain assets of the Eurasia Natural Resources groups metals and mining business.
EKH primarily operates in Kazakhstan producing, in particular, chrome, iron ore and alumina.
The Company has been given the benefit of a call option in respect of Mr Kims shareholding in EKH.
The terms of the call option allow the Company, at its absolute discretion, from 1 January 2007 to and until 31 December 2007, to call for Mr Kims interest in EKH to be transferred to the Company for a consideration representing 100% of Mr Kims initial investment of $751 million plus a 10% margin reflecting the risk of the initial investment and the actual financing and transaction costs incurred by Mr Kim.
This is provided that, as required by the Listing Rules, this consideration and the terms of the option are determined by an independent adviser to be fair and reasonable so far as the remaining shareholders of the Company are concerned.
Mr Kim is not permitted to dispose of his interest in EKH before 1 January 2008 without the consent of the Company.
Should the Company exercise the call option, then it will comply with all class tests and related party rules relevant to the Company.
Any such decision would be taken by an independent committee of the Board.
Future developments The Directors are looking at opportunities to use the proceeds from the Companys Listing as a platform upon which to grow the operations of the Group both organically by optimising performance of existing assets, by completing existing growth and expansion projects including the new mine at Zhaman-Aybat and the feasibility study at Aktogay, by seeking growth opportunities in natural resources within Kazakhstan and Central Asia and through opportunistic acquisitions.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 49 Share capital Authorised and issued share capital The Companys authorised share capital as at 31 December 2005 was 150,000,001 comprising 750,000,000 ordinary shares of 20 pence each and one special share of 1.
The Companys issued share capital as at that date was 467,474,200 ordinary shares of 20 pence, each credited as fully paid.
Allotment and redemption of shares In October 2004, all of the then issued and unissued ordinary shares of 1 each of the Company were consolidated and divided into 10,000 ordinary shares of 5 each and the authorised share capital of the Company was increased to 100,050,000 by the creation of 19,990,000 ordinary shares of 5 each and 50,000 redeemable preference shares of 1 each.
On 19 November 2004, the authorised share capital of the Company was increased from 100,050,000 to 100,050,001 by the creation of one special share of 1, issued to Perry Partners S. A. in connection with the re-financing of a debt.
Various share exchange agreements were entered into following the offer made by the Company to shareholders of Kazakhmys LLC, by which the Company acquired Kazakhmys LLC on 23 November 2004.
The consideration offered for each Kazakhmys share was one ordinary share in the Company or a cash payment of KZT 4,736.
The Company issued 15,580,210 ordinary shares of 5 each on or around 25 November 2004.
No shareholder elected for the cash option and the offer period closed on 7 January 2005.
However, due to delays in processing the relevant documentation in Kazakhstan, it was not possible to register all of the valid acceptances under share exchange agreements until after that date.
Consequently, a further 568,738 ordinary shares of 5 each were issued in the period to 23 August 2005 and an additional 2,000 ordinary shares of 20 pence each were issued equivalent to 80 ordinary shares of 5 each prior to the share split which took place on 23 September 2005 on 29 December 2005.
All acceptances still outstanding under the share exchange agreements at the time of the Listing have been fully processed.
On 20 September 2005, the 50,000 redeemable preference shares of 1 each were redeemed.
At an extraordinary general meeting held on 23 September 2005 the 50,000 nominal amount of authorised share capital of the Company formerly divided into the 50,000 redeemable preference shares of 1 each was divided into 10,000 ordinary shares of 5 each, and each issued and unissued ordinary share of 5 was sub-divided into 25 ordinary shares of 20 pence each.
The authorised share capital of the Company was then increased from 100,050,001 to 150,000,001 by the creation of 249,750,000 additional ordinary shares.
On 26 September 2005, the Company issued 5,314,425 ordinary shares of 20 pence each in consideration for the transfer to it of 127,546,200 units equivalent to 212,577 shares in Kazakhmys LLC from Kinton Trade Limited.
This was at an exchange rate equivalent to that applied pursuant to the share exchange offer made by the Company in November 2004 when it first acquired units in Kazakhmys LLC.
On 12 October 2005, the Companys ordinary shares were admitted to the Official List of the Financial Services Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
Following the exercise of an over-allotment option, the global offer comprised 140,849,373 ordinary shares of 20 pence each, of which 58,434,025 new ordinary shares of 20 pence each were issued by the Company and 82,415,348 ordinary shares of 20 pence each were sold by existing shareholders.
Gross proceeds of $553.7 million 315.5 million were received by the Company as a result of the issue of the new ordinary shares.
On 17 November 2005, the special share of 1 was redeemed and the issued share capital of the Company was reduced accordingly.
It is proposed that a Resolution be passed at the forthcoming AGM of the Company to cancel the special share of 1, thereby reducing the authorised share capital of the Company accordingly.
The changes to the authorised and issued share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2005 are also set out in note 24 to the financial statements.
A Special Resolution will be put to shareholders at this years AGM to give authority to make market purchases of the Companys shares up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 50 Kazakhmys PLC Directors Report continued Market value of land and buildings Land is carried in the balance sheet at deemed cost resulting from a revaluation, which was undertaken as at 1 January 2002 as part of the Groups transition to reporting under IFRS.
It is not practical to estimate the market value of land and mineral reserves and resources at each balance sheet date.
Health, safety and environment Objectives Prior to Listing the Board recognised that improvements were needed in the safety and environmental performance of the Group and, in the short term, its key target is to establish a solid platform from which such improvements can be developed.
That platform will be built around accountability, systems and measurement and its creation is the immediate objective.
Accountability The Board has established a Health, Safety and Environment Committee of the Board the HSE Committee chaired by Mr David Munro, and with Messrs Yong Keu Cha and James Rutland as members.
The HSE Committee will meet not less than twice a year and is responsible for formulating and recommending to the Board all matters of policy on health, safety and environmental issues, focusing primarily on compliance with national and international standards to ensure that an effective system of standard procedures and practices is in place at each of the Groups sites.
The HSE Committee is also responsible for reviewing management investigations of incidents or accidents that occur in order to assess whether policy improvements are required.
Health and safety Systems A detailed health and safety audit was commissioned from Wardell Armstrong, independent consultants, in 2005.
As a result of that survey Wardell Armstrong recommended enhancements to the Groups safety management system to bring it up to international standards.
Those recommendations will form the basis for initiatives to improve the system over the coming years.
Measures While the Group is in compliance with applicable safety legislation in Kazakhstan, the level of accidents is higher than the Board considers to be acceptable.
Although fatalities have reduced from 49 in 2002 to 33 in 2005, the Board does not consider any fatalities to be acceptable and is seeking the deployment of a number of initiatives to reduce fatalities and serious accidents.
Environmental Systems There are four principal environmental laws in Kazakhstan that address, among other things, protection of the natural environment, air and water quality, emissions standards and disposal of waste.
Compliance with these laws is the current driver for environmental performance within the Group.
Industrial companies are required to undertake programmes to reduce, control or eliminate pollution.
These are enforced through a mechanism of payment obligations on levels of emissions and waste storage.
Emissions and storage above benchmark levels give rise to additional payment obligations.
The Groups total payment obligations in respect of air emissions, pollution discharge and waste disposal amounted to $1.8 million and $2.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the Group is in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental legislation in Kazakhstan.
Kazakh legislation also requires the rehabilitation of site operations that have been closed down.
As a condition of its subsoil use contracts and licences, the Group sets aside dedicated funds for the cost of decommissioning and other rehabilitation costs for each mine or group of mines.
The Group provides for the estimated costs of decommissioning based on the discounted costs of reclaiming the mine or group of mines at the dates of depletion of each of the geological deposits.
As at 31 December 2005, this provision in the financial statements stood at $24.5 million 2004: $21.9 million.
In addition, as required by the Groups site restoration obligations, bank deposits are set aside in restricted special purpose bank accounts.
These bank deposits amounted to $1.5 million as at 31 December 2005 2004: $0.6 million.
In order to further advance the standards of environmental safety and protection, the Company engaged the consultants SKM to produce an environmental action plan.
This plan recommended a number of initiatives, which the Group intends to implement in due course.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 51 Measures The Group actively monitors air emission levels, ambient air quality, quality of nearby surface water, level of contaminates in soil and the creation of solid waste.
Renewal of environmental permits is subject to the submission of an annual report on pollution levels to the State environmental authorities, compliance with the permits provisions and the settlement of any additional payment obligations.
The State environmental authorities also conduct tests to validate the Groups reported results.
In Kazakhstan, the Group is pursuing a number of important environmental initiatives including implementing a programme to reduce dust and sulphur dioxide emissions from the smelting and converting furnaces at the Balkhash complex.
A sulphuric acid plant at Balkhash to recover sulphur emissions at an estimated cost of $60 million will be completed in 2006.
The Group invested $26.7 million in 2004 and $59.8 million in 2005 to fund environmental improvements.
In Germany, MKM is in compliance in all material respects with German and European environmental legislation.
Since 1996, total clean-up costs paid in respect of pollution from the plant site due to acts prior to unification have amounted to 2.1 million euros of which 800,000 euros has been paid by MKM and the balance paid by the Treuhandanstalt, the agency that privatised the East German state-owned enterprises in the 1990s.
Employees Kazakhmys LLC employees have individual employment agreements which cover, among other matters, base remuneration.
Kazakhmys LLC also negotiates collective employment agreements, which primarily cover social benefits, with representatives of its union that represents substantially all of the employees.
In Germany, employees are represented by a works council and approximately 85% of employees are members of the IG Metall union.
During the last three years, the Group has not experienced any strike that significantly affected its business activities.
The Group contributes to a defined contribution pension scheme in Germany and the Groups pension scheme in Kazakhstan is utilised by its employees to contribute the required amounts under Kazakh law.
Supplier payment policy It is the Groups policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Group companies and their suppliers, provided that all relevant trading terms and conditions have been complied with.
The Company is the corporate head office of the Group with few suppliers.
Trade creditor days of the Company at 31 December 2005 were 14.1 days 2004: n a.
Political and charitable donations No donations were made to political organisations during the year including in Kazakhstan.
The Group made charitable donations of $4.0 million during the year 2004: $3.7 million.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 53 Policy on derivatives and financial instruments The Groups objectives and policies on financial risk management can be found in note 32 to the financial statements.
Information on the Groups exposures to foreign currency, credit, commodity, price, liquidity and interest rate risks can also be found in this note.
Directors and officers liability insurance The Company purchases and maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers as permitted by sections 309A, B and C and section 337A of the Companies Act 1985.
The Companies Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise Act 2004 came into force in April 2005 and inserted a new provision in the Companies Act 1985 allowing a company to indemnify its directors against any liability incurred by a director to any person other than the company or any associated company in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company.
The legislation also allows a company to advance to its directors funds to cover the costs incurred by a director in defending certain legal proceedings against him or her.
Since directors are increasingly being added as defendants in legal actions against companies, the Board believes that the risk of directors being placed at significant personal financial risk is increasing.
The Board also believes that the provision of appropriate indemnities and the funding of directors defence costs as permitted by new legislation are reasonable protections for the Directors and are important to ensure that the Company continues to be able to attract and retain the highest calibre individuals as Directors.
The Company will therefore seek shareholder approval at the AGM to amend its memorandum and articles of association to give it authority to indemnify Directors and allow for the payment of their defence costs.
However, under such new provisions a Director will not be indemnified for legal costs of an unsuccessful defence in criminal proceedings, penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or legal costs of an unsuccessful defence in proceedings that are brought by the Company itself.
In such cases, where indemnification has been made to the Director during the course of the Directors defence, the Company would seek reimbursement of such costs.
Auditors A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the requirements of section 385 of the Companies Act 1985 and Ernst & Young LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office.
The reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP has been recommended by the Audit Committee, which will also be responsible, subject to shareholder approval, for determining their fee on behalf of the Board.
Annual General Meeting The second annual general meeting of the Company will be held at 2.00 pm on 23 May 2006 at the London Marriott Hotel, County Hall, Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7BP, United Kingdom.
The Notice of Annual General Meeting convening the meeting accompanies this Annual Report and sets out details of the business to be considered.
