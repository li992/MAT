08 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Investing to improve efficiency The ongoing process of investing to improve our business continued throughout 2005.
The significant investments in the print division allowed us to close the old press at Halifax and the closure of the presses at Wakefield and Sheffield have been announced and will coincide with the start up of the new press at Dinnington.
An announcement has also been made to close the old press at Scarborough.
The investment in standard operating systems and optimisation of process flows has resulted in further consolidation of production and backroom operations which will deliver improved product and an enhanced level of service to our readers and advertisers.
Expanded and upgraded systems will allow all of the acquired businesses to be absorbed into the Johnston Accounting Centre over 2006 with little additional resource requirements.
We are also investing in bringing more graduates and potential managers of the future into the Group.
These individuals are working in functions across the breadth of the business and helping to identify areas for potential improvement as our business continues to develop and evolve.
