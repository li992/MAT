Oil and Gas Reserves The following tables show estimates of proven and probable reserves prepared by the companys engineers in accordance with the UK Statement of Recommended Practice SORP issued by the Oil Industry Accounting Committee July 2001.
For total reserves, natural gas is converted to barrels of oil equivalent using a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas per barrel.
These upgrades were due to performance from the Mallard and Gadwall fields proving better than expected and from technical work on Goosander and Grouse, supported by our ongoing GKA experience.
Minor downward reserves revisions have been attributed to the Trees hub, based upon the well performance in Sycamore and Larch.
The reserves additions through acquisition were dominated by the purchase of the CNS assets including Acorn, Beechnut, Appleton and Halley, as well as the acquisition of 100% of the undeveloped Ensign Field in the SNS.
In addition to the reserves outlined above, Venture retains an economic interest in approximately 3.16 MMboe of proven and probable reserves in Trinidad through its 40% equity stake in Ten Degrees North Energy Limited.
Ventures total resource base, including contingent and prospective reserves, amounts to 292MMboe.
