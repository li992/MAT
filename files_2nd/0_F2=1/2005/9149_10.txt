0138 24-26 Financial Review 7 4 05 11:05 am Page 25 Property Property income primarily rent charged to B&Q on UK properties owned by the Group grew at 28.2% to 41.4m 2004: 32.2m reflecting rental inflation and some additional properties.
Kingfisher owns a significant property portfolio, substantially all of which is now used for trading purposes and which, at the year end, had a value of 2.4bn.
Kingfisher has continued its normal practice of externally valuing, on an existing use basis, one-third of the property portfolio on a rolling basis, with internal valuations being performed for the other two-thirds.
In both cases, these revalued amounts have been incorporated into the accounts, giving rise to a revaluation surplus in the year of 175.8m.
Other operating costs Other operating costs, principally Group central costs, fell 21.9% to 36.1m 2004: 46.2m following last years reorganisation of the corporate offices in London and Lille.
Interest The net interest charge from continuing operations for the year was 25.3m, down 8.3m from the prior year.
The current year interest charge has benefited primarily from a lower average net debt during the year.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are detailed in note 4 to the accounts.
A charge of 17.7m has been incurred in respect of the outstanding unsecured working capital loan made in connection with the disposal of ProMarkt.
The loan was due to be repaid in January 2005, however, due to difficult trading conditions experienced by ProMarkt, they were unable to repay the loan in full by that date.
The term of the loan has been extended, however, given the uncertainty surrounding its recoverability, the remaining balance of the loan was fully provided against in the current year.
Taxation The effective overall tax rate on profit has decreased from 46.3% in the prior year to 30.0%.
The high rate in the prior year was due to exceptional items charged not qualifying for tax relief.
The effective tax rate on profit for continuing operations before exceptional items and acquisition goodwill, excluding prior year tax adjustments, is 31.6%, being consistent with the prior year.
Pensions Kingfisher continues to account for pension costs on the basis of the requirements of SSAP 24 and provides the disclosures regarding the FRS 17 valuation of Kingfishers UK defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme net assets and liabilities.
At the start of the year, the FRS 17 valuation for the Scheme showed a deficit, net of deferred tax, of 189m.
The Kesa Electricals section of the Scheme was transferred to a new Kesa Pension scheme during the year resulting in a reduction in the deficit, net of deferred tax, of 44m.
However, this reduction was more than offset by the impact of lower assumed corporate bond rates and changes in financial and demographic assumptions.
The revised deficit, net of deferred tax, was 209m at 29 January 2005.
The Company, in consultation with the Trustees, has decided to make additional contributions to the Scheme, over and above the normal annual contributions, totalling 250m over the next three years.
The additional funds will be invested by the Scheme in assets designed to match its expected liability profile.
The funding will reduce Kingfishers exposure to future funding risks while increasing pension scheme solvency.
The initial financial impact of these additional contributions will be to reduce Kingfishers pension deficit and replace it with debt.
Accounting changes There have been no new accounting standards adopted during the year ended 29 January 2005. International Financial Reporting Standards Kingfisher will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the financial year ending 28 January 2006 and, as a result, has restated under IFRS the financial information for the year ended 29 January 2005 which will form the comparatives for next years consolidated financial statements.
Kingfisher has elected to defer the application of the financial instrument standards IAS 32 and IAS 39 until the financial year ending 28 January 2006 and therefore there is no impact from these standards on the restated 2004 05 IFRS financial statements.
For the year ended 29 January 2005, the impact on profits from the adoption of IFRS would be to reduce retail profit by less than 1% and profit after tax by 3%, with an underlying reduction in profit after tax of 5% excluding a functional currency benefit under IAS 21.
Net assets would be reduced by 7% at 1 February 2004 and by 11% at 29 January 2005 after the reversal of the property revaluation uplift recorded under UK GAAP.
A separate announcement detailing the impacts of IFRS and providing restated financial information was made on 17 March 2005 andis available on www.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 25 0138 24-26 Financial Review 5 4 05 3:16 pm Page 26 Financial review continued Treasury risk management Kingfishers Treasury function is principally responsible for managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves Treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage these risks.
Liquidity risk Treasury manages Kingfishers exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives and by promoting a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities.
During the year, Kingfisher repaid medium-term notes totalling 59m.
At the year end, Kingfisher has three medium-term notes in issue totalling 739m, which mature between 2010 and 2014.
Further details of the maturity of Kingfishers borrowings are provided in note 24.
In November 2004, a committed bank facility for 180m was cancelled as it was no longer required.
At 29 January 2005, Kingfisher had a 540m committed bank facility, maturing in February 2007.
Since the year end, Kingfisher has refinanced this facility, replacing it with a new committed bank revolving credit facility totalling 500m, provided by a number of banks.
This facility provides committed funding on improved terms, and in addition has extended the maturity to August 2010.
The facility is available to be drawn to support general corporate purposes.
Credit risk The credit risk of third parties that Kingfisher deals with is managed by setting a credit limit using published credit ratings.
The exposure against this limit is determined by taking account of the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts.
Interest rate risk Kingfisher manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on underlying debt instruments, principally the medium-term notes.
At the year end, 30% of Kingfishers long-term borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 2004: 30%.
Currency risk Kingfishers principal currency exposures are to the euro and the US Dollar.
The euro exposure is primarily operational and arises through the ownership of the retail businesses in France, Italy and Spain.
Balance sheet euro translation exposure is substantially hedged by maintaining a proportion of Kingfishers debt in euro.
However, it is the Groups policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings primarily euro into Sterling.
In addition, Kingfisher has a significant transaction exposure arising on the purchase of products for re-sale denominated primarily in US Dollars.
Kingfisher companies are required to hedge committed product purchases and a proportion of forecast product purchases arising in the next 12 months.
Use and fair value of financial instruments In the normal course of business Kingfisher uses financial instruments including derivative financial instruments which are held off balance sheet.
The main types of financial instruments used are medium-term notes, loans and deposits, interest rate derivative contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, spot and forward currency contracts, and currency options.
The fair value is defined as the amount for which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an at arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Listed instruments are shown at their market price, and the fair value of other financial instruments is calculated by discounting their future cash flows at market rates.
Short-term financial instruments are assumed to have a fair value equal to their book value.
