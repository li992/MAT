Report of the Directors continued Minerva plc 34 Annual report and accounts 2005 Authority to allot shares Under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, the Directors are not allowed to allot shares unless they are authorised to do so by shareholders.
Resolution 12 set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting gives the Directors authority, until the date of the next Annual General Meeting, to allot authorised but unissued share capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of 13,409,886.
This amounts to 53,639,546 ordinary shares representing one-third of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of this report.
The Directors consider the authority necessary to preserve maximum flexibility for the future.
Section 89 of the Act gives all shareholders the right to participate on a pro rata basis in all issues of equity shares for cash, unless they agree that this right should be excluded.
The effect of resolution 14, which is proposed as a special resolution, is to give the Directors authority until the date of the next Annual General Meeting, firstly, to carry out a rights issue without having to comply with the detailed requirements of Section 89 and Section 90 of the Act and, secondly, to allot equity shares for cash otherwise than by an issue pro rata to existing shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,011,483, which represents 5 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of this report.
The Directors consider that it is appropriate for these authorities to be granted and recommend shareholders to vote in favour of these resolutions as they unanimously intend to do so in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.

No shares have been purchased pursuant to this authority, which expires at the conclusion of the 2005 Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 November 2005.
Under resolution 15, which is proposed as a special resolution, the Directors are seeking to renew such authority to make market purchases if they deem it appropriate from time to time of up to 24,121,704 ordinary shares of 25 pence each in the Company, which represents 14.99 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company at the date of this report, at no more than 105 per cent of the average of the closing mid market price for the ordinary shares of the Company for the five business days prior to the date of purchase, nor at less than 25 pence each.
The Directors will only exercise the power to make market purchases of ordinary shares if they believe that as a result there will be an increase in net assets per ordinary share for the remaining shareholders and that such purchases would be in the best interests of the shareholders generally.
