4 The Companys benchmark is the FTSE World Europe Ex-UK in sterling terms.
Comparison of the Companys performance is made with its benchmark.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not follow or track this index and, consequently, there may be some divergence between its performance and that of the Company.
5 The fair value of the 35m and 100m loans, which are stated after the effect of the interest rate swaps, have been calculated by estimating the cost of breaking the loans and interest rate swaps.
6 Actual gearing means investments expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
This calculation excludes the Companys holdings in liquidity funds which are held as an alternative to cash.
7 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments expressed as a percentage of average net assets over the year.
