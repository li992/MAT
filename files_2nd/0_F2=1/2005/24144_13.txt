INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our financial performance EEV underlying profit UK Life & Pensions EEV underlying profit increased by 11% to 328 million 2004: 295m, due to increased profits from the in-force book and new business 2005 11% 328m profits on the back of strong volume growth.
2004 295m The return on embedded value, based on underlying profit after tax, is 9.4% Return on embedded value 2004: 9.5% with improved experience being offset by a lower rate of return on 2005 9.4% shareholder net assets and higher development costs, as explained below.
2004 9.5% Contribution from new business The contribution from UK new business has increased by 10% to 64 million 2005 10% 64m 2004: 58m.
The contribution is stated net of the cost of solvency capital of 5 million 2004: 5m and share based payments of 2 million 2004: 2m.
Growth in new 2004 58m business volumes has been offset by the effect of a different business mix.
In particular, 48% growth in group pensions business volumes, which tend to be lower margin, coupled with an 8% decrease in higher margin protection business, caused by the flat housing market and increased competition, has resulted in the overall UK new business margin reducing from 2.2% to 2.0%.
Profit from existing business The profit from existing business increased by 39% to 209 million 2004: 150m.
2005 39% 209m The expected return on the value of the in-force book increased by 10% to 170 million 2004: 155m, reflecting the increase in the value of the in-force 2004 150m business over 2004.
The positive experience variances of 20 million 2004: 12m resulted from several items, the largest of which was improved morbidity experience on income protection business.
The positive net operating assumption change of 19 million 2004: 17m negative was mainly due to revising morbidity assumptions on income protection business and updating With Profits Fund realistic balance sheet non-economic assumptions such as the proportion of cash taken by deferred annuitants with guaranteed annuity options at the time of vesting, offset by further strengthening of annuitant mortality.
Development costs Development costs have increased from 16 million to 25 million reflecting additional investment in our e-commerce propositions and infrastructure to support our new 2005 56% 25m distribution relationships.
We expect this development spend to continue at this higher 2004 16m level for 2006 as we look to deliver future cost and service improvements.
Expected return on shareholders net assets The expected return on shareholders net assets decreased by 22% to 80 million 2005 -22% 80m 2004: 103m.
The decrease is due to the reduction in shareholders invested net assets during the course of 2004 as a consequence of funding new business, a 2004 103m decrease in the expected rate of return and the impact of now calculating our expected return on the long-term debt outside the life funds based on the actual coupon payable.
