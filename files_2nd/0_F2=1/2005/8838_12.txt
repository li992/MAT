Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2005 Accounting Policies iii The Group also has a Long Term Incentive Scheme 'LTIS' for directors and key senior executives.
Participants are awarded shares dependent on the achievement of certain performance targets.
The charge to the income statement for shares expected to be awarded under the LTIS is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings.
For those shares that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classified as equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been declared.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share ownership trusts 'ESOP trusts'.
They have therefore been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
Shares acquired by and disposed of by the ESOP trusts are recorded at cost.
The cost of shares held by the ESOP trusts is deducted from shareholders' equity.
Segmental reporting The Group's primary reporting segments are its three operating divisions, namely Engineering & Production Facilities, Well Support and Gas Turbine Services.
Engineering & Production Facilities provides a broad range of life-of-field engineering, modifications, maintenance and operations services to oil and gas customers worldwide.
Well Support supplies solutions, products and services to increase production rates and recovery from oil and gas reservoirs.
It is among the market leaders worldwide in artificial lift using electric submersible pumps, in the provision of surface wellheads and valves and, in the Gulf of Mexico and in South America, in the provision of electric wireline and slickline services.
Gas Turbine Services is a world leading independent provider of maintenance, repair and overhaul services for industrial gas turbines and related high speed rotating equipment used for compression, transmission and power generation in the oil and gas and power generation industries.
Disclosure of impact of future accounting standards Amendment to IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' The Group adopted this amendment early, which allows the recognition of defined actuarial gains and losses through the statement of recognised income and expense.
This treatment is similar to that previously adopted by the Group under FRS 17.
The Group has not yet adopted the following standards which are only effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006 or 2007.
FRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' This standard consolidates IAS 30 and the disclosure requirements of IAS 32 relating to financial instruments.
We do not anticipate that this standard will have any material impact on the Group's financial statements.
IFRIC 4 'Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease' IFRIC 4 contains guidance on determining whether arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease should nonetheless be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 'Leases'.
We do not anticipate that this will have any material impact on the Group's financial statements.
