13 Development programme The Groups development programme is based on opportunities created from or otherwise complementing the existing portfolio.
Development returns can involve substantial, unmanageable market risk and our approach often favours building to customer specifications, by agreeing pre-lets.
We commit to projects in controlled stages on the basis of pre-lets or anticipated demand, adding value and quality assets to the portfolio and minimising income deficits, finance and other carrying costs.
Projects of 104,300 sq m 1.1 million sq ft have completed on time and within budget.
