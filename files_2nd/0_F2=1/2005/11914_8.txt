Our investment in the FTs Asia edition has coincided with intense interest in the rise of India and China, and the implications for international business, politics and economics.
Weve followed a very clear strategy for the FT Group: to take a UK business newspaper and make it the worlds business newspaper: to take a once-a-day morning read and make it a relevant through-the-day business tool: to attract premium advertising by collecting a global audience of the people who run the world: and to construct a powerful, resilient financial information business in IDC that can prosper through the business cycle.
That strategy is working, as the FT benets from its unique position as a global source of news, comment and analysis.
