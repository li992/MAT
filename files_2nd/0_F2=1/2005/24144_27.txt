INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Our financial performance Underlying profit The financial results of our Asset Management business represent the first full 12 months of the enlarged company, F&C Asset Management plc, following the 2005 170% 108m merger of F&C Group Holdings Limited and ISIS Asset Management plc in 2004 40m October 2004.
F&C underlying earnings per share Underlying profits increased by 170% to 108 million 2004: 40m driven 2005 24% 15.9p primarily by the merger.
Underlying earnings per share increased by 24% to 15.9p 2004: 12.8p.
2004 12.8p Net revenues Net revenues excluding investment income attributable to policyholders generated by the enlarged business were 76% higher at 267 million 2004: 152m.
The increase 2005 76% 267m was due mainly to the strong rise in equity markets during the final quarter of the year, 2004 152m which was offset by the effect of net fund outflows for the year of 6.1 billion.
Whilst impacting 2005, the net outflows will have a more significant impact on 2006 Funds under management revenues.
Net revenues included performance-related management fees of 13 million 2005 5% 131bn 2004: 8m.
2004 125bn The loss of the Resolution Life contract through corporate activity was a major factor Before withdrawal of 20bn Resolution Life funds impacting our outflows.
Resolution outflows in 2005 were approximately 5 billion and a further 20 billion has been withdrawn in the first quarter 2006.
We have agreed a termination payment with Resolution in respect of this business of 27 million, which will be received in the first half of 2006.
Some of the other institutional business losses, such as emerging equities mandates, were at a higher revenue margin than our 2004 average 21 basis points.
When taken together with the disposal of our private equity business, we expect our recurring revenue margin for 2006 to be 20 basis points.
Whilst this short-term setback is disappointing, our focus remains on generating net new business in higher margin areas.
Operating expenses Operating expenses excluding the Re-Investment Plan costs, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and net operating costs on 2005 50% 151m investment and insurance contracts, represent the ongoing costs of running the 2004 101m business and were 151 million 2004: 101m.
They benefited from the integration process which has generated annualised cost savings of 33 million.
Based on our budget for 2006 the full synergies will be achieved ahead of target and as such we should see benefits slightly in excess of the forecast 33 million in the 2006 results.
Approximately 60% of costs are staff-related costs and headcount has reduced by about 100 during the year.
Since the year-end this has further reduced.
Operating margin The operating margin the ratio of operating profit to net revenues has increased from 34.0% to 44.1%.
Operating profit increased to 118 million 2004: 52m and is 2005 44.1% similar to underlying profit but excluding such items as finance revenue, finance costs 2004 34.0% and investment impairment.
Intangible assets The level of fund losses during 2005 and anticipated losses in respect of both institutional and investment trust clients and resultant impact on future revenue was significant enough to be considered a potential indicator of impairment in respect of the related intangible assets.
A full impairment review of these assets was therefore undertaken.
The value of investment management contracts at 31 December 2004 amounted to 590 million.
This review determined the recoverable amount of the intangible assets in respect of the institutional and investment trust fund management contracts was lower than their carrying value and has therefore resulted in a total impairment charge of 112 million.
These calculations have been based on different risk discount rates using F&Cs weighted average cost of capital of 8.9% allowing for the nature of the contracts and the estimated life.
The recoverable amount assumes an estimated loss rate of 14% and 5% per annum respectively.
We are required to conduct an annual impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill although there is no annual amortisation charge.
Our review demonstrated that there was no impairment and hence no requirement to write down Asset Management goodwill as at 31 December 2005.
