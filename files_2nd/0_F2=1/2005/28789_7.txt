The other investment managers charge fees based on a percentage of the funds under management in the range from 0.5% to 1.6% per annum and, in certain RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 18 Directors Report MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION CONTINUED cases, performance fees are charged where the increase in the value of the funds exceeds specified hurdles.

The performance of each of the investment managers is reviewed regularly by the executive Directors and the Board as a whole.
The terms of the contracts between the Company and those managers are also reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate.

Pence 000 per share Quoted investments 82,280 52.7 Hedge funds 10,265 6.6 Long equity funds 4,201 2.7 Unquoted investments and property 47,249 30.3 Private equity partnerships 8,903 5.7 Government securities and money market funds 4,212 2.7 Currency hedging gains and dealing losses 4,720 3.0 Other movements 13,684 8.9 Increase in net asset value 138,706 88.8 The other movements mainly comprise administrative expenses 6.7 million, interest expense 3.3 million, the cost of share buy-backs 3.7 million and movements on provisions 3.2 million.
DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives: cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: and derivative transactions into which the Group enters to manage market risks and currency risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises from uncertainty about the future value of the Groups investments.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions as the result of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when appropriate.
Short-term exposure to movements in exchange rates, caused by the buying and selling of investments for future settlement, is mitigated through entering into forward contracts.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 20 Directors Report DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements as a substantial proportion of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular foreign currencies.
These contracts are used principally for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are analysed in note 27 on pages 55 and 56.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations and take appropriate action.
PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS It is the Companys payment policy to obtain the best terms for all business.
The Company agrees the terms on which business will take place with its suppliers, and it is the Companys policy to abide by such terms.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year end.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND CHARITABLE DONATIONS During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Company made no charitable donations or political contributions.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS A review of the anticipated changes in IFRS and their effect on the Groups financial statements is under way.
The changes relevant to the Group have been identified and the consequential amendments to the Groups procedures required to maintain compliance with the new IFRS are being put in place.
The Groups interim accounts for the six months ending 30 September 2005 and published accounts thereafter shall be prepared in accordance with the new IFRS.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS A resolution to re-appoint  LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
