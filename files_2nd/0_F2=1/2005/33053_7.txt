Review of operations continued Hanson Aggregates UK Hanson Aggregates UK is one of the leading suppliers of aggregates, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt in the UK.
Our extensive network of quarries and distribution links provides national coverage and is complemented by our marine dredging operations.
These aggregates locations are complemented in turn by a network of ready-mixed concrete and asphalt plants which are strategically located to service key markets.
Excluding joint-ventures and associates, the division sold 33m metric tonnes of aggregate in 2005.
It has long-term mineral reserves with approximately 2.2bn metric tonnes of reserve and resources, owned, leased or under option, available for future extraction.
This includes a strong reserve position in sand and gravel, both land and marine based.

Group turnover increased to 811.5m in 2005 771.9m, an increase of 5.1%.
Group operating margin increased by 3.8ppts to 11.9% 8.1%.
Excluding property profits, the margin increased by 3.2ppts, from 7.8% to 11.0%.
Operating profit before impairments increased by 46.0% to 108.8m 74.5m.
Excluding property profits, this increase was 38.8%, consisting of a small decline in the joint-ventures and associates profit after tax offset by an improvement in the existing operations.
The earnings improvement, achieved despite reduced volumes, illustrates our commitment to pricing discipline, our initiative to increase premium product output and the delivery of operational efficiency and overhead cost reduction benefits.
Total market demand across the UK for aggregates is estimated to have declined by approximately 3% in 2005.
Much of the reduction is due to a slow down in major infrastructure activity, and lower crushed rock volumes as recycled materials compete at the low-value end of the sector.
As a result of planned site closures and our initiative to increase production yields and reduce low-margin, non-premium products, our total heritage aggregates volumes have declined 8.1%, with crushed rock the major contributor to the decline.
Average selling prices increased by 6.3%, offsetting input cost increases for fuel and electricity.
Royalty rates and the cost of regulation have also continued to increase.
Hanson Aggregates UK Managing Director Our asphalt volumes increased by 2.5% in 2005 which was broadly in line with Patrick OShea pictured at the new aggregates estimated national market growth trends.

Review of operations continued Hanson Aggregates UK Commercially, significant progress has been made during 2005 in securing long-term maintenance contracts.
These are used as a procurement route by both the UK Highways Agency and by UK local authorities.
Innovative partnering arrangements with service level guarantees have also been introduced with a number of customers.
Both these approaches help underpin the long-term nature of our order book and support our capital investment programmes.
Capital expenditure during 2005 was 23.1m 35.6m and included one new ready-mixed concrete plant, aggregate and asphalt plant upgrades and modifications and additional mineral reserves and resources.
We are continuing to upgrade our facilities to make them more efficient.
In particular, initiatives are being pursued to increase the proportion of high-quality aggregates as opposed to lower-value by-product.
Managing our reserves, particularly sand and gravel, is a high priority for the division.
During 2005 additional sand and gravel reserves and resources were secured in a number of locations, most notably in the south east, east of England and east midlands.
In early 2006 additional mineral reserve licences were secured for our marine dredging operations.
Restructuring cost savings of 10m were achieved as planned and have resulted in a flatter and more customer responsive organisation.

share of net profit after tax of 11.9m 12.3m was broadly in line with the prior year.
Bottom: Marine dredger, North Sea, off UK coast.
Outlook Demand is expected to remain subdued in 2006.
Input cost inflation, in particular for cement, bitumen and energy, is expected to continue.
In addition, the use of recycled fuel oil was prohibited from the beginning of 2006 which will increase the cost burden for our asphalt operations.
We are seeking to offset these increases through cost reduction and efficiency initiatives.
However, achievement of our notified selling price increases will be key to the successful delivery of earnings growth in 2006.
In the medium-term, we would expect demand to recover in response to the UKs infrastructure needs and preparations for the London Olympics.

In addition, it produces aggregate blocks, Thermalite blocks, a range of precast concrete structures, and packed products.
Bricks accounted for nearly half of the divisions group turnover in 2005, and blocks for around a quarter.
The precast concrete range includes a variety of flooring systems, stairs and landings, and culverts.
Packed products sells a range of materials for general building and landscaping.

Group turnover increased to 368.2m in 2005 300.7m, an increase of 22.4%.
76.7m, of this increase was due to acquisitions made in 2005.
Group operating margin declined by 1.9ppts to 10.3% 12.2%.
Operating profit before impairments increased by 2.7% to 37.8m 36.8m.
12.3m, or 33.4%, was due to acquisitions which offset a decline attributable to the existing operations of 11.3m, or 30.7%.
The majority of the 11.3m reduction in earnings from existing operations was due to lower brick volumes.
Whilst our total brick volumes increased by 8.5%, excluding acquisitions, the heritage brick volumes declined by 12.4%.
The reduction has been predominately within the repair, maintenance and improvement RMI sector of the housing market.
Despite the reduction, increases in selling prices of 6.8% were achieved for the year.
Aggregate block volumes, excluding Thermalite, declined 3.0% whilst average selling prices increased 2.2%.
Precast product volumes, including flooring, remained strong during 2005.
Packed product average selling prices increased in 2005 despite lower volumes in the RMI market.
Input costs, in particular energy, continued to increase although the earnings impact was partly mitigated by forward hedging of gas prices.
In late 2005 and early 2006, we made the difficult but necessary decision to reduce production capacity, in response to low market demand and high energy costs.
Production was substantially reduced at four brick factories and temporary David Szymanski, Managing Director of Hanson lay-offs were implemented during January 2006 at five brick factories and three Building Products UK centre, Jon Morrish, Thermalite factories.

first of several integrated phases in Hansons investment at the site.
Four acquisitions were completed during 2005, for a total of 194.1m, as part of the divisions strategy of supplying a broad product range to customers.
Marshalls Clay Products has been integrated and is performing broadly in line with expectation.
Thermalite, which has experienced difficult market conditions since its acquisition in March 2005, performed below expectation but within our acquisition criteria.
Mid Essex Sand and Gravel, a bagging operation which complements our packed products range, and Cradley Special Brick are progressing well.
The acquisition of Red Bank Manufacturing was completed in early January 2006.

Review of operations continued Hanson Building Products UK Improved customer service and product offering remain key priorities.
Multi-product deliveries are an example of the customer service improvements trialled following the extension of our product range.
Outlook Overall market demand is expected to remain subdued in 2006.
Input costs will be significantly higher in 2006 than 2005.
We are working to mitigate these factors by reducing capacity, improving productivity through capital expenditure and hedging costs such as gas, where economic.
Despite these measures, it is anticipated that significant price increases will be necessary in 2006 to recover our earnings.
In the medium-term, we expect demand to respond to the need for additional houses, particularly in the south east.
Our production capacity is sufficiently flexible to be able to respond to any such increase in volume.
We intend to continue to grow this division through product range extension and ongoing improvements to the service we offer to our increasingly consolidated customer base.
