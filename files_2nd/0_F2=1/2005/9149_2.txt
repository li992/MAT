Review of activities and future performance In June 2004, Kingfisher announced its plans to open its first Castorama stores in Russia and in November 2004 Kingfisher announced the acquisition of five leasehold stores with a view to expanding the B&Q business in China.
Kingfisher is an international home improvement business in markets that fit strategic criteria of attractive scale, structure and economics.
Operating through its main retail brands: B&Q, Castorama and Brico Dpt, Kingfisher operates in nine countries across Europe and Asia and is market leader in five countries, giving the Group an excellent platform for growth in all of its markets.
Results and dividends The profit on ordinary activities of the Group before taxation amounted to 670.9m 2004: 426.7m and a profit after taxation of 469.5m 2004: 229.3m.
Kingfisher paid an interim dividend of 3.85p 2004: 3.5p per ordinary share amounting to 89.9m 2004: 81.1m on 12 November 2004.
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 6.8p 2004: 6.15p per ordinary share amounting to 159.7m 2004: 143.4m to be paid on 3 June 2005, making a total for the year of 10.65p 2004: 9.65p per ordinary share amounting to 249.6m 2004: 224.5m.
