The group operates in over 130 countries.
A key part of its policy is to develop renewable energy sources.
We believe the company is set to benefit from higher oil prices and demand growth in developing regions of the world.
2 1 BP 29,660 7.2 43,830 BP Amoco is one of the world's largest petroleum and petrochemicals groups.
Its main activities are: exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas: refining, marketing, supply and transportation of petroleum products: and manufacturing and the marketing of petrochemicals.
Like Shell, it will benefit from higher demand from developing economies.
3 2 HSBC Holdings 24,252 5.9 31,980 The group is one of the largest banking and financial services organisations in the world.
The HSBC Group's international network comprises more than 5,000 offices in 80 countries and territories, operating in the Asia Pacific region, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa.
The diversity of HSBCs business and exposure to faster growing regions of the world should enable it to deliver growth ahead of most UK domestic banks.
4 4 Barclays 16,709 4.0 16,596 Barclays offers commercial and investment banking, insurance, financial and related services.
It operates branches in over 60 countries and in its main market in the UK it operates over 1,900 branches.
Indeed, we believe the companys good exposure to wholesale and business banking will help it off-set slower growth on the retail side of its business.
The shares also offer a very attractive 4.9% yield.
5 15 GlaxoSmithKline 16,370 4.0 7,440 GlaxoSmithKline is a research based pharmaceutical group that develops, manufactures and markets vaccines, prescription and over the counter medicines as well as health related consumer products.
The group specialises in treatments for respiratory, central nervous system, gastro-intestinal and genetic disorders.
The attraction of the shares lies in the companys large pipeline of new drugs, which should enable it to deliver strong profit growth over the next few years.

Currently the bank's main operations are based in the UK where it has 20 million customers and 2,287 branches.
However, it has a very successful US operation called Citizens which is seen as the growth engine of the future.
We believe the shares offer good long-term dividend and profit growth.
8 8 Diageo 12,345 3.0 11,153 Diageo produces a wide range of spirits and Guinness.
Its key spirits brands include Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan, Baileys and Tanqueray.
As the worlds largest spirits company, we feel Diageo is well placed to prosper from strong trends towards greater consumption of spirits at the expense of other types of alcoholic beverage.
9 13 British American Tobacco 12,329 3.0 8,502 British American Tobacco is the holding company for a group of companies that manufacture, market and sell cigarettes and other tobacco products, including cigars and roll-your-own tobacco.
The group sells over 300 brands in approximately 180 markets throughout the world.
Key brands include State Express 555, Lucky Strike, Kent and Benson & Hedges.
Although the tobacco business can no longer be described as a growth industry, we believe well managed companies, like BAT, have scope to improve profitability through cost cutting and industry consolidation.
Expansion in to developing markets will also help to off-set slower growth in more mature regions of the world.
10 9 Great Universal Stores GUS 12,184 2.9 10,136 GUS is a retail and business services group.
They provide information and customer relationship management services through Experian, general merchandise through Argos, and luxury goods through a majority shareholding in Burberry Group.
We are of the view that GUS is ultimately likely to be broken up in to its constituent parts, which will unlock value for shareholders.

The company shares operations with Unilever N. V. The two are linked by a series of agreements and operate as a single entity as much as possible.
Unilever operates on a worldwide scale, selling its products in over 100 countries.
We believe the company can be run far more efficiently than in the past and are encouraged by the appointment of a new chief executive.

20 P&O 6,995 1.7 The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company provides various port and logistics services.
The company offers containerised cargo handling services, temperature controlled products and develops property.
We believe the company will divest all of its non-core businesses and ultimately becomes a focused ports operator with a high proportion of its assets in Asia.
The process of breaking up the company will unlock value for shareholders.
