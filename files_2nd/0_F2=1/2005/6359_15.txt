48 Unaudited pro forma financial information For the year ended 31 December 2005 Basis of preparation The pro forma financial information is consistent with the results for Group 4 Securicor plc for the year ended 31 December 2005.
However, as explained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 56, the statutory results for Group 4 Securicor plc for the year ended 31 December 2004 shown as comparatives therein include the full year of trading of the security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A S and the trading of the businesses of Securicor plc for the period from 20 July 2004 to 31 December 2004.
Therefore, the directors consider that it is of assistance to shareholders to show pro forma financial information for the combined entities for the full year comparative period.
This information is shown below.
Similarly presented is pro forma operating cash flow information.

50 Statement of directors responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the group.
The Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement which comply with that law and those regulations.
