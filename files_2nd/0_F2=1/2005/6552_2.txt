Business Review Group Overview We have unparalleled experience in the housing industry Our Business UK Housing Our 26 regional businesses and three satellites in the UK give our operations significant scale and truly national geographic coverage.
Each business unit provides a range of products, from one bedroom apartments and starter homes to large detached family homes.
Our UK homes are sold under two distinct brands: the core George Wimpey brand and the Laing Homes brand which has previously been used solely in the South East and Midlands.
Going forward all our businesses will have the opportunity to use both brands.
This will allow better use of large sites and provide greater returns on future land purchases.
2005 was the most challenging housing market in the UK for a number of years.
However, a fundamental shortfall in housing supply still exists which will underpin the market going forward.
This provides George Wimpey UK with significant potential for future growth.
