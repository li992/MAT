In 3 addition, he accrues a one-off cash sum of 80 of his Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of Pensionable Service.
1 b John Davis is a member of both Sections 1 and 3 of the Yell Pension Plan and under each Section accrues an annual pension of 60 of his Final Pensionable Earnings up to the Inland Revenues 1 Earnings Cap for each year of Pensionable Service total accrual of 30 each year.
As he is subject to the Earnings Cap, Mr Davis receives part of this pension through an unfunded unapproved 1 1 pension promise.
This unfunded unapproved pension promise was reviewed during the financial year.
The amended promise increases his overall entitlement to 30 previously 45 of his Pension Scheme Salary for each complete year of Pensionable Service and in proportion for a part year.
For the avoidance of doubt, it should be noted that the revised entitlement applies to all period of Pensionable Service.
To determine the transfer value of the unapproved pension we have used the standard cash equivalent transfer basis adopted by the Yell Pension Plan.
