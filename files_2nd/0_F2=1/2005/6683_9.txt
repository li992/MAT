22 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 Directors responsibilities in relation to the financial statements Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them, consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Management and staff There are approved share option and share incentive schemes in existence intended to enable all staff to share in the prosperity of the group.
It is the groups policy to give full consideration to suitable applications for employment by disabled persons.
Disabled employees are eligible to participate in all career development opportunities available to staff.
Opportunities also exist for employees who become disabled to continue in their employment or to be trained for other positions in the group.
The group is committed to involving all employees in the performance and development of the group.
Employees are encouraged to discuss with management matters of interest to the employees and subjects affecting day-to-day operations of the group.
Discussions take place regularly with trades unions representing the employees on a wide range of issues.

Special business at the annual general meeting Resolution 8 set out in the notice of annual general meeting, which will be proposed as a special resolution, will empower the directors to allot shares in the company.
Specic shareholder authority pursuant to S80 of the Companies Act 1985 is required before the directors can allot shares.
This authority would replace a five-year authority granted in 2000.
In accordance with changes in corporate governance practice the directors have decided to renew this authority annually.
The extent of the authority sought is in line with good corporate governance practice.
Resolution 9 set out in the notice of annual general meeting, which will be proposed as a special resolution, will supplement the directors authority to allot shares in the company.
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 requires a company proposing to allot equity securities for cash to offer them first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
Equity securities includes ordinary shares the only class of share capital the company has at present but does not include shares issued under employee share schemes.
If this resolution is passed, the requirement imposed by section 89 will not apply to allotments by the directors in three cases: 1 in connection with a rights or similar issue, where strict application of the principle in section 89 could for example either result in fractional entitlements to shares arising or require the issue of shares where this would be impractical because of local legal or regulatory requirements in any given overseas jurisdiction: 2 allotments of shares for cash up to a total nominal value of 258,286 representing 5% of the companys issued share capital at 2 July 2005.
This gives the directors exibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, whilst the 5% limit ensures that existing shareholders interests are protected in accordance with guidelines issued by institutional investors bodies: and 3 in connection with the sale by the company of shares held by it in treasury.
Whilst shares are held in treasury they will not be entitled to vote or receive dividends declared by the company.
Section 89 pre-emption rights would normally apply to the subsequent sale of the shares held in treasury in the same way as they apply to an issue of new shares for cash.
This resolution disapplies section 89 pre-emption rights in the event of sales of treasury shares.
Any acquisition of shares to be held in treasury by the company and any subsequent disposals, will be subject to compliance with any applicable rules or guidelines issued by institutional investors bodies.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 23 Directors report continued The board also confirms its intention that including any sales of shares held in treasury equity securities equivalent to no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the company will be allotted for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period, again in line with institutional investor guidelines.
This authority will lapse on the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company or, if earlier, fifteen months after the passing of the resolution except in so far as commitments to allot shares have been entered into before that date.
Resolution 10 set out in the notice of annual general meeting, which will be proposed as a special resolution, gives the company authorisation to use its available cash resources to acquire its own shares in the market for either cancellation or to hold them as treasury shares.
The maximum aggregate number of shares authorised to be purchased is inclusive of shares already held as treasury shares.
This resolution renews a similar authority given at the last annual general meeting.
The directors use this authority only after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels, and the overall position of the company.
The directors only purchase such shares after taking into account the effects on earnings per share and the benets for shareholders.
This authority will lapse on the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company or, if earlier, fifteen months after the passing of the resolution.
Auditors Resolutions to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the groups auditors and to authorise the directors to x their remuneration will be put to the forthcoming annual general meeting.
