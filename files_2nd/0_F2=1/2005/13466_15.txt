Rio Tinto Aluminium Rio Tinto: 100 per cent Rio Tinto Aluminium RTA is a major supplier of bauxite, alumina and primary aluminium to world markets.
RTA has a large, wholly owned bauxite mine at Weipa on Cape 01 02 03 04 05 01 02 03 04 05 York Peninsula, Queensland.
A US$150 million mine expansion was completed on time to supply the bauxite requirements of the Comalco Alumina Refinery.
Approximately 90 per cent of the bauxite from Weipa Alumina Aluminium is shipped to alumina refineries at Gladstone, Queensland, and Sardinia, Rio Tinto share Rio Tinto share Italy.
000 tonnes 000 tonnes PRODUCTION PRODUCTION Construction of the first stage of the wholly owned Comalco Alumina Refinery at Gladstone in Queensland was completed in late 2004, ahead of schedule and close to the budget of US$750 million.
Rated capacity is expected to be reached by the end of 2006.
There is potential for capacity to be increased to over four million tonnes.
The majority of the refinerys Stage One output will go into RTA smelters.
The balance will be placed in the traded alumina market.
The refinery enables RTA to add further value to the Weipa bauxite deposit and strengthen both RTAs and Australias positions in the world alumina market.
RTA owns 38.6 per cent of Queensland Alumina Limited in Gladstone, the worlds largest alumina refinery in terms of production and also owns 56.2 per cent of the Eurallumina refinery in Sardinia, Italy.
RTAs primary aluminium is produced by smelters at Boyne Island at Gladstone 59.4 per cent, Bell Bay 100 per cent in Tasmania, Tiwai Point 79.4 per cent in New Zealand and Anglesey Aluminium 51 per 01 02 03 04 05 01 02 03 04 05 cent in Wales, UK.

Rio Tintos share of alumina production for 2005 was 33 per cent higher than 2004.
Comalco Alumina Refinery produced 835,000 tonnes as efforts continued to improve the reliability of the pumps feeding the digestion circuit.
QAL production increased by five per cent compared to 2004, a record production for the refinery.
Eurallumina production increased one per cent over 2004 levels.
RTAs share of aluminium production from its four smelters, at 854,000 tonnes, was 17,000 tonnes above 2004 production.
Attributable metal shipments for 2005 were 859,000 tonnes, an increase of 18,000 tonnes, and went to primarily Japan, Korea, Australia, South East Asia and Europe.
ALUMINIUM GROUP PROJECTS Weipa mine expansion Rio Tinto 100 per cent In 2005, RTA continued to invest in the Weipa bauxite mine to underpin the 2004 expansion to a simultaneous mining operation.
This investment included replacing the existing power station with a new US$40 million 26 megawatt power station.
The new power station will service the mining operation and surrounding communities.
The other major expenditure at Weipa was on a second US$60 million shiploader to ensure reliability of bauxite supply to customers.
