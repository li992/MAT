On behalf of the Board 6 March 2006 Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, Chairman of Remuneration Committee 232 HSBC HOLDIN G S PL C Statement of Directors Responsibilities in Respect of the Annual Report and Accounts 2005 and the Financial Statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditors statement of their responsibilities set out in their report on pages 234 and 235, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the Auditor in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts 2005, the consolidated financial statements of HSBC Holdings and its subsidiaries the Group and holding company financial statements for HSBC Holdings the parent company in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
The Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
The Directors are also required to present additional information for US shareholders.
Accordingly these financial statements are framed to meet both UK and US requirements to give a consistent view to all shareholders.
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group and the parent company and the performance of the Group for that period: the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The Directors are required to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is not appropriate.
Since the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that sufficient accounting records are kept that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors also have responsibility for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance statement on page 206 that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors have responsibility for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts 2005 as they appear on the companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
On behalf of the Board 6 March 2006 R G Barber, Secretary 233 HSBC HOLDIN G S PL C Independent Auditors Report to the Members of HSBC Holdings plc We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements the financial statements of HSBC Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and parent Cash Flow Statements, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes.

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors The Directors responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU are set out in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities on page 233.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the companys compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Accounts 2005 and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and companys circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited.
234 Opinion In our opinion: the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Groups affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the year then ended: the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent companys affairs as at 31 December 2005: and the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
