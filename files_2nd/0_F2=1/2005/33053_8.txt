TASMANIA Review of operations continued Hanson Australia & Asia Pacific Operating profit for Building Products declined due to increased input costs and a highly competitive pricing environment.
The operational improvement in the joint-ventures and associates was due largely to improved volume, price and delivery of synergy benefits in Cement Australia.
Three acquisitions were made in 2005 for 12.6m, including a basalt quarry at Molong in New South Wales, and the acquisition of two Sydney based precast concrete companies, Rescrete and Abbey Precast, both of which expanded our building products range.
Capital expenditure totalled 31.6m 26.4m and consisted of replacement ready-mixed concrete and aggregates delivery vehicles, new ready-mixed concrete plants in south east Queensland and aggregates plant upgrades to increase capacity and efficiency.
Hanson Asia Pacific The group operating profit before impairments in this region declined primarily due to lower market demand following a reduction in public sector expenditure in Malaysia.
Average selling price increases of between 3.6% and 7.3% were offset by a decline in aggregates and asphalt product volumes and higher input costs.
Ready-mixed concrete volume and prices were broadly in line with the prior year.
In Singapore, the operating performance marginally declined following a further downturn in construction sector volumes.

sector work, our Hong Kong concrete volumes have increased year-on-year whilst selling prices have also improved.
Synergy benefits have been delivered in line with our expectations.
Outlook The Australian market is forecast to decline during 2006 from its current peak, while difficult trading conditions are expected to continue in Asia throughout the year.
Further gains are anticipated from operational cost savings.
Increased selling prices will be required to recover the continuing rise in input costs.
