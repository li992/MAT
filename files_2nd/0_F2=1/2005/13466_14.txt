Market conditions remained tight production in the middle of 2009.
Production volumes currently being for chloride feedstocks, as chloride pigment plants continued to run at evaluated are in the range of 1.6 to 2.4 million tonnes per annum.
Demand for very high grade feedstock products, such as QITs upgraded titanium slag, remained strong.
Sulphate markets continued to remain soft.
Market conditions for RITs iron and steel co-products remained strong in the first half of 2005 but fell in May as scrap prices declined due to weakening global demand and higher Chinese pig iron exports.
Zircon prices continued to increase in 2005, as markets continued to get stronger, reflecting a very tight global supply and demand balance.
Zircon production was 16 per cent higher than in 2004.
Titanium dioxide feedstock production was ten per cent higher than in 2004, principally due to RBMs contribution which reflected the return to full production of a furnace.
Likewise, upgraded titanium slag production was 15 per cent higher than in 2004 due to the UGS expansion, INDUSTRIAL MINERALS GROUP PROJECTS QIT Madagascar Minerals Rio Tinto: 80 per cent RIT manages QIT Madagascar Minerals QMM, in which an agency of the Government of Madagascar has a 20 per cent interest.
QMM was formed to evaluate large mineral sand deposits in the south east of Madagascar.
In 2005 Rio Tinto announced the approval of a US$775 million titanium dioxide project.
The project comprises a US$585 million mineral sands operation and port in Madagascar and a US$190 million upgrade of Rio Tintos ilmenite facilities in Canada.
First production from the operation in the Fort Dauphin region is expected in late 2008 and the initial capacity will be 750,000 tonnes per year of ilmenite.
