Annual general meeting special business The annual general meeting of the company will be held at Lords Conference and Banqueting Centre, St Johns Wood Road, London NW8 8QN on Monday 24 April 2006 at 11.45 a. m. The following items are to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting as items of special business.
Resolution 8: Directors remuneration report In accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this resolution seeks shareholders approval of the directors remuneration report as set out on pages 36 to 44.
Resolution 9: Renewal of authority to allot shares Under the Companies Act 1985, the board is not able to allot shares except with the general or specific authority of shareholders.
Resolution 9 renews the boards authority to issue share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,364,633 being the companys authorised but unissued share capital.
This represents 11.25 per cent of the issued share capital of the company as at 7 March 2006.
The authority extends until the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting and the date fifteen months from the passing of this resolution.
The board does not have any present intention of exercising this authority other than for the purposes of the companys employee share option schemes.
The company does not hold any treasury shares as at 7 March 2006.
47 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Resolution 10: Limited authority to allot shares for cash The Companies Act 1985 provides that, when equity securities are being issued for cash, such securities must first be offered pro-rata to existing shareholders unless the board is given power to allot them without regard to that requirement.
Resolution 10 therefore empowers the board to allot for cash, equity securities of a nominal amount not exceeding 406,534 representing 3.35 per cent of the issued share capital as at 7 March 2006 without first offering such securities to existing shareholders.
The calculation of this amount takes into account the placing of five million shares on 17 December 2004 in connection with the Wickes acquisition and the relevant insitution shareholder voting guidelines in respect of non pre-emptive issues.
Any issue of shares for cash will, however, still be subject to the requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Resolution 11: Authority to purchase own shares Your directors believe that it is in the best interests of shareholders that the company should have the flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares up to 10 per cent of the issued share capital.
The effect of any such purchases and the cancellation of such shares would be to reduce the number of shares in issue and the directors would only make such purchases after consideration of the effect on earnings per share and the longer-term benefits for the company and shareholders generally.
The fact that such authority is being sought should not be taken to imply that shares would be purchased at any particular price or indeed at all.
At 7 March 2006, there were options outstanding over 4,083,198 shares, representing 3.36 per cent of the companys issued share capital.
This would rise to 3.74 per cent if the authority being sought to buy back shares were to be exercised in full, and all of the repurchased shares were to be cancelled.
Auditors A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the companys auditors and to authorise the directors to fix the auditors remuneration will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
