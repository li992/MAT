Review of operations continued Hanson Continental Europe This division operates across Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, The Netherlands and Israel.
The largest country of operation is Spain.

Group operating margin reduced by 1.8ppts to 8.7% 10.5%.
Operating profit before impairments reduced by 4.0m, or 16.7%, to 19.9m 23.9m.
The 4.0m reduction in operating profit before impairments was due to difficult market conditions in Israel and The Netherlands, which persisted throughout 2005, and to quarry closures, which impacted results in Spain.
Market conditions in the Czech Republic and Belgium were more positive.
Both these countries increased their operating profit before impairments, as did Germany, despite its difficult market conditions.
Total heritage aggregates and asphalt volumes declined by 8.9% and 1.9% respectively across the division, whilst concrete volumes increased by 0.4%.
In Spain, both group turnover and operating profit before impairments decreased in 2005.
Aggregate volumes were below last year due to lower demand in Madrid and Zaragoza and to the closure of two quarries, although increases in average selling prices were achieved.
During the year we disposed of 19 underperforming ready-mixed concrete plants.
Excluding these disposals, ready-mixed concrete volumes were ahead of last year, as were average selling prices.
Weak trading conditions have continued in 2005 for our Israel operations.
Productivity improvements were not sufficient to counter a decline in volume and the impact of higher energy costs.
In the Benelux region, the ready-mixed concrete markets were difficult, resulting in lower prices and volumes.
Efficiency improvements were achieved in our aggregate operations which helped to offset a reduced operating profit before impairments.
Outlook The Spanish economy is anticipated to remain strong during 2006, although further reserve exhaustion is expected to lead to a lower operating profit before impairments.
Elsewhere, the market in Israel is likely to remain difficult, ready-mixed concrete margins in The Netherlands may improve slightly and volumes in the Czech Republic may decline slightly as a major road building contract concludes.
Replenishment of our reserves position, either through acquisition or mineral reserve purchases, remains a high priority for 2006.
We will continue to focus on both From right to left: General Manager Ian Peters acquisitions and margin improving capital expenditure activities.
