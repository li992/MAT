The committees objective is to provide senior management, including directors, with a competitive package which will attract and retain executives of the highest calibre and encourage and reward superior performance.
Further, the committee is cognisant that the market demands that criteria be established which measure an individuals performance.

The committee believes that the bonus payments, which are linked to the performance of the companys share price, together with participation in the companys share option scheme and share grants for the CEO are sufficient to motivate executives and align their interests with those of shareholders.
As a result of an investigation into the correct method of incentivising the CEO and to motivate his performance and to align him with the interests of shareholders it was decided that the CEO should no longer participate in the share option scheme but rather receive an award of shares which would only be granted upon the achievement of agreed performance criteria.
