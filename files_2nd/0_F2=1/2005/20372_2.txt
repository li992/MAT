COMPANY SUMMARY PERFORMANCE SINCE INCEPTION ON 10 DECEMBER 1990 Absolute Performance Log Scale gures are total returns and have been rebased to 100 at 10 December 1990 INVESTMENT UNIVERSE AND BENCHMARK INDEX ASCOTs portfolio normally consists of between 80 and 120 individual investments drawn from the ordinary shares and convertible securities of companies within its investment universe being companies which would form the constituents of the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Excluding Investment Companies HGSC XIC.
Investments will not be made in unquoted securities, AIM listed securities, or securities issued by investment trusts or investment companies.
The Companys performance is measured against the total return on the HGSC XIC.
This comprises the bottom 10% of all UK quoted companies by market value which at 1 January 2006 included some 583 companies, the largest market capitalisation of which was 926 million and the aggregate market capitalisation of which was 136 billion.
RISK The Board believes that the Company has a relatively low risk prole in the context of the investment trust industry.
This belief arises from the fact that the Company has a relatively simple capital structure: invests only in small UK quoted companies: has never been exposed to derivatives and does not presently intend any such exposure: and outsources all the main operational activities to recognised, well-established rms.
Investment in small companies is generally perceived to carry more risk than investment in large companies.
While this is reasonable when comparing individual companies, it is much less so when comparing the volatility of returns from diversied portfolios of small and large companies.
The Board believes the Companys portfolio is diversied.
In addition, since returns from small and large companies are not perfectly correlated, there is an opportunity for investors to reduce risk by holding portfolios of both small and large companies together.

Both of these contracts can be terminated by either party at any time by giving six months notice of termination.
