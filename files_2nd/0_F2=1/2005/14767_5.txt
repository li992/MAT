S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 R EVIEW OF O PERATIONS continued M ULTIMEDIA Our businesses at Blackburn and Uden both improved their performance by changing their work mix, increasing their volume of traditional products and widening their product range to counter-balance the seasonality of their principal markets.
It was decided during the year that it would be beneficial to transfer the point-of-sale business within our Crayford operation to SP Group.
This has enabled the consolidation of the Groups UK point-of-sale operations.
In addition, production of booklets and inlay products at Crayford transferred to our Blackburn plant which, for the foreseeable future, will focus predominantly on these types of paper-based products.
These transfers of activities were completed during the second half of the year.
The remaining Multimedia business in Crayford is now better able to accommodate expected growth in the demand for DVD carton board and special packaging products which are favoured by publishers and distributors of computer games, cinema lms and television programmes.
We have seen a similar growth in demand for this type of packaging in Uden and the significant investments we made last year in both the UK and Holland to produce these types of product has proven to be timely.
Volumes of Multimedia products are forecast to continue to grow overall, despite the expected reduction in demand for standard CD products arising from the growth in the downloading of music from the internet.
