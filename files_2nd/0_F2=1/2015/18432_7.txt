Underlying growth was driven by a strong performance in the industrial, furniture and health & personal care categories, supported by tobacco and food & drink.
Metal hardware delivered a strong result in both existing and export industrial markets, with range extensions and early success in custom injection moulding also contributing.
Enhanced project conversion, new business wins and cross-selling opportunities for extruded plastics boosted the result in the furniture segment, while innovative labels and tapes contributed to the increase in FMCG sectors.
In health & personal care, there was good growth in speciality wipes, advanced wound care and noise protection porous components, as well as in the core packaging portfolio which was supported by new product launches including authentication solutions which are well placed to meet evolving regulatory requirements.
The performance of the Clondalkin SPD business was in line with expectations, with efforts already under way to address less profitable activities.
Substantial progress was made in rationalising the site footprint, with seven sites already or in the process of being closed.
Over and above this acquisition integration activity, an additional four facilities were shut during the year and transitioned to existing Essentra operations in the region.

COM Americas % growth % growth m Actual exchange Constant exchange Revenue 371.6 42.9 35.5 Revenue ex-PPT 355.5 65.2 56.5 Revenue increased 42.9% 35.5% at constant exchange to 371.6m: like-for-like revenue was down -9.2% 2.6% growth excluding PPT.
The result in the Americas was driven by the afore mentioned developments in the oil & gas sector, and the consequent impact on the PPT business.
However, consistent with its positive longer-term view of the industry, the Company continued to invest in opportunities for future growth, including new technologies, robotics and process automation to help ensure even greater consistency in product quality while reducing cost and improving labour savings, as well as a new purpose-built distribution centre in Alberta.
Notwithstanding the rapid consolidation of the Abric Seals range into the Components offering, trading was also more challenging in the broader industrial segment, although an underlying improvement in execution in the second half helped to mitigate a weakening market environment.
Underlying growth in health & personal care was driven by portfolio and distribution channel expansion in speciality wipes and success in advanced wound care, while an increase in the household segment was boosted by the further successful commercialisation of recent business wins in both aircare and writing instruments for products using porous plastics.
New packaging projects supported the performance in the food & drink category, with development activity and the roll-out of the Companys e-cigarette offering continuing in tobacco.
The integration of Clondalkin SPD proceeded rapidly during the year, with some encouraging new business wins and the closure of two manufacturing facilities.
Asia % growth % growth m Actual exchange Constant exchange Revenue 178.8 7.0 4.2 Revenue increased 7.0% 4.2% at constant exchange to 178.8m, with like-for-like growth of 2.8%.
Growth in Asia came across the majority of categories, with particularly good progress in the industrial category in India.
The result in tobacco was supported by flavoured and non-standard diameter filters, combined with joint development activity with key multi-national customers and strong growth in Dubai: this was partially offset by the impact of temporary inventory destocking in China and material tax increases in India.
The healthcare segment was boosted by growth in medical devices, while household benefited from the transfer of writing instrument nib activity from South Korea to a new facility in Indonesia the full benefits of which will be realised in 2016 although weakness in printer systems reflected an accelerating decline in market conditions.
Total revenue was boosted by the rapid integration of the Specialty Plastics and Abric Seals businesses, both of which have performed well and benefited from some encouraging new business wins.
