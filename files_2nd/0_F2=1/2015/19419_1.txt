TWO DECADES OF DELIVERY BEHIND US.
AHEAD, NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR GRASP.
Since 1995, we have been building a business unlike any other in our industry.
A business focused on gold and on Africa, designed to create value for all its stakeholders, in bad times as well as good.
Our core strategy of discovering world-class orebodies and developing them into profitable mines produced Morila, Loulo, Gounkoto and Tongon.
Our eye for an opportunity found Moto Goldmines, which we transformed into Kibali.
Our business model, long based on a prudent $1 000 oz gold price, shields these operations from the vicissitudes of the commodity price cycle.
And still we look for more.
Our exploration teams are breaking new ground across Africa, finding fresh prospects and feeding them into our project pipeline as they search for multi-million ounce deposits.
Innovative transactions are yielding potentially profitable partnerships.
We also continuously scrutinise the market for further favourable possibilities.
As we enter our third decade, we can confidently forecast a profile of profitable production and decreasing costs into the foreseeable future, based on our existing businesses.
Above and beyond that, however, is the promise inherent in our proven expertise, our record of exploration success, and an achievement ability secured by a solid balance sheet.
