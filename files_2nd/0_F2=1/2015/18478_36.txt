On joining Experian, Lloyd Pitchford forfeited a number of long-term incentive awards from his previous employer.
As set out in last years Annual report on remuneration, and detailed as part of our normal consultation exercise to major shareholders in May 2014, the Committees approach to compensating Lloyd Pitchford for his forfeited incentives was in line with its belief in not over-paying on recruitment and that any replacement share incentives buyout awards would take into account the likely vesting and resulting value of the share incentives that were being given up.
Whilst the Committee aimed to replicate as closely as possible the structure and vesting dates of the share awards that Lloyd Pitchford forfeited, it was also mindful of shareholders views that vesting periods should be a minimum of 12 months and that performance conditions should be applied to awards.
Lloyd Pitchfords historic share awards were as follows: awards vesting in March 2015, March 2016 and March 2017, with no performance conditions: and awards vesting in March 2015, March 2016 and March 2017, subject to satisfying performance conditions based on earnings per share and TSR.
The buyout awards granted to Lloyd Pitchford have therefore been structured as follows: The awards with no performance conditions were replaced with awards of Experian shares with a similar face value and, with the exception of the award that had been due to vest in 2015, these will vest on the normal vesting dates in March 2016 and March 2017.
The buyout award, for the original award vesting in March 2015, was structured to vest 12 months from the date Lloyd Pitchford joined Experian.
Vesting of the buyout awards will be subject to satisfactory financial and business performance over the vesting period and the achievement of his personal objectives.
The awards with performance conditions were replaced with an award under the PSP, which is subject to the same performance conditions as other PSP awards made in 2014 and will vest at the end of the three-year performance period.
In establishing the quantum of the replacement awards, an independent consultant was used to estimate the fair value of the outstanding awards so this value could be replicated after taking into account the fair value of the Experian awards.

PSP awards will also only vest where, in the Committees judgment, the ROCE performance over the period has been satisfactory.
The Committee may also vary the level of vesting, if it considers that the level of vesting determined by measuring performance is inconsistent with the Groups underlying financial and operational performance.
The Committee selected Benchmark PBT, operating cash flow and ROCE as performance metrics as they reflect three of our key performance indicators.
The use of these metrics provides a direct link to Experians strategic aims.
The use of TSR recognises the importance of returning value to shareholders.
