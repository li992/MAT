Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 06 Business overview continued Our goal Our business goal is to create a sustainable business capable of delivering value directly and indirectly to all our stakeholders: shareholders, employees, clients, suppliers and the communities in which we work.
Our strategy We will continuously develop and grow our capabilities, working with new and existing clients, we aim to transfer the skills and techniques we have developed in our current target industries to new ones.
We will continue our dual strategy of organic and acquisitive growth generating profitable organic growth from major contracts and divisional business growth, and continuing to invest in value-generating acquisitions which fuel further organic growth.
Across both we will increase our focus on proprietary technology-led and platformbased solutions, and intelligence and insight-led, valuefocused, flexible operating models.
We will remain UK-focused and gradually extend our geographic footprint across growth sectors and markets, moving into new territories with existing services and support existing clients into new territories.
Our constant focus on developing and transferring our skills will allow us to move into new markets and territories without risking our wider business for example in 2015 we successfully moved into the mortgage servicing and scientific research markets as well as territories such as Germany and Switzerland.
We will continue to grow and maintain a leading-edge workforce and infrastructure, developing new entry platforms in new market segments and sectors by investing in new and existing talent as well as acquiring specialist businesses that meet our return-on-investment criteria.
