The way we work here is truly innovative.
Weve introduced a system where patients can choose their meal on a smart device.
Weve also recently given the retail restaurants a complete refresh, with a complete new menu serving delicious fresh food.
This is the first time the Trust has outsourced their facilities management so its important we work closely together to make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible.
We have the Trusts full support and together, we are focused on our goal of creating a safe and pleasant environment for patients, visitors and employees alike.

This was rapidly followed by a contract for everyday and race day cleaning as well as on-site waste management services which we resecured in 2014.
When we acquired Creativevents, our events catering company, later in 2012, they brought with them a relationship with Ascot that had started in 1997 with a pop-up champagne bar at Royal Ascot.
Royal Ascot is of course the main event at the racecourse, and this year we catered in the Silver Ring, serving up the best quality local ingredients to 69,400 race goers over five days.
The event was a huge success, with a 31% increase in food sales and fantastic feedback from customers.

In October 2014, we acquired the pre-employment screening and vetting company Procius, as a leading supplier of employee screening and vetting services.
Our strength is in pre-employment screening, competency management and criminal records checking services, where our meticulous approach has helped us become one of the UK market leaders.

Heathrow IRC is the largest of its kind in Europe, accommodating over 1,000 detainees.
Taking on the contract, in addition to managing the centre at Campsfield House, makes Mitie the largest single private sector provider of immigration detention services to the UK Home Office.
The successful mobilisation of Heathrow IRC saw us consolidate two sites to work under a single operating model, introducing significant efficiencies to the centre.
At Campsfield IRC, weve invested over 1.4m in the contract to improve the quality and facilities at the centre.
Our Care & Custody team looks after all aspects of the everyday wellbeing of the detainees, which is why strong, open staff-detainee relationships are so important.

Working alongside the Heathrow team, Mitie embraces a one team spirit, ensuring the smooth delivery of facilities management services across the airport.
Our focus is on adding value whether thats through technology, sustainability initiatives or service quality.

Mitie was originally awarded the integrated facilities management contract with the university in October 2010 to provide a full range of services, and over the past five years, weve developed a firm understanding of the universitys objectives.
To ensure we work together with the university to deliver on its strategic aims and future FM requirements, we set up a Strategic Board, made up of members from Mitie and Durham.
Weve introduced the LEAN Six Sigma concept and implemented better cleaning processes such as the flat mop system and the use of top of the range equipment to support our efficiency goals.
Were also rolling out the British Institute of Cleaning Science training to our teams and have carried out soft services workshops too.
As a result of our efforts, we were awarded the supplier recognition award by the universitys procurement team in 2013 and 2014, recognising our commitment to good customer service, innovation and corporate social responsibility.
