100 Report on directors remuneration continued Implementation of policy in 2016 Our revised remuneration policy is set out in the Policy report on pages 81 to 87.
Below we detail how this policy will apply in 2016, subject to shareholder approval at our 2016 AGM.
Base salary and fees Effective from 1 January 2016, the base salary of executive directors will be 538,000 for James Drummond and 359,000 for Kevin Quinn increased by approximately 2.5%.
These increases are broadly consistent with the average salary increases across the broader employee population.
Non-executive directors base fees were increased by 4.8%.
These increases reect the signicantly increased workloads in recent years and are also designed to bring them into line with levels paid at similar-sized companies.
Further details of the fees effective from 1 January 2016 are detailed below: Changes to policy effective 1 January 2016 Senior Independent Non-executive Chairman fee Base fee Chairman of committee Director 190,000 54,500 11,250 6,300 Annual bonus: target setting for 2016 In accordance with our revised remuneration policy, the maximum annual bonus potential for executive directors is 130% of base salary.
The personal target multiplier has been removed and 100% of the performance targets will be based on financial metrics.
However, the bonus outcome may be reduced if, at the committees discretion, progress toward the groups non-financial strategic priorities has not been satisfactory.
In addition, bonus outcomes will only be determined provided that the earnings per share threshold has first been achieved.
The annual bonus targets for 2016 will be set in accordance with our remuneration policy and will remain aligned to our current strategic goals, namely: Strategic goals Link to strategic objectives Captures long-term growth and improving financial returns Adjusted earnings per share KPI 50% by leveraging operational efficiency The generation of free cash ow 25% Encourages operational cash discipline and improving capital efficiency KPI R evenue KPI 25% Delivers sustainable organic growth Summary of our main KPIs Strategic objectives Page 32 Page 05 The committee will set calibrated targets for each of these three measures and intends to disclose these targets retrospectively in next years directors remuneration report.
The actual targets are therefore not being disclosed now as this is considered by the committee to be commercially sensitive information because the majority of our competitors are in the private, unquoted sector and so are not required to publicly disclose the same level of information as Berendsen.
LTIP: target setting for 2016 In accordance with our proposed new remuneration policy and subject to shareholder approval of the new PSP at the 2016 AGM, long-term incentives will only comprise a PSP award with a maximum award limit of 200% of base salary.
For awards granted under the PSP during 2016, the committee has approved the following targets: EPS KPI performance targets to be satisfied in 2018 Awards vesting Less than 72 pence 0% of award vests 72 pence 25% of award vests 85 pence 100% of award vests Between 72 pence and 85 pence Straight-line basis Weighted average ROIC KPI to be satisfied for the 12-month period to 31 December 2018 Less than 10% 0% of award vests 10% 25% of award vests 11% 100% of award vests Between 10% and 11% Straight-line basis These targets are based on actual 2015 performance performance for the financial year ending immediately prior to the date of grant being 60.4 pence for adjusted EPS and 10.3% for ROIC.
The EPS targets above 72 pence to 85 pence maximise with a growth of approximately 41% over the three-year period and equates to annual growth of approximately 6% to 14%.
Aligning long-term awards with strategic objectives Both EPS and ROIC measures are main group KPIs and link to two of our strategic objectives, improving financial returns by leveraging operational efficiency and improving capital efficiency, respectively.
