On 1 January 2015 the transitional arrangements for excluding available-for-sale asdescribed below and a decrease in RWA from asset gains from regulatory capital ended.

The key capital management committee is the Group Asset and Liability Committee GALCO.
In 2015, members of the GALCO included the Group Executive Directors and the Group Chief Risk Officer, with senior attendees from Group Treasury, Finance, Risk and the businesses.
The GALCO regularly reviews the capital plan and approves capital management policies and guidelines.
Following a review in 2015, a change to the key capital management committees is being implemented in 2016.
The GALCO membership will be expanded to include the Group Treasurer and the Deputy Group Chief Financial Officer, as well as other senior members from the Management Team and the businesses.
The remit of the GALCO will not change significantly, however certain policies currently approved by the GALCO willfall under the remit of the Group Chief Financial Officer with input from the Group Treasurer.
The responsibilities previously delegated from GALCO to the Capital Management Committee will be moved to the newly created Operational Balance Sheet Committee OBSC, which will focus on ensuring that in executing the business strategy, the Group operates within internally approved and externally required capital, loss absorbing capacity, liquidity and leverage risk tolerances.
