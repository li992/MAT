SMP The SMP was a standalone investment plan linked to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan.
It operated for the final time in 2013 in relation to the annual incentive relating to 2012 performance.
Executive directors were required to invest at least one-third and maximum 50% of their net annual incentive into the SMP and were granted a conditional award of matching shares against the gross value of the annual incentive invested.
The matching shares attracted dividends during the three-year deferral period, released on vesting of any matching shares.

Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests Minimum Shareholding Requirement MSR Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a setpercentage of base salary.
An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net value i. e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax of shares acquired under these schemes.
Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition.
Shares owned beneficially by the director and his her spouse count towards the MSR.
The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director.
Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: Initial Value Subsequent Value Ian King 150% 300% Peter Lynas 100% 200% Jerry DeMuro 175% 350% Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their Subsequent Value MSR at 31 December 2015.
Jerry DeMuro joined the Board in 2014 and has started to establish a personal holding of shares in the Company which, at 31 December 2015, stood at just under 20%.
The higher MSR values applicable to Jerry DeMuro recognise the higher LTI opportunity and broader US market practice.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.
