The Board recognises that responsible behaviour is key to building sustainable growth and reputational value.

In recent years we have achieved considerable reductions in energy usage by replacing all the lighting in the public areas of our managed and franchised pubs with LED lighting.
Water usage has been signicantly reduced by installing water management systems in our managed pubs, and we are now rolling the same systems out across our franchised estate.
We continue to aim to increase the percentage of waste being recycled 2015: 81.0%, 2014: 80.2%.
Currently 336 of our managed pubs recycle food waste 2014: 319.
This year electricity and gas consumption emissions have again increased due to greater food sales, additional new-build pubrestaurants, and the conversion of more tenanted pubs to franchised.
Marstons estate maintenance team continues to work to reduce energy and emissions in the pub estate.
Projects have included installing LED lighting in all front of house areas, ambient air to cool our cellars rather than air conditioning, voltage optimisation, heating control systems and heat recovery systems.
