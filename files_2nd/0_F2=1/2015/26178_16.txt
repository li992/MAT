This facility replaced the previous 150 million facility.
Attached to the facility is an additional 100 million accordion capability, on which no fees are payable until utilised.
The facility is used primarily to fund acquisitions and repaid through raising equity in the market or using distributions from the Portfolio.

The 17.0 million drawing was repaid in early January 2016.
The Group subsequently drew 89.5 million to finance the acquisition of the Barcelona Metro Stations and British Transport Police PPP projects.
The Company has sufficient cash balances to meet other current obligations as they fall due while all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
Report of the Directors continued GOING CONCERN CONTINUED In March 2016, the Company raised gross proceeds of 92.9 million through the placing of additional new ordinary shares.
The proceeds will be used to repay the outstanding debt of 89.5 million.
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and projections which cover a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report, taking into account reasonably-possible changes in investment and trading performance, which show that the Company has sufficient financial resources.

Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Both assets were acquired from John Laing Group.
Completion of the Oldham Social Housing project is subject to certain conditions and is expected in the coming weeks.
The combined consideration for both assets is approximately 22 million.
In late February 2016, JLIF announced a proposal to issue up to 81.2 million new ordinary shares.
