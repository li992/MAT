On 19 June 2014, the Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with Invesco Asset Management Limited Invesco, which came into force at the Companys initial public offering IPO on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement was to ensure that the Company was capable at all times of carrying on its business independently of Invesco.
If any person acquired control of the Company or the Company ceased to be admitted to the Official List, the Relationship Agreement could be terminated by Invesco.
If Invesco together with its associates ceased to hold 30% or more of the voting rights over the Companys shares, the Relationship Agreement would terminate save for certain specified provisions.
On 9 October 2015, Invesco reported pursuant to DTR 5 that it had decreased its holdings to 63,502,442 shares, or 29.45%.
On the basis that Invesco no longer exercises or controls, on its own or together with any person with which they are acting in concert, 30% or more of the voting rights over the Companys shares, Invesco is no longer a controlling shareholder under the Listing Rules, and the Relationship Agreement terminated on such date in accordance with its terms and conditions.
The Relationship Agreement provided that Invesco would undertake to use all reasonable endeavors to procure that its associates and any person with whom it was acting in concert shall: conduct all agreements, arrangements, transactions and relationships with any member of the Group on an arms length basis and on a normal commercial basis and in accordance with the related party transaction requirements of Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules: Page 51 of 165 020 c112021 5.5. indd 51 21 04 2016 13:26 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Directors Report continued not take any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules or preclude or inhibit any member of the Group from carrying on its business independently of Invesco, its associates and any person with whom it was acting in concert: not propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which was intended to, or appeared to be intended to, circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules: and not exercise any of its voting rights attaching to the shares held by it to procure any amendment to the Articles of Association of the Company which would be inconsistent with, undermine or breach any of the provisions of the Relationship Agreement.
The Board believes that the terms of the Relationship Agreement enabled the Company to carry on its business independently, prior to its termination, from Invesco and its associates, and ensured that all transactions and relationships between the Company and Invesco were at arms length and on a normal commercial basis.
The Company has and, in so far as it is aware, the Invesco and its associates have, complied with the independence provisions set out in the Relationship Agreement from the date of the agreement, during the relevant period under review, until its termination on 9 October 2015.
The ordinary shares owned by Invesco rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares in all respects.

Accordingly, the Directors conducted this assessment over the two years to December 2017, taking into account the Groups current position, investment strategy, and the principal risks detailed in the Strategic Report.
The Directors believe that a two-year assessment is most appropriate as it aligns with the Groups normal and well-established budgeting process.
In making their assessment, the Directors considered a wide range of information, including present and future economic conditions, future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital requirements and availability of sources of funding.
The Groups annual budgeting process builds into a robust two-year plan, which is the period the Directors consider as an appropriate period to be covered by the viability statement.
This plan forms the basis for strategic decisions across the Group.
The consolidated plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Directors at the beginning of the year.
The plan is then deployed down to the subsidiary businesses and used to set performance metrics and objectives MBOs.
Progress against the original plan is reviewed quarterly by the Directors, and adjustments to the plan can be made if needed to address new risks or take advantage of new opportunities.
In summary, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over the two year period to December 2017.
They were comforted by the Groups strong financial position, its long-term investment objectives, the stability of the business model, the Groups control over its investments and how working capital requirements are met.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the two year period to December 2017.

This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Notice of AGM circulated with this Report and Accounts contains a full explanation of the business to be conducted at that meeting.
