American pp01-20 23 03 2016 23:00 Page 3 Strategic Report CHAIRMANS STATEMENT As shareholders will be aware, this report covers a particular 12 month period in the life of JPMorgan American Investment Trust.
We publish estimated Net Asset Values daily and our share price is quoted minute by minute.
The Trust has been in existence since 1881.
I therefore see the Chairmans Statement as an opportunity both to bring shareholders up to date with the Boards thinking, and to put the year covered by the annual report and financial statements into a longer term context.
Over the longer term, your Company has performed well and has provided strong returns.
Since the end of the reporting period, markets have seen some turbulence.
In 2015, the US equity market, as measured by the S&P 500 total return Index in sterling terms, provided a return of 6.9%.
In local currency terms, the market was more or less flat, and the gain to investors arose largely from the strength of the US dollar compared with sterling.
Over the period, your Companys net asset value NAV underperformed the S&P 500 by just over 2%.
The 10 year record over which period Garrett Fish has been responsible for fund management remains ahead of the Index and the performance of the NAV of the trust, over the 10 years to 31st December 2015, ranks it in the top 2% of the 270 US large capitalisation blend funds in the relevant Morningstar universe.
Garrett produced a very strong relative performance in 2008, and outperformed in 2013 and 2014 and has started this year well.
He reports upon the reasons behind the performance returns for 2015 in his statement on pages 8 to 12.
Overall, the underperformance in the period was due to his long term preference for value stocks which led him not to invest in some of the strongest performers over the year, such as Amazon, which he considered to be expensive.
In addition, he had one or two stock disappointments.
The share price total return was 2.4%.
This was somewhat disappointing to us as it represents the combination of portfolio underperformance and the establishment of a small discount.
Having issued shares at a small premium in 2014 and early 2015, we saw investors changing preferences in mid 2015.
We have therefore, as we indicated we would, bought back shares and will continue so to do.
From the emergence of the discount in the first quarter of 2015, we have now repurchased 10,468,652 shares into Treasury as at the date of this statement, representing 3.7% of the Companys issued share capital at the beginning of 2015. Dividend growth from the portfolio was again quite significant, helped by the strength of the dollar.
This enables your Company to provide an increased final dividend of 2.5p per share, taking the dividends for the year as a whole to 4.0p per share, an increase of 23.1% on 2014.
Gearing Gearing has remained within the Boards strategic gearing level of 10%, plus or minus 2% over the year.
The investment manager, Garrett Fish, has the ability to hold cash of up to 5% of net assets if he believes there to be a real risk of capital loss and we have indicated that our highest level of gearing would be 20%.
The ability to gear is an important feature of a closed end investment vehicle.
The Board has developed a diversified debt strategy in order to avoid having to refinance all our debt at a particular point, to alleviate the need to time a particular interest rate level and to maintain flexibility.
In April 2015, the Company put in place an additional 25 million of flexible bank debt through a five year facility with National Australia Bank to ensure that the Boards strategic gearing level could be maintained.
The Company now has bank facilities totalling 60 million which are or will be drawn down in dollars, together with a 50 million sterling debenture in respect of which the currency mismatch is hedged.
Repayment dates for the bank debt are December 2016 and April 2020: the debenture matures in June 2018.
For full details of the terms of these facilities please refer to pages 49 and 50.
Dividends US companies continued to provide a reasonably strong dividend flow and the income we received last year showed further gains.
The increase in your Companys income was approximately 12%.
Our analysis shows that, just over 7% of the income increase over the year came from the strengthening of the US dollar vs. sterling.
The remainder was due to an increase in dividends 3
