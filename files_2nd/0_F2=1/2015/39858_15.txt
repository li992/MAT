9.5 million of our reversionary potential should be realised through the normal cycle of rent reviews, lease renewals and lettings.
Shops, restaurants, cafs and pubs account for 63% of this uncontracted reversion.
In our experience, these uses have, in our locations, demonstrated a long history of sustained, non-cyclical demand.
Together with a restricted supply of space, this underpins their growth prospects.
Consequently, we remain confident that, through our proven long-term management strategy, we shall not only convert this potential additional income into cash flow, but also deliver further additional long-term sustained rental growth.
With vacancy levels remaining low, where possible, we seek to secure vacant possession of under-rented space and, in re-letting, accelerate the realisation of this potential income.
