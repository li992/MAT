Aggregate Directors emoluments are shown at the end of the Single Total Figure of Remuneration section.
No compensatory payment was made.
His 2015 base salary was 472,000 2014 463,000 although he elected to waive 54,000 2014 53,000 of his salary and therefore received a pro-rata salary of 418,000 2014 410,000, representing an increase of 1.9%.
His bonus for both years was based on salary before waiver.
Mark Rollins originally waived part of his salary increase in 2011 so that his percentage increase was broadly in line with the average percentage increase awarded to Group employees.
2 David Squires 2015 total reflects him joining part way through the year, on 1 May 2015.
His single figure remuneration total includes his One-off Award consisting of 4,770 shares with a value of 14,906 and long-term incentive awards with a face a value of 287,500.
Further information on his One-off Award can be found on page 65.
3 Taxable benefits include the provision of a fully expensed company car or car allowance and private medical insurance.
The amount in respect of Mark Vernon, a US-based Director, relates to the cost of travel to Board Meetings in the UK.
Until April 2015, HMRC regulations required Mark Vernons flights to attend Board Meetings to be treated by the Company as home-to-office travel, which meant these air travel costs were treated as taxable benefits.
From April 2015 air travel was no longer deemed to be home-tooffice travel and therefore from that date the only costs recognised in the table included accommodation and travel costs incurred within the UK.
4 Awards under the deferred bonus award, the Enhanced SMIS, in respect of 2015 performance will be granted in March 2016.
The deferred bonus element that is to be granted in the form of shares to David Squires and Derek Harding in March 2016 is included in the cash bonus figure and will be equivalent in value to 5% of 2015 base salary, namely 15,350 and 15,750 respectively.
5 20.6% of the 2013 LTIP Award is due to vest in March 2016 for David Squires and Mark Rollins and in September 2016 for Derek Harding.
Mark Rollins 2015 LTIP award shall be prorated to reflect the period of time served during the relevant LTIP performance period, namely, 29 36ths.
As the LTIP awards had not vested at the date this report was signed, the average market value of the shares over the last three months of 2015 of 240.8p has been used to determine the value for the purposes of the single total figure.
Mark Rollins 2014 comparator LTIP figure has been re-stated from the figure shown in the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 to reflect the difference in value of the 2012 LTIP award on the actual date of vesting on 1 April 2015 of 3.21p and the estimated value of the LTIP award having used the average market value of the shares over the last three months of 2014 of 275.0p.
Consequently, his 2014 total figure has also been restated to reflect changes in the LTIP valuation.
Further details on the performance conditions can be found on page 63.
FEES RECEIVED FOR OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS Mark Rollins was appointed a non-executive director of The Vitec Group plc on 2 October 2013 and received total fees of 18,000 during the year until his retirement from the Board of Senior plc on 31 May 2015 2014 41,000.

No additional fees are payable for Committee membership.

After these increases, the fees remain around lower quartile.
Weighting of annual bonus KPIs for 2016 The individual weightings of the KPIs for the executive Directors for the Annual bonus are as set out in the following table: 2016 2015 Enhanced Enhanced Maximum SMIS Maximum SMIS possible cash maximum possible maximum award share award cash award share award Cash flow targets: Interim 10.0% 5.0% 10.0% 5.0% Full year 15.0% 7.5% 15.0% 7.5% EPS targets: Internal target 30.0% 15.0% 15.0% 7.5% Year-on-year growth 15.0% 7.5% 30.0% 15.0% Totals 70.0% 35.0% 70.0% 35.0% The actual targets are currently considered commercially sensitive because of the information that this provides to the Companys competitors.
Fulldisclosure of the 2016 targets will be disclosed in the Annual Report 2016.
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS FOR 2016 AWARDS Conditional share awards to be granted in 2016.
The performance conditions for awards which will be made in 2016 will again be based on growth in EPS 50% weighting and relative TSR measured against a peer group 50% weighting.
