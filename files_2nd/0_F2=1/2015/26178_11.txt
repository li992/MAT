The reduction in WADR is consistent with JLCMs experience of the secondary market for PPP assets and particularly that If actual deposit rates were to vary from those assumed in the UK, in which 88% of JLIFs Portfolio by value in the valuation of JLIFs Portfolio for only the next few was located as at the end of 2015. years, as opposed to the whole remaining life of the assets average life of the Portfolio was 18.5 years at 3.3.

Changes to interest rates therefore have little impact on the finance costs of the projects and therefore the returns received by JLIF are largely insulated from this risk.
Long term gilt yields in the UK, Continental Europe and Canada remained at historically low levels in 2015.
There is the potential that these could increase over time.
Historically, there appears only limited correlation between movements in gilt rates and discount rates used to value PPP projects.
The current Portfolio WADR of 7.82% is signicantly higher than the Portfolio weighted average gilt rate, a differential that remains at an historic high since launch.
