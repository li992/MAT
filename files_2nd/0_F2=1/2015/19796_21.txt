Corporate governance report continued Board evaluation The Board last conducted an externally facilitated evaluation in 2011 12.
Given the Chairmans succession, the Board agreed that an externally facilitated Board evaluation in 2014 15 would have limited value and that an internal interview-based evaluation process, tailored to the need to respect the Serious Fraud Office investigation, would be conducted.
The review covered a range of factors relevant to the effectiveness of the Board including: skills, knowledge and diversity: clarity and leadership of purpose and values: teamwork: relationships: succession and development: quality of information, papers and discussion: decision making processes: risk processes: and communication with stakeholders.
The evaluation found that overall the Board was felt to have confronted the major challenges both in the industry and with the replacement of senior management, rigorously addressed the commercial income issue and the process of transformation of the Company, whilst retaining its effectiveness and building towards the future.
The assessment of views and suggested actions from the evaluation will be considered further and taken forward by the new Chairman, John Allan.
The intention is to conduct an externally led review during 2015 16.
Board meetings During the 2014 15 year, the Board held seven scheduled meetings, plus a strategy meeting with ad hoc meetings being arranged to deal with matters between scheduled meetings as appropriate.
Board meetings were preceded by a day of Committee meetings.
This pattern of meetings was intended to support the Boards focus on the strategic and long-term matters, while ensuring it could discharge its monitoring and oversight role effectively through intensive high-quality discussions and high-quality information flows.
