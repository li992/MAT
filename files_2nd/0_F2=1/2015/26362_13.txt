Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Summary of Group results Overview: robust financial performance with increased underlying profits and returns: strong balancesheet The Groups underlying profit increased by 5 per cent in the year to 8,112 million, driven by a 1 per cent increase in total income, lower operating costs despite increased investment in the business and a 48 per cent improvement in impairments.
Statutory profit before tax was 1,644 million 2014: 1,762million after provisions for PPI of 4,000 million 2014: 2,200 million including an additional 2,100 million charged in the fourth quarter.
Statutory profit after tax was 956 million compared to 1,499 million in 2014.
Total loans and advances to customers were 455 billion compared with 456 billion excluding TSB at 31 December 2014, with growth in the key customer segments offset by further reductions in run-off and portfolios closed to new business.
Customer deposits were 418 billion compared with 423 billion excluding TSB, a reduction of 5 billion, or 1 per cent, compared with 31 December 2014, largely due to a planned reduction in tactical deposits.
The combination of good underlying profitability and continued reduction in risk-weighted assets resulted in an improvement in the Groups common equity tier 1 ratio on a pro forma basis to 13.9 per cent before taking account of dividends in respect of 2015 and 13.0 per cent after dividends 31December 2014: 12.8 per cent.
The pro forma leverage ratio was 4.8 per cent 31 December 2014: 4.9 per cent.
Total income 2015 2014 Change million million % Net interest income 11,482 10,975 5 Other income 6,155 6,467 5 Total income 17,637 17,442 1 Banking net interest margin 2.63% 2.40% 23bp Average interest-earning banking assets 441.9bn 461.1bn 4 Average interest-earning banking assets excluding run-off 427.5bn 431.2bn 1 Further detail on net interest income and other income is included on page 52.
Total income of 17,637 million was 1 per cent higher than 2014, with growth in net interest income partly offset by lower other income.
Net interest income increased 5 per cent to 11,482 million, reflecting the improved net interest margin.
Net interest margin of 2.63 per cent was up 23basis points, driven by a combination of lower deposit and wholesale funding costs, partly offset by continued pressure on asset prices.
Average interest-earning banking assets fell by 19 billion, or 4 per cent, to 442 billion, largely as a result of the reduction of 15.6billion in run-off assets.
Excluding run-off, average interest-earning banking assets were 1 per cent lower with lending growth in key customer segments offset by reductions in portfolios closed to new business.
The Group expects the net interest margin for the 2016 full year will be around 2.70 per cent, despite continued low base rates, benefiting from further improvements in deposit and wholesale funding costs, including the impact of the ECN exchange, partly offset by continued pressure on asset prices.
Other income was 5 per cent lower at 6,155 million largely as a result of the reduction in run-off business.
Excluding run-off, other income was in line with 2014.
Fees and commissions were lower than 2014 mainly due to a reduction in current account and credit card transaction related net income, and the impact of changes in the regulatory environment.
This was partly offset by income generated by the Insurance business from its entry into the bulk annuity market and the increase in operating lease income.
As expected, other income recovered in the fourth quarter, and at 1,528 million, was 11percent ahead of the third quarter and 1 per cent higher than in the same period last year, despite insurance claims as a result of Decembers floods and storms of 58 million.
Costs 2015 2014 Change million million % Operating costs 8,311 8,322 Cost:income ratio 49.3% 49.8% 0.5 pp 1 Simplification savings annual run-rate 373m 1 Run-rate savings achieved from phase II of the Simplification programme.
Operating costs of 8,311 million were lower than in 2014 despite now including costs relating to the next phase of Simplification, with a 466 million increase in investment including strategic initiatives and Simplification, and 143 million for pay, inflation and other costs, offset by 491 million of incremental savings from the Simplification programmes and 129 million of reductions from business disposals.
Phase II of the Simplification programme has delivered 373 million of annual run-rate savings to date and we are ahead of target in achieving 1 billion of Simplification savings by the end of 2017.
The Group has a proven track record in cost management and given the lower interest rate environment, is responding through the accelerated delivery of cost initiatives and targeting further efficiency savings.
The cost:income ratio improved to 49.3 per cent from 49.8 per cent in 2014 and remains one of the lowest of our major UK banking peers.
We remain committed to achieving annual improvements in the cost:income ratio with a target ratio of around 45 per cent and based on current interest rate assumptions we now expect to achieve this target as we exit 2019.
Operating lease depreciation increased 6 per cent to 764 million driven by the continued growth in the Lex Autolease business.
35 Financial results Summary of Group results continued Impairment 2015 2014 Change million million % Continuing business impairment charge 560 899 38 Run-off impairment charge 8 203 96 Total impairment charge 568 1,102 48 Asset quality ratio 0.14% 0.23% 9 bp Impaired loans as a % of closing advances 2.1% 2.9% 0.8 pp Provisions as a % of impaired loans 46.1% 56.4% 10.3 pp Provisions as a % of impaired loans excluding run-off 43.0% 44.6% 1.6 pp The impairment charge was 568 million, 48 per cent lower than in 2014 as a result of the significant reduction in run-off business and improvements in all divisions.
The charge is net of significant provision releases and write-backs, although at lower levels than seen in 2014.
The asset quality ratio improved to 14 basis points from 23 basis points in 2014.
Impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances reduced to 2.1 per cent from 2.9 per cent at the end of December 2014, driven by reductions within both the continuing and the run-off portfolios including the impact of the sale of Irish commercial loans in the third quarter.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans reduced from 56.4 per cent to 46.1 per cent reflecting the disposal of highly covered run-off assets during the year.
The continuing business coverage ratio reduced slightly to 43.0 per cent 31 December 2014: 44.6 per cent but remains strong.
In 2016, the Group expects to benefit from its continued disciplined approach to the management of credit and the resilient UK economy.
The asset quality ratio for the 2016 full year is expected to be around 20 basis points, comprising a marginally lower level of gross impairments at around 25 basis points, compared with 28 basis points in 2015 and a much reduced level of write-backs and provision releases.

Asset sales and other items Asset sales and volatility of 182 million included a charge of 101 million for the reduction in the value of the equity conversion feature embedded in the Groups Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs and negative insurance volatility of 105 million offset by a number of other items including own debt and banking volatility.
The charge in 2014 of 1,190 million included a net loss of 988 million relating to the Groups ECN exchange offers and changes in value of the equity conversion feature, and negative insurance volatility of 228 million.
The fair value unwind arises as a result of acquisition related adjustments made at the time of the HBOS transaction in 2009.
The reduction in the unwind in 2015 to 192 million relates to a lower charge relating to the HBOS subordinated debt of 363 million 2014: 497 million and a credit for the accelerated amortisation of a fair value adjustment which was recognised in the first half of the year.
Other items of 342 million related to the amortisation of intangible assets.
The credit of 374 million in 2014 included a gain of 710 million relating to changes made to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
36 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Simplification Simplification costs in 2015 were 170 million and relate to redundancy costs incurred to deliver phase II of the Simplification programme.
The costs of 966 million in 2014 primarily related to redundancy, IT and other business costs of implementation relating to phase I. TSB The Groups results in 2015 include TSB for the first quarter only, following the agreement in March to sell our remaining stake in the business to Banco Sabadell.
The charge of 745million includes 660 million relating to the sale of TSB which covers the net costs of the Transitional Service Agreement between the Group and TSB and the contribution to be provided by the Group to TSB in migrating to an alternative IT platform, partially offset by the gain on sale.
PPI The Group increased the provision for PPI costs by a further 4.0 billion in 2015, bringing the total amount provided to 16.0 billion.
This included an additional 2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, largely to reflect the impact of our interpretation of the proposals contained within the Financial Conduct Authoritys FCA consultation paper regarding a potential time bar and the Plevin case.
As at 31 December 2015, 3.5 billion or 22 per cent of the total provision remained unutilised with approximately 3.0 billion relating to reactive complaints and associated administration costs.
The volume of reactive PPI complaints has continued to fall, with an 8 per cent reduction in 2015 compared with 2014, to approximately 8,000 complaints per week.
Whilst direct customer complaint levels fell 30 per cent year-on-year, those from Claims Management Companies CMCs have remained broadly stable and as a result, CMCs now account for over 70 per cent of complaints.
Assuming current FCA proposals are implemented and an average of approximately 10,000 complaints per week, including those related to Plevin, the outstanding provision should be sufficient to cover all future PPI related complaints and associated administration costs through to mid-2018.
Weekly complaint trends could vary significantly throughout this period, given they are likely to be impacted by a number of factors including the potential impact of the FCAs proposed communication campaign as well as changes in the regulation of CMCs.
Other conduct provisions In 2015, the Group incurred a charge of 837 million, of which 302 million was recognised in the fourth quarter relating to a number of non-material items including packaged bank accounts and a number of other product rectifications primarily in Retail, Insurance and Commercial Banking.
Within the full year charge, 720 million of provisions related to potential claims and remediation in respect of products sold through the branch network and continuing investigation of matters highlighted through industry wide regulatory reviews, as well as legacy product sales and historical systems and controls such as those governing legacy incentive schemes.
This includes a full year charge of 225 million in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts.
The full year charge also included the previously announced settlement of 117 million that the Group reached with the FCA with regard to aspects of its PPI complaint handling process during the period March 2012 to May 2013.
Taxation The tax charge for the year to 31 December 2015 was 688 million 2014: 263 million, representing an effective tax rate of 42 per cent 2014: 15 per cent.
The effective tax rate was higher than the UK corporation tax rate largely due to the introduction in 2015 of restrictions on the deductibility of conduct related provisions which resulted in an additional tax charge of 459 million.
Adjusting for this charge, the effective tax rate would have been 14percent reflecting a number of positive one-off items including non-taxable and relieved gains and a small prior year adjustment.
Going forward we do not expect these positive one-off items to continue and now expect a medium-term effective tax rate of around 27 per cent, including the forthcoming 8percent surcharge on banking profits.
This is lower than our previous guidance of around 30 per cent, reflecting actions on PPI.
1 Return on required equity At 31 Dec At 31Dec Change 2015 2014 % Underlying return on required equity 15.0% 13.6% 1.4pp Statutory return on required equity 1.5% 3.0% 1.5 pp 1 For basis of calculation see page 53.
Underlying return on required equity has improved in the year reflecting the improvement in underlying profit together with a reduction in the required equity which has been driven by the fall in risk-weighted assets.
The statutory return was lower, largely as a result of higher conduct related provisions and the restriction on their tax deductibility.
At the time of the strategic update in October 2014, we anticipated achieving a sustainable return on required equity, of around 13.5 to 15.0 per cent by the end of 2017.
Since this time, the expected level of interest rates over the plan period has reduced significantly, required equity has increased to 12per cent and the new bank tax surcharge of 8 per cent will come into effect from 1 January 2016.
We continue to target 13.5 to 15.0 per cent but, based on current interest rate assumptions, we now expect to deliver this in 2018.

As at 31 December 2014, loans and advances to customers including TSB were 478 billion, customer deposits including TSB were 447 billion and the loan to deposit ratio was 107 per cent.
2 Excludes balances relating to margins of 2.5billion 31 December 2014: 2.8billion and settlement accounts of 1.4billion 31December 2014: 1.4billion.
Total loans and advances to customers were 455billion compared with 456billion excluding TSB at 31 December 2014.
Mortgage lending increased by 1 per cent, slightly below market growth of 2.5per cent, reflecting our focus on protecting margin in a highly competitive low growth environment.
UK loan growth in Consumer Finance was strong at 17 per cent and SME lending growth was 5 per cent, both outperforming the market.
This growth was offset by further reductions in run-off and other lending portfolios which are closed to new business.
Total deposits were 418 billion compared with 423billion excluding TSB at 31 December 2014, largely due to a planned reduction in tactical deposits.
Wholesale funding was 120 billion, of which 38billion, or 32 per cent, had a maturity of less than one year 31December 2014: 41billion, representing 35 per cent.
The Groups liquidity position remains strong, with liquidity coverage ratio LCR eligible assets of 123billion.
LCR eligible assets represent almost 5.7times the Groups money-market funding with a maturity of less than one year and were in excess of total wholesale funding at 31December 2015 thus providing a substantial buffer in the event of market dislocation.
The Groups LCR ratio already exceeds regulatory requirements and is greater than 100 per cent.

2 Including Insurance dividend relating to 2015, paid in 2016.
Excluding the Insurance dividend the leverage ratio was the same at 4.8 per cent.
The Group further strengthened its capital position in 2015, with the pro forma CET1 ratio increasing to 13.9 per cent before taking account of dividends in respect of 2015 and 13.0 per cent after dividends.
The pro forma ratio recognises the 2015 Insurance dividend paid in February 2016 following the implementation of Solvency II.
The improvement in the pro forma CET1 ratio was driven by a combination of underlying profit and lower risk-weighted assets offset by charges relating to PPI and other conduct issues.
The Group continues to be strongly capital generative, generating, on a pro forma basis, 300 basis points of capital before dividends and PPI in 2015.
This has benefited from a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets, which is unlikely to be repeated.
Going forward, we now expect to generate around 200 basis points of capital annually pre dividends.
This will enable us to support sustainable growth in the business and help Britain prosper whilst delivering sustainable returns for shareholders.
In addition to the internal stress testing activity undertaken in 2015, the Group participated in the UK-wide concurrent stress testing run by the Bank of England, comfortably exceeding both the capital and leverage minimum thresholds.
The remaining issued Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs were not taken into account for the purposes of core capital in the PRA stress tests and the Group has determined that a Capital Disqualification Event CDE, as defined in the conditions of the ECNs, has occurred.
This determination was confirmed by a unanimous decision by the Court of Appeal on 10 December 2015 and on 29 January 2016 the Group announced the redemption of certain series of ECNs using the Regulatory Call Right.
The Group also launched Tender Offers for the remaining series of ECNs on 29 January 2016 and subsequent to completion of such offers, the Group has announced that it will redeem those ECNs not validly tendered using the Regulatory Call Right.
The Tender Offers and process for redemption of the ECNs not validly tendered by the noteholders will be completed before the end of the first quarter with an estimated cost of 0.7billion.
The Group is aware that the Trustee has been granted leave by the Supreme Court to appeal the Court of Appeal decision.
In the event that the Supreme Court were to determine that a CDE had not occurred, the Group would compensate fairly the holders of the ECNs whose securities are redeemed using the Regulatory Call Right for losses suffered as a result of early redemption.
Risk-weighted assets reduced by 7 per cent, or 17 billion to 223 billion 31 December 2014: 240 billion, primarily driven by the sale of TSB, other disposals in the run-off business and continued improvements in credit quality, partly offset by targeted lending growth.
The Groups pro forma leverage ratio, after taking account of dividends relating to 2015, reduced to 4.8 per cent 31 December 2014: 4.9 per cent reflecting the reduction in tier 1 capital offset by the reduction in balance sheet assets arising, in part, from the sale of TSB.
38 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Dividend The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.5 pence per share, together with a capital distribution in the form of a special dividend of 0.5pence per share.
This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 0.75 pence per share 2014: nil that was announced at our 2015 half-year results.
The total ordinary dividend per share for 2015 of 2.25 pence has increased from 0.75 pence in 2014, in line with our progressive and sustainable dividend policy, and we continue to expect ordinary dividends to increase over the medium term with a dividend payout ratio of at least 50 per cent of sustainable earnings.
The special dividend of 0.5 pence per share represents the distribution of surplus capital over and above the Boards view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties.
This level is consistent with our capital requirement guidance of around 12 per cent plus an amount broadly equivalent to a further years ordinary dividend.
The amount of capital we believe is appropriate to hold is likely to vary from time to time depending on circumstances and the Board will give due consideration, subject to the situation at the time, to the distribution of any surplus capital through the use of special dividends or share buy backs.
By its nature, there can be no guarantee that this level of special dividend or any surplus capital distribution will be appropriate in future years.
Conclusion The Group has delivered a robust underlying performance in 2015, driven by higher income, lower operating costs and reduced impairment and further improved underlying returns.
Statutory profit before tax of 1.6 billion was lower, due to the impact of PPI, where an additional charge of 2.1 billion was taken in the fourth quarter largely to reflect our interpretation of the impact of the proposals contained within the FCA consultation paper regarding a potential time bar and the Plevin case.
As a result of the strategic and financial progress, the Board has recommended the payment of an increased ordinary dividend and a special dividend and we are enhancing our guidance for the 2016 net interest margin and annual capital generation.
Although the delivery of the cost:income ratio and return on required equity guidance has been deferred, we remain confident in the Groups prospects and its ability to generate capital and believe the Group is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and superior returns.
