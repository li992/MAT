The Directors consider that a robust going concern assessment process was undertaken and the results were discussed and challenged by the Audit Committee.
Liquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Group can experience significant movements in its liquidity position due to movements in power prices, working capital requirements and phasing of future wind development and construction projects.
Treasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate risk, and managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts, including ensuring compliance with any banking covenants.
Short-term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.
In relation to the Groups liquidity risk, the Groups policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Companys reputation.
Based on management forecasts and committed bank facilities with no immediate maturing facilities, the Group considers it has adequate headroom and will continue to meet liabilities as they fall due.
