This increase means penetration of Mobile within our residential Club has almost doubled to 25% over the last four years with scope for significant further improvement in this level of penetration in future.
CashBack Our exclusive CashBack card has proven itself as an important Member acquisition and retention tool.
It gives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly bill from us.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 15 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED We have seen a 20% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 167,434 2014: 139,769, with around 40% of new residential Club Members gathered directly by our Partners applying for a card.
We believe this continuing strong demand demonstrates the attractiveness of this unique membership benefit, and would be even higher were it not for the difficulties faced by some new Members in funding the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in advance with our prepayment card.
We have seen a pleasing increase in the use of our online shopping portal, with Members earning CashBack on over 1m of online retail spend each month.
We aim to further develop this membership benefit within the online Clubhouse and via a Member App to be launched later in the year.
We paid over 5.4m 2014: 4.9m in CashBack to our Members during the year funded entirely by the retailers in the programme, with many Members achieving a reduction of between 20% and 30% on the amount they pay for the utilities we are supplying to them each month, simply by using their CashBack card instead of an alternative payment card for most of their regular household shopping, and or our online shopping portal.
Membership Service and Support We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single call centre based in the UK.
We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members: we readily invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects of our Members interactions with us in order to ensure the overall quality of their experience.
We have been delighted at the consistently high ratings we receive in Which?
magazine for the quality of the service and support provided to our Members, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.
Partners Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business.
In contrast to the routes to market adopted by other suppliers of similar household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenuesharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy higher-spending Members who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be least likely to churn: by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income.
This ensures that cases of misselling are both inadvertent and extremely rare.
We provide a variety of training and personal development courses both online and classroom based, designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners effectively and successfully: all of these courses are free to attend.
In addition, we offer an interest-free hire purchase scheme which gives Partners access to a Tablet so they can present the benefits of our unique Discount Club more effectively.
16 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini, remains extremely popular with around 700 vehicles now on the road 2014: 575.
Owners inform us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new Members and Partners.
Premises and Systems The refurbishment of our new headquarters office building which we purchased in February 2012 is now substantially complete, and we took occupation around the end of March.
This exciting new space will support our growing business for the foreseeable future.
From a systems perspective, we have the capacity to manage a substantial increase in our current membership base and service numbers, without the need for any material further capital investment.
