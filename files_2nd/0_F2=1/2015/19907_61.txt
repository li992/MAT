IMPLEMENTATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2016 The Committee undertook a full review of Unite Executive Director remuneration towards the end of 2015.
Although it was concluded that the overall structure of remuneration remains appropriate, the Committee considers that the attractiveness of the overall package has fallen below market rates versus comparable companies.
Taking into account the Groups sustained exceptional performance, the increase in scale of Unites operations in recent years and strong competition for talent from new market entrants, the Committee is proposing to make a number of adjustments to executive remuneration for 2016 and is therefore seeking shareholder support for the revised remuneration policy set out earlier in this report.
Details of how the Committee intends to operate the new policy in 2016 are included below: Base salary The Committee has approved the following salary increases with effect from 1 March 2016: Base salary from 1 March 2015 Base salary from 1 March 2016 Executive Director to 28 February 2016 to 28 February 2017 Percentage increase M C Allan 434,000 460,000 6% J J Lister 274,600 291,000 6% R C Simpson 247,700 270,000 9% R S Smith 247,700 270,000 9% The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 85
