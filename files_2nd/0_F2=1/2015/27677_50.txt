These are reversed on acquisition in the statement of financial position and replaced by goodwill, other intangible assets and the value of the acquired present value of in-force business acquired PVIF.
In determining AOP, the Group recognises deferred revenue and acquisition costs and deferred revenue in relation to policies sold by acquired businesses pre-acquisition.
The Group excludes the impairment of goodwill, the amortisation and impairment of acquired other intangibles and acquired PVIF as well as the movements in certain acquisition date provisions.
Costs incurred on completed acquisitions are also excluded from AOP.
If the intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are subsequently impaired, this is excluded from AOP.
The effect of these adjustments to determine AOP are summarised below: m Institutional Emerging Old Mutual Asset Y ear ended 31 December 2015 Markets Wealth Management Total Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 23 23 Amortisation of acquired PVIF 7 51 58 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 13 13 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 13 56 69 Acquisition costs 4 10 14 Deferred consideration 16 16 24 120 23 167 m Institutional Emerging Old Mutual Asset Y ear ended 31 December 2014 Markets Wealth Management Total Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 14 14 Amortisation of acquired PVIF 3 67 70 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 11 11 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 7 47 54 Change in acquisition date provisions 1 1 10 118 128 OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials c Net profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments 183 The net profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments is analysed below: m Y ear ended Y ear ended 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 Emerging Markets 15 66 Old Mutual Wealth 52 70 Institutional Asset Management 1 2 Net loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments 36 2 Emerging Markets Current year transactions On 10 December 2015, Old Mutual Investment Group, a subsidiary of the Group, acquired an additional 50% stake in African Infrastructure Investment Managers Pty Ltd AIIM.
The accounting related to the step-up in ownership from 50% to 100%, which effectively involved a simultaneous sale of 50% of the business, followed by an acquisition of the fair value of 100% of the business.

d Short-term fluctuations in investment return Profit before tax, as disclosed in the consolidated IFRS income statement, includes actual investment returns earned on the shareholder assets of the Groups life assurance and property & casualty businesses.
AOP is stated after recalculating shareholder asset investment returns based on a long-term investment return rate.
The difference between the actual and the long-term investment returns is referred to as the short-term fluctuation in investment return.
Long-term rates of return are based on achieved rates of return appropriate to the underlying asset base, adjusted for current inflation expectations, default assumptions, costs of investment management and consensus economic investment forecasts.
The underlying rates are principally derived with reference to 10-year government bond rates, cash and money market rates and an explicit equity risk premium for South African businesses.
The rates set out below reflect the apportionment of underlying investments in cash deposits, money market instruments and equity assets.
Long-term rates of return are reviewed annually by the Board for appropriateness.
The review of the long-term rates of return seeks to ensure that the returns credited to AOP are consistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long term.

These include investments in the Companys ordinary shares and the subordinated liabilities and ordinary shares issued by the Group.
These investment returns are eliminated within the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before tax in the consolidated IFRS income statement, but are included in AOP.
This ensures consistency of treatment with the measures in the related policyholder liability.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the investment return adjustment increased AOP by 31 million year ended 31 December 2014: increase of 42 million.
f Dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities Dividends declared to the holders of the Groups perpetual preferred callable securities on an AOP basis were 31 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 year ended 31 December 2014: 32 million.
For the purpose of determining AOP, these are recognised in finance costs on an accrual basis.
In accordance with IFRS, the total cash distribution is recognised directly in equity.
g Institutional Asset Management equity plans Institutional Asset Management has a number of long-term incentive arrangements with senior employees in its asset management affiliates.
As part of the incentive schemes in the Institutional Asset Management business, the Group has granted put options over the equity of certain affiliates to senior affiliate employees.
The impact of revaluing these instruments is recognised in accordance with IFRS, but excluded from AOP.
At 31 December 2015, these instruments were revalued, the impact of which was a loss of 9 million year ended 31 December 2014: loss of 42 million.
h Credit-related fair value losses on Group debt instruments The widening of the credit spread on the Groups debt instruments can cause the market value of these instruments to decrease, resulting in gains being recognised in profit or loss.
Conversely, if the credit spread narrows the market value of debt instruments will increase, causing losses to be recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In the directors view, such movements are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and will reverse over time.
Therefore they have been excluded from AOP.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, due to widening of credit spreads, a net gain of 7 million was recognised year ended 31 December 2014: net loss of 10 million.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials i Development costs of the new Old Mutual Wealth UK platform 185 In 2013, Old Mutual Wealths UK business embarked on a significant programme to develop new platform capabilities and to outsource UK business administration.
This will involve replacing many aspects of the existing UK platform, and on completion certain elements of service provision will be migrated to International Financial Data Services IFDS under a long-term outsourcing agreement.
The cost of developing the new technology typically cannot be capitalised, hence these costs and the costs of decommissioning existing technology and migrating of services to IFDS are excluded from AOP.
Only costs that are directly attributable to the programme are excluded.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, these costs totalled 97 million year ended 31 December 2014: 60 million.
C2: Earnings and earnings per share The Group calculates earnings per share EPS on a number of different bases as appropriate to prevailing international, UK and South African practices and guidance.
IFRS requires the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.
Adjusted operating EPS reflects earnings per share that is consistent with the Groups alternative profit measure.
JSE Limited JSE listing requirements also require the Group to calculate headline EPS.

As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in certain African territories, dividends to ordinary equity holders on the branch registers of those countries or, in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.
A second interim dividend of 6.25 pence or its equivalent in other applicable currencies per ordinary share in the Company has been declared by the directors.
This dividend will be paid on 29 April 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1 April 2016.
The dividend will absorb an estimated 297 million of shareholders funds.
In March and November 2015, 17 million and 13 million respectively, were declared and paid to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities March 2014: 17 million, November 2014: 15 million.
