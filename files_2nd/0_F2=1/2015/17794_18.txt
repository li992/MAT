STRATEGIC REPORT: NIOBIUM AND PHOSPHATES Duncan Wanblad NIOBIUM AND CEO Base Metals and Minerals PHOSPHATES With the ramp-up of the Boa Vista Fresh Rock BVFR plant, we move to being the No.
2 niobium producer in the world, with our operations located in Gois state, Brazil.
Our phosphates business, based in the countrys agricultural heartland in Gois state, is the second largest in Brazil.

The plant reached 69% of high strength steels.
Phosphorus is a basic component of all living things Phosphates and phosphates are a vital ingredient of fertilisers.
Our Production of 1.1 million tonnes of fertiliser was broadly in line Chapado mine in Ouvidor has a long mine life, as well with the prior year.
Phosphoric acid production decreased as some of Brazils highest grades of phosphate ore. by 10%, mainly due to maintenance repairs at the Cubato Ours is an integrated operation that covers mining processing plant.
Phosphoric acid is a key component of phosphate ore, refining it to produce P O concentrate, dicalcium phosphate DCP : consequently, DCP production 2 5 and processing into intermediate and final products.
was 10% lower owing to the priority given to phosphoric acid sales in Cubato.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Niobium Underlying EBIT of $33 million was 52% lower Niobium 2014: $69 million, as a result of the capitalisation of sales Production from installed capacity is expected to increase associated with the ramp-up of Boa Vista Fresh Rock to 6,800 tonnes once the BVFR plant reaches nameplate BVFR, inflation and rehabilitation provision increases, capacity in the third quarter of 2016.
This, when combined partly compensated by the benefit of the weaker with certain metallurgical debottlenecking activities Brazilian real.
currently being implemented, will take the total annual capacity to 9,000 tonnes.
Underlying EBIT of $17 million from BVFR was capitalised in 2015, as the project had not reached Phosphates commercial production.
Fertiliser and DCP production in 2016 is expected to be broadly similar to 2015.
Phosphoric acid production is Phosphates expected to increase to around 300,000 tonnes, driven Underlying EBIT of $91 million was 38% higher by improved performance at Cubato following the 2014: $66 million, mainly due to the positive impact of maintenance repairs in the second half of 2015. the weaker Brazilian currency on operating costs and lower study costs, partly offset by inflation, reduced sales volumes and lower realised pricing including the impact of the weaker Brazilian real on prices.
MARKETS Niobium Despite a strong first six months, worldwide demand for ferroniobium has softened, while global production capacity has increased slightly.
This decline in demand was driven by the challenging conditions in the Chinese steel industry and lower investments in oil and gas pipeline steel.
As a result, average niobium prices weakened across all regions.
Phosphates The average MAP CFR Brazil price was marginally lower at $479 tonne 2014: $487 tonne, mainly as a result of softer demand in Brazil and lower than expected Indian imports in the second half.
