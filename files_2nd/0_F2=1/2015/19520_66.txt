2 On 20 June 2014 Jamie Wilsons value share award granted on 1 June 2011 was released to him.

3 Jamie Wilson stepped down as a director on 18 February 2015 and ceased to be an employee on 31 March 2015, and accordingly all of his unvested value share awards were forfeited.
The number of shares which can be released under a value share award is dependent upon TSR outperformance compared with the median of a comparator group identified on page 90 over three, four and five-year performance periods: at median or below median TSR performance, no shares will vest: and for every 10 million of additional shareholder value created, a pre-determined fixed number of shares will vest as set out in the table above.
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2015 95 Governance Directors remuneration report continued | Annual report on remuneration continued Additional shareholder value represents the amount of additional return to shareholders as a result of the companys TSR performance exceeding that of the comparator group.
It is calculated as the percentage change in TSR of the company, less the percentage change in TSR of the median of the comparator group, multiplied by the companys market capitalisation at the commencement of the performance period.
The maximum number of shares that can vest is capped at the level at which additional shareholder value at the end of each performance period equals the market capitalisation of the company at the commencement of the performance period.
The maximum value for all participants including executive directors in the aggregate is therefore capped at 0.5% of additional shareholder value created for any five-year performance period.
This is the maximum theoretical percentage that can be earned in aggregate by all participants, with 99.5% ofthe additional value created accruing to shareholders.
Value share awards granted before 2013 vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to TSR outperformance, butparticipants may request the release of all or part of the award from the third anniversary of the grant date.
If the remuneration committee exercises itsdiscretion to release shares in such circumstances, the number of shares is determined based on TSR outperformance to that date, withthe shares partially deferred and released in equal instalments over the period until the fifth anniversary of the grant date.
There is no opportunity for retesting against future TSR performance, and the deferred shares are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances should the participants employment terminate before the fifth anniversary.
Value share awards granted from 2013 vest one-third on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date respectively.
Any shares are then released, based on TSR outperformance to the preceding 31 March.
If the performance conditions for any award are not achieved at the relevant date, the appropriate proportion of shares will lapse and there is no opportunity for retesting.
At 31 March 2015, TSR outperformance, additional shareholder value created, and the indicative value of shares capable of vesting for the highest paid executive Alan Clark were: Performance period commencing 1 April 2010 1 April 2011 1 April 2012 1 April 2013 1 April 2014 SABMillers TSR to 31 March 2015 120.721% 79.584% 56.644% 22.030% 17.654% Comparator group median TSR to 31 March 2015 84.669% 76.101% 65.969% 16.289% 15.022% Outperformance 36.052% 3.483% nil 5.741% 2.632% SABMiller market capitalisation at commencement 27,746m 33,485m 37,639m 47,580m 48,459m of the performance period Additional shareholder value created 10,003m 1,166m nil 2,731m 1,275m Value of shares capable of vesting at 35.40 per share 4.1m 0.47m nil 1.2m 0.56m Value of shares as % of additional shareholder value created 0.04% 0.04% 0.04% 0.04% Approval This report complies with the requirements of the regulations.
