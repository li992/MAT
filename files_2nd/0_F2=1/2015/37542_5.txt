Our business model Our market knowledge and deep occupier relationships are integral to our investment decisions.
We leverage these relationships and our property expertise to generate assets with long and strong income characteristics.
Once we have added value, a review of the future performance and prospects for each asset is undertaken, and whether to sell and recycle the capital.
We are unemotional about our portfolio and believe that each asset has to justify continued ownership.
