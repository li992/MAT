Section 2: Strategic Report continued An analysis of the weighted average discount rates for the investments in the portfolio analysed by territory, and showing movement in the period, is shown below: 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 Movement Discount rate Long-term Government Country Risk premium Discount rate Bond yield UK 2.2% 5.6% 7.8% 8.2% 0.4% Australia 2.5% 5.7% 8.2% n a n a Canada 2.0% 5.4% 7.4% 7.9% 0.5% France 1.0% 9.1% 10.1% 10.6% 0.5% Holland 0.6% 7.2% 7.8% 8.3% 0.5% Ireland 1.0% 7.7% 8.7% 9.0% 0.3% Portfolio 2.1% 5.8% 7.9% 8.2% 0.3% In the UK, there is sufficient market data on discount rates and hence the risk premium is derived from this market discount rate for operational social and transportation infrastructure investments less the appropriate long-term Government Bond yield.
For Australia, Canada and the Eurozone, where there is less market data, more emphasis is placed on the bottom up approach to determine discount rates.
The Board discusses the proposed valuation with the third-party valuation expert to ensure that the valuation of the Groups portfolio is appropriate.
As long-term Government Bond yields in the UK, Australia, Canada and the Eurozone are currently low, this is reflected in higher country risk premium, which includes an allowance for increases from these historically low yields.
The 0.3% average reduction is attributable to a more competitive environment for social infrastructure assets.
While there is a steady supply of new investment opportunities, new market entrants, attracted by the favourable risk-adjusted returns, have driven prices upwards, and hence caused discount rates to fall further during the year.
This is a trend the Investment Adviser is still experiencing currently based on recent market transactions.
Valuation Assumptions Apart from the discount rates, the other key economic assumptions used in determining the Directors valuation of the portfolio are as follows: 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 1 UK RPI and RPIx 2.75% p. a.
2.00% p. a. thereafter Inflation Canada CPI 2.00% p. a.

Retail Price Index and Retail Price Index excluding mortgage interest payments 30 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2015 Valuation Sensitivities The portfolios valuation is sensitive to each of the macro-economic assumptions listed above.
An explanation for the reason for the sensitivity and an analysis of how each variable in isolation i. e. while keeping the other assumptions constant impacts the valuation follows below.
The sensitivities are also contained in Note 4 to the accounts.
Discount Rate Whilst not a macro-economic assumption, the weighed-average discount rate that applies for the purposes of valuing the portfolio is arguably the single most important variable.
Discount rate -0.5% change Base Case 7.9% 0.5% change Directors valuation 85.8m 1,732.2m -79.4m 1 NAV per share implied change 6.8p share -6.3p share 1.
NAV per share based on 1,268m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2015 Inflation Sensitivity The projects in the portfolio have contractual income streams derived from public sector clients, which are rebased every year for inflation.
UK projects tend to use either RPI Retail Price Index or RPIx RPI excluding mortgage payments, and revenues are either partially or totally indexed depending on the contract and the nature of the projects financing.
Facilities management sub-contracts have similar indexation arrangements.
In the UK, RPI and RPIx were 0.9% for the year ending 31 March 2015.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK inflation of 2.75% per annum for both RPI and RPIx, the same assumption as for the prior year.
The March 2015 forecasts for RPI out to December 2016 range from 1.3% to 3.7% from 20 independent forecasters as compiled by HM Treasury, with an average forecast of 3.0%.
In addition to the prior years sensitivity analysis of - 0.5% p. a. to the base case UK inflation assumption, the Investment Adviser has prepared an additional inflation sensitivity for this year.
The new sensitivity models 0% p. a. RPI and RPIX until 2020, before it reverts to the assumed long-term assumption of 2.75% for the remainder of the project concession lives.
0% p. a. until 2020, Inflation assumption UK -0.5% p. a. change Base 2.75% p. a.
0.5% p. a. change 2.75% thereafter Directors valuation -112.5m -52.9m 1,732.2m 57.6m NAV per share -8.9p share -4.2p share 4.5p share implied change 1.

Analysis based on the 20 largest investments, extrapolated for the whole portfolio The chart below provides a graphical illustration of how the expected future cash flows to be received by the Group from the current portfolio are sensitive to a reduction in the inflation assumption to 0% p. a. until 2020, before reverting to 2.75% for the remaining concession lives of all projects red bars, compared to the base case red and purple bars.
Even in this unlikely scenario of zero inflation for five years, the Group would still be able to achieve the current level of distributions to shareholders.

Deposit Rate Sensitivity Each projects interest costs are at fixed rates, either through fixed rate bonds or bank debt which is hedged with an interest rate swap, or linked to inflation through index-linked bonds.
A projects sensitivity to interest rates relates to the cash deposits which the project is required to maintain as part of its senior debt funding.
For example most projects would have a debt service reserve account in which six months of debt service payments are held.
As at 31 March 2015, cash deposits for the portfolio were earning interest at a rate of 0.4% per annum on average.
There is a consensus that UK base rates will remain low for an extended period, with a current median forecast for UK base rates in December 2016 of 0.5% p. a.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK deposit interest rates are 1.0% p. a. to March 2019 and 3.0% p. a. thereafter.
This extends the period of 1.0% deposit interest rates and applies a lower long-term rate compared to that applied in the March 2014 valuation, which assumed 1.0% deposit interest rates to March 2018 and 3.5% thereafter.
These changes have reduced the portfolio valuation by approximately 19.9m and are included within the 10.7m aggregate decrease in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic Assumptions.
A change of 0.5% p. a. to the assumed deposit rates would have the following effect on the valuation: Base 1.00% p. a.
Cash deposit rate -0.5% p. a. change 0.5% p. a. change then 3.00% p. a.
Directors valuation -19.8m 1,732.2m 19.4m NAV per share implied change -1.6p share 1.5p share 1.

32 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2015 Annual Project Distributions Lifecycle and Tax Rate Sensitivities Lifecycle also called asset renewal or major maintenance concerns the replacement of material parts of the asset to maintain it over the concession life.
It involves larger items that are not covered by routine maintenance and for a building will include items like the replacement of boilers, chillers, carpets and doors when they reach the end of their useful economic lives.
The lifecycle obligation, together with the budget and the risk, is usually either taken by the project company and hence the investor or is subcontracted and taken by the FM contractor.
The lifecycle sensitivities consider a -10% change to the projected budget for lifecycle where the risk is taken by the project company.
Of the 20 largest assets, 11 have lifecycle as a project company risk i. e. not subcontracted to the supply-chain.
This is broadly typical of the portfolio as a whole.

Sensitivity from the impact on 20 largest investments as a result of a 10% change - in the existing profiled lifecycle expenditure and extrapolated across the whole portfolio.
The profits of each UK project company are subject to UK corporation tax.
The UK corporation tax assumption for the portfolio valuation is 20%, which has reduced by 1% from 21% at March 2014, to reflect the current rate of UK corporation tax.
This change has increased the portfolio valuation by approximately 9.2m and is included within the 10.7m aggregate reduction in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic Assumptions.
The tax sensitivity looks at the effect on changing the tax rates by - 5% each year and is provided to show that tax can be a material variable in the valuation of investments.
The analysis to prepare this sensitivity was carried out on the 20 largest investments 58% of the portfolio by value as at 31 March 2015.
