A3.5 CONCLUSION I am delighted to report another year of excellent progress for Paragon, as we continue our strategy of diversifying the Groups income and funding streams, whilst continuing to improve shareholder returns.
Paragon Banks development over a short space of time has been significant and the recent acquisition of Five Arrows Leasing Group takes us into the SME finance market.
We are looking forward to working closely with the Five Arrows management team on a business that has substantial growth potential under Paragons ownership.
The Groups financial performance has been strong, including profit growth of 10.2%.
Buy-to-let volumes increased by 102% and our pipeline at the year-end was up 72%.
The level of capacity and diversification we have achieved in our funding, including over 950 million in retail deposits raised to date through Paragon Bank, will allow us to capitalise on future growth opportunities.
Capital management remains a priority for the Group.
We have delivered improved return on equity, increased the dividend by over 22% and have extended the share buy-back programme by a further 50.0 million as we continue to balance strong growth with increased shareholder returns.
This set of results demonstrates the strength of the Groups existing franchises which are being extended by the ongoing diversification of both our funding and income streams.
