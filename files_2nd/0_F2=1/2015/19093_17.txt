The improvements were delivered through volume growth, higher selling prices, generally lower input costs, the benefits of completed capital investments and positive 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 currency effects.
European demand for containerboard is estimated to have grown 4.1% in 2015, with virgin Underlying operating profit grades growing by 4.7% and recycled grades by 3.9%.
Demand in Russia and the other million Commonwealth of Independent States CIS was stable.
Our total containerboard sales volumes grew by 1.2%, driven by operational debottlenecking, with all operations running at capacity.
391m Average European benchmark selling prices for unbleached kraftliner were up 4.4% on ROCE 2014 levels, with a series of price increases implemented during the year before some 391 moderate price erosion towards the end of the year.
White-top kraftliner prices were 342 relatively stable during the year, with the average benchmark price marginally up compared 308 300 to 2014.
236 Average benchmark recycled containerboard prices were up 0.9% on the prior year.
Price increases were implemented in the second half of the year and closing prices were 3.4% higher than the average price for the year.
Recent capacity increases in the European virgin containerboard market, coupled with an increase in imports from certain emerging markets benefiting from weaker currencies 2015 2011 2012 2013 2014 versus the euro, have resulted in downward pressure on selling prices.
In the early part of 2016, selling prices for the Groups unbleached kraftliner grades sold into Europe declined by an average of around 20-25 tonne, while white-top kraftliner prices were 10-15 tonne lower.
A 10% increase in the domestic Russian market was implemented for white-top containerboard in February.
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 53 24.5% 17.8% 21.7% 23.7% 25.5% Business reviews Sales volumes of sack kraft paper were up by 10.4%, benefiting from the ramp-up of the 155,000 tonne per annum bleached kraft paper machine in tt Czech Republic, commissioned in 2014: forward integrating pulp that was previously sold in the open market: and the full-year contribution from the Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill US acquired in mid 2014.
Selling prices for sack kraft paper declined at the beginning of 2015, giving up much of the gains achieved in the second half of 2014.
Thereafter prices remained stable for most of the year, and average prices were broadly in line with those of the prior year.
In export markets, a combination of a slowdown in construction activity in certain south east Asian markets and political instability in some countries in the Middle East and North Africa had a negative effect on demand in the second half of the year.
Seasonal weakness towards the end of the year also impacted European markets.
As a result, in early 2016, average selling prices for sack kraft paper produced in Europe have reduced by approximately 5-6%.
We saw good demand for our speciality grades of kraft paper, with higher selling prices on average than the prior year, although sales volumes were negatively impacted by the closure of the Lohja mill Finland.
Selling prices remain stable in the early part of 2016.
The full-year contributions of our projects completed in 2014, including the Syktyvkar pulp dryer Russia and rebuilt bleached kraft paper machine in tt, contributed significantly to our performance.
The completion of our new recovery boiler in wiecie Poland, conversion of the existing boiler to a biofuel boiler and closure of the coal-fired boilers contributed to lower energy costs in the second half of the year.
Input costs were generally lower than in 2014 as a result of various cost savings initiatives and lower market prices.
Wood, chemicals and biofuel costs were all lower and in Syktyvkar, the weaker rouble more than offset domestic inflationary cost increases.
Paper for recycling costs were, on average, 7% higher than in 2014, with significant increases experienced during the third quarter of the year before decreasing again towards the end of the year.
Income from green energy was lower than the prior year due to lower market prices and volumes sold.
Planned annual maintenance shuts of our wiecie, Dyns Sweden and Stambolijski Bulgaria mills were completed in the first half of the year with the balance of shuts taking place in the second half of the year.
In 2016, the maintenance shuts of our wiecie and Syktyvkar mills are scheduled to take place in the middle of the year and our kraft paper mill shuts are scheduled for the fourth quarter.

This technological breakthrough saves millions of cubic metres of natural gas Packaging Paper operates large and generally integrated production facilities.
We focus compared to standard industry practice and is a on improving efficiencies, increasing yields, reducing energy and water consumption and clear example of how sustainable development is part of the way we work at Mondi.
Product development is aimed at reducing the weight of our packaging paper, while still retaining or improving its functionality and printability.
We also aim to increase the recycled content of our products.
We consider virgin and recycled fibres as complementary.
Both are key elements of an integrated fibre cycle that is not sustainable without the introduction of virgin fibre for quality and strength.
Our passion for performance drives us to continually improve the yields and efficiencies in our mills.
During 2015, we completed a number of projects at our wiecie, Syktyvkar and Frantschach Austria mills to improve the quality of products produced.
The most significant investment completed in 2015 was the construction of the new recovery boilerand conversion of the existing recovery boiler to a biofuel boiler, replacing the coalfired boilers at our wiecie operation.
This investment significantly improved the energy efficiency of the mill, reduced CO e emissions, improved operating efficiencies and 2 reduced ongoing maintenance costs.
In 2016, the focus will be on the completion of the second phase of the project, providing increased softwood pulp capacity and an additional 80,000 tonnes of lightweight kraftliner making full use of the increased capacity from the new recovery boiler.
In 2015, we hosted a seminar, From Fibre to Corrugated Board attended by over 300 customers at our wiecie mill.
Our customers had the opportunity to observe and ask questions about our production processes and our operating procedures, providing them with a much deeper understanding of the products they use.
Our next event is planned for 2017.
Packaging Paper enjoys strong, long-term relationships with many of our customers and this was clearly reflected in the outcomes of the customer survey.
The survey also identified two areas that need our ongoing focus: improving our production planning and delivery, and ensuring that our products continue to meet sustainability criteria.
We continue to invest in the development of our people, with a focus on plant  in 2016.
We have completed the capital investments to engineer outthe businesss Top 5 Fatal Risks and we are making good progress in improving our safety record, with a significant reduction in our TRCR.
At our kraft paper mill in the US, we continued our activities to ensure the mill meets Mondi safety standards through both training and investment.
