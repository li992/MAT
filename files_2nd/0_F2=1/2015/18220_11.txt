Thisdelivers higher crop yields with less energy-intensive manufacturing.
6x Working closely with our Can deliver up to six times more concentrated customers, I was able to identify levels ofmicronutrients their performance needs and work than the industry norm with the team to find a solution Marcia Werner Research and Technology Manager In the development of this exciting new product, I focused on testing Enables more efficient during the laboratory phase to manufacture and higher crop yields ensure it was ready for global manufacturing and launch Douglas Porto Market Applications Specialist Improves shelf life offormulations The market need Micronutrients are essential for successful growth ofplants: without their presence, the consequences can range from stunted growth, leaf discoloration and loss of fruiting bodies, all of which lead to reduced crop yields Atlox is a dispersant that helpssuspend higher concentrations of particles the micronutrients in liquid formulations, therefore delivering better crop protection products for use inagrochemical manufacturing As a result our customers manufacturing process is more efficient and less energy intensive, water consumption is reduced and less packaging is required The Croda solution Micronutrient formulations should be highly concentrated, with many particles in a formulation Producing these formulations can be challenging, assplitting and solidifying is a common occurrence Additionally, the chemistry of micronutrients tends tobe incompatible with products such as herbicides Using Atlox, customers can: incorporate higher levelsof micronutrients within their formulation: more easily combine micronutrient formulations with otherplant protective products: and gain the added benefit ofimproving the shelf life of formulations Croda International Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 19
