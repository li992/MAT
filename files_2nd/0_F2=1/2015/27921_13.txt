All relevant Group companies hold the requisite interim permissions from the FCA under the new consumer credit regime and have applied, or will apply, for full authorisations under the consumer credit, second charge mortgage and consumer buy-to-let mortgage contract regimes.
Paragon Bank is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA and regulated by the PRA and the FCA.
The Group is subject to consolidated supervision by the PRA.
The current and projected rate of regulatory change, driven by domestic and European policy, is significant, as further aspects of the Basel III supervisory regime are rolled out and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision consults on further changes.
The governance and control structure within Paragon Bank and the wider Group has been established and developed to ensure that the impacts of new requirements on the business are clearly understood and planned for.
Regular reports on key regulatory developments are therefore received at both executive and board risk committees.
A3.3 FUNDING REVIEW During the year the Group has continued to pursue its funding strategy of broadening its asset specific financing channels and enhancing its central debt capacity while making increased use of retail savings funding to take advantage of the defensive attributes of this form of funding.
The Groups funding at 30 September 2015 is summarised as follows: 2015 2014 2013 m m m Paragon Mortgages 9,597.1 9,367.8 9,204.4 Idem Capital 102.9 145.1 - Paragon Bank 708.7 60.1 - Business specific funding 10,408.7 9,573.0 9,204.2 Corporate borrowings 404.9 293.2 169.1 10,813.6 9,866.2 9,373.5 Funding markets have been dominated by three key themes during the financial year: the launch of the ECBs quantitative easing programme, the renegotiation of Greeces funding arrangements with the ECB and IMF and concerns surrounding US interest rates.
These themes were most pronounced in the latter six months of the financial year.
Paragon Mortgages funding Buy-to-let mortgage originations outside of Paragon Bank are initially funded through four revolving warehouse facilities totalling 950.0 million at 30 September 2015 2014: 550.0 million.
Existing facilities with Lloyds Bank and Macquarie Bank were increased by 200.0 million in total during the year and a further facility of 200.0 million was agreed with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
This enhanced capacity within the Group, together with the option of using Paragon Bank funding supports the Groups growth plans in the buy-to-let market.
In the longer term buy-to-let mortgage loans are funded through the securitisation markets.
Three new public securitisation deals totalling 828.7 million, with senior notes rated AAA were completed in the year.
In order to diversify its funding beyond the sterling market, the Group included euro denominated tranches on its Paragon Mortgages No.
22 PLC and Paragon Mortgages No.
23 PLC transactions, and these tranches were successfully placed with euro investors.
The Groups 62nd transaction, Paragon Mortgages No.
24 PLC PM24, for 350.1 million, completed post year-end.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 35 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Strategic Report STRATEGIC REPORT The Groups public securitisations in the current year, the previous year and post year-end are summarised below.
Securitisation Amount raised Date Average funding m margin basis points Paragon Mortgages No.
24 PLC 350.1 November 2015 175 Paragon Mortgages No.
23 PLC 292.5 July 2015 123 Paragon Mortgages No.
22 PLC 292.5 March 2015 95 Paragon Mortgages No.
21 PLC 243.7 November 2014 88 Paragon Mortgages No.
20 PLC 343.0 July 2014 70 Paragon Mortgages No.
19 PLC 343.0 March 2014 90 During the first six months of the financial year, sterling credit markets were favourable, with swap spreads stable and gilt yields declining to historical lows as inflation expectations reduced.
The improved funding backdrop led to an increase in note issuance which was increasingly backed by non-conforming assets and offered to investors at a higher margin than the Groups issuance.
This increase in supply led to margins on new issues widening significantly as the year progressed.
PM24 priced in difficult market conditions, reflecting an expectation of increased issuance.
In recent months several very large mortgage portfolio sales have taken place, with more expected to follow.
We understand that bond investors expect these transactions to be refinanced through the securitisation market during 2016, resulting in substantial additional supply of issuance.
This in turn has led to an assumption that wider margins will be needed to achieve that volume, substantially in excess of those at which PM24 was priced, and this expectation has led to higher present margins being demanded by investors on new issues.
The Group has significant warehouse capacity and intends to expand the proportion of its buy-to-let advances funded by Paragon Bank, providing the Group with options regarding the timing of its next securitisation transaction.
Alternative markets for Paragon Mortgages funding to the traditional sterling investor base will continue to be rigorously assessed in the interim, including the potential for US dollar issuance.
Idem Capital funding Following the year end, in October 2015, an Idem Capital special purpose vehicle company SPV entered into an agreement to issue 117.3 million of sterling floating rate notes to Citibank NA.
These notes bear interest at a rate of one month LIBOR plus 3.5% and the funds raised were used to re-finance existing Idem Capital unsecured loan assets, previously funded intra-group and through an existing SPV, and are secured on those assets.
The transaction raised net new funding of 65.5 million and, following the transaction, 37.9% of Idem Capitals loan investment balances by value at 30 September 2015 were externally funded.
The new borrowings bear interest at a lower rate than the funding they replace and the increase in structured borrowings, on a limited recourse basis, represents a development in funding for Idem Capital, broadening its sources of finance and demonstrating its ability to access third party funding on a more regular basis, offering greater flexibility to the business.
Paragon Bank funding The Bank currently targets the UK savings market and deposits are accepted over the internet and processed by a highly automated system with significant scope for future expansion.
Initially deposits accepted by the Bank were used to finance its car finance lending operations, expanding into secured lending and increasingly into buy-to-let during the year.
By 30 September 2015 Paragon Bank held deposits of 708.7 million 2014: 60.1 million.
PAGE 36 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Strategic Report Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT Savings balances at the year end are analysed below.
Following the year end savings deposits were used to finance a large part of the cash requirement for the Five Arrows Leasing Group acquisition, with balances having exceeded 950 million by the date of this report.
With the Bank expected to contribute increasingly to the Groups originations, the scale of its deposit-taking activities is expected to expand materially over the next few years.
Corporate funding While the Groups working capital has been primarily provided by equity since 2008, in recent years it has expanded its use of corporate debt funding, allowing it to diversify its funding base and extend the tenor of its borrowings.
The Group is now rated by Fitch Ratings, which has ascribed it an initial BBBrating.
With a strategy to increase holding company leverage levels over time, the rating will support long dated corporate debt issuance in both scale and pricing terms.
The achievement of this investment grade rating represents a further significant development in the Groups growth and diversification strategy.
The concerns in the funding markets from mid-year onwards also impacted the retail bond market, with demand more subdued than in previous years.
Nonetheless, in August 2015, the Group issued 112.5 million of 6.0% sterling bonds due August 2024.
The bonds, listed on the London Stock Exchange Order Book for Retail Bonds ORB, were issued to provide additional working capital for the Group.
This was the third transaction under a 1.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme announced in January 2013 and renewed to allow further issuance in October 2014.
This brought the total issued under the programme to 297.5 million.
Further information on all of the above borrowings is given in note 50.
The additional sources of finance for the Group, together with the Fitch rating, extend and diversify its funding sources, better placing it to support future growth.
In the medium term, the Group is targeting a balance between securitised and retail deposit funding for its new lending activities.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 37 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Strategic Report STRATEGIC REPORT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Group has continued to enjoy strong cash generation during the year.
Free cash balances were 199.9 million at the year-end 30 September 2014: 177.3 million note 38 after investments to support the growth of Paragon Bank, new buy-to-let originations and acquisitions by Idem Capital.
The Company sees opportunities going forward to deploy capital for new lending activities, which should continue to increase, both in the Bank and in the wider group, to invest further amounts in loan portfolios through Idem Capital as banks and other financial institutions continue to dispose of assets and potentially to invest in corporate acquisitions.
These cash balances, together with future operational cash flow, will support the Groups growth through investment in these areas.
In view of the strong position of the Group and its confidence in the prospects for the business, the Board is proposing, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 11 February 2016, a final dividend of 7.4p per share which, when added to the interim dividend of 3.6p, gives a total dividend of 11.0p per share for the year.
This represents an increase of 22.2% from 2014, bringing the dividend cover to 3.2 times 2014: 3.5 times note 6.
The Groups dividend policy, established in 2012, is to target a cover ratio of 3.0 to 3.5 times by 2016 and it will continue to target reductions in the cover ratio to the lower end of the target range by 2016.
The PRA supervision of the Group referred to above imposes capital adequacy rules upon it.
The Group maintains extremely strong capital and leverage ratios, with a CET1 ratio of 19.1% at 30 September 2015 2014: 19.9% and a leverage ratio at 7.7% 2014: 8.3% note 6 leaving the Groups capital at 30 September 2015 comfortably in excess of the regulatory requirement.
Following the acquisition of Five Arrows Leasing Group after the year end, the CET1 ratio will reduce by a little over two percentage points, the final amount to be determined as part of the acquisition accounting.
The Board keeps under review the appropriate level of capital for the business to meet its operational requirements and strategic development objectives.
The strength of the Paragon Mortgages and Idem Capital businesses, the diversification which has been achieved in the funding base in recent years and the further opportunities for growth and sustainability provided by Paragon Bank, have now created the foundations on which to develop the Groups next phase of growth.
An analysis of the Groups central funding between corporate debt and equity note 6 is shown below: Given the strong capital base and low leverage in the Companys balance sheet, the Board has determined that the Group should seek to utilise greater levels of debt to support growth and reduce its over-reliance on equity capital, improving returns for shareholders.
To enhance this strategy the Group regularly reviews the opportunities available to it to access the sterling senior unsecured debt market and the UK retail bond market to add incremental long-dated debt to the Group balance sheet.
