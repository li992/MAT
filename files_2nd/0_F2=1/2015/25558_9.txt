The total value of the Groups 95 non-platform portfolio companies, calculated by reference to the Groups holding in such companies and grossed up to reflect their total value, is now in excess of 2.5bn, or approximately 3.0bn including the Groups four holdings in multi-sector platform companies e. g.

20 IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:01 PM Strategic Report Our Performance Portfolio analysis by sector The Group funds spin-out companies based on a wide variety of scientific research emerging from leading research intensive institutions and does not limit itself to funding companies from particular areas of science.
The Group splits its core opportunity evaluation and business building team into four specialist divisions, Biotech, Cleantech, Healthcare and Technology.
Where the Group invests in businesses that cannot be classified within these divisions, primarily those portfolio companies which also invest in other opportunities, they are recorded in a separate sector as shown below.
Together these five sectors make up the university partnership business segment.
An update on the other two operating segments is included in the financial review on pages 30 to 33.
As can be seen from the table, the Groups portfolio by number of companies is well diversified across its four main sectors.
By fair value, however, the portfolio is currently more concentrated in the healthcare sector, largely as a result of the relative valuations of the Groups holdings in Oxford Nanopore Technologies Limited, hVIVO plc and Tissue Regenix Group plc.
A more detailed analysis of each sector follows.
