Details of 2015 grant The PSP remains the primary long-term incentive plan for senior executives and under the revised remuneration policy will become our sole long-term incentive plan.
Awards were granted to executive directors equal to 100% of base salary which equals 50,700 awards 524,998 for James Drummond, 50,900 awards 564,990 for Peter Ventress and 31,549 awards 350,193 for Kevin Quinn.
Peters 2015 awards lapsed on 29 April 2015.
James 2015 award was granted following his appointment on 6 August 2015.
Vesting of these awards is subject to two performance conditions that operate independently of each other.
Half of an award was based upon a performance condition relating to adjusted EPS and the other half was based upon weighted average post-tax ROIC.
Both performance conditions are measured over a three-year performance period.
To the extent that awards vest, the directors would receive the benefit of any dividends paid over the vesting period in the form of share-based dividend equivalents.
In return for investment shares which can be worth up to a maximum of 35% of base salary per annum being invested into the CIP, the director was granted a matching award over company shares that matches the number of investment shares on a 2:1pre-tax basis.
Matching awards were subject to the same performance conditions and with the same right to receive a dividend equivalent, as PSP awards.
Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn invested shares amounting to 35% of base salary and were granted 71,260 and 44,168 matching awards respectively.
Under the revised remuneration policy, there will be no further grants under the CIP.
