3 Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were: Deposit Proved Ore Reserves Probable Ore Reserves Leinster 25m x 25m 25m x 50m Mt Keith 60m x 40m 80m x 80m Cliffs 25m x 25m and development 50m x 50m 4 Ore delivered to process plant.
5 Metallurgical recoveries for the operations for FY2015 were: Deposit Metallurgical Recovery Leinster Concentrator including Cliffs 84% at 8% concentrate grade Mt Keith 58% at 17% concentrate grade Metallurgical recoveries differ from the recovery assumptions applied to generate the Ore Reserves due to variable ore quality.
6 Leinster Reassessment of Rockys Reward Cutback 2 was being undertaken at the time of reporting.
7 Mt Keith Decrease in Ore Reserves due to the exclusion of Stage H2 as a result of lower nickel prices.
