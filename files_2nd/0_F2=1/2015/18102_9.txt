Business model Circassias business follows a focused and efficient outsourced model.
We retain key functions in-house: notably strategy, intellectual property, clinical study design, regulatory affairs and commercialisation, which we leverage across our allergy, NIOX and particle-engineered respiratory product franchises.
To complement these in-house skills we draw on third-party experts, outsourcing non-core activities to well-established contract research organisations, manufacturers and commercial partners in territories beyond our core markets.
