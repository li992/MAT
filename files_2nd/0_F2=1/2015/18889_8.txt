Marketing costs were higher by 30.4% reflecting our investment in customer acquisition and payments to our employees in support of the multi-channel programme.
In 2016, we expect UK Retail operating costs to increase by c. 2-3% taking account of a continued attractive rental market, staff costs increases including the impact of the National Living Wage being introduced in March 2016 as well as voluntary single scheduling, and the small reduction in the estate planned for 2016.
