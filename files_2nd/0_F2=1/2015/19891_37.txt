a For the three business-focused performance measures, 25% of target awards vest for achieving threshold performance.
200% of target awards vest capped at 150% under the MCIP for maximum performance.
b For the relative TSR measure, Unilevers TSR is measured against a comparator group of other consumer goods companies.
TSR measures the return received by a shareholder, capturing both the increase in share price and the value of dividend income assuming dividends are reinvested.
The TSR results are measured on a common currency basis to better reflect the shareholder experience.
The current TSR peer group is as follows: Avon Colgate-Palmolive Henkel LOral Reckitt Benckiser Beiersdorf Danone Kao Nestl Shiseido Campbell Soup General Mills Kelloggs PepsiCo Coca-Cola Este Lauder Kimberly-Clark Procter & Gamble The TSR comparator group consists of 18 companies 19 including Unilever.
No shares in the portion of the award subject to TSR vest if Unilever is ranked below position 10 in the peer group at the end of the three-year period, 50% vests if Unilever is ranked 10th, 100% vests if Unilever is ranked 7th and 200% 150% under the MCIP vests if Unilever is ranked 3rd or above.
Straight-line vesting occurs between these points.
The Committee may change the TSR vesting levels set out above if the number of companies in the TSR comparator group changes.
ULTIMATE REMEDY MALUS Grants under the GSIP and MCIP are subject to ultimate remedy.
Upon vesting of an award, the Committee shall have the discretionary power to adjust the value of the award if the award, in the Committees opinion taking all circumstances into account, produces an unfair result.
In exercising this discretion, the Committee may take into account Unilevers performance against non-financial measures.
The Committee will only adjust the value of a vesting GSIP and MCIP award upwards after obtaining shareholder consent.
With effect from the 2015 GSIP and MCIP awards, the Committee may apply malus to reduce an award or determine that it will not vest or only vest in part in the event of a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever, gross misconduct or gross negligence, material breach of Unilevers Code of Business Principles or any of the Unilever Code Policies or conduct by the individual that results in significant losses or serious reputational damage to Unilever.
The annual bonus will also be subject to malus on the same grounds as apply for GSIP and MCIP awards.
CLAW-BACK The Committee has discretion to reclaim or claw-back some or all of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors in the event of a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever.
This includes the annual bonus together with any awards that have been made and or vested shares under the Share Matching Plan, the GSIP and the MCIP.
This claw-back may be effected up to two years from vesting by reducing outstanding awards or requiring the return of the net value of vested awards to Unilever.
In 2015, the Committee did not reclaim or claw-back any of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors.
