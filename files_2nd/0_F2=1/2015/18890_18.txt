BUYOUT AWARD FOR TONY QUINLAN A buyout package for incentives foregone in respect of Tony Quinlans role at Drax Group plc was provided to facilitate his recruitment as Chief Financial Officer.
In line with the Companys recruitment policy, when determining the package the Committee considered the structure of Draxs incentive arrangements, the proportion of the relevant performance periods completed, the associated performance conditions and the likelihood of vesting.
The Committee determined that Tony Quinlan would be entitled to participate in Lairds Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in respect of 2015.
His maximum award for 2015 was set at 140% of salary and pay-out would be determined in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy and the performance conditions for the year pages 65 to 67 set out the bonus assessment for the Executive Directors for 2015.
Tony Quinlan forfeited his bonus opportunity at Drax for the 2015 Financial Year.
Therefore, as part of the terms agreed on recruitment, the Committee determined that his bonus opportunity at Laird for 2015 would not be pro-rated.
It should be noted that Jonathan Silver did not receive a bonus for the period of the 2015 Financial Year he worked.
In addition, in line with Lairds recruitment policy, the Committee determined that Tony Quinlan would be granted nilcost options over 147,804 Laird Shares as part of the buyout arrangements.
The award was granted on 1 July 2015 and was made in six parts, as set out in the table below.
The Committee determined the buyout share package on a fair value basis with new time vesting conditions i. e. taking into account any performance measures and expected performance outcomes at the date of the buyout, or that buyout shares would be awarded with time-based vesting conditions where there were no performance conditions on the awards forfeited, or that buyout shares should be granted subject to new performance conditions.

At the time of recruitment the total value of buyout shares was limited to 525,000.
This was converted into replacement share awards of 147,804 Laird PLC ordinary shares using a share price of 355.2 pence per share.
The face value of the replacement shares was calculated using the closing mid-market share price of 372.2 pence per share on 1 July 2015, the date Tony Quinlan joined the Company and the date the awards were granted.
The normal vesting date for the award is shown in the table above, provided that the Company is not in a prohibited share dealing period.
