Governance Termination policy The committees approach, when considering payments in the event of termination, is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, any contractual or other legal obligations, and the relevant share plan and pension scheme rules.
The overriding principle is that there should be no reward for failure.
While the treatment applied is at the discretion of the committee, in normal circumstances the application is tabulated below.

Service contracts and notice periods It is the policy that executive directors have service contracts with the company which may be terminated with not less than 12 months notice given by the company or by the executive.
The committee retains the discretion to appoint a new executive director on a notice period of up to 24 months reducing to 12 months during the first year, such that after 12 months service the notice period would have reverted to the standard 12 months.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but serve the company under letters of appointment which may be terminated without liability for compensation.
