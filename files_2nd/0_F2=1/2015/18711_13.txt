Strategic report Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Strategic report Financial Review Outlook Financial Review Our established businesses are progressing in line with our expectations and we expect the Group to deliver good growth in 2016.
In the UK, we expect our business to be stable with growth being driven by our international businesses.
Increased customer acquisition investment and a weaker Euro are expected to reduce profits in France, however this will be more than offset by strong growth in the USA and Spain.
We plan to invest around 6m in New Markets principally in relation to innovation initiatives.
