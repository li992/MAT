80 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration The information set out in this section has been subject to audit except where specified.
Single total figure of remuneration Executive directors The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the current executive directors, in respect of the years ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2015.
The single figure of remuneration relating to the time each served as an executive director is set out in the following table.
Brian Cassins annual salary was 462,500 at 1 April 2014 and increased to 850,000 on his appointment as CEO.

Lloyd Pitchford received a cash supplement of 52,500 in 2015 in lieu of his pension contribution.
Don Robert received an accommodation allowance of 250,000 in 2014.
This allowance continued up to the time he ceased to be an executive director on 16 July 2014 and the amount paid to him in respect of this benefit in 2015 was 74,038.
3 Annual bonus Awarded for each of the years ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2015.
The Committee set targets for the annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2015 based on profit growth, which required stretching levels of performance to earn the maximum bonus.
The Committee considered a profit growth metric to be appropriate as it reflects one of Experians key performance indicators EBIT.
The Committee has not disclosed the annual bonus target calibration for the year ended 31 March 2015, as it considers that this single financial metric continues to be commercially sensitive.
Whilst we acknowledge that certain shareholders would like targets to be disclosed, the Committee believes that this is not in shareholders longer-term interests given that it could be damaging to the Company and useful to our competitors.
If the Committee decides that targets have ceased to be commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed in the next available remuneration report.
Target for the annual bonus is generally set around the budget for the relevant financial year.
In setting the level of attainment required for maximum bonus payment, the Committee considers internal expectations and external market conditions and refers to benchmarks such as broker earnings estimates, earnings estimates for competitors and peers and internal budgets and forecasts to establish a performance range that is stretching but incentivising.
In determining the outcome for the annual bonus, the payment is reviewed in the context of the overall business performance to ensure an appropriate correlation between this and the payments made.
The Benchmark PBT growth, for bonus purposes, was 4%.
In the context of the Groups underlying performance, the Committee determined that a bonus payout equivalent to 75% of salary as against a maximum payout of 200% was appropriate for the executive directors.
Brian Cassin will be paid a bonus of 551,430 based on his annual salary of 462,500 for the period between 1 April 2014 and 16 July 2014, and 850,000 from his appointment as CEO until 31 March 2015.
Kerry Williams will be paid a bonus of US$475,096 based on an annual salary of US$900,000, pro-rated for his time on the Board.
These equate to 75% of target.
On his appointment, the Committee agreed to compensate Lloyd Pitchford for the annual bonus he was forfeiting from his previous employer, by an amount equivalent to a target bonus payment under his previous plan, pro-rated for time, which equated to 343,500.
In addition, as an executive director of Experian between 1 October 2014 and 31 March 2015, he earned a bonus of 75% of target, which, when pro-rated for time, equates to 196,875.
In aggregate, therefore, his 2015 bonus will be 540,375.
The executive directors have all made the maximum deferral, invested in Experian shares invested shares, under the CIP, of 100% of their annual bonuses.
The deferred bonuses are matched, on a gross basis, with an award of shares matching shares with a value of two times the gross bonus deferred.
The release of invested shares and matching shares is deferred for three years and the release of the matching shares is subject to performance conditions which are measured over that period and continued service.
Don Robert ceased to be an executive director in July 2014 and was not eligible to participate in the annual bonus plan in 2015.
Chris Callero stepped down from the Board but continued to be employed by Experian until 31 March 2015.
The 2015 figure in the table is the annual bonus he earned in the year ended 31 March 2015 pro-rated for the time served as an executive director US$225,447.
82 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued 4 Share-based incentives The amount included in the single total figure of remuneration is the combined value of the CIP and PSP awards.
For 2014 these awards were granted on 15 June 2011 and for 2015 they were granted on 18 May 2012.
Vesting in 2015 for both the CIP and PSP awards depended on performance over the three years ended 31 March 2015 and continued service.
Brian Cassin joined Experian in April 2012 and so was not eligible to participate in the CIP in that year.
The 2015 figure shown for Brian Cassin, therefore, relates to the PSP award granted to him in May 2012.
The figure shown for Kerry Williams for 2015 relates to the CIP award and the PSP award granted to him in May 2012.
Details of the value of these awards are given below.
The value of the share awards realised by Don Robert and Chris Callero in 2014 was originally calculated using the average share price from 1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014 of 10.83, as an estimate before the actual vesting date, in accordance with the prescribed single figure methodology.
The actual share price on the vesting date was 10.05 and so the 2014 figures in the table have been revised to reflect this.
The 2014 figure for Don Robert was US$11.990m and has been revised to US$11.434m, whilst for Chris Callero it was US$7.685m and has been revised to US$7.329m.
The performance achieved against the performance targets for CIP and PSP awards granted in May 2012 is shown in the following tables.
CIP awards 1 Vesting Percentage of total award 2 Performance measure Weighting No match 1:1 match 2:1 match Actual vesting Benchmark PBT annual growth 50% Below 7% 7% 14% 8.7% 31.0% Below 3 Cumulative operating cash flow 50% US$3.4bn US$3.4bn US$3.7bn US$3.9bn 50.0% Total 81.0% 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 The maximum opportunity was a 2:1 match on the bonus deferred.
3 In line with the performance framework of the CIP and the operation of the plan in any given year, the Committee has taken into account the impact of certain factors outside of managements control in determining the outcome of the cash flow element, in order to maintain the degree of difficulty intended when the original targets of US$3.7bn US$4.1bn were set.
These factors include the impact of acquisitions and disposals over the performance period, and the effect of foreign exchange movements.
Such adjustments are consistent with the calculation of PBT for incentive plan purposes where this metric is calculated on a constant currency basis.
Our standard approach continues to be to make appropriate adjustments to the target range rather than actual performance to aid transparency to shareholders.
The revised targets shown above reflect an increase of approximately US$60m to reflect the impact of a number of acquisitions made over the performance period: a reduction of approximately US$160m as a result of a major disposal made in the early part of the performance period: and a reduction of approximately US$260m to allow for the effect of foreign exchange movements, in particular the movement in the US dollar Brazilian real exchange rate where the average exchange rate over the performance period was approximately 30% weaker than that used at the time the target was set.
PSP awards 1 Vesting Percentage of total award 2,3 Performance measure Weighting 0% 25% 100% Actual vesting Benchmark PBT annual growth 75% Below 7% 7% 14% 8.7% 32.4% Below Equal 25% TSR of Experian vs TSR of FTSE 100 Index 25% Index to Index above Index 2.2% 7.8% Total 40.2% 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 The maximum opportunity was the original award with a face value of 200% of salary.
3 Vesting of the PSP awards was also subject to the Committee agreeing that the return on capital employed ROCE performance over the performance period was satisfactory.
As these awards had not vested at the date this report was finalised, the value of the awards shown below is based on the average share price of the last three months of the financial year, which was 11.54, representing a 33% increase from the date of grant.
The value of the awards, as included in the single total figure of remuneration, is set out in the following table.

Dividend equivalents of 106.25 US cents per share will be paid in cash on vested shares.
These represent the value of the dividends that would have been paid to the owner of one share between the date of grant and the date of vesting.
The following dividend equivalent cash sums will be paid.
Value of dividend equivalent cash amount Brian Cassin 27,145 Kerry Williams US$141,267 5 Pension Brian Cassin participates in a defined contribution plan and the Company contribution to this was 32,285.
Lloyd Pitchford is eligible to participate in the same plan but elected not to do so during the year ended 31 March 2015.
Kerry Williams participates in a defined contribution plan 401k and the Company contribution from the date of his joining the Board to 31 March 2015 was US$8,307.
Chris Callero was eligible to participate in the same plan but did not do so for the period from 1 April 2014 to 16 July 2014 when he stepped down from the Board.
Don Robert is provided with benefits through a Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan SERP which is a defined benefit arrangement in the USA.
The table below shows Don Roberts defined benefit pension entitlements in respect of benefits from registered schemes and non-registered arrangements.
Closing accrued Opening accrued Pension input amount pension at pension at net of directors Age at 16 July 2014 1 April 2014 contributions Name 31 March 2015 US$000 pa US$000 pa US$000 pa Don Robert 55 598 684 Accrued pension represents the deferred pension to which Don Robert was entitled had he left the Group at either the opening or closing date.
The pension input amount represents the pension entitlement built up during the period using the HMRC calculation method.
Although Don Roberts Normal Retirement Age was 60 he elected to take early payment after stepping down as CEO.
As a result the pension benefit was reduced to 598,029 per annum, as per the closing date, and therefore there was no pension input amount in the year.
The pension input amount net of directors contributions for the prior five years was as follows: 2014: US$1,187,000 2013: US$807,000 2012: US$869,000 2011: US$952,000 2010: US$726,000 Three former directors of Experian Finance plc formerly GUS plc receive unfunded pensions from the Company.
Two of the former directors are now paid under the Secured Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme, which provides security for the unfunded pensions of executives affected by the HMRC earnings cap.
The total unfunded pensions paid to the former directors was 395,208 in the year ended 31 March 2015.
84 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Chairmen and non-executive directors The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for each of the Chairmen and non-executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2015.
He receives a private healthcare benefit.
As CEO, Don Robert was granted shares under the CIP and PSP in 2012 which will vest on 18 May 2015, when he is no longer CEO, and are therefore included in the table above.
As these awards had not vested at the date this report was finalised, the value of the awards is based on the average share price of the last three months of the financial year, which was 11.54.
The number of shares vesting, as a result of the outcome of the relevant performance conditions, as detailed in the previous section, and their associated value is as follows.
CIP PSP Shares Shares Shares Shares Value of awarded vesting awarded vesting shares vesting Don Robert 423,994 343,647 170,381 68,577 4,757m Don Robert was originally awarded 219,063 shares under the PSP and these were adjusted on a pro-rata basis to 170,381 when he ceased to be an executive director.
No adjustment was made to the matching shares awarded under the CIP.
This treatment was in line with the rules of the Plans.
Dividend equivalents of 66.59 pence per share will be paid on the vested shares and a dividend equivalent cash sum of 274,512 is therefore payable to Don Robert and is included in the main table above.
2 Sir John Peace retired from the Board on 16 July 2014.
He received a company car benefit and private healthcare up to that time.
3 Jan Babiak joined the Board on 29 April 2014.
4 Alan Jebson retired as Audit Committee Chairman on 21 January 2015 and accordingly his annual fee was reduced to 132,500.
He was replaced in that role by Deirdre Mahlan, whose annual fee was increased to 172,500.
5 G eorge Rose was appointed Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director on 16 July 2014 and accordingly his annual fee was increased from 132,500 to 212,500.
6 Sir Alan Rudge retired from the Board on 16 July 2014.
7 In July 2014, the Irish Revenue Commissioners issued guidance that certain travel and subsistence expenses for non-executive directors were to be treated as taxable.
Subsequently, in November 2014, it was confirmed by the Minister of Finance in the Irish parliament that the taxation of such expenses would be reviewed by the Irish Revenue Commissioners in 2015.
This review is underway and, given that the outcome is, at the date of the Annual Report, unknown, the relevant expenses for the year ended 31 March 2015 are not disclosed as benefits in the table above.
Should the outcome of the announced review confirm that such expenses are taxable, appropriate disclosure will be made in the 2016 Annual report on remuneration.
