Fees received by the directors in their capacity as directors of these companies are retained, reecting the personal responsibility they undertake in these roles.
For the period of his directorship, Guy Berruyer was a Non-executive Director of Meggitt Plc.
The Board recognises the significant demands that are made on executive and non-executive directors and has therefore adopted a policy that no executive director should hold more than two directorships of other listed companies.
The Board encourages executive directors to limit other directorships to one listed company.
Except in exceptional circumstances where approved in advance by the Chairman of the Commiee, if an executive director holds non-executive positions at more than one listed company then only the fees from one such company will be retained by the director.
No formal limit on other board appointments applies to non-executive directors under the policy but prior approval not to be unreasonably withheld from the Chairman on behalf of the Board is required in the case of any new appointment.
In the case of the Chairman, prior approval of the Nomination Committee is required on behalf of the Board.
