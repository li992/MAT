In the four year period that we have been at Curzon Street, London funds under management have grown from 8.9 billion to 16.5 billion as at 31 December 2015.

In early 2017, Rathbones head office will move from its 44,000 sq ft space at 1 Curzon Street to a 75,000 sq ft space at new development, 8 Finsbury Circus.
We believe with its quality architecture and strong transport links, 8 Finsbury Circus will provide a welcoming environment for our clients.
Crucially, it will also allow all of our London-based staff to work together under one roof whilst also creating capacity for future growth.
Liverpool During 2015, we expanded our office space in Liverpool by approximately 18%, adding a further 12,000 sq ft to our existing 65,000 sq ft in the Port of Liverpool Building.
