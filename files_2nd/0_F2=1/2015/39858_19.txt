22.5% Change of accounting policy for the Loan-to-value Longmartin joint venture The Group is adopting IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements for the first time this year.
This standard removes the proportionate 1.7% consolidation option that was previously available under IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and instead requires us to account for the joint venture using the equity method.
The consequence 168.0p is that we now include the Groups net equity interest in Longmartin as a single line item in both the consolidated balance Basic EPS sheet and consolidated income statement, rather than proportionally consolidating the Groups share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Loans, 22.5% interest and management fees between the Group and Longmartin are no longer eliminated on consolidation.
Whilst this change in accounting policy does not affect the net 8.32 asset position nor profit after tax, it does alter the line-by-line analysis in the primary statements and the cash and cash Diluted NAV equivalents reported in the Cash Flow Statement.
The prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly, and the changes are summarised in note 2 to the Financial Statements.
