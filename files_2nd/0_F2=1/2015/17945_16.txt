As with other companies within our industry, A helicopter-sharing first BP is taking measures to respond to the impact of a lower-price environment by When changing crews on board BPs Skarv limiting capital spend, looking to benefit from platform in the Norwegian North Sea, a cost deflation and reducing headcount.
In helicopter flies the replacement team offshore addition, for some time we have been and brings the current team back to land.
On encouraging everyone in BP to find and these journeys an average of six of the 19 implement smarter ways of working, without seats were unused.
We discovered that nearby compromising safety.
From large-scale operator, Statoil, was in the same situation and behaviour changes to small and simple ideas, so looked for opportunities to maximize seat our employees are helping to make a positive usage on our journeys.
Statoil offered BP a difference to the reliability and efficiency of 50% share in its contracted helicopter capacity our operations.
and the companies entered into a cost-sharing agreement for scheduled flights.
With fewer flights offshore we have reduced costs and CO emissions.
2 Easing the bottleneck The Cherry Point refinery rail facility receives crudes directly from US and Canadian producers.
But with only two tracks available, the mile-long trains often had to wait to offload their oil supply.
This prevented the refinery from maximizing its rail offloading efficiency.
Teams at the site, along Foundations for success with the supply organization, worked to resolve the problem by installing additional track to BP drilling and cementing teams in Azerbaijan reduce congestion and allow full utilization of regularly review well design and construction the rail facility.
In 2015 we safely executed this to ensure they are safe, efficient and reliable.

The oil and water are pumped away, leaving the sediment to be easily cleaned up in the final manual cleaning step.
Since the process was implemented at the Rotterdam refinery in 2015, it has significantly reduced cleaning times from 9-12 months down to three, reduced risks to cleaners and saved more than $3 million.
It is now being adopted across BP with further savings expected.
Logistics planning Making storage simpler Driving supply boats to our offshore Egypt rigs Throughout more than 50 years of operations in can consume a lot of fuel.
Through detailed the North Sea, BP had built up large quantities of logistics planning we calculated that a 25% equipment that were spread around 172 locations, reduction in speed consumed about 40% less with significant storage fees and long lead times fuel per trip.
We also found that keeping a vessel to get these materials offshore.
By updating and outside the 500 metre rig zone required less improving our materials management process we engine power than the full dynamic positioning reduced the number of stored inventory items by mode needed within it, and this reduced fuel half and brought the number of storage locations consumption by around 80%.
We have applied down by about 65%.
We also generated around these changes across the regions fleet and are $32 million by selling surplus materials and scrap.

We are sharing this cost-saving approach globally.
