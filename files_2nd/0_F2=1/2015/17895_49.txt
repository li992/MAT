The above table has been subject to audit.
The current UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme ExPS and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1 30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8%.
Benets paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1 30th of Final Pensionable Pay FPP for each year of ExPS pensionable service subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP.
FPP is dened as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouses death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age.
Childrens allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 18.
Spouses pensions and childrens allowances are also payable upon death inretirement and death after leaving the Companys employment with a deferred pension.
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benets should continue to be based on the Companys registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance introduced in 2006 and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance.
The current UK executive directors were given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise: they both elected for the latter.
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company isto pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given afurther opportunity to commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
As stated above, Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from the Company arising from the 2006 changes to the taxation of pension benets, which has been extended to cover the reduced Annual Allowance at no additional cost to the Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the 2000 Plan, applicable to former employees of Marconi Electronic Systems MES, and members of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62.
The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1 50th of Final Pensionable Earnings FPE for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions.
TheCompany decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006 07 Plan Year to 20% of basesalary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 08 Plan Year and thereafter.
However, there is a guarantee that theFPE gure for benets in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE gure at 5 April 2007 toensurethat employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses.
Ian King and Peter Lynas joined theExPS in1999.
Therefore, their individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 Plan benets plus the top up fromthe ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401 k dened contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which thecompany will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to US regulatory limits for2016 $265,000.
In 2015, the company paid contributions of $15,080 into this arrangement.
