The Directors have therefore adopted the going concern basis of accounting preparing Net debt and capital structure the financial statements.
Net debt in the year increased by 92m FY14: increase of 104m to589m FY14: 497m driven by investment in growth and the acquisitions of blinkbox, Tesco phone and broadband Virgin Media broadband bases.
As a result the net debt to EBITDA ratio increased modestly from 2.3x in FY14 to 2.4x in FY15.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure of the Group and we expect to return to below two times net debt to EBITDA in the medium term.
Accounting developments The adoption of accounting standards in the year, as disclosed innote 1 to the financial statements, has had no material effect onthe financial statements.
