STRATEGIC REPORT: NICKEL Duncan Wanblad NICKEL CEO Base Metals and Minerals Our Nickel business is well placed to serve the global stainless steel industry, which depends on nickel and drives demand for it.
Our assets are in Brazil, with two ferronickel production sites: Barro Alto and Codemin, in the state of Gois.
DRIVING CHANGE DEFINING OUR FUTURE FURNACE REBUILDS AT BARRO ALTO A DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO EVALUATE A SALE COMPLETED BELOW BUDGET AND WITH OF OUR NICKEL BUSINESS DESIGN CAPACITY ACHIEVED Discussions with potential buyers are under way 30 kt production in 2015 EARLY ATTAINMENT OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION 1 DECREASE IN C1 UNIT COSTS AT BARRO ALTO FROM BARRO ALTO IN 2015 Successful furnace rebuilds and ramp-ups executed in 2015, setting the stage to reach a nominal capacity production year in 15% since 2012 pre-rebuild 2016.
Total nickel production including Codemin expected to reach 45,000-47,000 tonnes SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SAFETY Codemin LTI-free since June 2014 over 2.1 million man-hours C1 UNIT COSTS AT BARRO ALTO EXPECTED worked.

Following the successful furnace rebuilds and subsequent ramp-up, Barro Alto C1 unit costs averaged 350 c lb in the last quarter of the year, a significant improvement compared with 2012 pre-rebuild.
This was mainly the result of higher throughput, lower energy consumption owing to higher efficiencies being achieved at the new coal pulverisation plant and efforts to reduce electricity consumption, lower overhead costs and favourable exchange rates.
MARKETS 2015 2014 Average market prices c lb 536 765 Average realised prices c lb 498 731 The average LME nickel cash settlement price decreased by 30% to 536 c lb as the impact of slower Chinese economic growth continued to exert downward pressure on commodity prices.
World stainless steel production the end use for around 65% of all nickel was flat year-on-year, matching 2014s record output.
Nickel pig iron production in China declined by approximately 18%, or 85,000 tonnes, owing to the ongoing Indonesian nickel ore export ban: this led to a near-doubling of Chinese ferronickel imports in 2015, which reached a record high of 137,000 tonnes Ni contained.
This, in turn, resulted in an improvement in ferronickel market fundamentals, and a decrease in ferronickel discounts, through the year.
