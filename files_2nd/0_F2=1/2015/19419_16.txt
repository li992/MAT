Gains were identified within the SZ open pit resources from grade control drilling which replenished mining depletion for the year, while model changes due to infill resource drilling reduced the mineral resources from the NZ, resulting in a 2% net reduction of declared mineral resources year on year.
Ore reserves were partially replenished in the year, principally from grade control gains within the SZ, while ore reserve reductions were identified in the NZ from mining depletion and model changes.
Total ore reserves were thus slightly down year on year.
drilling continues on both the NZ and SZ to test the orebodies below the current pits for possible extensions.
