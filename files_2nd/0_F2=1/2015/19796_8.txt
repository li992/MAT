Our business model Tesco grew into a big business by focusing on the little things.
Not because we developed a highly complex business strategy.
Nor because we developed a radical, revolutionary business model.
We were successful because customers were our number one priority and everything we did was about doing the right thing for them.
Our aim today is to regain that total focus on serving customers.
We have refocused our business under three operational headlines: listening to, understanding and reaching out to customers to create the best possible offer working with growers and suppliers to make great products, and helping to deliver the best value to customers and working across different channels to get those products to customers in the most convenient way possible.
Our aim is to make sure everything in the business is set up in the most efficient way to create value for customers.
By refocusing on these three areas and with the capabilities, reach, insight and skills we have within our business we are uniquely placed to deliver the best offer we can and in doing so earn our customers loyalty.
By creating value for our customers, we will create sustainable value for our shareholders too.
