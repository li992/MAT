Market The UK construction market has continued to recover and is generating an improving pipeline of projects at appropriate margins.
The public sector market depends on the governments ability to finance investment, either directly or by attracting private sector funds.
We saw an improvement in this market in England and Wales ahead of the general election in May 2015, and continued good levels of spending in Scotland, where we are one of the largest contractors.
The regulated sector is driven by five-year investment plans.
Thismarket remained solid, as regulated entities continued to invest in line with their plans.
Better market conditions and our success Private sector work depends on companies having the confidence in securing long-term national frameworks to invest, which is linked to economic conditions, consumer spending and the availability of finance.

These projects included the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the first ever PF2 contract with the EFA, which are discussed under our Infrastructure and Building businesses earlier in thisreport.
The acquisition of Miller Construction gave us a place on the Hub North Scotland framework to add to our existing positions on the South East and South West hubs.
These programmes continue toproduce a healthy pipeline of work, as a result of ourcollaborative approach.
The Miller Construction acquisition also brought with it a team ofexperienced PPP professionals in a market where talent is highly sought after.
06 Outlook There is a pressing need for both social and economic infrastructure, which cannot be financed through public sector capital budgets.
The cost of funding for the private sector is at anall-time low, making this a good time to procure these assets using PPP models.
We believe the PF2 model works well and will allow public sector clients to drive excellent value for money for their projects.
The project pipeline in Scotland and our strengthened position through Miller Construction make us confident about the prospects for PPPInvestments.
