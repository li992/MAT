Through the course of 2015 we continued to closely monitor developments in the OECDs work on Base Erosion and profit Shifting BEPS and Country-By-Country Reporting CBCR.
We do not expect that any of our tax arrangements should be materially impacted by any legislative changes arising from the BEPS recommendations.
However, we recognise that the proposals are not nalised and so we continue to closely follow developments.
