Key performance indicators Our objective is to deliver attractive shareholder returns through the execution of our strategy described on page 20.
We use seven key performance indicators to monitor the performance of the Group and its share of joint ventures.
A number of the key performance indicators are also used to evaluate management performance and remunerate senior employees.
