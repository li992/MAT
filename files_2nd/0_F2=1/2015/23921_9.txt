237135 Finsbury Growth & Inc pp01-pp23 SR 14 12 2015 10:59 Page 15 Finsbury Growth & Income Trust PLC 15 15 Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2015 Strategic Report Investment Themes Although your investment portfolio is best analysed as a collection of individual, more or less unique companies it can also be understood as offering access to three strategic investment ideas.
These three semi-permanent ideas have driven investment performance over the 15 years of our responsibility and we see no reason to give up on them today.
First consumer branded goods, with their predictable cash flows and promise of protection against monetary inflation.
Next media and software: where we try to identify companies with content or services that viewers or users feel they cant do without.
Finally, we participate in the long term health and success of stock markets by investing in strong franchise proxies for wealth creation: the London Stock Exchange itself and several fund management companies.
Astute Company shareholders will note that a common denominator across these three themes is that each is underpinned as much by intellectual as physical capital.
Investment returns earned on ideas do best.
