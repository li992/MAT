Higher selling prices, good cost control, forestry revaluation gains and currency benefits more than offset domestic cost inflation.
Sales volumes were marginally lower than the previous year as a result of an extended 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 planned maintenance shut at our Richards Bay mill.
Strong domestic demand for uncoated fine paper was met by reducing export volumes into the rest of Africa, while export volumes of pulp were increased due to favourable export pricing and weaker Underlying operating profit domestic demand.
million Selling prices for pulp and white-top kraftliner were higher on average than in the previous year for both our domestic market and exports.
For uncoated fine paper, domestic prices were higher on average while US dollar export prices were lower.
Significant currency gains 161m were realised from the effect of the stronger US dollar and euro on export sales volumes.
ROCE Selling price increases were implemented in early 2016 in certain domestic uncoated fine 161 paper segments.
Above inflationary price increases in labour and electricity and the impact of the weaker 112 South African rand on imported materials put pressure on our input costs.
However, a 93 continued focus on improving productivity, driving efficiencies and reducing waste ensured 69 that fixed cost increases were limited.
63 Forestry gains are dependent on a variety of factors over which we have limited control.
In 2015, selling prices of timber increased which, combined with the benefit of the lower average crude oil price, resulted in a fair value gain of 40 million 2014: 34 million being 2015 recognised, of which 23 million was recognised in the first half of the year.
We also 2011 2012 2013 2014 benefited from land sales as we sought to further optimise our forestry operations.
The planned maintenance shut at Richards Bay took place during the first half of 2015.
In 2016, a shorter shut is planned, again for the first half of the year.

At our Richards Bay operations, we have reduced our specific water consumption by 9% compared to 2014.
We are operating below the Level 3 water restriction limits of the Department of Water and Sanitation and will be well below the Level 4 water restriction limits proposed for implementation in March 2016.
We continue to explore opportunities for increasing water recovery from the mills production processes and we are investigating alternative water sourcing options in collaboration with government, industry and agriculture.
We enjoy strong relationships with our customers and received excellent ratings in our recent customer survey for our product and service quality, and professional staff performance.
In response to customer feedback, we improved the way we communicate sustainability information, and we will continue to focus on ensuring consistent, on-time, in-full delivery.

Our productivity has improved by 90% over the last three years.
Safety remains our top priority and we have kept our focus on eliminating incidents.
Among other initiatives, we have made successful use of training videos to highlight safety procedures during maintenance shuts.
