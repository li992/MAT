We set key performance indicators for Winning Teams, Customer Heartbeat, Profitable Growth and Good Together.
Behind each of these headings are clear and measurable targets which together make up our balanced scorecard, or WINcard as we call it Whitbread In Numbers.
A range of factors are taken into consideration when setting targets but, in most cases, the following principles are applied: A green score is achieved where the performance is better than both the prior year and target.
An amber score is for performance which is better than the prior year, but below target.
A red score is for a result below the previous year.
Further detail on each area of value creation and the application of Whitbreads Business Model in Hotels & Restaurants and Costa can be found on pages 12 and 13, and 24 and 25 respectively.
