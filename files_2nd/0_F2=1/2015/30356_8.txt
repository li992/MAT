Just over half of this growth was driven by strong balance growth across mortgages and cards, the rest being a consequence of margin improvements.
The improvement in net interest margin NIM to 1.65% in 2015 was mainly driven by management of the retail cost of funds, against a background of falling deposit interest rates across the market.
Increasing the use of cost effective wholesale funding also contributed to NIM improvement.
Thiswas partially offset by pressure on mortgage pricing across that market, mitigated by our focus on higher yielding segments within ourrisk appetite.
Lastly, although the margin on our credit card book reduced as expected given the growth in the number of front book customers, at a group level having proportionately more credit cards drives a higher NIM.
Other income was 7% or 5.1 million lower at 67.0 million, primarily driven by the anticipated absence of card origination commissions aswe changed our business model.
Overall, ourcards business contribution increased.

With costs including the FSCS levy of 332.5 million in 2015, cost growth during the year was limited to 5% despite a 15% increase in total customer balances, whilst maintaining levels of investment spend.
This combined with our income increase of 19% produces positive JAWS at 14% and drove the cost:income ratio down by 8.9 percentage points to 63.6%.

This stability reflected the continued high asset quality of the loan portfolio and a further reduction in the low level of defaults.
The impairment charge for credit cards, before debt sales, increased broadly in line with the size of the book.
Net of debt sale recoveries, the charge increased by 87% to 27.3 million.
In addition to book growth, this was a consequence of 2014 including the sale of charged-off credit card balances from both 2013 and 2014.
The resulting cost of risk for credit cards net of debt sale recoveries increased by 49bps to 2.00% in 2015, from 1.51% in 2014.
Impaired loans as a percentage of loans and advances reduced to 0.4% at 31 December 2015 from 0.5% at 31 December 2014.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increased to 35.6% at 31 December 2015, from 29.5% at 31 December 2014.
Thisrise was primarily due to portfolio growth in both mortgage and credit card lending, combined with a reduction in impaired balances in the mortgage book.
