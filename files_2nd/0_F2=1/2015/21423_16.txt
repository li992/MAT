At Beazley we have acted, reducing the size of our book by 10% in 2014 and a further 8% last year excluding the Korean Re transaction.
At the same time, we have continued to adjust the geographic balance of our book to take advantage of untapped opportunities in Europe and elsewhere.
To achieve this, we have been locating underwriters in reinsurance hubs around the world, where they can access business that would not normally be seen by our underwriters in London.
We now underwrite around 20% of our total book outside London.
In September we appointed Benoit Goureau to lead the development of our business in France and Belgium, following on from the success of our Munich office established in 2008.
Benoits strategy will be similar to the one we have pursued in Munich, focusing on building long term relationships with local cedents many of them small mutual insurers and brokers.
On the other side of the world, we nominated Tom Yang as an underwriter for the Beazley Underwriting Division of Lloyds China to facilitate the placement of business through the Lloyds China platform.
He knows the local market well and will help us ascertain the scale of local opportunities for Beazley.
