As you can see from the charts on page 103, sustained growth across all our key performance metrics has delivered substantial value to our shareholders.
This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of long-term incentive awards, as set out in the annual report on remuneration.
In particular, the long-term incentives awarded to Executive Directors in 2013 had stretching performance conditions attached to vesting and were denominated in shares or ADRs.
The value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends paid over the last three years is therefore reflected in the value of the 2015 long-term incentive plan LTIP releases.
The value of these performance-related elements of remuneration are added to the fixed packages provided to Executive Directors to calculate the 2015 single figure of total remuneration.
