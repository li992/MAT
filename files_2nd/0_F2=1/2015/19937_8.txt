The Steel Division Vesuvius is a global leader in molten metal flow engineering.
We achieve this by working closely with our customers to develop customised refractories, systems, services and technologies that enable them to improve their performance.
The three businesses that comprise the Steel division are Steel Flow Control, Advanced Refractories and Technical Services.
Our Flow Control products and systems are used extensively in the continuous casting process, enabling steel to be cast without interruption, while protecting it from the atmosphere when passing through the production process.
Avoiding atmospheric contact significantly reduces contamination levels in the steel.
Thus the quality, reliability and consistency of our products are critical in the quality of the finished metal being produced and the productivity, profitability and safety of our customers process.
Vesuvius Advanced Refractories business supplies the steel industry and other process industries with high performance refractory materials used for lining vessels such as blast furnaces, ladles and tundishes to enable them to withstand high temperatures and or corrosive attack.
These refractory lining materials are supplied in the form of powder mixes, which are spray-applied or cast onto the vessels to be lined monolithics, or in pre-cast shapes and bricks.
Our newly established Technical Services business complements existing product lines by bringing new services to our existing customers.
Technical Services focuses on the capture of key manufacturing data, combining this with Vesuvius strong presence and refractory expertise in metal casting to create new technologies and develop integrated expert process management systems.
The Steel Production Process and Vesuvius Our products can have a short service life often a matter of a few hours due to the significant wear caused by the high temperature, high thermal cycling and the erosive and corrosive attacks they suffer.
Due to the specialised nature of our products and the high volume in which these products are consumed, Vesuvius has developed close, collaborative relationships with customers together with an extended global manufacturing network aligned with customer locations.
