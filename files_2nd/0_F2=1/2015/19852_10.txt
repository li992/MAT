STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCE & PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT MAINTAINING LIQUIDITY AND MAXIMISING CASH FLOW Tullow continues to focus on driving down costs and capital expenditure to maintain liquidity and deliver our operational commitments.
savings incurred through headcount reductions and associated costs, our contract and procurement teams are working hard with suppliers to deliver savings on current and future contracts, which will reduce expenditure in the years to come and improve the profitability of our business.
At the end of 2014, we made a decisive shift in our capital allocation to prioritise key development projects that generate current and future high margin production for the business.
I am pleased to say that our West Africa portfolio of oil producing fields met their production targets for the year and were largely responsible for the $1 billion of pre-tax operating cash flow that the Group generated in 2015.
The largest single element of our 2015 $1.7 billon capital expenditure was the $900 million investment in the TEN Project.
This development has been expertly executed and remains on schedule and on budget for first oil in July August 2016.
The completion of the TEN Project will end the current capital intensive period and this is reflected in our lower 2016 capital expenditure forecast of up to $1.1 billion, with work ongoing to potentially reduce this to $0.9 billion.
Having ensured we maximise our current and future cash The challenging business environment that the oil and gas flows, the final element of our strategy of maintaining a sector is experiencing and the requirement to fund the strong liquidity position has been ensuring our lending banks capital intensive TEN Project, have meant that maintaining continue to support the business.
