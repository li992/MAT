The current policy is to make annual awards at the level of 100% of salary.
Salary The Committees policy on salary increases, as set out in the Remuneration Policy, is that they should normally be in line with increases for The vesting of LTIP awards is based on performance of EPS and ROCE, pre-exceptional, with 50% relating to performance of each measure.
This approach has been applied consistently by the Committee over a number of years.
The Committee believes that these two measures are transparent, are easy to understand, track and communicate, are cost effective to measure and fundamentally aligned to the strategic ambitions that have been communicated to the market: The average increase for all Redrow employees on 1 July 2015 was 3.86%.
The Committee decided to award base salary increases for the Executive EPS ensures that the team delivers strong bottom line profitability and growth for shareholders: and Directors of 2.8%, effective 1 July 2015, as follows:- ROCE provides balance by requiring that profit is delivered efficiently from a capital perspective.

LTIP awards vesting in respect of 2015 The LTIP awards granted in September 2012 were based on performance over the three year performance period ending in 2015.
Based on % of bonus opportunity Rationale performance against the EPS and ROCE targets set when the award was granted, summarised in the table below, the Committee determined that the PBT 25% A fundamental measure of annual profitability 2012 LTIP awards will vest in full on 23 October 2015.

Actual performance 44.5p 22.8% Therefore, after careful consideration, the Committees policy on bonus target disclosure continues to be that, subject to the Committee determining Vesting % of total award 50% 50% that they are no longer commercially sensitive, it is intended that bonus targets will be disclosed in the Annual Remuneration Report on a two year delayed basis.
Therefore, the targets for 2015 will be disclosed in the 2017 report.
