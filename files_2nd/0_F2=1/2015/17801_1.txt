We were only halfway through that nights orders and everything still needed to go out.
It was then that I had a bright idea line the staff cars up facing into the depot, turn the headlights on full beam and load the lorries.
We leapt into our cars, manoeuvred them into position and in moments everything was lit up like a football stadium.
All of the orders went out on time and the car heaters even kept us warm.

After all, they both wash clothes.
The car that finishes first looks identical to the one that finishes last.
The difference is often down to build quality and engineering.
To help us understand more, we sent a large team of people to one of our leading suppliers for a week.
The outcome was a series of 3D computer-generated videos that brought the products to life and showed how the technology really worked, and so were now rolling this out across many of our products.
If we understand, we can explain product differences to customers.
And if they understand, they can choose the right product.
And if that happens, we get happy customers and suppliers.

This year, we learnt something big.
The double-decker delivery trucks we use in the UK were too tall to go under German bridges.
Using typical German efficiency and innovation, we decided not to reduce the size of the trailer as that would mean increasing the number of deliveries we had to make and extra cost and emissions.
Instead we decided to design and manufacture a new type of double-decker trailer that you could reduce the height of at the press of a button.
Germany is new and exciting for us.
We dont pretend to know everything about it.
But as things go up and down in the market, so can we.

One week we asked customers to upload a short video sharing their experience of AO.
Involving customers like this helps us to build relationships while also having a bit of fun.
It showed us customers dont just like our service, they love it and that happy customers really are our best advertisement.
It actually inspired us to make our customers the stars and tell their own stories in our TV adverts.

Once we got under way we called customers as usual to let them know we were on schedule.
Customers like to know when were going to arrive so they can plan their day.
And what a day it was for one of our customers!
It was their parents wedding anniversary and they told us they had organised a surprise party for later on.
My mum always told me you should never go to a party without something for the host.
So we stopped off at a local Garden Centre and bought the customer a sunflower in a bright green plant pot as a present.
The huge smile we got from the customer made our day.
Being a driver, I think its always nice to go that little bit further.
