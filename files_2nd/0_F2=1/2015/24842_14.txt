The growth in the valuation of the portfolio at 31 March 2015 over the rebased value was 16.3%.
The increase arises from a 142.6m return from the portfolio, 72.2m net valuation uplift from certain assets and 56.1m from a 0.3% decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to value the portfolio.
The 72.2m comprises 50.6m from the sale of Colchester Garrison and 21.6m from the revaluation of certain investments where new data was available to reforecast the projects cashflows.
The revaluation included an impairment of a hospital project where it is expected that working capital may be required from shareholders to support the project in resolving some long-standing construction defects.
