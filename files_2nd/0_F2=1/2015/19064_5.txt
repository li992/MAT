How measured: Direct and Indirect GHG emissions calculated in line with UK Governments Total GHG emissions 2014 DEFRA reporting standards.
Principally based on data from our 20 largest offices, covering approximately 44% of the Group by headcount, and extrapolated for the Group as a whole.
Total energy derived emissions CO e tonnes Why its important: The emissions calculations look at the CO2e impact of our operations in 2 Source of emissions 2014 2015 absolute terms.
Direct GHG emissions 1,395 1,527 How we performed in 2015: Direct GHG emissions relating to the combustion of fuel increased Indirect GHG emissions 4,742 4,935 by 9.5% to 1,527 tonnes CO2e, while Indirect GHG emissions, through the purchase of energy such as electricity, rose by 4.1% to 4,935 tonnes.
Relevant strategic objective: Sustainable growth.
How measured: Intensity values for GHG emissions are based on property and vehicle energyIntensity values of derived emissions per 1,000 headcount.
Headcount is viewed as being the most representative GHG emissions metric for PageGroups activity levels.
Why its important: Intensity values help to normalise the GHG metrics and place them in the CO e tonnes per 1,000 employees 2014 2015 2 context of the Groups changing business profile, particularly in terms of increases in headcount.
It Energy derived emissions 1,115 1,118 helps to identify where progress has been made on emission reduction.
How we performed in 2015: Energy derived emissions increased by 0.2% and business travel Business travel air, car and rail 507 463 related emissions related emissions fell by 8.7%, in part due to a continued Group-wide focus on reduction in travel late in 2014 and during 2015, and an increase in Group headcount of just over 4% in the year.
The source of data and calculation methods year-on-year are on a consistent basis.
The movements in KPIs are in line with expectations.
17 PB GHG EMISSIONS PEOPLE ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Greenhouse Gas Emissions GHG Intensity values In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 Strategic The intensity values are based on property and vehicle energy Report and Directors Report Regulations, PageGroup reports derived emissions per 1,000 headcount.
This was chosen as being on all direct greenhouse gas GHG emissions relating to the most representative of the Companys activity levels, and being combustion of fuel and the operation of any facility, together with unaffected by issues such as business mix or foreign exchange any fugitive emissions : and indirect GHG emissions through the variations.
The intensity value of 2015 emissions increased by purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling.
Since 2014, we have gathered energy data from our major offices.
In addition to the mandatory reporting of emissions, we also This is in conjunction with our environmental policy which focuses calculated our business travel related emissions, and the intensity on implementing efficiency measures in our offices to reduce of emissions for 2014 and 2015. energy consumption and carbon emissions.
As a result, for the 2014 emissions reporting, we reviewed all our 2013 data as well as enhancing the quality of our 2014 data collection.
The 2015 data collection has continued this process.
In order to provide improved consistency between the 2014 and 2015 data, the calculations behind the 2015 data have been revised.
Emissions have been calculated in line with the 2015 DEFRA reporting standards, and calculated using the UK Government conversion factors for Company Reporting produced for DEFRA and DECC.
Property energy emissions direct emissions relating to gas and fuel oil and indirect emissions relating to electricity derived from consumption in properties directly under the Groups control have been calculated by using a sample of offices across the world including those for the entire UK business.
These offices represent 44% of the global headcount in 2015.
The emissions for the remaining offices were calculated by extrapolating headcount.
Direct emissions from fuel consumed by Company owned or leased vehicles were calculated using the fuel consumed by the German based car fleet.
This represents 12% of the Groups global car fleet of just under 1,100 vehicles.
The German business has one of the highest vehicle fleet per headcount in the Group.
The emissions for vehicles in other countries were calculated by first extrapolating the fuel consumption of the German business per vehicle and then calculating the resulting emissions.
There were no fugitive emissions related to refrigerants topped up as part of air conditioning maintenance.
