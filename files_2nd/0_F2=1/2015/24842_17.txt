Return from the Portfolio The return from the portfolio of 142.6m 2014: 126.5m represents a 9.6% 2014: 9.5% increase in the rebased value of the portfolio.
As expected, the majority of this return 8.0%, being the average was generated by the unwinding of the weighted average discount rate used to value the portfolio in the year.
The remaining 1.6% 2014: 1.2% of incremental value arose as a result of the net positive contributions from a number of factors including: Contributions from new investments: Acquisitions made at, or above, the portfolio discount rate: Net operational out-performance including savings from portfolio insurances: and UK actual inflation in the year being lower than the 2.75% p. a. valuation assumption.
Discount rates The main method for determining the appropriate discount rate used for valuing each investment is based on the Investment Advisers knowledge of the market, taking into account intelligence gained from bidding activities, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of these markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.
When there are limited transactions or information available, and as a second method and sense check, a bottom up approach is taken based on the appropriate long-term Government Bond yield and an appropriate risk premium.
The risk premium takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings e. g. predictability and covenant of the concession income, all of which may be differentiated by project phase and market participants appetite for these risks.
In the current portfolio, the majority of projects are operational and so the number of investments with construction risk is small 7 as at 31 March 2015.
An investment in a project under construction can offer a higher overall return i. e. require a higher discount rate compared to buying an investment in an operational project, but it does not usually yield during the construction period and there is the risk that delays in construction affect the investment value.
The discount rates used for valuing the Groups investments in the portfolio are as follows: Discount rate 31 March 2015 30 September 2014 31 March 2014 Range 7.4% to 10.5% 7.6% to 11.0% 7.8% to 11.0% Phase Operational phase 7.8% 8.0% 8.2% Construction phase 9.1% 8.9% 8.9% Portfolio weighted average 7.9% 8.0% 8.2% The average discount rate reflecting market pricing for an operational asset in the UK has been assessed as 7.8% down 0.4% from the prior year reflecting market conditions discussed in Section 2.7 Market Trends and Outlook below.
The discount rates for investments under construction are higher than the prior year as there are more early-stage construction projects, including the new investments in France, Holland and Ireland.
