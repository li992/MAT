Strategic report Drax Group plc 01 Annual report and accounts 2015 Whats the challenge?
Coal is a fossil fuel and damaging to our environment.
But it still provides around 25% of UK electricity and, across the world, there is ever-more demand forenergy.
We need new sources of electricity, ones that do not cause climate change.
But building new power stations can be a long and costly process.
There is an alternative: we can shift from coal to an innovative, renewable energy source without taking all the existing power stations off the grid and we can do this today.
For the last ten years Drax has been developing the capability to achieve this and today it is now optimised with the latest technology.
With the right support we can further enhance and deploy to ultimately become a fully biomass-fuelled generator.
Yet, until we are able to fully upgrade to biomass, ourcoal units will remain a critical part of the UK generating infrastructure.
