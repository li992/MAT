Satellite communication operators typically own a fleet of satellites, operate them as a communications network, and commercialise it, mainly to satellite communication service providers worldwide.
There are essentially two main categories of satellite operators: North America 25% Other 35% Mobile satellite services MSS operators, Europe 25% SES 19% Inmarsat being one of them, which typically operate in L or S frequency bands, and focus on Asia & Oceania 21% Intelsat 18% data and voice communications for mobility, Middle East & Africa 18% Eutelsat 13% corporate and governmental markets.
Fixed satellite services FSS operators, which Latin America 11% Inmarsat 6% typically operate in Kuand C-bands, and focus Telesat 5% on video and data communications for media, Source: Euroconsult 2015 telecoms, corporate and governmental markets.
JSAT 4% There is an increasing overlap between MSS and Source: Euroconsult 2015 FSS providers through the progressive adoption by both types of operator of high throughput satellite HTS technology, particularly suited for broadband data communications across markets.
Inmarsat has adopted this technology for its COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Ka-band Global Xpress constellation.
Inmarsat is one of the worlds leading satellite operators.
The fast-growing demand for The fast-growing demand for communications globally, especially for broadband applications, According to Euroconsult, in 2014 around 50% of communications globally is a is a key driver of commercial satellite services the industrys revenues are made up by the three key driver of commercial satellite revenue growth.

com, satellite operators generated $13.2bn wholesale Inmarsat is estimated to hold a 6% share of the revenues globally in 2014, expected to grow by over global operators market.
With a history of providing 3% pa over the next 10 years.
North America and safety services at sea, our key differentiators are our Europe each represent a quarter of the global focus on global coverage and mobile applications.
Our ability to deliver seamless, reliable, resilient and secure communications on the move remain crucial to our customers.
Inmarsat also has a fully integrated operating and business model, see page 18, with both ownership and control of dedicated infrastructure assets: mainly satellites, but also ground infrastructure and a hybrid terrestrial satellite European Aviation Network S-band, and also significant services and distribution capabilities.
35% of the industrys revenues are held by an increasing number of regional or national operators, focusing on specific geographies or vertical markets.
