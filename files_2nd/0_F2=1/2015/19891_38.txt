In 2015 underlying sales growth improved to 4.1%, ahead of our markets.
Improvement in core operating margin compared with 2014 was 0.3 percentage points driven by margin-accretive innovation, pricing and continued delivery from our savings programmes, which more than offset currency-related cost increases.
All categories delivered progress against their strategic priorities.
For the annual bonus calculations, we have adjusted free cash flow FCF downwards for one-offs from 4.8 billion to 4.3 billion.
After that adjustment, the growth in FCF was still strong, with an 11.6% improvement driven by the increase in core operating profit and an improvement in year-end working capital.
On a formulaic basis, the outcome of Unilevers 2015 performance was 118% of target.
However, Unilevers performance over 2015 was not without challenges.
Further progress needs to be made in winning market share, agility and cost control.
Accordingly, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the formulaic outcome for the 2015 annual bonus from 118% to 110%.
The Committee considered this to be a fair representation of the performance delivery by the executive team during 2015.
In the past six years, including 2015, the Committee has exercised its discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus calculation downwards four times and upwards twice.
72 Governance Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2015 In determining bonus outcomes for Paul Polman, the Committee also considered his very strong personal performance and leadership, both internally and externally.
In 2015, Paul again received recognition for his work in leading Unilever and helping to promote a sustainable and responsible long-term business model around the world.
Unilever not only delivered consistent growth in underlying sales and core operating margin together with strong cash flow in a difficult market, but also made significant progress in driving its USLP strategy, management succession, gender balance, simplification, empowerment initiatives and in reshaping the portfolio.
As a consequence of that review, Paul Polman was awarded a personal performance multiplier of 140%.
This resulted in Paul Polman receiving a bonus of 185% of his base salary.
This is calculated as follows: Target bonus: 120% of Unilevers 2015 Personal performance 1,866,480 base salary 1,212,000 performance ratio 110% multiplier 140% 185% of base salary In determining bonus outcomes for Jean-Marc Hut for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2015, the Committee also considered his personal performance and leadership, including the management of Unilevers financial risk exposure and the continuing drive for enterprise-wide efficiencies.

The comparator group is the same as disclosed on page 71.
25% of target awards vest for threshold performance under the three business-focused performance measures.
50% of target awards vest for threshold performance under the TSR performance measure.
Over the past three years, Unilever has consistently delivered solid financial performance despite volatile market conditions.
Underlying sales growth during this period was 3.8% per annum and core operating margin improvement over the period was an average of 0.37 percentage points per year, demonstrating managements drive for consistent top and bottom line growth.
Unilever also generated strong operating cash flow in the period, with cumulative operating cash flow of 16.6 billion.
Total shareholder return TSR over this three-year period was below the performance of many of our peers and as such no part of the GSIP and MCIP awards related to TSR will vest.

The Committee also determined that MCIP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2013 will vest at 98% of initial award levels vesting of MCIP is capped at 150% for Executive Directors ie 65% of maximum awards.
