6 Thisfocused on improving and extending the retail units on Tottenham Court Road and followed a phased upgrade of 5 nearly half the ofce space.
The letting of the majority of the retail units and the ofce refurbishment at above anticipated 4 rental values contributed to a strong valuation rise of 19.0% onthe property to 340.6m.

Rental income m Reversion % 300 120 The December 2015 valuation recorded a good increase in ourportfolios contracted income and a very significant increase in our potential income.
Overall, our contracted 225 90 income has risen 4.1% to 137.1m pa and our ERV has risen 29.0% to 278.1m pa.
The portfolios reversion stands at 141.0m.
Of this growth 150 60 35.5m is contractual and due to come from xed uplifts or the expiry of rent free periods within the leases.
Adding this to our contracted income takes topped-up rent to 172.6m, 5.4% higher than last year.
75 30 The bulk of the reversion comes from the potential income from letting either vacant space under construction, under 0 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 refurbishment or currently available.
It primarily reects the recent start of the two new developments at 80 Charlotte Contractual rent Contractual rental uplifts Street W1 and Brunel Building W2, and the acquisition of Vacant space and lease reversions Reversion The White Chapel Building E1 previously known as Aldgate Union, which is currently undergoing refurbishment.
The total ERV of vacant space at the year end was 76.4m pa. Whilst this has more than doubled since June 2015, much of this space will not be delivered for four years.
These projects require 569m of further expenditure, and offer a degree of exibility on the timing of delivery.
Of this vacant space 75% derives from developments, 22% from refurbishments and only 3% represents existing vacancy.
We have let or pre-let 12% of this space since the year end for 9.2m pa net, at levels in excess of December 2015 ERV.
The final component of our growth could come from lease reviews and renewals and this is estimated to add 29.1m to our income, which is 24% higher than last year.
