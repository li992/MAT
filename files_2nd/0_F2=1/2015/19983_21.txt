Their job is to encourage horizontality to deliver the best resources to clients, identify acquisition opportunities and help recruit the best talent locally.
At least one of WPPs global competitors has finally woken up to this approach, announcing, late last year amidst a broader reorganisation, the creation of chief client officers.
It also signalled its intention to bring together its media agencies to leverage their collective scale, something WPP did under GroupM more than a decade ago.
Back to politics, and risk In geopolitics, togetherness is harder to find.
In the coming year, deeply divisive political events will dominate news coverage in our two biggest markets.
In the US the reality TV Presidential election is rocking the Establishment, on both sides of the party divide.
In the UK, against the backdrop of the ongoing migrant crisis, the electorate will decide whether or not the country should remain in the European Union.
Both could have a significant economic impact.
In each case, voters face a choice between a riskier and a safer option.
Brexit will bring uncertainty for business and, potentially, real damage to the UK economy.
Populism and protectionism in the White House is not a recipe for economic success.
For once, a cautious approach may be no bad thing.
The interests of our people, clients and investors are best served when we embrace calculated risk-taking At WPP, however, we hold to the view that the interests of our people, clients and investors are best served when we embrace calculated risk-taking.
We will continue to stick our neck out on their behalf.
