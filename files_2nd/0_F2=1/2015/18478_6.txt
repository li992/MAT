TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT Aim: To minimise as far as possible our impact on the environment Greenhouse gas emissions 000s CO e tonnes 2 CO e emission per CO e emission per full-time 2015 42.9 15.0 12.0 3.5 2 2 US$1,000 of revenue equivalent employee tonnes 14 49.1 20.9 14.5 4.2 kilogrammes 13 48.8 21.2 14.8 4.1 Total CO e emission 000s tonnes : 12 50.1 21.6 16.0 4.5 2 Buildings Travel 11 53.8 18.7 17.1 4.9 Our most significant environmental impact is from energy use at our offices and data centres, and from employee travel.
We measure our energy use by calculating our carbon dioxide emissions, which we are committed to steadily reducing.
We set a target in 2013 to reduce CO e 2 emissions per US$1,000 of revenue by 5% by 2016 against a 2013 baseline.
This year the decrease was 19% compared to the 2013 baseline, achieving our target ahead of schedule.
The reduction was due predominantly to consolidating our offices and decreases in business travel.

| Where emission factors have changed, we have applied the most recent factors retrospectively.
