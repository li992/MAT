18 | F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited Report and Accounts 2015 | 19 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT Solihull, Outlook Sears Retail Park UK property is performing well, and the Governor of the Bank of Englands announcement in January 2016 that he believes that there is no need to raise interest rates imminently bodes well for both the investment and occupational property markets.
However, there are clear headwinds with the economic effects of the slowdown in China, higher US interest rates, sluggish growth in the Eurozone and lower oil prices all potential issues: especially if they lead to reduced or reversed investment and capital flows from Asia and the Middle East in particular.
The outcome of the EU referendum is unclear and this could lead to uncertainty and inactivity, with investors holding back until the result is known.
In the occupational markets tenants may also delay making important decisions until the result.
As a generality the EU referendum may be disruptive to the markets.
Within property, the reforms to the rating system are a further area of uncertainty.
We believe that the era of double digit total returns has drawn to a close and the market has entered a period when income is the main driver of total returns.
The Property Managers are forecasting a market total return of circa 6.5 per cent for 2016 and that total returns in the five years to 2020 will average 5.0 per cent per annum.
In light of such an outlook, the ability to deliver on opportunities within the portfolio that grow the income stream will be critical.
We continue to favour Central London retail, quality logistics and South East offices but also recognise the importance of stock-specific selection.
We remain wary of secondary stock in weaker or non-established locations.
