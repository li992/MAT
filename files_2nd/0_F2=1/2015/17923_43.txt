Antamina All metals used in net value calculations for the Antamina Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves were assumed to be recovered into concentrate see footnote 8 for averages and sold.
2 Escondida The increase in Mineral Resources and improved resource confidence was mainly due to a revised resource estimate that included 90,000m of additional drill hole data.
3 Spence Ore type previously reported as Sulphide was redefined as Hypogene Sulphide.
4 Olympic Dam Ore type previously reported as Non-sulphide is redefined as Sulphide due to test work which has confirmed that gold is associated with Sulphide and can be recovered through the conventional flotation circuit with similar recovery assumptions.
5 Antamina The increase in Mineral Resources was due to an updated resource model as a result of approximately 75,000m of additional drilling and a revised estimation methodology.
8 Metallurgical recoveries for the operations were: Deposit Metallurgical Recovery Escondida Oxide: 70% Sulphide: 84% Sulphide Leach: 32% Cerro Colorado 71% of TCu Spence Oxide: 73% Oxide Low Solubility: 71% Supergene Sulphide: 72% ROM: 30% Olympic Dam Cu 94%, U O 73%, Au 71%, Ag 64% 3 8 Antamina Sulphide Cu only: Cu 93%, Zn 0%, Ag 79%, Mo 64% Sulphide Cu-Zn: Cu 78%, Zn 81%, Ag 66%, Mo 0% 9 Escondida The increase in Ore Reserves was mainly due to the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.
While this resulted in changes to Probable and Proved Reserves, it also included new Probable Reserves due to conversion of Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources.
The increase was published on 25 August 2015 in the BHP Billiton Results for the Year Ended 30 June 2015, along with Appendix 1 JORC Table 1, and is available to view at w ww.
10 Escondida Inherent within the Reserve Life calculation were Oxide and Sulphide Leach, which have a Reserve Life of 11 and 51 years respectively.
11 Cerro Colorado Environmental and mining permit approvals required to continue operations have been delayed, but are expected to be granted during 2015 as part of the normal course of business.
The current Environmental Qualification Resolution is in effect until December 2016.
12 Spence Ore type previously reported as Sulphide was redefined as Supergene Sulphide.
13 Olympic Dam The Mineral Resources were defined by open-pit mining and the Ore Reserves were based on underground sub-level open stoping extraction.
