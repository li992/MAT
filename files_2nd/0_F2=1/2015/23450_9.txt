Market Review We have seen deal volumes fall back again in 2015 and this in turn has pushed prices up further.
Despite this we have been able to deploy 188 million in a new platform investment and in supporting a number of portfolio companies making value-additive acquisitions.
Summary The UK market has experienced subdued deal volumes in the year, which in turn has resulted in average deal pricing increasing further.
Our focus remains on three areas: first, growth businesses playing to our key investment themes: second, situations where business or transaction complexity leads the market to undervalue stable, cash-generative businesses: and third, bolt-on acquisitions in which synergies and frequently limited competition allow us to deploy capital at favourable prices.
We have invested 99 million in one new control buyout, 14 million in two secondary transactions and partly financed ten portfolio company bolt-ons.
Conditions remain good for realisations and we have been able to realise 259 million during the year.
Market deal volumes Deal volumes in the year to 30 September 2015 have been below the levels seen last year, with 25 private equity deals in the UK in the 75 million to 300 million range.

34 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 Deal Pricing Deal pricing has continued to increase throughout the year.
The average entry multiple for UK buyouts valued at over 10 million was 10.9x EBITDA compared to 10.6x in the year to 30 September 2014 and 10.5x in the year to 30 September 2013 source: CMBOR.
Our average entry multiple for the two years to 30 September 2015, a weighted average of 7.9x EBITDA, remains significantly below that of the wider market reflecting the mix of deals in this period.
Our deal pipeline remains healthy.
In October we committed to invest 89 million in the acquisition of PhotoBox, and we expect to be able to deploy a significant portion of Electras firepower in the short to medium term.
Patience and discipline as ever remain central to our investment philosophy.
