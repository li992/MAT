Financial results Other financial information Banking net interest margin Banking net interest margin is calculated by dividing banking net interest income by average interest-earning banking assets.
A reconciliation of banking net interest income to Group net interest income showing the items that are excluded in determining banking net interest income follows: 2015 2014 m m Banking net interest income underlying basis 11,630 11,058 Insurance division 163 131 Other net interest income including trading activity 15 48 Group net interest income underlying basis 11,482 10,975 Asset sales and other items 318 619 TSB 192 786 Insurance gross up 38 482 Group net interest income statutory 11,318 10,660 Average interest-earning banking assets are gross of impairment allowances and comprise solely of customer and product balances in the banking businesses on which interest is earned or paid.
Non-banking assets largely relate to fee based loans and advances within Commercial Banking and loans sold by Commercial Banking and Retail to Insurance to back annuitant liabilities.
Other non-banking includes pooling arrangements where interest is received from or paid to customers based on the net of their lending and deposit balances but these balances cannot be netted on the Group balance sheet.

52 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Volatility arising in insurance businesses The Groups statutory result before tax included negative volatility totalling 105million compared to negative volatility of 228million in 2014.
Volatility comprises the following: 2015 2014 m m Insurance volatility 303 219 Policyholder interests volatility 87 17 Total volatility 216 202 Insurance hedging arrangements 111 26 Total 105 228 Insurance volatility The Groups insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments.
IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement.
The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments.
As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group.
Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition to results based on the actual return.
The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility.
The expected gross investment returns used to determine the underlying profit of the business are based on prevailing market rates and published research into historical investment return differentials for the range of assets held.
Where appropriate, rates are updated throughout the year to reflect changing market conditions and changes in the asset mix.
In 2015 the basis for calculating these expected returns has been enhanced to reflect an average of the 15 year swap rate over the preceding 12 months and rates were updated throughout the year to reflect changing market conditions.
Thenegative insurance volatility during 2015 of 303million primarily reflects lower equity returns than expected, widening credit spreads and low returns on cash investments.
Policyholder interests volatility Accounting standards require that tax on policyholder investment returns should be included in the Groups tax charge rather than being offset against the related income.
The result is, therefore, to either increase or decrease profit before tax with a related change in the tax charge.
Timing and measurement differences exist between provisions for tax and charges made to policyholders.
Consistent with the expected approach taken in respect of insurance volatility, differences in the expected levels of the policyholder tax provision and policyholder charges are adjusted through policyholder interests volatility.
In 2015, the statutory results before tax included a credit to other income which relates to policyholder interests volatility totalling 87million 2014: 17million reflecting offsetting movements in equity, bond and gilt returns.
Insurance hedging arrangements The Group purchased put option contracts in 2015 to protect against deterioration in equity market conditions and the consequent negative impact on the value of in-force business on the Group balance sheet.
These were financed by selling some upside potential from equity market movements.
On a mark-to-market basis a gain of 111 million was recognised in relation to these contracts in 2015.
Return on required equity Underlying return on required equity is the underlying profit after tax at the standard UK corporation tax rate less the post-tax profit attributable to other equity holders divided by the average required equity for the period.
Required equity comprises shareholders equity and non-controlling interestsand is the amount required to achieve a common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.0per cent after allowing for regulatory adjustments and deductions.
An adjustment is also made to reflect the notional earnings on any excess or shortfall in equity.
Statutory return on required equity is the statutory profit after tax less the post-tax profit attributable to other equity holders divided by the average required equity for the period.
