The team explored a number of measures it could put in place to achieve this goal.
Work at these facilities often involves completing small repetitive tasks that can lead to occupational illnesses, so reducing these incidents was a key focus.
In addition to buying more ergonomic equipment to improve workers postures and make processes safer, an onsite occupational health nurse was employed.
The nurse is responsible for holding ongoing evaluations to determine exactly why injuries happen and updating the sites plans with the best preventative actions.
So far our team has made great progress and has seen a 60% improvement over the first year, exceeding its original target.
Injuries fell by more than half and occupational illness cases also dropped, representing a huge achievement.
Since this renewed focus on health and safety, the equivalent of just over 100,000 has been made in lost time savings.
As we continue to make health and safety our priority at Johnson Matthey, we expect to see similar initiatives around the group.
We believe that we are all responsible for minimising risks and continue to look for new ways to improve our working environments.
