Open-pit mining at Olcha will start in Q3 2016, at the Kubaka mill in 2016. with a subsequent switch to underground mining.
We plan 2015 highlights We are very sad to report the untimely passing of to process ore from Olcha at the Kubaka plant.

Concentrate processed from albazino dropped to 143 Kt down 6% year-on-year while the average grade was 52.3 g t gold up by 4% year-on-year.
Concentrate processed from Mayskoye increased to 22 Kt up 125% year-on-year with the average grade at 57.9 g t up by 5% year-on-year.
recoveries from both albazino and Mayskoye concentrate amounted to 94% and, in the case of Mayskoye, consistently exceeded design levels.
Trial batches of thirdparty concentrate were processed and achieved similar recovery levels.
These purchases are expected to continue in 2016.
