Internal and External Audit This relationship is developed and maintained through regular private meetings with both  LLP and the Head of Internal Audit.
Further information regarding the roles of both Internal Audit and External Audit can be found below: Internal Audit Group Audit & Advisory Group Audit & Advisory is an independent review function set up within Tesco as a service to the Board and all levels of management.
Its remit is to provide independent and objective assurance and consulting activity to add value and improve the organisations operations.
It helps the organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes.
Its responsibilities include assessing the key risks of the organisation and examining, evaluating and reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control as operated by management.
Management remains responsible for identifying risks and for the design and operation of controls to manage risk.
However, Group Audit & Advisory facilitate the Companys risk management processes with the Board and Audit Committee, by assisting with the annual process to refresh the Groups Key Risk Registers and by assisting the Company in its formulation and reporting of corporate governance policy.

The recommendations that were made were accepted and are in the process of being implemented.
Internal control The Board conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Companys risk management and internal controls during the year.
To support the Board in their annual assessment, a report is prepared by Internal Audit which describes the arrangements that the Board has put in place for internal control and risk management systems and summarises the key issues or non-compliances arising from those processes.
The Control Environment has not been fully effective in the year.
This has manifested itself primarily in the events around commercial income and the resultant impact on the financial statements.
The business has invested significant time and resource to understand, evaluate and remediate the control weaknesses.
Clear control improvement plans are in place.
External audit The Companys external auditor  LLP PwC contribute a further independent perspective on certain aspects of the Companys financial control systems arising from its work, and report both to the Board and the Audit Committee.
As previously mentioned, the Company put its external audit out for tender this year.
In line with best practice the Company intends to put the external audit out to tender every 10 years in the future.
Given the audit was put out to tender and the current auditor did not participate in this process, it was decided that there was limited value in conducting an effectiveness review of the external auditor this year.
The Company has a non-audit service policy for work carried out by PwC.
This is split into three categories as explained below: Pre-approved work for external auditors this is predominantly the audit of subsidiary undertakings statutory accounts and is audit-related in nature: Work for which Committee approval is specifically required this includes transaction work and corporate tax services, and certain advisory services: Work from which the external auditor is prohibited.
To safeguard auditor objectivity and independence the Committee oversees the process for the approval of all non-audit services provided by PwC.
Prior to approval, consideration is given to whether it is in the interests of the Company that the services are purchased from PwC, rather than another supplier.
Where PwC were chosen, this was as a result of their detailed knowledge of the structure of our business, combined with an understanding of our industry, which together made them the best supplier to carry out the work cost effectively.
This year the Committee approved PwC to complete 0.8 million of audit-related services.
These services principally related to extended half year review procedures arising from the commercial income issue in the UK.
Where any significant non-audit related work is necessary fee value 300k, the pre-approval of the Committee is specifically required.
In total 3.3 million 2014: 4.7 million was spent on non-audit fees being 38% of the total spent with our external auditors and details of the significant items are shown in the table below: Business area Work undertaken Safeguards implemented to preserve independence Amount UK Working capital support Advisory service provided by a team separate to audit 1.3m and forecasting review Decision-making accountability remained with management UK International Continuation of prior year consultancy work Advisory service provided by a team separate to audit 0.6m vendor assistance and tax in respect of the divestment of the China business to CRE Decision-making accountability remained with management UK International Advisory and compliance services Management was sufficiently involved in the preparation of final tax returns 0.6m around taxation to retain responsibility for filing correctly UK Forensic accounting support in respect Advisory service provided by a team separate to audit 0.25m of the half year commercial income issues on behalf of Freshfields LLP PwC neither prepared financials nor took management decisions UK Head Office cost analysis Advisory service provided by a team separate to audit 0.1m PwC neither prepared financials nor took management decisions The fees paid to the auditors in the year are disclosed in Note 3 on page 100 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015.
