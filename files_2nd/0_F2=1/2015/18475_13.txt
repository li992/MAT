com OUR APPROACH EVRAZ is a sociably responsible company, addressing and monitoring all aspects of corporate social responsibility CSR that are relevant to the business.
This section of the report provides an overview of the Groups policies and performance in 2015 in key areas of CSR, including human rights, health and safety, the environment, human capital management and community engagement, and an outline of how the Group intends to improve its performance in the years ahead.
EVRAZ follows the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to ensure a uniform approach to business standards across its global operations.
The Groups commitments are based on internationally recognised standards and respect for all human rights, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.
In particular, EVRAZ fully endorses the provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and strives at all times to uphold them.
EVRAZ seeks to develop and maintain a work environment that is free from discrimination and ensures equal rights, where every employee has the opportunity to contribute to the Groups overall results, and to realise his her abilities and potential.
In 2013, 2014 and 2015 the EVRAZ focused its efforts on increasing safety with contractors.
The Group implemented a unified standard for all contractors that clearly requires every potential contractor to obtain a certain level of safety qualification prior to start of the works.
Where it concerns safety the Group treats its contractors as if they are their own employees and apply EVRAZ rules and standards to all of them across all locations.
Partly due to these efforts the Group experienced only 3 fatalities in 2015 among its contractors versus 7 fatal cases in 2014.
This aspiration is reflected in the Groups internal codes and principles, including the Business Conduct Policy, The EVRAZ Way, available on the corporate website at www.
