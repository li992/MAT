Our business is now well established as both a renewable energy and a PPP investor and, in addition, is becoming increasingly international.
We operate in three selected geographical markets Asia Pacific, North America and Europe and in each we see continuing strong demand for new privately-financed infrastructure projects.
We are also looking at opportunities in the wider infrastructure market in sectors closely linked to PPP and renewable energy.
The model we operate is flexible and this, together with the skillset of our teams, enables us to react quickly to new opportunities as they arise.
We combine this with a disciplined approach to risk analysis.
