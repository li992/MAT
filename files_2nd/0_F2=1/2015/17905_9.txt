S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Delivery volumes of new business jets fell in 2015 but remain above those recorded in the Commercial Aviation 2011-2013 period.
Deliveries are forecast to continue to steadily increase over the next five years Worldwide commercial aircraft movements increased by 3% in 2015 versus 2014.
In North due to existing order books, new jet models entering service and the need to refresh the fleet America, commercial aircraft movements remained flat and in Europe increased by 3%.
Long-term forecasts project the delivery of more than 8,000 new business jets Operational trends continue in the USA and globally as airlines continue to move towards between 2016 and 2024, with the North American market positioned to take about 60% of larger, more fuel efficient aircraft and implement further capacity discipline.
Military Aviation Pre-owned inventories of business jets grew marginally in 2015 but, at c. 9% of the active fleet, Trends in military aviation remain the same.
Cuts to the US military budget continue to remain close to historical norms.
Pricing of used jets in this segment has become more stable negatively impact the flight activity of some platforms and thus maintenance spend.
For sale inventory for turboprop business aircraft has been growing However, this trend is also supporting the life extension of existing platforms as funding moderately but remains at historically normal levels in the USA.
New platform programmes have also demonstrated that long development periods are required thus putting life extension programmes at the forefront of defence Over the longer term, the key drivers for B&GA remain the same as historically - continued strategies.
The average age of the global military fleet is now approximately 25 years and growth in GDP and total wealth, the increasing value of peoples time and corporate activity ouraftermarket businesses are agile and flexible in their ability to support the older, out levels.
The unusual nature of the 20072009 credit-driven crisis and the slow associated ofwarranty aircraft now in service.
recovery have meant that business confidence and thus reinvestment have remained low overthe last few years.
However, continued steady growthin US GDP supports the increase 24 in B&GA movements in the USA.
