Credit risk categorisation Description Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are not in arrears and which do not meet the impaired asset definition.
This segment can include assets subject to forbearance solutions.
Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are categorised as neither past due nor impaired, and are currently subject to one of the defined and inforbearance forbearancesolutions.
Past due and notimpaired Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment and the asset does not meet the definition of impaired assets, as the expected recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.
This category is not applicable for unsecured lending.
Arrears For secured lending, where the customers payment shortfall exceeds 1% of the current monthly contractual payment amount.
For unsecured lending, customers are classified as in arrears at one day past due.
Impaired assets Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment, including changes in customer behaviour or circumstances, and where the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the expected recoverable amount.
Unsecured lending assets are treated as impaired at one day past due.
All fraud and operational risk loans are categorised as impaired irrespective of the expected recoverable amount.
The credit quality of retail assets is detailed in the tables below.

The December 2014 forbearance balance was restated to reflect achange in the definition to include customers categorised as in hardship and on apayment plan or vulnerable.
The criteria the Group use to determine that there is objective evidence of impairment are disclosed on page 161.
All loans, where specific circumstances indicate that aloss is likely to be incurred for example, mortgage accounts which have entered possession or loans where fraud has been confirmed, are individually assessed for impairment by reviewing expected future cash flows including those that could arise from the realisation of security.
Loans and advances which are neither past due nor impaired Neither past due nor impaired balances account for 99.0% of the total portfolio 2014: 98.6%.
This improvement is driven by new lending in the period, along with an overall reduction of customers in arrears.
There has been an increase in the higher risk balances within this categorisation due to accounts which have moved from being past due, and therefore remain to hold ahigher probability of default.
The table below shows the details of the credit quality for neither past due nor impaired loans.

The increase in impaired asset balances on the secured portfolio is aresult of ahigher rate of discount cost observed on sold possessions, which have reduced the estimated recoverable loan amount of assets in this category.
Observed discount costs are based on alow volume of possession sales during 2015 which have reduced to 47 cases 2014: 63.
Possession stock reduced to 12 cases at 31 December 2015 from 18cases in 2014.

Interest only mortgages The Group provides interest only mortgages to customers, whereby payments made by the customer comprise interest for the term of the mortgage, with the customer responsible for repaying the principal outstanding at the end of the loan term.
The Groups exposure to residential interest only mortgages for the year to 31 December 2015 has reduced, accounting for 33.1% of total secured balances, compared to 36.9% at 31 December 2014.

These customers are contacted each year to ask if their repayment strategy remains on track to repay the interest only mortgage loan in full at the end of the agreed term.
If they are not on track, they are encouraged to make contact to discuss their options.
Interest only balances due to mature in the next two years represent 2.2% of total interest only balances, totalling 188.1 million at 31 December 2015.
Treatment strategies exist to help customers who may not be able to repay the full amount of principal balance at maturity.
Of residential interest only mortgages which have missed the payment of principal at the end of term, 19.8 million remain at 31 December 2015 2014: 19.9 million.
All expired term balances are categorised as impaired loans, regardless of loss expectation.
The provisioning methodology for expired term mortgage loans reflects the latest performance on these accounts.
The Group offers interest only loans to applicants who have credible means to repay the mortgage loan at maturity.
The flow of new interest only residential business has remained low in 2015, representing 2.8% of residential completions.
As aresult, the proportion of residential interest only mortgages in the portfolio continues to reduce, moving from 24.7% to 19.1% during 2015.
The Group made enhancements to internal monitoring of the interest only portfolio to track closely movements in asset quality and better understand the composition of expired term balances.
This management information is regularly reviewed to assess the effectiveness of the Groups interest only policy, contact strategies and to ensure the delivery of fair customer outcomes.
Less than 0.1% of the secured portfolio relates to expired term loan balances, with the average balance of these loans around 49,000 and an average LTV of 22%.

The credit rating of the debt securities remains high, with 95% having arating of AA or better compared to 96% at 31 December 2014.
Derivative financial instruments The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.

The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms, and readers are therefore advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
