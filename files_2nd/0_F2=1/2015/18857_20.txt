Developing Award Winning Sustainable Technologies Process Technologies has developed new technology that produces biodiesel from the fatty acids of cheap waste oils such as those used in industrial fryers for cooking.
The resulting biodiesel is a new, clean burning, environmentally friendly fuel that can be used in place of regular diesel in cars, trucks and other vehicles.
This high grade fuel benefits both customers and the environment by recycling a byproduct that is normally hard to dispose of.
It leaves global food supplies untouched, unlike many biofuels which rely on the use of vegetable oils.
It is a valuable, attractive and sustainable option for many of our customers.
In the future there is scope for this technology and its applications to have a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as the biodiesel it produces is more environmentally friendly than traditional fuels.
Johnson Mattheys technology was recognised by the UKs Institution of Chemical Engineers IChemE with a Sustainable Technology Award in November 2014.
Held annually, IChemEs global awards recognise excellence in chemical engineering.
