Develop the NEXT Continue to focus on delivering better design.
In particular focus on improving our Brand buying processes to 1 make better use of the time spent developing long lead time product and 2 respond more powerfully to emerging trends with short lead time product.
Invest in online growth Invest in growth from our online business, through 1 improving UK delivery services, 2 expanding our new branded business, LABEL, and 3 developing the NEXT Brand in overseas markets.
Invest in profitable new Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Companys payback and profitability space hurdles of 15% net store profit before central overheads and payback on net capital invested in 24 months.
Improve service Continue to improve the quality of our service provided in our shops, in our call centres, through website systems and our distribution networks.
Control costs Control costs through constantly innovating and developing more efficient ways of operating.
This must be done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.

We believe the investment in time, effort and resources has been worthwhile.
Unusually, our ranges in Spring and Summer 2014 were successful across all of our five product divisions Womenswear Clothing, Womens Shoes and Accessories, Menswear, Childrenswear and Home.
The focus on design continues in the year ahead with further investment in our fabric and print resources.
We also aim to develop and improve our buying processes.
Traditionally, NEXT has begun to develop design themes eight months before the launch of a season.
We will continue to work this way but believe that we can make much better use of the intervening time to improve our fabrics, design details, prints, trims, shapes and prices on long lead-time product.
In addition to our more traditional buying cycle, we also develop a small amount of product much closer to the season, using shorter lead time territories and quicker response suppliers.
This approach to buying is newer and less comfortable for NEXT, and requires a different mind-set to our traditional techniques.
We aim to build on the success we have had with shorter lead-time product and make more of this buying method going forward.
RETAIL Total Retail sales were 4.8% ahead of last year, of which new space contributed 3.4%.
RETAIL SPACE EXPANSION Space added in the year Trading space increased by 330,000 square feet to 7.4 million square feet.
Store numbers remained broadly the same, with the increase from new stores being offset by the closure of smaller, less profitable stores.

These side-by-side stores give the Company the opportunity to re-define the way we trade out of town, investing in the architecture of our buildings and the quality of shop-fit.
We have radically changed the appearance of existing retail park buildings, adding glass frontages, light-wells, and improved facades.
We have also built two stores from the ground up Hedge End and Maidstone, and these have enabled us to create beautiful and iconic buildings.
Over the next three years we hope, subject to planning, to open at least eight more of these bespoke new stores.
Maidstone Opened November 2014 Retail Space Pipeline to 2017 We continue to look for opportunities to profitably increase UK selling space.
For the coming year we expect to add 350,000 square feet net of closures.

The combined effect of a weak economy and growth in online sales has meant that same-store growth has been hard to achieve across the sector.
Despite this, the profitability of our store portfolio remains extremely healthy.
The reason for this apparent contradiction is that the active expansion and relocation of our portfolio has allowed us to manage the economics of our retail portfolio to reflect the current retail environment.
In the seven years since 2008 NEXT has increased its net trading space from 5.2 million square feet to 7.4 million square feet.
Of the 539 stores we trade in today, almost half are either new or have been significantly extended.
Those stores represent 60% of our current trading space.
The table below shows the changes to store numbers and square footage since 2008.

ft. 0.4m January 2015 539 7.4m Long Term Profitability Comparisons The table below gives key measures of performance since 2008.
It shows how the 26% fall in sales per square foot have not resulted in the proportionate increase that might be expected in rent, rates, depreciation and branch wages.
In fact, store profitability before central overheads has moved forward in the period.
This is because savings achieved through more effective Sale stock clearance, lower shrinkage and management of other branch costs have more than offset any increases in rents and rates.
Wages have reduced as a percentage of sales, because productivity improvements have more than compensated for the dis-economies of lower sales per square foot and inflationary wage increases.

We are currently only entering into leases of more than 10 years in situations where 1 we believe that the trading location is very unlikely to deteriorate within 20 years, 2 landlords are making a very substantial investment in a new trading location or 3 we are swapping out of an existing store with a significant number of unexpired years on the lease.
The graph below shows the remaining lease commitment in years by percentage of our portfolio by rental value.

Our starting point was a rather disappointing set of customer surveys conducted in June 2013.
We re-defined what we meant by great service, focusing on serving our customers in the way they want to be served, not on traditional retail salesmanship designed to maximise short term sales.
Over the last eighteen months we have: Overhauled our recruitment process, focusing on attitude rather than experience Increased our lowest wage rates by 6% Introduced new service training Changed our store staff bonus scheme to be awarded on the basis of service, rather than sales Re-allocated contract hours throughout the day to achieve better service at peak times Increased the average contract hours worked per member of staff.
Any consequent reduction in head count has been achieved through natural wastage and without any redundancies Introduced a shift market-place to allow staff to offer up, swap and accept additional shifts Changed our staff appraisal and performance management systems We believe that all the above changes have had a significant and positive effect on the levels of service we provide in our stores.
The two charts below are taken from an independent survey which assesses the number of customers rating service as Very Good or Outstanding, both in our own stores and in other major competitors.
As can be seen, we have achieved a marked improvement but still have some way to go to get to best in class.

The table below sets out significant margin movements by major heads of costs.
Net operating margin on total sales last year 15.5% Bought-in gross margin Underlying gross margin improved by 0.3% due to a planned increase in 0.5% Home furniture.
In addition, we were able to buy currency at slightly better rates than initially anticipated, resulting in a margin gain of 0.2%.
Higher markdown Retail stock for Sale was up 13% and markdown sales were up 8.5%.
Margin - 0.4% reduced as a result of markdown sales growing faster than full price sales and lower Sale clearance rates.

Delivery Service During the year we extended the ordering window for deliveries to stores.
From October store orders could be placed until midnight for next day delivery.
This service provided the ground work for the much harder exercise of extending our window for deliveries to home, we have recently extended our cut-off to 11pm and hope to extend to midnight by August.
Currently we take around 9% of our orders between 10pm and midnight.
NEXT Directory Customer Service We have made some progress in improving customer service in our call centres.
We have taken many of the lessons learnt from Retail and used them to change our recruitment methods, training courses, staff bonus schemes and appraisal methods.
Enquiry levels and complaints have fallen.
However, we still feel we have a long way to go to get to the levels of service we would like.
In particular we need to ensure that more enquiries are dealt with first time.
Of course, much of the effort is about preventing mistakes in the first place.
To that extent, our warehouses and distribution network can contribute more to preventing repeat enquiries than our call centres.
We also aim to improve the functionality of our website, with particular emphasis on: Improvements to payment processing and account management screens Re-launch of our iPad and iPhone Apps in addition to a redesign of our mobile site m. next.
uk Improvements to the operation of specialist Home product web pages where clothing search and selection methods are inappropriate e. g. dining chairs, tables, fitted wardrobes and beds Publications In 2013 we experimented with a number of small New In publications.
These are now published at six week intervals between the launch our four big hardback Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter catalogues.
During the year we increased the size and extended the distribution of these publications.
In the year ahead we will add one further small new publication in May to offer High Summer and holiday product.
12 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 2 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc FOCUS ON NEXT DIRECTORY CREDIT BUSINESS Over the last few years, NEXT Directory has made the transition from Catalogue to Online.
In doing so, we have made it easy for new customers to trade using a debit card or credit card we refer to these customers as Cash as opposed to Credit customers.
This has dramatically increased the reach of the NEXT Directory and we now have 900,000 active Cash customers.
However, this has meant that, over the last few years, our Credit customer growth has slowed and this year it has declined by -2.6%.
The graph below shows the growth in total Directory sales relative to our Credit customer base, the figures are indexed to 2007.
The dotted line shows the growth in Credit sales in the same period.
Total Directory Sales, Credit Sales and Credit Customers indexed to 2007 200 190 180 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total Directory Sales Credit Sales Average Credit Actives Effect on Profitability Net interest income accounts for 8% of the 25.4% net margin made on Credit sales.
However, the difference in the profitability of our Cash customers is not as great as might first be expected.
Our Cash business experiences much lower returns and marketing costs, boosting the profitability of Directory Cash sales to 23%, and narrowing the difference to 2.4%.
Effect on Credit Sales Interestingly, the decline in Credit customers has not yet been matched by a decline in Credit sales.
Growth in sales to our Credit customers is more than compensating for the decline in customer numbers.
Interest income has also started to grow slightly faster than Credit sales.
We believe that this is because the customers who are leaving are those who are most likely to have been paying down their balance in full.
Both of these effects do not change the underlying reality, that our Credit business is in decline, but they do mean that the decline is likely to be slower than we initially anticipated.
Promoting the Credit Offer We have not directly promoted our Credit business but will begin to do so over the course of this year.
In addition to providing flexible payments, the account also allows customers to try items before they buy them customers have at least 28 days to return items without incurring interest charges on them.
Most Credit account holders are also eligible to get early access to our End of Season online Sale.
Whilst it is very unlikely that we will return to our Credit customer base growing in line with Directorys total UK sales, we may be able to take steps to arrest the decline.
We will have further information on this subject at the half year.
13 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 4 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc STRATEGIC REPORT DEVELOPING DIRECTORY OVERSEAS NEXTs online business continues to do well overseas.
Around 85% of Directorys overseas sales come from our own website, the remainder is being sold through local third party home shopping operators.
Over the last three years the emphasis of our work overseas has been on opening new territories, translating our website and accepting local currencies.
Much of this work is now done and we will shift our focus to improving our delivery service.
This can be achieved either through increasing the speed of distribution from our UK warehouses through 3rd party networks or by distributing from our overseas hub warehouses.
Faster From the UK We have recently improved our delivery service to Germany and France, offering most of our customers a next day delivery service.
Initial sales response has been encouraging and we will look to extend this service to other close European countries.
Local Distribution Hubs In September 2014 we successfully opened a local hub in Northern Ireland.
This has allowed us to offer next day delivery in both Northern Ireland and Eire.
We will shortly open a local distribution hub and, later in the year, a call centre in Russia.
Total investment in this project is 2.5m.
Our current delivery promise in Russia is 8 to 12 days.
The new hub will allow us to offer a stated day service, next-day to customers in Moscow and St Petersburg, and between 25 days for our other Russian customers.
New Territories China The only significant new territory launched last year was China.
Sales started slowly but are now exceeding our expectations and we believe that China will shortly be one of our top ten trading territories.
We are currently working on a local distribution hub to serve mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.
We hope to be operational within the current year.
Our aim is to reduce mainland China lead times for most of our customers from 14 days to 12 days.
Sales, Profitability History and Outlook for the year ahead The table below sets out the last three years sales, profits and net margins for overseas online.
The fourth column gives an estimate of the sales and profitability we are expecting in the year ahead.
January January January January m 2013 2014 2015 2016 e Sales 54 101 163 205 e Net Profit 10 18 30 37 e Profitability 19% 18% 18% 18% e We expect our international online sales to grow by 25% in the year ahead, to around 205m.
This rate of growth is significantly lower than last year.
This is partly because we have now opened in all our target territories and have limited further opportunities to add local currencies and languages.
In addition two of our largest markets, Russia and Ukraine, have both suffered significant currency devaluations.
We have had to increase our prices in local currency to maintain profitability in these territories and as a result sales measured in Sterling are no longer growing.
We believe that both countries will return to growth if and when their currencies stabilise.
Despite the tough trading environment we remain confident that our Russian distribution hub will be operational with the next two months.
LABEL We launched our first LABEL catalogue in March last year.
The business was an extension of the small number of third party brands we had been selling through the NEXT Directory.
The aim was to offer premium non-competing brands to the 4 million NEXT Directory customer base, leveraging the next day service we are able to offer through our warehouses and distribution networks.
The business has started well and we continue to recruit new, premium brands to the business.
Last year we added 34 new major brands to LABEL.
In the year ahead we intend to add at least another 30 premium brands.
LABEL will publish four catalogues a year with around 400 pages in each.
LABEL products can be ordered through a dedicated part of the NEXT website and through LABELONLINE.

Profitability is shown excluding any interest income from those customers who buy items using their Directory account.

Profitability in the year just ended was lower than the previous year, partly as a result of more partner brands switching to trade with LABEL on a commission basis.
This means we take a commission on sales rather than purchase wholesale.
The commission model is less profitable for us, but gives partner brands far more freedom to manage the ranges they sell through LABEL and allows us to draw on their selection expertise.
Our experience so far is that brands which switch to trading on commission can dramatically increase their sales.
DIRECTORY PROFIT ANALYSIS Operating margin reduced by 1.6% to 24.5%.
Net operating margin last year 26.1% Bought-in gross margin Underlying gross margin improved by 0.3% due to a planned - 0.1% increase in Home furniture margin.
In addition, we were able to buy currency at slightly better rates than initially anticipated, resulting in a gain of 0.2%.
This has been offset by an increase in Branded and International sales which have lower margins.
Markdown Directory stock for Sale increased by more than Sales, up 25%.
In - 0.4% addition lower clearance rates have reduced overall margin.
Stock write downs More stock was damaged whilst in transit.
In particular flat pack - 0.3% furniture and items returned via our stores.
In addition, we incurred a 0.9m one-off sofa recall cost.
Interest income Interest income increased, but at a lower rate than total sales.
Interest - 0.4% income was also reduced by a 1% APR reduction made in September 2014.
Bad Debt Bad debt costs have reduced, increasing margin.
0.3% Warehouse & distribution Margins have reduced by -0.6% due to increasing International - 0.3% sales.
This has been partially offset by savings in International parcel rates, operational savings and increased use of our store network for customer returns.
Photography & catalogue A combination of additional LABEL and New In publications increased - 0.3% production print costs faster than sales.

The tables below outline the main contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.
Cost control remains at the heart of the business and we remain determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency rather than any compromise to our product quality or services.

Anticipated wage increases account for 18m of this, the majority of which comes from our annual wage award.
We again expect cost increases to be more than offset by cost savings.
In NEXT Retail, the profit from new stores should offset lower profits from existing stores.
In NEXT Directory, profit from growth in UK sales should exceed that from growth in International sales.
Head Office, Warehouse and Systems Projects The rapid growth of our Online and Home businesses meant that we commenced an unusual number of big systems, warehousing and Head Office Infrastructure projects in 2014.
These projects will give some operational benefits but are mainly required to facilitate continued growth or replace obsolete systems and buildings.
Most systems development costs are revenue costs and written off in the year they are incurred.
Hardware and other infrastructure are depreciated over the life of the asset.
The table below sets out the largest projects and their revenue and capital costs for the year ended and estimates for the year ahead.
The biggest number is the 20m investment in fitting out a new automated Home Sofa and Furniture warehouse, located next to our existing warehouses in Doncaster.
We expect to spend a further 12m on this project in the year to January 2017.

NS provides the Group with an insight into manufacturing and the relative technical strengths of different parts of the world.
Although wholly owned, it operates as a stand-alone business and must compete without favour with our other suppliers.
NS trades mainly in US Dollars and its sales were up 10% in Dollars.
The table below shows sales and profits in Sterling.
m 2015 2014 Sales mainly inter-company 600.6 571.2 5.1% Operating margin % 6.9% 6.0% Operating profit 41.4 34.1 21.3% We are forecasting NS profits of 47m for the year ahead, which includes a 3m currency benefit from the stronger Dollar.
NEXT Sourcing has made excellent progress controlling costs, and its margins are now approaching historical highs.
There is an opportunity for NS to be more competitive and their Board has taken the decision to lower their commission rate by 1% for Spring 2016 stock.
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL AND FRANCHISE STORES Our franchise partners operate 188 stores in 37 countries, sales and profits were little changed on the year.
We own 13 stores in Central Europe, which made a small profit.
We have no plans to open our own stores in new territories.
Revenue and profit are set out below.
We are budgeting for International Retail to make 10m profit in the year ahead.
The anticipated drop in profit is due to the economic difficulties being experienced by our franchise partners in some eastern European countries.

Lipsy sales are broken down by distribution channel in the table below.
Lipsy sells stock directly through its own stores, website, to wholesale customers and to franchise partners.
Lipsy also sells stock in 34 units inset into NEXT Retail stores and through the NEXT Directory.
Sales made through NEXT Retail and Directory are now reported in those divisions see Note 1 to the financial statements.

Lipsy also sells some other, third party, young fashion brands.
These third party branded sales now account for 12% of Lipsys sales and we anticipate that this participation will increase in the year ahead.
Outlook for Sales and Profits One of Lipsys major wholesale customers, Bank, recently went into administration and this customer contributed 1.3m to profit.
We believe that some of the lost turnover will be recovered through other channels and the balance of lost profit will be made up for with organic growth.
We anticipate that Lipsy profit for the year ahead will be broadly in line with last year.

In aggregate these activities contributed 25m to the growth in profit, a far greater difference than we would normally expect from these activities.
Of this 25m, the most significant was a 15m swing in unrealised accounting gains losses on currency hedging instruments.
m 2015 2014 Property management 6.9 1.8 Central costs 23.4 30.7 Unrealised foreign exchange 8.9 5.9 Associates 0.9 2.5 Total 6.7 32.3 Property Management The Property Management profit of 7m includes a 4m one-off profit on sale of a NEXT Retail store lease.
In the year ahead we anticipate a similar one-off profit will be achieved from the development of at least one other new store.
Central Costs The reduction in Central Costs is due primarily to lower share-based employee incentives, in the prior year the rate of share price growth and the provisions required had been particularly high.
Unrealised Foreign Exchange IAS 39 The 9m gain this year compares with a 6m loss in the previous year.
This accounting volatility is unhelpful and hard to predict, we are working on the basis of no gain or loss in the year ahead.
INTEREST AND TAXATION The interest charge was 30m as forecast and we expect a similar figure for the year ahead.
Our tax rate of 20.4% was unchanged and is commensurate with current headline UK corporation tax rates.
We expect our effective tax rate will be no higher than 21% in each of the next two years.
EXCEPTIONAL DISPOSAL GAINS During the year we sold our investment in Cotton Traders for 15m, which was 11m above book value.
We also released 2m of other prior year disposal provisions.

Net debt at the end of the year was virtually unchanged at 515m.
During the coming year net debt is expected to move between a minimum of 500m and a maximum of 750m, and is expected to finish at around the same level as it started.
Our bonds and committed bank facilities of 1,088m remain unchanged, as set out below.
m 2016 bonds 213 2021 bonds 325 2026 bonds 250 Total bonds nominal value 788 2019 committed bank facility 300 Total debt facilities available 1,088 FINAL ORDINARY DIVIDEND We have proposed raising our final ordinary dividend to 100p, taking the total ordinary dividend for the year to 150p.
The increase of 16% is marginally ahead of growth in underlying EPS, although cover remains at 2.8 times.
CASH GENERATION, SHARE BUYBACKS AND SPECIAL DIVIDENDS CASH GENERATION Over the last year we generated 363m of surplus cash after capex, interest, ordinary dividends and tax.
We returned 361m of this to shareholders, through special dividends of 223m and share buybacks of 138m.
We expect to generate around 360m surplus cash in the year ahead and, again, we intend to return this to shareholders.
We paid a 74m special dividend in February and have committed to a further 90m which will be paid in May.
If our share price remains above our maximum limit for buybacks and our profit expectations remain unchanged, then we intend to pay further quarterly special dividends in August and November this year.
SHARE BUYBACK LIMIT GOING FORWARD We have, on several occasions, set out the criteria by which we would decide the maximum price the Company would pay to buy back shares.
We use the concept of Equivalent Rate of Return ERR.
This is the pre-tax return required from an alternative investment, if that investment were to produce the same level of earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback.
We set the minimum ERR at 8%, which we consider a reasonable target for a return on equity investments.
For the year to January 2016, the mid-point of our guidance for profit before tax is 810m.
On this basis an 8% ERR gives a new upper limit for buybacks of 68.27.

Low price inflation, an end to real wage decline, healthy credit markets and strong employment all paint a more positive picture than in recent years.
Consumer Price and Wage Ination 6.0% 5.0% 4.0% 3.0% 2.0% 1.0% 0.0% Source: CPI CPI: ONS 17 February 2015 Average weekly earnings: ONS 18 March 2015 Avg.
Bonus SALES OUTLOOK FOR NEXT Although the consumer economy looks benign, we remain very cautious in our sales budgets.
Whilst we are happy with most of our current product ranges, we recognise that some collections are not as strong as they were at this point last year.
In addition, during the Spring and Summer seasons, we face very tough comparative numbers from last year, when sales were assisted by unusually warm weather.
There is a potential upside in the second half as the comparative performance last year weakens, particularly in the third quarter.
We are currently budgeting for full price sales growth for the full year to be up between 1.5% and 5.5%, with the first half expected to be up 0% to 3%, and the second half up 3.5% to 7.5%.

For the purposes of this guidance, we have assumed that surplus cash of 360m is generated and returned as special dividends rather than buybacks.
In reality the choice between buybacks and special dividends will depend on the prevailing share price as explained above.
We have expressed the dividend return as a percentage of our average share price during the first month of this financial year.
Lower end Upper end Guidance Estimates of guidance of guidance Total full price NEXT Brand sales % growth 1.5% 5.5% Group profit before tax m 785m 835m Group profit before tax % growth 0.4% 6.7% Ordinary dividend yield based on 72.33 share price 2.1% 2.1% Special dividend yield based on 72.33 share price 3.3% 3.3% Total Shareholder Returns 5.8% 12.1% This guidance is based on 52 weeks for the years ending January 2015 and 2016.
This year will actually be the 53 weeks to 30 January 2016.
Our Interim accounts will be for the comparable 26 weeks to 25 July 2015.
First Quarter Trading Update Our next statement will cover the first thirteen weeks of the year, to 25 April 2015, and is provisionally scheduled for Wednesday 29 April 2015.
CONCLUSION A TOUGHER YEAR BUT PLENTY TO DO Whilst the prospective returns detailed above would be very respectable by most standards, they are low by comparison to NEXTs historical performance.
However, they are based on realistic sales estimates and we believe that it would be a mistake to be over-optimistic at this stage.
Our experience is that starting with prudent sales budgets is the key to coping with lower sales growth.
Stock purchases and other costs can then be tailored to get the business through the year in good shape.
Whatever the sales environment in the current year, the Company has plenty of opportunities to lay foundations for future growth.
Of these, the most important are: further improvement to our buying techniques, customer service, delivery capabilities, growing our store portfolio, initiating overseas fulfilment operations, and growing our third party branded business through LABEL.
