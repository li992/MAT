com probonoreport2015-16 June 2016 The fast read Who we are WPP is the world leader in communications services.
It comprises leading companies in all these disciplines: Advertising Healthcare Communications Media Investment Management D irect, Digital, Promotion & Relationship Marketing Data Investment Management Specialist Communications Public Relations & Public Affairs Branding & Identity There are more than 160 companies within the Group and each is a distinctive brand in its own right.
Each has its own identity, commands its own loyalty, and is committed to its own specialist expertise.
That is their individual strength.
Clients seek their talent and their experience on a brand-by-brand basis.
Between them, our companies work with 352 of the Fortune Global 500, all 30 of the Dow Jones 30 and 77 of the NASDAQ 100.
It is also of increasing value to clients that WPP companies and their people can work together, as increasingly they do: providing a tailor-made range of integrated communications services.
Some 830 clients are now served in three distinct disciplines.
Over 550 clients are served in four disciplines, and these clients account for almost 52% of Group revenues.
Group companies also work with 448 clients across six or more countries.
Collectively, over 190,000 people including associates work for WPP companies, out of over 3,000 offices in 112 countries.
Why we exist Within WPP, our clients have access to companies Our mission with all the necessary marketing and communications To develop and manage talent: skills: companies with strong and distinctive cultures to apply that talent, of their own: famous names, many of them.
WPP, throughout the world, the parent company, complements these companies for the benefit of clients: in three distinct ways.
to do so in partnership: First, it relieves them of much administrative work.
Financial matters such as planning, budgeting, reporting, control, treasury, tax, mergers, acquisitions, investor relations, legal affairs and internal audit are co-ordinated centrally.
Second, the parent company encourages and enables operating companies of different disciplines to work together for the benefit of clients.
It also plays an across-the-Group role in the management of talent, property, procurement, IT, knowledge sharing, practice development and sustainability.
And, finally, WPP itself can function as the 21st-century equivalent of the full-service agency.
For some clients, predominantly those with a vast geographical spread and a need for a wide range of marketing services, WPP can act as a portal to provide a single point of contact and accountability.

2 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2015 The fast read What we think The case for sticking your neck out by Sir Martin Sorrell The danger of losing your head notwithstanding, at WPP we are very much in favour of sticking your neck out.
Establishing an office in Havana, the day after Washington announced the reopening of the US Embassy last July, no doubt caused palpitations in the internal audit department and red lights to flash all over the risk dashboard.
We did much the same in Myanmar three years earlier when sanctions were lifted.
It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Iran will become our 113th country of operation in the course of the next year or so.
For some these are risky moves.
We see them as market leadership.
From WPPs entrepreneurial beginnings, with two people in one room and a stake in a manufacturer of wire baskets and teapots, to the acquisition of J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather, the consolidation of media buying under Mindshare and later GroupM, the identification of the digital and data revolutions, and our unique, cross-Group, horizontal approach to serving clients, the Companys story has been one of doing things differently.
Sir Martin Sorrells article begins on page 87.
Sorry to Disappoint You But the Business Were in is Unusually Low in Risk Which is why experiment and adventure can be so confidently explored by Jeremy Bullmore To be reminded just how unlikely we are to make a catastrophic error is to be liberated: liberated to be less of a slave to caution: liberated to experiment, both in content and in levels of expenditure: liberated to test the waters, to try things out, to suck it and see.
The penalties for getting it wrong will be barely measurable.
The rewards for getting it right can be heady.
Read Jeremy Bullmores essay on pages 103 to 105.
Four strategic priorities Our goal remains to be the worlds most admired and respected communications services advisor to global, multinational, regional and local companies.
To that end, we have four core strategic priorities: Advance horizontality by ensuring our people work together for the benefit of clients, primarily through two horizontal integrators: Global Client Leaders and Regional, Sub-Regional and Country Managers.
Increase the combined geographic share of revenues from the faster-growing markets of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe to 40-45% of revenues.
Increase the share of revenues from new media to 40-45% of revenues.
Maintain the share of more measurable marketing services such as data investment management and direct, digital and interactive at 50% of revenues, with a focus on the application of technology, data and content.
