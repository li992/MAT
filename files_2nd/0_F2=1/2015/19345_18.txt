Information that fulfils the requirements of the corporate governance statement can be found in the Governance Report on pages 44 to 72 and is incorporated into this report by reference.

The financial statements have been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company, as a body, and no other persons.
The Company, its Directors and employees, agents and advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this document is shown or into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed.
The financial statements contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of the Group.

The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of these financial statements and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Nothing in this document should be construed as a profit forecast.
Results and dividend The results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 are set out on pages 89 to 126.
On 25 February 2016, the Board recommended the payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 18.9 cents per share which will be paid to shareholders on the register as at 6 May 2016.
The payment of the final dividend requires shareholder approval which will be sought at the Companys annual general meeting to be held at the Sefton Hotel, Douglas, Isle of Man on 18 May 2016.
If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 3 June 2016 and together with the interim dividend of 9.6 cents per share paid on 26 October 2015 makes a total dividend expressed in of 28.5 cents per share for the year.
Shareholders who wish to receive their final dividend in sterling rather than euros will be required to return currency election forms to the Companys registrars by 13 May 2016.
Currency election forms are contained with the notice of annual general meeting that accompanies the Annual Report and further copies are available from the Companys website www.
Going concern, viability, responsibilities and disclosure The current activities of the Group and those factors likely to affect its future development, together with a description of its financial position, are described in the Strategic Report.
Principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, and the steps taken to mitigate these risks are described on pages 36 to 38.
Critical accounting estimates affecting the carrying values of assets and liabilities of the Group are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
During 2015, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those factors that would threaten its future performance, solvency or liquidity.
This ongoing assessment will form part of the Groups three year strategic plan, currently under development.
After making appropriate enquiries and having regard to the Groups cash balances and normal business planning and control procedures, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
As part of this assessment, the Directors considered the going concern status for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of signing this report, which is considered to be an appropriate period over which the Group can predict its revenue, cost base and cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, as opposed to more arbitrary forms of forecasts based solely on percentage increases.
Notwithstanding, due to the significant cash reserves and projected profitability over the next 12 months, the Directors have no reason to believe that the Groups viability will be threatened over a period longer than that covered by the positive confirmation of long term viability above.
Given the above, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

The Directors are responsible under applicable law and regulation for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
International Accounting Standard 1 revised requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Boards Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards.
A fair presentation also requires the Directors to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Groups transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In addition, the Directors at the date of this report consider that the financial statements taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups performance, business model and strategy.
Website publication Financial statements are published on the Companys website.
The maintenance and integrity of the Companys website is the responsibility of the Directors.
The Directors responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
