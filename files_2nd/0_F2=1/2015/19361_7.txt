13 Our Strategic Vision: Building the Global Destination for electronics customers The following pages describe the opportunities, investments and progress that we have made in meeting the requirements of the three customer segments that we have identified.
Engineering customers: our traditional targeted customer base 0.1 of design engineers and maintenance engineers Manufacturing customers: supporting customers for longer 0.2 through their production process Component manufacturers: turning our traditional supplier base 0.3 into customers by supporting their new product innovations Each customer segment is complementary to the others.
Our insight into new and coming soon technology from working with component manufacturers enhances our offering to engineers.
We can follow the signs of activity with engineering customers to open up small production opportunities with manufacturing customers.
The larger volume sales completed with manufacturing customers reinforces the value provided through demand generation to our component manufacturing customers.
