The purchases of Angel Square EC1 in November 2014 and Rental value growth 20 Farringdon Road EC1 in February 2015 brought almost immediate letting opportunities.
The former 126,900 sq ft Half-yearly rental value growth % property was acquired with an income of 2.4m pa, equivalent 8 to an average rent of 19 per sq ft.
The majority of the leases expired in March 2015, but we swiftly re-let 98,300 sq ft to Expedia and The Ofce Group, and the property is now virtually fully let at a rent of 4.8m pa.
The second purchase 6 was a 170,600 sq ft building producing 3.2m pa net.
In the second half we re-let the 25,700 sq ft ground oor, and embarked on the refurbishment of 88,000 sq ft, of which 38% 4 has been pre-let.
Assuming we let the remaining available space at ERV we will have increased the income on the property to 6.5m pa net.

The major components of this residual have either since been let or are % currently under offer.
However in addition to the immediately 60 available space we have a number of refurbishments under way which will provide letting opportunities during the course 50 of the year.
The most significant is at The White Chapel Building E1, which we acquired vacant in December 2015 and is now undergoing a light refurbishment at a cost of around 40 18m.
We expect 200,000 sq ft of refurbished ofces to be available here in the latter part of 2016 with an ERV of c. 9.0m.
30 Other notable projects include rejuvenating space at 20 Farringdon Road EC1, Network Building W1 and the eighth oor of 1 Stephen Street W1.

4 For some time we have been monitoring the expansion of the new breed of exible ofce space providers.
We could see they were responding to significant demand for small amounts 2 of space, lease exibility and co-working facilities that would be too management intensive for our business.
One operator which caught our attention was The Ofce Group TOG, who share with us an interest in workspace design.
Last year we 0 Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec made three lettings to them totalling 116,150 sq ft, or 6.0m pa 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 of rent 3.5% of contractual rent.
All these transactions are at Derwent London by rental value properties with multi-let strategies, and were agreed at market Derwent London by oor area rents with two incorporating an additional profit share once CBRE West End by oor area TOG has achieved a threshold return.
The most significant of these is at 2 Stephen Street W1 where, based on current profitability, we are expecting overage income of about 7 per sq ft in 2016 on 34,150 sq ft. We expect the TOG space to complement our offer and extend our buildings appeal to a wider range of potential occupiers to whom we are unable to offer the same level of services and lease exibility.
TOGs services are available both to occupiers within the buildings and to other businesses in the vicinity, which we believe adds to each properties utility and vibrancy.

During 2015 the Group carried out 35 rent reviews on 357,300sq ft and 29 lease renewals on 72,300 sq ft.
In total this increased the income from these properties by 27.7% to 18.2m pa. 98% of all rents were collected within 14 days of the due date.
In the current year to date we have let 132,300 sq ft for 10.1m pa gross 9.2m net.
The most significant letting was of the 87,150 sq ft ofce element at The Copyright Building W1 which was announced today.
Capita is taking a 20-year lease for a gross rent of 7.4m pa. After ground rents we will receive 6.5m pa.
The average ofce rent is 86 per sq ft, which was above December ERV, but after allowing for rental incentives equivalent to a 34 months rent-free period and a payment to Capitas current landlord to extend their lease to allow a back-to-back move into The Copyright Building, the terms are in line with December levels.
The other major letting in the period was a further two oors at White Collar Factory where Adobe has pre-let 28,600 sq ft for 1.8m pa. Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2015 49
