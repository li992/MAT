Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill is carried at cost less provision for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if any indicators of impairment arise.
"Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units ""CGUs"" for the purpose of impairment testing, with the allocation to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose."
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
On 19 June 2007, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited, giving rise to a goodwill asset being recognised.
2015 2014 m m Goodwill 341.2 341.2 341.2 341.2 No additional goodwill was recognised in the year 2014: nil.
The Group has determined that it has a single CGU for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill.
In performing the impairment test, management prepares a calculation of the recoverable amount of the goodwill and compares this to the carrying value.
The recoverable amount for the acquired share capital was based on the net present value of the Groups future earnings.
The net present value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model, with reference to the Groups projected cash flows and cost of capital.
A significant headroom was noted, and therefore no impairment was implied.
No impairment losses have been recognised in the current or preceding years.
Intangible assets In 2007, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited.
This acquisition gave rise to the recognition of intangible assets relating to investment management contracts and the trade name of the Group.
The other intangible assets recognised are computer software.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are held at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
In relation to the investment management contracts and the trade name, the useful lives are assessed as being finite and they are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for these assets are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The useful economic lives of the trade name and individual management contracts acquired are currently assessed as a maximum of ten years and seven years, respectively.
The remaining amortisation period of the trade name is 1.5 years, and as at 31 December 2014, the investment management contracts were fully amortised.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis.
Computer software licences acquired are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the software into use and are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are estimated as being five years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that do not meet the capitalisation criteria under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset.
The difference is then recognised in the income statement.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that an asset in use may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is measured as the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
91 The Directors have reviewed the intangible assets as at 31 December 2015 and have concluded there are no indicators of impairment.
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Section 3: Assets and liabilities Notes to the Group financial statements Assets and liabilities continued 3.2.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they were incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Leasehold improvements Shorter of 10 years and the remaining period of the lease Office furniture and equipment 3-5 years The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial period end and adjusted if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, is included in the income statement in the year the item is sold or retired.

Financial instruments held at fair value Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument.
They are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except for financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss where transaction costs are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or where they have been transferred and the Group has also transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, quoted and unquoted seed capital investments and derivative financial instruments.
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL as held for trading or designated as at FVTPL, loans and receivables or available-for-sale.
The classification adopted by the Group depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired and is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at FVTPL include investments in closed-ended funds, open-ended investment companies and unit trusts which are designated as at FVTPL as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the documented strategy.
A financial asset is classified in this category if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Financial assets at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other gains in the period in which they arise.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Where the Group is deemed to have control, the investment is consolidated.
Where the Group is deemed to have significant influence, the investment is classified as an investment in associate.
Further information is included in the Basis of consolidation in Note 5.1.
Financial liabilities The Group's financial liabilities include loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and the non-controlling interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other gains in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL relate to non-controlling interests in consolidated funds which are designated as at FVTPL.
Further information is provided in Note 5.1.

Information on changes in the tax rate is included in Note 1.10.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against trade receivables and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables, including loans to employees, are included in current assets except where they have maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
Accrued income relates to accrued interest and accrued management, performance and registration fees.
It is based on the latest available information and therefore involves a degree of estimation related to the valuation of underlying AUM.

Cash at bank earns interest at the current prevailing daily bank rates.
Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the forecast cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
Cash held by seed capital subsidiaries of 1.4m 2014: 0.3m was not available for use by the Group.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
In 2014, the Group repaid the 11.0m outstanding on the revolving credit facility RCF.
The RCF remained undrawn at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015.

Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Certain share awards made to employees include conditions which, prior to vesting, may require the Group to repurchase the shares at nominal value.
Accordingly, these amounts are shown within trade and other payables.
Accruals are based on the latest information and, therefore, involve a degree of estimation.
The most significant accruals at the year end relate to bonuses.
The Group recognises a provision for bonuses based on a formula that takes into consideration the operating profitability of the Group.
At the end of each financial year, the Group recognises a liability for bonuses accrued but not yet paid in respect of service attributable to that year.
This provision is recognised within accrued expenses.
Deferred income relates to initial charges being spread over the expected life of the contract on a straight line basis.
