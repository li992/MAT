com MARKET OVERVIEW Global picture The global steel and bulk commodities industry experienced another challenging year in 2015 due to structural overcapacity and the ongoing restructuring in the Chinese economy.
Weak demand and excess supply in the steel, iron ore and coking coal markets led to a negative global price environment during the year.
China consumed 671 million tonnes of steel products in 2015, down 5.5% year-on-year, while its steel production fell by just 2.7%.
As such, its net exports rose to 104 million tonnes in 2015, up by 25% from 83 million tonnes in 2014.
Together with weak steel demand in other regions, this put pressure on global steel prices, which declined by an average of 28% year-on-year in 2015.
Global steel capacity utilisation reached 65% by the end of the year, down from the average of 73% for 2014 and the lowest rate since the bottom of the 2008-09 credit crunch.

the global urban population has increased by 1.1 billion people.
The United Nations Coking coal followed the same path, driven by the dynamics of the steel market.
Lower forecasts that by 2030, it will rise by steel production meant a decrease of 14 million tonnes of coking coal imports to China another 1.1 billion people, highlighting the in 2015.
Global trade volumes decreased by 5% in the year, as exports from the US and potential for a sustainable upside in global Canada fell and Australia gained market share.
spot FOB Australia contracts, the price of hard coking coal averaged US$90 per tonne in 2015, compared with US$114 per tonne in 2014.
While the market is not expected to recover in 2016, the Group believes that the situation is unlikely to worsen substantially.
As the global iron ore supply and Chinese steel exports already peaked in 2015, the Group expects that commodity prices will face less negative pressure next year.
Given current steel prices, producers globally continue to face low profitability, which will make certain future development unsustainable, leading to calls for capacity optimisation and market rebalancing.

Sales volumes of semi-finished steel products to 3rd parties increased by 18.2% year-on-year mainly due to reduced internal slab consumption of North American operations and lower demand for finished steel products.
Construction products sales volumes fell by 10.8% year-on-year due to weak demand in the local Russian and Ukrainian markets.
Sales volumes of railway products, including rails and wheels, dropped by 24% overall.
External sales volumes of flat-rolled products dropped by 51.5% in 2015, mostly following the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel and EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium.
Another factor was lower sales of third-party producers flat-rolled goods by EVRAZ Metall Inprom, amid reduced demand.
EVRAZ sales volumes of key finished products in Russia declined in 2015.
Russian rebar sales fell by 20% year-on-year due to the slowdown in construction and lower mortgage issuance.
Beam sales dropped by 24% year-on-year and angles and channel sales by 18% due to lower domestic infrastructure investment.
The most significant decline was in wheel sales, which slumped by 35% due to extremely low railcar production.
While Russian Railways bought 3% fewer rails from EVRAZ in 2015, volumes were in line with the contracts.
At the same time, sales of grinding balls rose by 17% amid new mining projects in Russia.
