Strategic Report Understanding Our Markets The Groups main markets benefit from global trends including the growing population, increasing economic development, urbanisation and the need to produce Strong greater energy and natural resources to replace rapidly depleting supplies.
These trends mean that mining, oil and gas and power markets remain good sources of long-term shareholder value, but they are not immune Fundamentals to nearer-term declines which reduce investment and activity.
MINING Weir is a global market leader in the provision of engineering solutions for the mining mill circuit: the Weir operates in three main markets which are process by which mined rock is broken down into cyclical but all share strong prospects for long-term valuable ore.
The Groups largest exposures are to commodities, such as copper, which has good long-term growth.

Mining original equipment orders are driven by capital expenditure from global natural resource customers.
This can come in the form of greenfield expenditure on new mines or brownfield spending, where existing Long-term growth in cyclical markets assets are developed to increase production or efficiency.
Processing rock into ore leads to significant wear and tear to our equipment, which in turn generates valuable aftermarket revenues for spares and servicing.
Copper consumption in the post-war period has closely followed Increasingly, operators need to process more rock to growth in the world population access the same amount of ore as grades decline, which leads to more abrasive processing and therefore more aftermarket opportunities.
To put this issue into context, Figure 1.
