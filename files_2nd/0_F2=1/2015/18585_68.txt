Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Pay for performance audited Annual bonus The majority of the annual bonus opportunity is based on a formal review of performance against stretching financial targets.
This outcome is then adjusted to reect individual performance by applying an individual performance multiplier IPM.
The IPM is set by the Committee taking into account performance against individual objectives.
The multiplier may be set between 0% and 150%.
Generally, in a year when an Executive Director has performed strongly against all of his objectives, it would be expected that they would receive an IPM towards the top of that range.
For 2015, the annual bonus was based on the following financial measures and weightings.
2015 performance against targets Core Group operating profit Core Group PBIT Vaccines performance Weighting Sir Andrew Witty 75% 25% Simon Dingemans 75% 25% Dr Moncef Slaoui 25% 75% 2015 performance Target 6,092 million 5,885 million 850 million Outcome 6,405 million 6,224 million 896 million The core Group operating profit and core Group PBIT targets and outcomes for the purpose of annual bonuses differ from core Group operating profit and PBIT disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report primarily because both the target and outcome numbers are calculated applying GSK budget exchange rates and not actual exchange rates.
The core Group operating profit measure excludes corporate costs, but these costs are included in core Group PBIT.

Vaccines Vaccines sales were 3,675 million, up 19% CER and up 3% on a pro-forma basis in 2015.
