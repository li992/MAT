The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares or ADS and the total value of the shares or ADS on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
No options vested for Executive Directors during 2015.
In respect of nil-cost options under the DABP, the bonus which is deferred by the Director is recorded as remuneration under annual bonus for the year to which it relates.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises this remuneration, the total of the amounts received in re-invested dividends prior to vesting and the gains or losses resulting from movements in the share price between the dates of grant and exercise for the initial bonus amount deferred and the dates of dividend reinvestment and exercise for the re-invested dividends.
For the matching element of the DABP, the remuneration of the Executive Director is recorded in the year that the performance criteria end and represents the number of vested shares multiplied by the price at vesting.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises the total of this remuneration and the gain or loss resulting from the movement in the share price between vesting and exercise.
For Sir Andrew Witty: The total gain of 1,490 following the exercise of 776 options granted under the ShareSave Plan.
The gain of 819,158 recorded following the exercise of the 57,932 nil-cost options relating to the deferral of bonus earned in respect of 2011 comprises remuneration of 700,000 recorded in 2011 as annual bonus and a net gain of 119,158 relating to the re-investment of dividends prior to vesting and movements in the share price between grant and dividend re-investment dates and the exercise date.

GSK Annual Report 2015 121 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Annual report on remuneration continued Directors interests in shares continued Deferred Annual Bonus Plan matching awards Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP matching awards are made annually to Executive Directors, based on the individuals mandatory deferral and voluntary bonus deferral election.
The company will match shares or ADS up to one-for-one depending on the companys performance during a three-year performance period.
Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 109, 110 and 112 of this report.
Awards to UK-based Executive Directors are made in the form of nil-cost options.
Once an award vests, the UK-based Executive Director may choose to exercise the award at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
Awards to US-based Executive Directors are made as conditional awards of ADS.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of the matching shares or ADS is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant award vests.
If the award vests after the date of the Remuneration report, the calculation is performed using the average share or ADS price over the last quarter of the financial year.
If an Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil-cost options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
Dividends are reinvested on the nil-cost options or conditional awards of shares or ADS made to Executive Directors up to the date of vesting.
The following tables provide details for each Executive Director in respect of DABP matching awards.
Market price at grant and at vesting represent the closing share prices on those dates.
This has been valued based on a fair market value of 15.60: the closing share price from the business day prior to the vesting date.
Please note that the values shown differ from those disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report as the value was based on an estimated vesting price of 14.14.

GSK Annual Report 2015 123 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Annual report on remuneration continued Directors interests in shares continued Performance Share Plan awards Performance Share Plan PSP awards are made to Executive Directors on an annual basis.
Under the terms of the PSP, the number of shares or ADS vesting is determined following the end of the relevant performance period and is dependent on GSKs performance during that period.
Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 109, 110 and 112.
Dividends are reinvested on the performance shares or ADS awarded to executives throughout the performance period and up to the date of vesting.
At vesting, UK participants receive the relevant number of shares and US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of performance shares is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant PSP award vests.
The PSP awards made to Sir Andrew Witty in 2012, 2013 and 2014 have three-year performance periods.
However, the deeds of award specified that 25% of the awards would be subject to a further two-year vesting period five years in total.
During this two-year period, there are no additional performance criteria and the awards will only lapse if Sir Andrew is dismissed for cause.
The remuneration in respect of these awards will therefore be considered to be realised in full following the determination by the Remuneration Committee of the vesting levels of the initial 75% of the awards i. e. full remuneration will be recognised at the end of the three-year performance period.
From 2015, the whole of the award made to each Executive Director has a three-year performance period, and an additional two-year vesting period.
Each award will therefore only vest after five years.
During the final two years of the vesting period, the award for each Director will only lapse if he is dismissed for cause.
The remuneration in respect of the awards and dividend equivalent up to that point will therefore be recognised at the end of the three-year performance period i. e. in the 2017 Remuneration report.
The following tables provide details for each Executive Director in respect of PSP awards.
