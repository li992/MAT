STRENGTH THROUGH PARTNERSHIP Established in 1991, Unite Students is the UKs largest and most experienced developer and operator of student accommodation.
We provide a home for over 46,000 students in 138 properties in 28 of the countrys strongest University towns and cities.
We rent our rooms both directly to students, and through working closely with around 60 Universities across the UK: these strong partnerships are key to our success.
Our business is delivered through our 1,250 motivated and committed employees.
Students come to us from around 165 countries, and our culturally diverse customers are at the heart of our business.
We aim to provide them with a home that supports their success, academic achievement, personal growth and employability.
Working with our partner Universities, we aim to provide the right accommodation experience and support for students.
Our properties provide high quality, well-located and safe accommodation close to University campuses, transport and local amenities.
Students living in our properties are provided with someone on hand to help: a well designed study bedroom, all bills, insurance, 24-hour security, cleaning services and high speed Wi-Fi throughout our buildings.
We are focused on delivering attractive returns to our investors, while maintaining investment in customer service, our operating platform and future development opportunities.
