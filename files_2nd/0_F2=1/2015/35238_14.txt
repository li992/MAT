INVESTMENT ACTIVITY We were able to acquire two substantial buildings inthe Tech Belt at a low average cost to maintain the balance of our portfolio, with its attractive growth profile.
Despite very competitive market conditions during 2015 we were able to acquire two substantial buildings in the Tech Belt at a low average cost of 545 per sq ft. We also acquired a number of smaller retail and ofce properties.
These are strategically placed close to our current holdings at the eastern end of Oxford Street, and will benefit from the significant changes to this area.
The first Tech Belt acquisition was in Clerkenwell, an area we had previously identied as a major beneciary of Crossrail.
Our recent acquisition and development activity has seen our exposure to this village rise from 5% to 11% in the last five years.
The 175-year lease of 20 Farringdon Road, with a ground rent of 10% pa, was acquired in February 2015 through a property swap.
This substantial property is located opposite the new Farringdon Crossrail station which will be an important interchange with the London underground and the Thameslink overground line.
In the second half of 2015 we renewed the lease on the 25,700 sq ft ground oor raising the rent from 2 pa to 1.1m pa 42.50 per sq ft. We are currently refurbishing 88,000 sq ft principally on the upper oors at DAVID SILVERMAN a total cost of 11m and have pre-let 38% at 45 per sq ft. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR All the leases expire or have a landlord break in 2021 2022 giving us the scope to consider a more significant redevelopment following the opening of Crossrail which is expected to complete the transformation of an area that is already improving.
The second Tech Belt acquisition was in Whitechapel, at the eastern end of the Tech Belt arc.
We see this village as offering attractive value given the good levels of occupier demand here and the rent increases seen elsewhere.
We made our first acquisition in the Whitechapel market in 2012 when we acquired 9 and 16 Prescot Street E1.
This is now held in a 50 50 joint venture as a consequence of our property swap for 20 Farringdon Road.
Our progress on this property and elsewhere in the Tech Belt gave us the confidence to acquire The White Chapel Building with vacant possession.
This represents a departure from our normal practice of acquiring income producing buildings.
In this exceptional case we believe that, due to the good condition and exibility of the existing property, it requires only a modest level of refurbishment.
Since the year end we have acquired the long 248m lease on the lower ground oor for 12m after costs, which of principal commercial extended our ownership to 285,000 sq ft. property salesat 18% premium To maintain the balance of our investment portfolio, with its to December2014 values attractive growth prole, it is important that we dispose of assets where either we can secure substantial uplifts or where we now expect only a limited impact on our overall growth.
These decisions are made in the context of the Groups 247m income base as a whole.
of principal property acquisitions at an average of570 per sq ft Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2015 55 INVESTMENT ACTIVITY CONTINUED The volume of our sales activity in the last few years has been Net investment at fairly consistent levels.
It has also seen us sell most of our isolated smaller buildings in less central locations at substantial m premiums to book value.
The latest of these were our holdings 400 at Portobello Dock W10.
In addition last year we sold a number of more central properties.
At the Davidson Building WC2 we completed the refurbishment of a number of oors in Q4 2014.
300 These were let at new rental levels ranging between 72.50 per sq ft and 80 per sq ft during 2015.
This fresh rental 200 evidence enabled us to achieve an attractive price for the building.
Following the receipt of planning permission for a hotel and ofce development, we sold Wedge House SE1 to a hotel 100 operator.
The three Q1 disposals which formed part of the property swap to acquire 20 Farringdon Road were discussed 0 in last years report and are included in the table opposite.
Residential development forms a very small part of Group 100 activities.
In the last two years our disposals have included a number of residential trading sales relating to our small developments at Queens, Bayswater W2 and The Corner 200 House, Fitzrovia W1.
During 2015 these activities raised 23.7m, comprising 13 apartments.
Since the year end we have sold the last unit at Queens and have only two 300 apartments remaining at The Corner House.
In addition we have the potential to receive an overage payment at 400 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Riverwalk House SW1, which is dependent on the schemes 2.7 17.4 88.8 91.2 85.4 final profitability.
