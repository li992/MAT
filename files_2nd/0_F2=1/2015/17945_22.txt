Strategic report Adapting rapidly To enable us to respond rapidly to the unique and highly competitive operating environment of the US onshore exploration and production industry, the Lower 48 began operating as a separate BP-operated onshore business in the US in 2015.
With its own governance, processes and systems, Lower 48 is better equipped to operate competitively across several basins from the onshore Gulf Coast north to the Rocky Mountains, and develop the vast resource within these large acreage positions.
In the San Juan basin of Colorado and New Mexico, we are drawing on our deep understanding of the areas reservoirs and utilizing innovative well designs to signicantly improve capital efficiency and increase the number of economic development opportunities.
In 2015 we successfully completed three multi-lateral wells in the San Juan basin, our first-ever wells of this type there.
With multiple horizontal laterals from the main wellbore, instead of only one, we can access more of the reservoir and produce signicantly more resource.
Our multilateral wells are already among the most productive we have ever drilled in the basin, with an average development cost that is about 60% lower than wells we drilled in the basin just a few years ago.
We now plan for the majority of our new wells in the San Juan basin to be multi-laterals, and are pursuing well design improvements like these across our extensive resource base.
In addition to enhancing returns on new capital investments, Lower 48 is working to improve operating efficiency through various initiatives to reduce production deferments and lower costs.
These efforts have begun to reduce production costs, which were down by about 7% year-overyear in 2015 and are expected to decline even further in 2016.
Using experience to enhance our competitiveness.
