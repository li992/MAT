Production at Amandelbult increased from 219,000 ounces to 437,000 ounces owing to the mine returning to normal MARKETS production following the strike, as well as an improved 2015 2014 mining performance.

Investment 7 Refined platinum production increased by 30% to Total 100 2,459,000 ounces 2014: 1,890,000 ounces owing to Source: Anglo American Platinum production returning to normal following the 2014 strike, as well as operational improvements.
In addition, a physical count of in-process metals conducted in the first half of the year led to an inventory increase of 130,000 ounces.
The subsequent processing of this additional inventory resulted in refined platinum production of 2,459,000 ounces exceeding 2,337,000 ounces of produced metal.
In line with the return to normal production levels, refined palladium output increased by 30%, while refined production of rhodium was 33% higher.
As a result of higher refined production, platinum sales volumes increased by 17% to 2,471,000 platinum ounces.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK It is anticipated that platinum production metal in concentrate will remain between 2.3-2.4 million ounces in 2016.
The required process to put the Twickenham project onto care and maintenance will commence in 2016.
It is estimated that cash unit costs will be R19,250-R19,750 per platinum ounce metal in concentrate for 2016.
Platinum believes the focus on cost rationalisation will enable it to meet its goals of keeping costs below mining inflation.
