Executive Directors share interests audited We believe that the interests of Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders so we operate a shareholding requirement to achieve this.
For executive Directors, a considerable part of this alignment can be achieved through the retention of shares released under the DBP and under long-term incentive plans.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve a minimum shareholding of 200% of base salary within five years or as soon as possible after that if they were appointed after 2012.
Nigel Stein was in post at that time and has met the requirement comfortably see table below.
Adam Walker was appointed 0n 1 January 2014 and is expected to achieve 100% of base salary within five years of his appointment and 200% of base salary as soon as possible after that.
He is expected to retain all vested long-term incentive awards net of tax until the requirement is met in full.
He is making progress towards meeting 100% of his shareholding requirement since his appointment see table below.
We also apply a similar shareholding requirement to Executive Committee members and the top 100 executives in the Group as we believe their interests should be closely aligned with shareholders in the same way as those of executive Directors and non-executive Directors see page 88.
Executive Committee members are expected to achieve a minimum shareholding of 100% of base salary having to retain all vested long-term incentive awards net of tax until the requirement is met in full.
The top 100 executives below that level are required to achieve a minimum shareholding of either 20% or 30% of base salary, depending on their grade having to retain 50% of vested long-term incentive awards net of tax until the requirement is met in full.
The shareholding requirement for all executives is tested annually on 31 December using the average share price for the final three months of the year based only on shares held outright by the executives or their connected persons.
Shares deferred under the DBP are not taken into account.
As the SEP will not pay out in 2016, and is forecast not to pay out in 2017 and 2018, it may take some Directors and other executives more than five years to meet their shareholding requirement.
The table below shows the number of shares held by Directors and their connected persons at 31 December 2015.
It also shows the interests of executive Directors in share awards and options at the same date.

1 For SEP awards, it includes both the core and sustainability awards.
2 The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted under awards and options is: For SEP, Restricted Shares 2 and Performance Share awards, it is the average price for the three dealing days immediately before the grant dates.
For DBP awards, it is the average price for the five dealing days immediately before the grant date.
For LTIP awards, it is the average share price for the year prior to the grant date.
For ESOS options, it is the average price for the five dealing days immediately before the grant dates.
This is also the price at which options can be exercised.
3 For SEP awards, 50% of any vested core award is released after three years and the remaining 50% and any vested sustainability award is released after five years, in both cases after the announcement of the prior year annual results.
4 Represents 50% of the vested core award 174,978 shares to be released in 2017 and sustainability award 69,991 shares which will vest subject to the sustainability target being met.
5 Performance condition was not met so the 2013 SEP core and sustainability awards lapsed in full on 16 February 2016.
6 Performance condition was not met so the 2014 performance share award lapsed in full on 16 February 2016.
7 Awards lapsed on resignation from the Board.
