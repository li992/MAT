We have developed market-leading credit decisioning.
Our underwriting is highly automated which allows for rapid profiling and provisional approval of customers, providing us with a competitive advantage.
Our credit science is based on a combination of external credit bureau data, our own proprietary scorecards and policy rules.
The underwriting process includes robust affordability assessments, including obtaining proof of income, to ensure that we only lend when it is responsible to do so.
Collections are normally made through fixed monthly direct debit payments.
If a customer gets into financial difficulties during the term of the loan, then our customer services team will work closely with the customer to help them get back on track.
This may include a temporary payment arrangement for short-term financial difficulties.
However, for those customers who demonstrably can no longer afford the ongoing repayments, the most appropriate exit strategy is often through the repossession and sale of their vehicle to settle theirloan before the vehicle depreciates further.
We have a highly scalable IT platform that supports the end-toend customer journey.
We were the first non-standard lender in the market to adopt automated underwriting decision making.
Our IT system is completely bespoke, having been developed in-house, and our in-house IT team is able to respond quickly to business requirements and ensure that we remain at the forefront of technology.
Finally and very importantly, we have a strong cultural appetite for compliance and meeting our regulatory obligations.
Paramount to this is treating customers fairly.
