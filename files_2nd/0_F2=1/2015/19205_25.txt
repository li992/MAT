SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Foreign currency translation The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar the US dollar or US $.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2015 175 Parent company financial statements Notes to the Parent company financial statements Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through the statement of comprehensive income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace regular way trades are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Companys financial assets include investments, loans, cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
Subsequent measurement Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less impairment.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
These estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense credit in the period in which they become known.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks.
Derecognition A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognized when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 17 6 Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures Parent company financial statements Notes to the Parent company financial statements payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Companys financial liabilities include payables and accrued liabilities.
Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortization is included in finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions: reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same: discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

The Companys financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables and accrued liabilities.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
The Companys management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
Foreign currency risk Most of the Companys operation is denominated in USD, therefore the Companys statement of financial position is not significantly affected by exchange rate movements.
Credit risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, consist primarily of receivables and cash in banks.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The Company considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of receivables from shareholders and cash and cash equivalents.
The Company places its US Dollar and Euro denominated cash with ING with a credit rating of A1 upper medium grade from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2015.
Receivables are amounts receivable from group companies, thus risk of credit default is low.

The management assessed that its assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to their nature or the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Capital management For the purpose of the Companys capital management, capital includes issued capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company.
The primary objective of the Companys capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.
