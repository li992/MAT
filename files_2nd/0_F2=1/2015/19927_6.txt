The focus on infrastructure investment, aided by a focus on certain industries with significant impact on the overall economic growth, will drive demand for aluminium, zinc, copper and iron ore. As a large net importer of crude oil, the decline in crude prices has a positive impact in India.
Going forward, this could improve growth prospects and ease inflation pressures increasing disposable incomes for consumers, lower input costs for energy-intensive sectors and lower current account deficit amongst others.

aluminium supply is outpacing demand, with subsequent pressure on pricing and premiums.
In Government programmes such as 2014 LME aluminium cash prices remained almost Make in India and electricity and flat at US$1,866 but high LME stocks and lead time for delivery led to higher metal premiums.

is forecast to grow by 5% per annum up to 2020, driven by the transport sector and substitutions in favour of aluminium, but the release of LME inventories and consistently high production in China will keep prices soft over the coming year.
Aluminium demand from India is growing strongly, spurred by large infrastructure investments.
Government programmes such as Make in India and electricity and housing for all will drive increased demand from the electrical power, transport and construction industries.
There are new opportunities for the downstream industry in India to develop value added products, including alloys for defence and automobile applications.
Vedantas portfolio is focused more on the value added products and demand for its rods, billets and rolled products is likely to increase substantially.
Iron ore The global iron ore trade is estimated to have increased 9% in 2014 to 1.3 billion tonnes supported by increases in supply from Australia and Brazil.
Record iron ore production in 2014, combined with weak demand fundamentals in China, put pressure on prices which dropped by 47% during the calendar year.
This reflected the market shift into oversupply with high stocks building in Chinese ports in addition to resilient domestic production.
For 2015, lacklustre Chinese steel consumption growth is likely to dampen prices and the major miners are turning their focus to cutting production costs and increasing productivity.
In India demand for steel is forecast to rise as the Indian Ministry of Steel plans to increase steel production to 300mt by 2025 and investment in new capacity is under way leading to a projected growth rate in demand for steel of 5.3%.
As Vedanta iron ore mines come back into production, it will help service the projected demand growth.
