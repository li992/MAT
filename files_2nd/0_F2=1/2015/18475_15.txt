93 CSR Report ENERGY-SAVING MEASURES In 2015, the Group conducted work at its enterprises aimed at increasing energy efficiency, generating more own electricity and reducing the share of energy resources bought.
Initiatives to optimise the use of light, heat, fuel, compressed gas and its separation products products generate significant savings.
Steel segment Steelmaking EVRAZ ZSMK | In 2015, EVRAZ ZSMK installed an energy management system and took measures to reduce fuel and energy costs.
ENERGY-SAVING PROGRAMME AT EVRAZ Over the year, through efforts to increase generation at the ZSMK Heat and Power Plant and ZSMK SAVES RUB229 MILLION IN 2015 decrease electricity consumption, EVRAZ ZSMK reduced its electricity purchases by 17% and energy consumption on saleable products by 4.3%.
In addition, it boosted the volume of own electricity generated by 5%.
EVRAZ NTMK | In 2015, EVRAZ NTMK has modernised its lighting system and introduced measures to increase own power generation, including by optimising the use of associated metallurgical gases from blast furnaces and coking facilities, and to upgrade the water supply system.
One priority project in 2015 was the launch of two new air separation units to supply oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the enterprises blast furnaces and coking facilities.
The units are 35% more efficient than their predecessors.
A US company Praxair is operating them.
In 2015, EVRAZ NTMKs heat and power plant set a new record for electricity generated of Over 2015, EVRAZ ZSMK installed an energy management system and introduced measures 158 MWh, up 12% year-on-year.
In addition, a project to modernise the coke dry quenching unit continues and the second phase is under way.
As part of this, equipment will be to reduce fuel and energy spending.
As a result, it became more energy-efficient, reducing the volume installed to collect surplus gas and generate power from it.
of energy consumed on saleable products by 4.3% year-on-year.
The improvements followed the EVRAZ DMZ | In 2015, EVRAZ DMZ undertook numerous initiatives to reduce spending on energy purchases and maximise its consumption of associated gases from blast introduction of automated systems for measuring energy use.
They allow electricity use to be furnaces and coking facilities.
controlled at various stages of production, optimise the work of high-power equipment and reduce perDuring repairs to a coke gas pipeline, EVRAZ DMZ reversed gas transmissions from its coke production site through the blast furnace gas pipeline, saving 5 million cubic metres unit spending on energy resources.
Overall, in 2015, EVRAZ ZSMK reduced its of natural gas consumption in steelmaking.
The enterprise also worked to decrease its electricity consumption by installing frequency changers and energy-efficient lighting, purchases of electricity from third parties by almost 17% by increasing generation at the ZSMK Heat and reducing its electricity purchases by 0.3 million kWh in 2015.
In addition, over the year, it increased own electricity generation by 0.7 million kWh.
Power Plant and decreasing electricity consumption.
EVRAZ Bagleykoks | In 2015, EVRAZ Bagleykoks upgraded its gas pumping equipment, pumps and heat-exchange units and replaced old aggregators with more modern, efficient ones.
As a result, it reduced its consumption of steam and electricity and made its production process more stable.
com Mining 1 KGOK | In 2015, EVRAZ KGOK implemented three energy-saving measures.
It reduced Energy production consumption ratio, % the size of the ore lumps used as feedstock and increased the yields from dense media 2013 2014 2015 separation tails.
It installed commercial flow meters to measure natural gas consumption Electrical energy 40.71 37.65 41.32 in its pellet plant and added extra thermal insulation to reduce energy consumption.
It also switched electricity tariff to reduce spending on power.
Hot water for heating 204.76 201.96 210.10 Steam 102.72 112.65 113.89 Evrazruda | In 2015, Evrazruda installed energy-saving devices fluorescence excitation 1 Taking into account performance of Steel segment and illumination systems and commercial heat-measuring gauges: fitted frequency changers Coal segment operations.
to the lifting machinery at the Sheregesh mine to reduce electricity consumption: and switched to a more optimal electricity tariff.
EVRAZ Sukha Balka | In 2015, EVRAZ Sukha Balka completed the switch to a three-zone approach to recording its electricity use, reducing its purchases of power.
In addition, it optimised the schedule for tunnelling and drilling work, saving around 10 million kWh of electricity.
Steel, North America Segment EVRAZ North America 2 EVRAZ North Americas enterprises also continued to implement energy-saving measures Energy consumption of Steel segment, in 2015.
By upgrading to LED lighting, they saved c. 1.5 million kWh of electrical energy GJ per tonne compared with 2014.
For 2015, the business units EINA electrical and natural gas consumption are both estimated to have fallen year-on-year from 1,683 GWh to 1,623 GWh and from 9,129 TJ to 9,120 TJ, respectively.
2015 32 2014 30 Coal segment 2013 29 2 Yuzhkuzbassugol | In 2015, Yuzhkuzbassugol fitted frequency changers to the lifting Taking into account performance of EVRAZ ZSMK, EVRAZ NTMK, EVRAZ DMZ machinery at the Osinnikovskaya mine, reducing electricity consumption by 20%.
Raspadskaya | In 2015, Raspadskaya implemented a range of major energy-saving measures.
In particular, it decommissioned energy-inefficient equipment, began to focus more on optimising equipment work schedules, upgraded the water supply system and modernised its lighting equipment.
