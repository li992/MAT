A reinvigorated leased and tenanted estate will remain at its core.
However, at one end of the property spectrum, the Group intends to hold some assets as commercial properties, whilst at the other end the Group will directly manage the operation of some pubs within three managed house operating models.

For these sites, we are looking to partner with some of the most experienced operators in the pub industry in order to tap into their expertise.
