Tier 2 events are those of number of incidents lesser consequence than tier 1.
Tier 1 Tier 2 Loss of primary containment We seek to record all losses of primary containment regardless of the 400 volume of the release, and to report externally on losses over a severity threshold.
These include unplanned or uncontrolled releases from pipes, 300 containers or vehicles within our operational boundary, excluding releases of non-hazardous substances such as water.
200 We have seen improvements in our process safety performance over the 100 past five years.
This has been true across our upstream and downstream businesses, with fewer tier 1 process safety events, fewer leaks and spills 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and fewer recordable injuries.
At the same time, the reliability of our rigs and refineries has improved.
We believe this shows that the rigour needed to produce safe operations tends also to produce reliable Recordable injury frequency operations.

Security and crisis management The scale and spread of BPs operations means we must prepare for a range of potential business disruptions and emergency events.
We monitor for, and aim to guard against, hostile actions that could cause harm to our people or disrupt our operations, including physical and digital threats and vulnerabilities.
Cyber attacks present a risk to the security of our information, IT systems and operations.
We maintain a range of defences to help prevent and respond to this threat, including a 24-hour monitoring centre in the US and Improving reliability employee cyber awareness programmes.
We also maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity Periodic breaks in production for planned maintenance are essential to management plans and work to build day-to-day response capabilities to keep our operations running safely and reliably, but BPs production in support local management of incidents.

80 Working with contractors and partners 60 BP, like our industry peers, rarely works in isolation we need to work with contractors, suppliers and partners to carry out our operations.
In 2015 52% 40 of the 353 million hours worked by BP were carried out by contractors.
