Motor Finance seeks to achieve this through improving customer service by building digital capability and continuing to create innovative propositions.
Credit Cards aims to attract customers through better use of Group customer relationships and insight, underpinned by improvements to customer experience.
Progress against strategic initiatives Investing in growth: Exceeded UK customer assets growth targets, whilst improving portfolio credit quality.

Implemented enhanced application processes in Black Horse for motor dealers, leading to more efficient customer service: launched a new direct to consumer online secured car finance proposition to serve the needs of internet banking customers: and implemented further capabilities in the light commercial vehicle sector to improve the offering to Lex Autolease customers.
Focus on new business in a competitive market: Leading issuer of new credit cards in 2015, with a 22 per cent increase in average advances to new customers and a 20 per cent increase in the number of existing customers transferring balances in from competitors.
Black Horse grew its market share through an 18 per cent increase in new lending, through improved dealer motor finance penetration and the Jaguar Land Rover JLR partnership.
Lex Autolease fleet size up 7 per cent with leads from existing bank relationships up 13 per cent.
Growing balances in under-represented markets: Credit Cards balances increased 4 per cent compared with market growth of less than 2 per cent.
Black Horse loans up 34 per cent outperforming a strong market and benefiting from the continued strength of the JLR relationship, while leading the industry in embedding significant Consumer Credit regulatory change.
Lex Autolease operating lease assets grew 13 per cent driven by new SME customer activity.
Financial performance Underlying profit of 1,005 million with growth in better quality but lower margin lending, resulting in broadly flat income but lower impairments.
Thiswas offset by increased cost of investment in growth initiatives.
Net interest income in line with prior year at 1,287 million 2014: 1,290 million with 9 per cent growth in average interest-earning banking assets offset by a lower net interest margin down 55 basis points to 5.94 per cent.
Net interest margin was down due to the acquisition of lower risk but lower margin new business, an increased proportion of Cards interest free balance transfer balances as we grow the business and the impact of the planned reduction in deposits in line with Groups balance sheet funding strategy.
Despite this, return on risk-weighted assets was down only 6 basis points reflecting the portfolio quality.
Other income of 1,358 million 2014: 1,364 million with higher income from Lex Autolease fleet growth offset by the impact of lower interchange income in Credit Cards as a result of the recent EU ruling.
Operating costs increased by 1 per cent, to 768 million as efficiency savings were more than offset by continued investment spend.
Operating lease depreciation increased 8 per cent driven by Lex Autolease fleet growth.
Impairment charges reduced by 29 per cent to 152 million, driven by the continued improvement in portfolio quality, supported by the sale of Credit Card recoveries assets: asset quality ratio improved by 37 basis points to 0.68 per cent.
Net lending increased by 13 per cent driven by Black Horse and Credit Cards.
UK Consumer Finance lending growth of 17 per cent year-on-year.
Customer deposits reduced by 26 per cent, of which 4 per cent was due to foreign exchange movements, to 11.1 billion driven by the Groups funding strategy.

Received approval from the PRA for our Solvency II internal model, on which ongoing capital requirements will bebased.
Completed, through a Part VII transfer, the consolidation of eight UK Life companies into a single combined entity, significantly simplifying thebusiness.
Financial performance Underlying profit increased by 4 per cent to 962 million, driven by increased new business from bulk annuity deals as well as the net benefit from a number of assumption updates.
These have been partially offset by increased costs reflecting significant investment spend, adverse economics and reduced general insurance income.
Building on the 1 billion of dividends remitted in 2014, the division paid a further 0.5 billion of dividends to the Group in February 2016.
Operating cash generation reduced by 61 million, primarily reflecting reduced general insurance income and increased new business strain following our entry into the attractive bulk annuities market, partially offset by increased cash generation from the long-term investments strategy.
LP&I sales PVNBP increased by 10 per cent in the year, boosted by 2,783 million from bulk annuity deals.
Excluding this, PVNBP fell by 22 per cent, driven by significant regulatory and market change including increased auto enrolment driven sales in 2014.
General Insurance Gross Written Premiums GWP decreased 4 per cent, reflecting the competitive market environment and the run-off of products closed to new customers.
Capital Our internal model for Solvency II was successfully implemented on 1 January 2016 with the capital position remaining robust.
The estimated solvency ratio for the insurance business at 1 January 2016 was 148 per cent before allowing for dividends.

Full 2014 comparator tables for the profit and cash disclosures can be found on the Lloyds Banking Group investor site.
New business income increased by 58 million, with the primary driver being the new bulk annuity business.
This was offset by a reduction in Protection income, following the removal of face-to-face advice in branch standalone protection sales and reduced annuity income following the introduction of Pensions Freedoms in 2015.
Corporate pension income remained robust despite lower sales following the auto enrolment driven increases in 2014.
The fall in existing business income reflects a reduction in the expected rate of return used to calculate life and pensions income.
The rate of return is largely set by reference to an average 15 year swap rate 2.57per cent in 2015 and 3.48per cent in 2014.
Long-term investment strategy includes the benefit from the successful acquisition of a further 1.4billion of higher yielding assets to match the long duration annuity liabilities.
49 Financial results Divisional results Insurance continued Assumption changes and experience variances include an adverse impact of 208million in pensions and investments as a result of the strengthening of lapse assumptions on the pensions book to allow for the impact of the recent pension reforms.
This was more than offset by the 240 million of benefit recognised within Protection and Retirement, primarily as a result of changes to assumptions on longevity.
These longevity changes reflect both experience in the annuity portfolio and the adoption of a new industry model reflecting an updated view of future life expectancy.
General Insurance income net of claims has fallen by 95 million.
This reflects the run-off of products closed to new customers, the impact of becoming a sole underwriter of the home insurance business which has resulted in a short term reduction from the loss of commission recognised upfront and the impact of adverse weather.
The anticipated launch in early 2016 of a more flexible Home product is expected to lead to an improvement in general insurance sales going forward.
Costs are 30 million higher, reflecting significant investment spend as part of an ongoing programme of growth and simplification initiatives.
In 2015 this included the launch of Protection to IFAs and our bulk annuities business alongside the Part VII transfer as well as a significant regulatory change agenda in particular to support pensions freedoms and transition to Solvency II.
Excluding investment related expenditure, underlying costs fell by 3 per cent during 2015 reflecting ongoing operational efficiencies.

2 Intangible items include the value of in-force life business, deferred acquisition costs and deferred income reserves.
3 Restated to align with the revised product offerings and how the Insurance business supports customers.
The Insurance business generated 676 million of operating cash in 2015, 61 million lower than the prior year.
The initial cash strain from writing new bulk annuity business, reduced volumes within General Insurance and a reduction in the expected rate of return used to calculate life and pensions income, drove the reduction in cash generated in the year.
These impacts have been partly offset by 185 million of cash benefits recognised in respect of the acquisition of attractive higher yielding assets to match long duration annuity liabilities and a 48million benefit from the sale of a reinsuranceasset.
