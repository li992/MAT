Refining margins are a measure of the difference between the Net favourable unfavourable impact price a refinery pays for its inputs crude oil and the market price of its of non-operating items and fair products.

driven by higher margins on gasoline as a result of increased demand in a low oil price environment and persistent refinery outages in the US.
Our fuels business The fuels strategy focuses primarily on fuels value chains FVCs.
This includes building a top-quartile and focused refining business through operating reliability, feedstock and location advantage and efficiency improvements to our already competitively advantaged portfolio.
We believe that having a quality refining portfolio connected to strong marketing positions is core to our integrated FVC businesses as this provides optimization opportunities in highly competitive markets.
In January 2016 we announced that we signed definitive agreements to dissolve our German refining joint operation with our partner Rosneft.
The restructuring will refocus our refining business in the heart of Europe and is in line with our drive for greater simplification and efficiency.

It has a two-fold purpose: Improving operations Our Castelln refinery in Spain has been ranked among the best refineries for availability in the world by Solomon international standards.
Since 2009 the refinery has had an ongoing programme in place that is focused on unlocking local employee knowledge to find efficiencies and improvements to safety and operations.
Using BPs continuous improvement methodology, the programme has captured more than 2,500 ideas, with contributions from around 80% of the refinerys employees.
Ideas have covered everything from reducing risks, improving efficiency, increasing margins, reducing costs and increasing plant availability to improving staff engagement.
All of these have been analysed to draw out underlying issues and develop actions that address these.
By April 2015 around 1,000 ideas had been implemented and the benefits of the programme are being realized with reduced break-even margins, improved safety ratios and increased plant availability and utilization.
The programme has contributed to the improvement in Castellns break-even margin by more than $2 per barrel between 2009 and 2015.
The refinery has also seen that steps to improve safety go hand-in-hand with improving operational reliability.
Since the programme began, there has been a steady reduction in tier 1 and 2 process safety events those with the potential to cause the most harm to people and property.
Over the same time, the refinerys utilization a measure of how much crude is being processed improved, up from 78% in 2009 to 93% in 2015.
