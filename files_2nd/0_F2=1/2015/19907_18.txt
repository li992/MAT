up from 881 million a year earlier.
The 441 million increase in portfolio value on a see-through basis was attributable to: The main factors behind the 145 pence per share growth in EPRA NAV per share were: Capital expenditure on developments of 134 million and acquisitions of 60 million The growth in the value of the Groups share of investment assets 99 pence, as a result of rental growth 25 pence Disposals of 66 million and yield compression 74 pence Valuation increases of 304 million on the investment and The value added to the development portfolio 30 pence development portfolios, with like-for-like rental growth of 3.8% being generated on the stabilised portfolio.

We will continue to manage the development weighting of our balance sheet to remain within our internal cap of 20%.
The regional focus of our development pipeline means that the London weighting is likely to fall to around 40% as the portfolio is built out.
STUDENT ACCOMMODATION YIELDS There has been an unprecedented level of transactions in the student accommodation sector throughout 2015 with over 5.5 billion of assets, representing around a quarter of the total purpose built sector, traded as a series of large portfolios have been sold to new or relatively new entrants to the sector.
The majority of buyers have been supported by international capital from institutional and private equity investors and we believe that yields on these transactions ranged from c. 4.5% for central London assets to c. 5.7% for secondary provincial locations.
INDICATIVE YIELDS 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 London 4.5 5.25% 5.5 6.0% Major provincial 5.35 5.8% 6.1 6.5% Provincial 6.0 6.5% 6.5 7.0% When reviewing these transactions, our valuers estimate that 5-10% of the purchase price, equivalent to 25 bps to 50 bps of yield, is a portfolio premium as many of the buyers are likely to have been prepared to pay more to secure larger portfolios to ensure that they benefit from operational scale.
No portfolio premium is taken into account in valuing our portfolio as assets are valued on an individual basis.
Overall the average yield on our portfolio on a see-through basis at 31 December 2015 is 5.55%, representing an inward movement of 70bps over the year and excluding any portfolio premium.
The yield movement has been most notable in London and an indicative spread of direct let yields by location is outlined above.
The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 39 STRATEGIC REPORT PROPERTY BUSINESS CONTINUED Although it is likely that a proportion of this potential upside will reflect portfolio premium, which will not be reflected in individual asset valuations, this indicative pricing suggests there is room for meaningful yield movement.
