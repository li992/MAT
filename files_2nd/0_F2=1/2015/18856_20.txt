d The value of long-term incentives which vested in respect of performance periods ending during the year inclusive of all amounts subject to further deferral: this figure also includes dividends.
The LTIP award for performance period 2013-2015 accrues dividends which are paid as additional share options: 80% is paid following the end of the performance period and 20% deferred for two years.
The deferred element may continue to attract dividends which will be reported in the period which they are received.
The figures have been calculated using the number of share options that vested multiplied by the closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2015 of 6.125.
