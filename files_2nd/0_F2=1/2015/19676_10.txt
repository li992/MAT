It is for regulate and encourages investors to invest this reason that SSE adopted in 2006 the SSE in the Great Britain energy market.

There will then be a further period of stakeholder engagement and analysis before any final proposals are published.
While SSE understands the new UK governments intention to end any new public subsidy for onshore wind farms it is an established and important feature of government in the UK that there should be open and dynamic policy-making and that there should be substantive discussion with stakeholders and experts to enable Ministers to take well-informed and robust decisions that also avoid unintended consequences and SSE is optimistic that the new UK government will pursue its energy policy objectives, including those relating to onshore wind farms, in a measured and constructive way.
In terms of the UK government and the CMA investigation, SSE will continue to argue for policies and decisions that are: fair to energy bill payers and investors: and support the delivery of reliable and sustainable supplies of energy over the long term.
Dividend per share and adjusted earnings per share Increasing the dividend for 2014 15 SSEs first financial responsibility to its shareholders is to give them a return on their investment through the payment of dividends.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 61.8p per share, to which a Scrip alternative is offered, compared with 60.7p in the previous year, an increase of 1.8%.
This will make a full-year dividend of 88.4p per share which is: an Case study increase of 2% compared with 2014 15, which is in line with RPI inflation: and covered 1.40 times SSEs 8.8bn contribution by SSEs adjusted earnings per share.
