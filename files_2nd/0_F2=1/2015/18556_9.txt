Fresnillo plc Strategic Report Annual Report 2015 Driving Long-Term Value from Solid Foundations Key Performance Indicators 1 Operate Our performance in the year: Silver production increased, mainly driven by throughput at Saucito, whilst gold production also rose, exceeding both 2015 guidance and our 2018 target, as a result of Herradura and its dynamic leaching plant being fully operational for the year.
Continued focus on efficiency and controlling costs led to lower cost per tonne at almost every mine this year.
