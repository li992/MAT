Treasury-related credit risk The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties with investment grade ratings, as measured by financial credit rating agencies.
All treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities to the Group.
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost-effectively, bank accounts, surplus cash and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Each counterparty that the Group uses for derivatives, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and derivatives that can be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
