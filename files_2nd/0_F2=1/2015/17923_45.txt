4 Peak Downs The Coal Resources and Coal Reserves for Caval Ridge are reported as part of Peak Downs.
5 Poitrel-Winchester The increase in Coal Resources and improved resource confidence was due to an updated resource model as a result of additional drilling and geological interpretations review.
Drill hole spacings vary between seams and geological domains and were determined in conjunction with geostatistical analyses where applicable.
The range of maximum spacings was: Deposit Proved Coal Reserves Probable Coal Reserves Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow 900m to 1,300m plus 3D seismic coverage for UG 1,750m to 2,400m Peak Downs 500m to 1,050m 500m to 2,100m Saraji 500m to 1,040m 900m to 2,100m Norwich Park 500m to 1,400m 1,000m to 2,800m Blackwater 500m 500m to 1,000m Daunia 650m 1,200m Gregory Crinum 850m plus 3D seismic coverage for UG 850m to 1,700m South Walker Creek 500m to 800m 1,000m to 1,500m Poitrel-Winchester 300m to 950m 550m to 1,850m Haju 500m 500m to 1,000m Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow and Daunia The classification criteria were revised based on a drill hole spacing analysis study.
7 Product recoveries for the operations were: Deposit Product Recovery Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow 76% Peak Downs 5662% Saraji 61% Norwich Park 72% Blackwater 89% Daunia 83% Gregory Crinum 84% South Walker Creek 71% Poitrel-Winchester 69% Haju 100% 8 Total Coal Reserves were at the moisture content when mined 4% CQCA JV, Gregory JV, BHP Billiton Mitsui: 7% Haju.
Total Marketable Coal Reserves were at a product specific moisture content 9.510% Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow: 9.5%10% Peak Downs: 10% Saraji: 7.511% Blackwater: 9.510% Daunia: 1011% Norwich Park: 8.5% Gregory Crinum: 9% South Walker Creek: 9.512% Poitrel-Winchester: 7% Haju and at an air-dried quality basis, for sale after the beneficiation of the Total Coal Reserves.
9 Coal delivered to wash plant, except for Haju where coal will not be washed.
10 Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow Increase in Coal Reserves due to revised mining and cost assumptions.
11 Saraji The decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increased nominated production rate from 14.4Mtpa in FY2014 to 17.3Mtpa in FY2015.
12 Norwich Park and Gregory mines remain on care and maintenance.
Increases in Reserve Life were due to revised assumptions and are subject to ongoing review.
13 South Walker Creek Increase in Coal Reserves due to revised economic assumptions.
14 Poitrel-Winchester Increase in Coal Reserves due to improved resource confidence resulting in conversion of Coal Resources to Coal Reserves.
15 Haju Maiden Coal Reserves following the granting of the operations permit.
Qualities are reported on an air-dried in situ basis.
2 Cut-off criteria: Deposit Coal Resources Coal Reserves San Juan 3.0m seam thickness, 5,000KCal kg CV 3.0m seam thickness, 5,000KCal kg CV Mt Arthur Coal 0.3m seam thickness 0.3m mineable seam thickness, 26.5% ash, 50% product yield Togara South 1.5m seam thickness Cerrejn 0.65m seam thickness 0.65m seam thickness 3 San Juan Divestment is in progress.
Volatile matter was not estimated because %VM is not a quality requirement in the current sales contract.
4 Cerrejn The Coal Resources are restricted to areas which have been identified for inclusion by BHP Billiton based on a risk assessment.
5 Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were: Deposit Proved Coal Reserves Probable Coal Reserves San Juan 500m 250m radius from drill hole 500m to 1,000m 250m to 500m radius from drill hole Mt Arthur Coal 500m 500m to 1,000m Cerrejn 6 drill holes per 100ha 2 to 6 drill holes per 100ha 6 Product recoveries for the operations were: Deposit Product Recovery San Juan 100% Mt Arthur Coal 79% Cerrejn 98% 7 Total Coal Reserves were at the moisture content when mined 8.5% San Juan: 8.7% Mt Arthur Coal: 13.2% Cerrejn.
Total Marketable Coal Reserves were at a product specific moisture content 8.5% San Juan: 9.6% Mt Arthur Coal: 14.2% Cerrejn and at an air-dried quality basis, for sale after the beneficiation of the Total Coal Reserves.
8 Coal delivered to wash plant, except for San Juan, where coal is not washed.
9 Mt Arthur Coal The decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increased nominated production rate from 30.8Mtpa in FY2014 to 32Mtpa in FY2015.
10 Cerrejn The decrease in Coal Reserves was due to a revised life of mine plan.
The Reserve Life remained constant due to a decrease in nominated production rate from 41.5Mtpa in FY2014 to 38.8Mtpa in FY2015.
