Share Buy Backs The Board is once again seeking shareholder permission to continue its programme of share buybacks as outlined on page 67.
A key point in the Investment Managers mandate is to take a long-term view of investments and one of the advantages of a closed end fund is that the portfolio structure is not disturbed by large inflows or outflows of cash.
However, the Board and the Investment Manager recognise that the returns experienced by shareholders are in the form of movements in the share price, which are not directly linked to NAV movements and the shares may trade at varying discounts or premiums to NAV.
Many shareholders, both professional and private investors, have expressed a view that a high level of volatility in the discount is undesirable.
A less volatile discount and hence share price is seen as important to investors.
For this reason, TEMIT uses share buy backs selectively with the intention of limiting volatility and where it is in the interests of shareholders.
Shares bought back and cancelled during the year 4,404,900 Proportion of share capital bought back 1.36% Cost of share buy backs 24.7m The benefit to NAV 0.25% The benefit to NAV 3.1m Auditor Deloitte LLP has expressed a willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution proposing their reappointment will be submitted at the AGM.
The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP, who were appointed in 2009, be reappointed as theCompanys auditor.
Further details on the assessment of the auditor can be found within the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 74 and 75.
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditor was unaware and that each Director had taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditor was aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provision of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Companys Articles give the Directors authority to approve such situations.
54 Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC www.
co. uk There are safeguards which apply when Directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
Firstly, only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered are able to make the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Companys success.
The Directors are able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
The Company maintains a register of Directors conflicts of interest which have been disclosed and approved by the other Directors.

The Investment Manager invests in companies that it considers to be well managed and subject to appropriate corporate governance.
A well-managed company is considered to be one which complies with all the relevant legislation and which meets the environmental, social, community, ethical and human rights requirements of the country in which it operates.
It is important to recognise that local laws and requirements of emerging markets do not necessarily equate with those of developed countries.

The Company has engaged with the Investment Manager in relation to its approach to the Stewardship Code the Code.
The Company and the Investment Manager generally support the Principles of the Code as outlined below.
On-going monitoring of investee companies and dialogue with management are fundamental to the Investment Managers investment approach.
The strategy on intervention with investee companies is dealt with on a case by case basis and is usually a judgement made by the Investment Manager based on the research done on each investee company for the investment decision making progress.
In all cases, the Investment Manager holds regular review meetings with the senior management of investee companies.
In exceptional circumstances, the Investment Manager may provide a director to the investee company.
The Investment Manager considers the key objectives are to seek to obtain value for the Company and to comply with its fiduciary duties.
The level of engagement with investee companies derives from the fiduciary duties of the Investment Manager to the Company.
Thus, for example, in voting shares, the Investment Manager considers what would be in the best interests of the Company.
Similarly, there will be many instances in which actions such as a dialogue between the Investment Manager and the management of investee companies, or with other shareholders, may help to maximise shareholder value.
At the same time, there may be instances in which activism is not consistent with the Investment Managers fiduciary duty.
For example, in the process of company research and monitoring, a significant problem or risk may be identified and the Investment Manager may decide it is better simply to sell a position than seek to undertake a lengthy engagement with management.
Decisions involving when and how to engage with management or carry out collective engagement are matters of judgement.
