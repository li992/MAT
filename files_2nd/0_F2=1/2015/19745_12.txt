Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport of goods to and from site and the movement of these transport vehicles on site.
Internaltransport on site is included.
Emissions to air have been calculated from theusage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel.
They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc.
with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity These losses are in Scope 3, this report is for Scope1 & 2.
CO equivalent emissions include contributions from CH and N O associated with combustion.
NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes.
