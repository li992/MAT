Outlook for our markets We operate in a market for new infrastructure primarily driven by population growth, urbanisation and climate change which means that infrastructure needs are generally substantial and urgent.
However, our market is also affected by external factors such as government policies, interest rates, exchange rates and, for our renewable energy assets, energy prices.
Any of these factors can present challenges, but John Laing is well positioned to mitigate the consequences while capturing opportunities and creating shareholder value.
We currently operate in three principal geographical regions: Asia Pacific Australia and New Zealand : North America Canada and the US : and Europe including the UK.
