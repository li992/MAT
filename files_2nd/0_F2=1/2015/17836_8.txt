Key performance indicators Measuring our performance At Group level, we measure the performance of the business using a number of key performance indicators KPIs.
These help to ensure that we are delivering against our strategic priorities as set out on page 16.
Several of these KPIs underlying EPS, return on investment and leverage influence the remuneration of our executive team see page 52.
Certain KPIs are more appropriately measured for each of our two operating businesses, whereas other KPIs are best measured for the Group as a whole.
