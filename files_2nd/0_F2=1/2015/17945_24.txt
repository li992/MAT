Optimizing our assets The Caspian Sea is one of the worlds leading hydrocarbon provinces and we have been the major presence in development of Azerbaijans offshore oil and gas elds since our ofce in Baku opened in 1992.
The countrys gas production is dominated by one of the worlds largest elds, Shah Deniz BPs biggest discovery since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 1968.
Developing Shah Deniz Stage 1 involved drilling some of BPs most difficult wells at depths of around 6,000 metres below sea level and under high pressures.
And in only seven years, we also drilled the deepest exploration well in the Caspian to date, built the platform and onshore terminal and laid the 700km South Caucasus pipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Turkish border.
Our technical expertise and ongoing maintenance of the facilities has helped Shah Deniz provide a consistently secure and reliable supply of gas to the region and in 2015 we achieved almost 100% plant reliability.
This has helped to increase production from the existing facilities.
Shah Deniz Stage 1 has reliably delivered plateau production throughout 2015, with 9.9 billion standard cubic metres of gas and about 18.3 million barrels of condensate produced.
Strengthening our assets to provide momentum for years to come.
