Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 70 Remuneration Committee continued Since 2011, awards under the LTIP have been subject to a performance condition which measured Severn Trent Water Limiteds Return on Regulatory Capital Value RoRCV relative to the Final Determination set by Ofwat.
RoRCV was considered a key financial measure of performance under the AMP5 framework.
Under AMP6 and the new regulatory incentive structures for water companies, Return on Regulatory Equity RORE has replaced RoRCV as Ofwats key financial metric and is a key measure for investors in the new regulatory environment.
RORE is calculated as profit after tax plus net incentives earned in the year divided by the average equity element of our regulatory capital value and measures how efficiently we can deliver returns to shareholders.
Unlike RoRCV, RORE is aligned with the key drivers of performance in AMP6 and reects how well we perform against our operational and capital expenditure targets, our nancing performance and achievement against the ODI framework.
To align the incentive structure with the new reporting framework, LTIP awards from 2015 onwards will be based on RORE outperformance relative to Ofwats Final Determination.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2015 require average RORE over the three year performance period to equal the Final Determination 5.65% for 25% of the award to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting for outperforming the Final Determination by 1.29 times 7.29%.
The committee considers the targets to be demanding and the stretch target requires the company signicantly to outperform the Final Determination, delivering substantial returns to shareholders.
Finance Director changes During the course of the year, the committee considered the retirement of the current Chief Financial officer, Michael McKeon, and the recruitment arrangements for his successor, James Bowling as Chief Financial officer.
Full details of their respective leaving and joining arrangements are set out in the Annual Report on remuneration on page 85.
Structure of the report The changes to the performance measures used in the annual bonus and LTIP require us to resubmit our Policy Report for shareholder approval.
The Policy Report reects the remuneration policy approved by shareholders last year, updated to reect the new board structure and the proposed changes to the performance measures noted above.
The Policy Report will be subject to a binding vote at the forthcoming AGM and, once approved, it is intended that the policy will apply until the 2018 AGM when it will be subject to reapproval by shareholders as required under the regulations.
This letter and the Annual Report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
I hope that you are supportive of our proposals and will approve both resolutions at the AGM.

Outstanding incentive awards would vest in line with the treatment set out below for a good leaver except that the performance and vesting period will end on the date of control.
Annual bonus The committee may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus to a departing executive, subject to performance and pro rated to reect the proportion of the year worked.
The bonus would be paid at the same time as for the other directors and, if the executive has left employment by that date, it may be paid solely in cash.

In exceptional circumstances the committee may time pro rate the 2005 LTIP, 2014 LTIP and SMP awards to a lesser extent or not at all.
For the Recruitment Awards granted on appointment to Liv Gareld and to be granted to James Bowling, no time pro rata reduction will be applied in a good leaver situation.
This is in recognition of the fact that the expected value of the forfeited awards was signicantly higher in both cases with much of it being non performance related and which would not have been scaled back for a similar event.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
Outstanding awards under the SAYE and the legacy Share Incentive Plan SIP would vest in accordance with the terms of the plans as approved by HMRC.
Approach to recruitment and promotion The remuneration packages for all new executive directors will be set in line with the companys approved policy.

Annual bonuses and long term incentives will be awarded in line with the maximum limits outlined in the policy on page 72.
Participation in the bonus plan will normally be prorated for the year of joining.

Long term incentive awards vesting in relation to performance in 2014 15 The 2011 SMP awards and the 2012 LTIP awards have vested or will vest based on performance during the year as follows: a 2011 SMP awards TSR vesting schedule Percentage of award vesting % The 2011 SMP awards were subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, measured relative to 100 companies ranked 51150 in the FTSE by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts.
The overall performance period 75 was three years commencing on the date of grant 20 May 2011.
However, the award was split into three tranches, each with a different measurement period for TSR as follows: 50 25 0 Median Upper Quartile Position against FTSE 51150 excluding investment trusts Tranche Performance period Weighting Severn Trent TSR Median TSR Upper Quartile TSR Vesting 1 18 months 20% 26.5% 3.6% 22.6% 100% 2 27 months 30% 42.6% 26.9% 55.6% 70.3% 3 36 months 50% 49.1% 40.9% 77.4% 50.3% Overall level of vesting 66.2% The committee was satisfied that the companys TSR appropriately reected the companys underlying performance and the award vested at 66.2%.
b 2012 LTIP awards RoRCV vesting schedule for 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards The 2012 LTIP awards were subject to an RoRCV performance Percentage of award vesting % condition, measured over three financial years to 31 March 100 2015.
Average RoRCV is compared to the baseline gure set out in the Ofwat Final Determination.
0% of the award vests 75 if average RoRCV equals that set in the Final Determination, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% vesting for 1.02x the Final Determination and 100% vesting for 1.07x 50 Final Determination.
The committee has various discretions in relation to 25 determining the final vesting outcome as set out in the policy report.
The committee considered the level of RoRCV 0 outperformance of the Ofwat Final Determination for the 2012 99% 100% 101% 102% 103% 104% 105% 106% 107% 108% LTIP.
This showed the average RoRCV over the three years Average annual RoRCV against the Ofwat final determination expectation ending in 2014 15 had outperformed the RoRCV Ofwat Final Determination by 1.14 times therefore resulting in 100% vesting.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 80 Remuneration Committee continued c Liv Gareld recruitment award The second tranche of Liv Garelds recruitment award will vest in May 2015.
It is subject to the same performance conditions as the 2012 LTIP awards and therefore will vest at 100%.
For the LTIP award this is based on the average share price over the final three months of the performance period 20.62 as the awards will not be released until after the end of the close period.
ii Michael McKeon stepped down from the board on 1 April 2015 and will subsequently be retiring on 31 May 2015.
As noted on page 85, he is being treated as a good leaver under the rules of the LTIP.
His award will vest as normal.
In accordance with the rules, there is no pro rata reduction since he served for the whole of the performance period.
iii Tony Wray retired from the board on 11 April 2014.
As noted in last years Annual Report, he is treated as a good leaver under the rules of the SMP and LTIP.
The awards vested on the normal vesting date subject to performance and a time pro rata reduction.
For the 2011 SMP award, time prorating was calculated to the nearest month.
For the 2012 LTIP award, time prorating was calculated to the nearest year in accordance with the rules of the plan.
ii Additional dividend equivalent shares may be released where provided in the rules.
iii Tony Wrays outstanding scheme interests have been adjusted to reect a time pro rata reduction following his retirement on 11 April 2014.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 82 Remuneration Committee continued a Long Term Incentive Plan awards The LTIP awards are granted as conditional shares.
The awards are subject to an RoRCV performance condition measured over three financial years.
Average RoRCV is compared with the baseline gure set out in the Ofwat Final Determination.
0% of each award vests if average RoRCV equals that set in the Final Determination, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% vesting for 1.02 x Final Determination and 100% vesting for 1.07 x Final Determination.
Ofwat are no longer publishing a baseline RoRCV gure in AMP6.
This impacts on the final year of the 2013 LTIP award and the final two years of the 2014 LTIP award.
However, an equivalent baseline gure can be constructed using the component numbers set out in the Ofwat model.
To ensure a like for like comparison between the baseline gure and how actual RoRCV will be calculated in those years, an adjustment has been made to increase the baseline gure to take into account the impact of expected income to be received under Pay As You Go which dictates what portion of total expenditure is treated like operating expenditure, and directly passed through into customers bills, and what is treated as capital expenditure and added to Severn Trent Waters asset base.
As noted on page 79, the 2012 LTIP vested at 100% on 1 April 2015.
However, as the company was in a close period, the release of awards will be made after this period ends.
The 2014 LTIP awards were granted on 16 July 2014.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted was 19.17 being the average price over the preceding three days.
b Share Matching Plan awards For the outstanding legacy Share Matching Plan awards, TSR performance is measured over three different measurement periods, each commencing on the date of grant 20% of each award is measured over 18 months, 30% over 27 months and 50% over 36 months.
25% of each part of the award will become eligible for vesting for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
However, for any of the awards to vest, the committee must be satisfied that the companys TSR is reective of the companys underlying performance over the full three year performance period.
The 2012 SMP awards will vest, subject to performance, on 25 May 2015.
However, the current indication is that the 2012 SMP will not meet the TSR performance measure and as such no shares will vest.
c Deferred shares under the Annual Bonus Scheme Each year, 50% of an executive directors annual bonus is deferred in shares for three years.
The awards are granted in the form of deferred shares.
The 2014 award relates to the deferral of the annual bonus for 2013 14.

The awards will be based on return on regulatory equity RORE over the three year period to 31 March 2018.
Our three year average RORE performance will be compared with the baseline RORE gure set by Ofwat in our Final Determination.
25% of the award will vest if average RORE matches the baseline gure of 5.65%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for outperforming the baseline by 1.29 times equivalent to 7.29%.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the threshold target is demanding and more challenging than the RORCV target set for the previous AMP.
It also considers that the upper target is very challenging and would require very significant ODI and nancing outperformance, together with a very high level of efficiencies, and was set signicantly ahead of analyst consensus.
