The feasibility study is expected to additional crushing and flotation circuits and be completed by the middle of 2017 and the balance for the desalination plant and will include pilot testing of a hydraulic roll water pipeline.
The Board will consider the crushing system which is being considered feasibility study for this project for approval in preference to conventional SAG and ball in late 2016 or in 2017, but a decision to mills.
A decision to proceed with the project proceed will only be made once market will only be made if it is supported by the conditions are suitable and an approved market outlook at the time.
If approval EIAis in place.
Production would commence is granted in 2017, production would in late 2019 at the earliest.
