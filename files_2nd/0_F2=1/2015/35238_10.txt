OUR MARKET CBREs views support our own estimates of 5-8% average ERV growth across our portfolio and for investment yields to remain firm in 2016.
Last year the Group continued to enjoy very favourable market Central London ofce development pipeline conditions with strong occupier demand underpinned by a growing UK economy.
The recent falls in public equity prices Floor area million sq ft Vacancy rate % and the value of oil and other commodities demonstrate that, 12 12 despite some recovery in the USA and European economies, overall economic growth remains fragile and faces a number ofrisks.
The latest estimates see the UK economy growing at about 2% pa over the next two years, one of the faster growth 9 9 rates amongst the G8 economies, and Londons growth rate is expected to remain in excess of the UK average.
This level of economic activity remains conducive to 6 6 employment growth and continuing low interest and ination rates in the UK.
CBRE forecasts Inner London ofce employment growth at 1.7% pa in the next five years.
Last year 14.5m sq ft 3 3 of central London ofce space was taken up, of which 4.4m sq ft was in the West End.
Total take-up was 3% below the previous years level, but remains well above trend.
The overall vacancy rate reduced to 2.5% Under construction Completed average in central London one of the lowest levels recorded, and to 2.2% in the West End.
Prime rental levels are now estimated at Source: CBRE 120 per sq ft in Mayfair and St. Jamess, 82.50 per sq ft in Fitzrovia and 68.50 per sq ft in the City.
The decline in the vacancy rate has led to a supply response with estimated above average central London completions West End ofce development pipeline in each of the next five years.
In total this adds up to a potential 35 million sq ft of space, or 16% of the current market.
Floor area million sq ft Vacancy rate % The net impact is likely to be lower than this as only 33%, or 3 12 11.6m sq ft, is under construction and, of this amount, 40% is pre-let or under offer.
The outcome is 6.9m sq ft of speculative space currently available which represents less than half of last years take-up.
The full impact of the 23.4m sq ft yet to start may be deferred due to planning delays and the availability 2 8 of finance.

Of this potential supply 2.5m sq ft is under 20 construction of which 30% is pre-let.
This leaves 1.7m sq ft under speculative construction representing 40% of last years take-up.
After the completion of White Collar Factory and the refurbishment of The White Chapel Building E1 later this year, 15 our subsequent committed major projects are all located in theWest End.
Last year saw 16.2bn of central London investment 10 transactions 8.2bn in H1, which was 2.3bn below 2014 levels with a smaller volume of deals above 100m.
Overseasinvestors continued to dominate, but the UK buyers share of the total increased to 42% from 31%.
CBRE reports 5 that demand weakened in Q3 before picking up again in Q4, and there was 4.5bn of ofce stock under offer at year end.
However, it expects to see more stock on the market as 0 someinvestors seek to take profits.
CBRE expects yields to 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 beunchanged in 2016 given the background of continuing Central London Central London average lowinterest rates and central Londons growth prospects.
Itestimates rental growth in the City and West End markets for Source: CBRE 2016 to be over 6%.
Our own portfolio has a more significant West End and Tech Belt weighting than the central London average, but CBREs views support our own estimates of 5-8% average ERV growth across our portfolio and investment yields to remain rm in 2016.
West End ofce take-up In the near term the London property market continues to face a number of specic opportunities and challenges.
Crossrail is Floor area million sq ft on track to open in 2018.
This will improve Londons east-west 6 connectivity and, in central London, the new service is expected to particularly benefit Tottenham Court Road and Farringdon.
Approximately half our portfolio is located near these two stations.
With Londons population growth expected to continue, attention has begun to focus on central Londons 4 next major rail project, Crossrail 2, but this is still uncommitted and the project is unlikely to complete before 2030 at the earliest.
If it goes ahead it will improve north-south connectivity, again running through Tottenham Court Road and with new stations in our Islington and Victoria villages.

Thenew rates will be set on April 2015 rental levels, whereas bn the current rates are set on April 2008 levels.
As most London 20 commercial property has experienced good rental growth in that period, business rates are likely to rise, although a transitional period, if adopted, could defer the full impact.
Although these costs are borne by our tenants, the rise in 15 overall occupation costs may affect future rental growth while these additional expenses are absorbed.
CBRE has recently Average estimated the impact across 19 central London locations.
10 Onan unweighted basis the average increase in rates on prime ofces is 40%, which translates into an average increase of occupational costs rates and rents of 11%.
Given that we have seen strong rental growth on our properties we would expect 5 to be affected and CBRE estimates that occupational costs in our largest village, Fitzrovia, will increase by 4%.
Based on their numbers, the successful Shoreditch and Farringdon locations could experience some of the higher increases of our villages, 0 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 with increases of 13% and 9% respectively.
These numbers Source: CBRE remain a matter of conjecture at this stage, but they suggest Tech Belt total occupancy costs will still remain substantially below most of the traditional core ofce locations.
Estimated business rates As well as these two specic catalysts there are two uncertainties based on upcoming votes.
On 5 May Londoners will choose a new Mayor, and, whatever the outcome, there psf are likely to be some policy changes.
In addition, a national 200 referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Union is to be held on 23 June.
We have previously discussed the additional property market uncertainty that we would 150 expect to see if the result was for the UK to leave the EU.
CBRE warns that the central London ofce market would be the most affected given the sensitivity of the financial services industry.
Our own portfolio would not be immune to any 100 potential fall out, but it has no exposure to the City core marketand financial tenants accounted for just 2% of our rentalincome in December 2015.
