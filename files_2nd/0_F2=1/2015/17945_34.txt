Renewable energy Other businesses BP has the largest operated renewables business among our oil and and corporate gas peers.
Our activities are focused on biofuels and onshore wind.
Biofuels business model and strategy Biofuels can be blended into traditional transport fuels without Comprises our renewables business, shipping, significant engine modifications to existing fuel-delivery systems.
BP is working to produce biofuels that are low cost, low carbon, scalable and treasury and corporate activities including centralized competitive without subsidies.
Our main activity is in Brazil, where we operate three sugar cane mills producing bioethanol and sugar, and exporting power made from sugar cane waste to the local grid.
We use our expertise and technology capabilities to drive continuing improvements in operational efficiency.
Our strategy is enabled by: Safe and reliable operations continuing to drive improvements in personal, process and transport safety.
Competitive sourcing concentrating our efforts in Brazil, which has one of the most cost-competitive biofuel feedstocks currently available in the world.
Low carbon producing bioethanol supported by low-carbon power generated from burning sugar cane waste.
These processes reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by around 70% compared with gasoline.
Domestic and international markets selling bioethanol domestically in Brazil and also to international markets such as the US and Europe through our integrated supply and trading function.
We are also investing in the development and commercialization of biobutanol, in conjunction with our partner DuPont.
Compared with At our Tropical BioEnergia plant in Brazil we process sugar cane to other biofuels, biobutanol has the potential to be blended with fuels in produce biofuels.

We are also investigating a number of chemical applications for this Financial performance advanced biofuel.
