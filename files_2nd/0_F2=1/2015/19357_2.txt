MARKET OVERVIEW Poundland operates in a dynamic and intensely competitive sector of the UK economy, general merchandise retailing.
We also trade from a wide variety of retail locations across high streets, shopping centres and retail parks.
Our sales of 1.1bn are generated across 17 different food and non-food product categories.
This breadth of product offer means that we compete with a broad range of large and sophisticated competitors in a wide range of retailing sectors.
Firstly we compete directly with the national grocery multiples Asda, Morrisons, Sainsburys and Tesco and other large national retailers e. g. Aldi, the Co-op, Costcutter, Iceland, Lidl and Spar.
Secondly we compete with specialist retailers that focus on certain segments e. g. Boots, Superdrug and WH Smith.
Lastly we compete with the newer and faster growing retailers in the value general merchandise sector e. g. B&M, Home Bargains, Wilkinsons.
Our recent brand launches include, Jane Ashers Kitchen, Make Up Gallery, Purple Ivy Jewellery, The Tasty Snack Company, indulgent and healthy snacking, Millie, our hair accessories brand, Nail Bar and most recently, Tommy Walshs DIY-time.
These, together with our amazing value every day offer across many household necessities, create an exciting shopping environment which drives on average 5.3 million shoppers through our doors every week.
We are pleased that our share of the total retail market is growing, but at just 0.3% of 334 billion, we believe that we have plenty of opportunity to grow our business as we move towards our 1,000 store target for the UK.
The key trends and features of the UK value general merchandise market are listed below: One of the fastest growing sectors within UK retail, having grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since 2007, predominantly driven by rapid store roll out: An established sector that continues to benefit from a structural shift in consumer behaviour towards value retailing: Significant long-term growth potential with the market forecast by PwC to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.3% per year between 2012 and 2017, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors, and also supported by evidence in the more mature US value general merchandise market: and While the value general merchandise market has primarily appealed to less affluent customers, there is now an increasing penetration by a broad social economic group.
While many new consumers entered the discount retail market during difficult economic times, research suggests that the majority of these customers will continue to use value retailers, even as the economy improves.
Research suggests that a number of these customers are from the higher socio demographic groups.

We think that this will benefit us and the discount market as a whole, as its addressable market increases.

Thanks to the enthusiasm and support of colleagues and customers, over 1.3 million has been raised, which is an amazing achievement and underpins our goal and values.

There have been a range of fancy dress days, tea parties in support of Macmillans Worlds Biggest Coffee Morning, a Spook fest for Halloween and wearing Christmas jumpers over the festive period, plus lots of great individual store activities, including taking part in the ice bucket challenge.
