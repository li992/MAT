Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT MANAGERS REPORT This was another successful year, during which we continued to implement the Groups investment and financing strategies, positioning it for further success.
Investment activity The Group acquired an additional 11 assets in 2015, bringing the total to 25: the portfolio was 100% fully contracted and income producing at the year end.
These are all high-quality assets, which further diversify the Groups portfolio by geography, tenant and size, and include five forward funded, pre-let developments.
