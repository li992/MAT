NOTES TO THE ANNUAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE DECLARATION Randgold reports its mineral resources and ore reserves in accordance with the JORC 2012 code and as such numbers are reported to the second significant digit.
Reporting standards are equivalent to National Instrument 43-101.
The reporting of mineral resources is based on a gold price of $1 500 oz.
The reporting of ore reserves is also in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7.
Reserve pit optimisations are carried out at a gold price of $1 000 oz for all pits.
Underground ore reserves are also based on a gold price of $1 000 oz.
Dilution and ore loss are incorporated into the calculation of reserves.
Cautionary note to US investors: The United States Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC permits mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proven and probable ore reserves.
