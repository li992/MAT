EDF Energy operates nuclear power stations around the world, including eight in the UK, where it hopes to build four more reactors at two sites.
Balance of plant areas typically include the turbine hall, water treatment and cooling systems.
Approval for Rotork IQ3 technology brings the benefits of increased functionality to the operation of valves and dampers in these areas.
