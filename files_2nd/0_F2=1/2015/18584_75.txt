In GKN, annual profit and margin targets for the Group and each division are set in line with the budget approved by the Board, which the Board approves in light of shareholder expectations, the Groups strategy and market conditions.
GKNs budget, and therefore STVRS targets, tend to be stretching as discussed in the Chairmans letter.
Cash targets for the Group and divisions included operating cash flow targets measured monthly over nine months, cash conversion targets measured at three points in the year and rolling three-month stock turn targets measured monthly over nine months.
These targets were based on the Groups budget.
The rationale for measuring cash on a monthly basis is to encourage smooth flow of cash throughout the year so as to incentivise sustainable cash flow.
Given the complex structure and number of targets with different targets across the four divisions relating to operating cash flow, cash conversion and stock turns we believe the disclosure of such targets would not be practical or meaningful to shareholders.
