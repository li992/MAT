com slugline Strategic Report Our strategic framework sets the direction and priorities for our business.
Last year we defined the following strategic pillars: Pipeline Delivery We must deliver our pipeline on time, at the right costs and with the expected returns.
It is also important that we refill the pipeline so that we get a constant flow of novel products in future years.
Our priorities are: Deliver existing pipeline projects to schedule.
Continuously refill the pipeline by identifying and evaluating new ideas.
a b c Portfolio Focus We are a specialist veterinary pharmaceuticals business focused on CAP, Equine and FAP.
Our portfolio is well positioned in our therapeutic focus sectors to assist in maximising returns.
We have recognised that we are underweight in FAP which represents 13% of our revenue.
Our priorities are: Maximise revenue and profit from existing CAP portfolio by focusing on clearly defined therapeutic sectors.
Develop and grow critical mass of FAP portfolio by extending our geographical reach.
Geographical Expansion The animal health market in emerging countries is growing rapidly due to the demand for high quality protein and the increase in pet ownership.
We have identified a number of markets that present both volume and profit opportunities in the medium to long term and we are evaluating various entry strategies.
In the US, we will grow the business organically in the short term with the launch of new products, including Osphos.
Our priorities are: Grow the US business and invest steadily in the infrastructure as our pipeline delivers.
Short term: establish subsidiaries in new territories with existing critical mass.
Medium term: build critical mass or enter via acquisition.
Long term: build a presence, where barriers to entry are high, through partnerships.
Acquisition While our strategy aims to deliver organic growth, acquisitions can accelerate our expansion by providing entry into new geographies, enhancing our portfolio or giving access to new technologies.
We have defined criteria through which potential acquisition targets can be screened.
Our priority is to target strategic acquisitions that will expand our geographical footprint and or enhance our product portfolio.
Strategic Enablers Our strategic enablers are critical to support the execution of our strategy: Our manufacturing and supply chain organisation is focused on running our operations efficiently and to high quality standards to maintain or improve margins: We are implementing a strong IT platform to enable us to operate efficiently and are exploring how IT can provide a source of competitive advantage: and Our people strategy underpins everything we do in the business.
We have a well-defined plan to build talent, develop people and strengthen the Dechra culture.
