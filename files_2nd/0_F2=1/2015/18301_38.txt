DLTIP awards to be made in the year ending 30 June 2016 The long term incentive plan DLTIP was approved by shareholders at the AGM in September 2014.
The long term incentive plan measures are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are selected to reward long term consistent performance in line with Diageos business strategy and to create alignment with the delivery of value for shareholders.
The DLTIP measures for awards to be granted in September 2015 are: Relative total shareholder return: reflects the value of share price growth plus dividends, thus measuring the value returned on shareholder investments: Organic net sales: sustained year-on-year organic net sales growth is a key performance measure: Cumulative free cash flow: measures the efficiency of cash management: and Adjusted eps growth: reflects profitability and is a key measure for shareholders.
The table below outlines the targets and the vesting profile for these awards.
The measures are equally weighted, with performance shares subject to performance against total shareholder return, net sales and cumulative free cash flow, and share options subject to performance against adjusted eps growth.
