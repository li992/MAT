Itprovides unique, high, long lasting performance without breaking down, changing colouror givingoffodour during exposure.
Newest development in slip additive technology There are numerous benefits of Incroslip onthe market when used in different applications, anditwas my responsibility to conduct the testing on development samples andthefinished product to prove its Unique chemistry uniqueperformance attributes delivers both high slip andhigh stability Phil McCoy Lead Applications Scientist Incroslip is new and unique chemistry, so I led the work on scaling this up from development samples to full-scale commercialised production at our manufacturing site in Hull, UK 3x Matt Jenkins Lead Engineer When exposed to UV light over time, performs uptothree times betterthanthe market leadingproduct The market need Slip additives are used in plastics to reduce friction between surfaces Without them you cantopen carrier bags or remove a screw top from aplastic bottle Standard slip additives candemonstrate poor oxidative stability, whichmeans they canloseperformance, change colour or give offunpleasant odours and tastes during high temperatures or ozone sterilisation The Croda solution Incroslip is the only slip additive on the market thatdelivers both high stability and high slip Itprovides oxidative stability in applications wheretaste and odour is critical, such as food packaging, and in automotive applications where high temperatures and UV lightcan cause other common slip additives tobreakdown It also performs better in tightenandrelease applications, such as screwcapsandcan be usedto lower friction during, forexample, bag production and packaging operations It also hasanti-scratch properties when used in variouspolymer systems, such as plastics in automotive interiors Croda International Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 21
