ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Regional Perspectives: EMEA How did you deliver against your 2015 priorities?
We delivered a strong performance in 2015.
Market conditions were sufficiently robust so that the investment we made in our teams, new disciplines and rolling out our Page Recruiting System PRS, started to benefit our performance.
We delivered gross profit growth for the year of 12%.
We also continued to monitor our costs, resulting in our conversion rate improving to 14.7%.
We had notable results in our German Page Personnel business, which grew 32% for the year, as we started to see the return on the headcount investment we made in 2014.
We also delivered a record year in Southern Europe, with collective growth of 28%.
We anticipate growth to continue into 2016, as we seek to maximise returns made on our investment in headcount and the roll-out of our PRS operating system.
Olivier Lemaitre Regional Managing Director What are your priorities for 2016?
In 2016 we anticipate good growth to continue and so we will focus on maximising the returns we have made in our fee earner headcount and the roll-out of our PRS operating system.
We will continue to focus on our fee earner productivity, ensuring that the new fee earners we added in 2015 get up to full productivity.
We will continue our transition to the European Shared Service Centre in Barcelona, and anticipate that we will be able to transfer the majority of the finance functions in the region during 2016.

The UK continued to perform well in 2015, with overall growth of 10%, and a notable result from Page Personnel, up 19%.
Oliver Watson Regional Managing Director What are your priorities for 2016?
We want to continue to develop the business.
We saw a slight tempering of growth during the fourth quarter of 2015 and, if this was to be prolonged into 2016, we may need to rethink our projected growth trajectory.
We will continue to develop our existing disciplines and, in particular, we will seek to drive the business into areas where margins are good and market dynamics are positive.

Overall for the year, Asia Pacific delivered growth of 5% in constant currencies.
We have diversified our offerings in the Asian markets throughout 2015 and sought to improve consultant productivity over the course of the year.
Trading conditions became more difficult as the year progressed, with concern over macro-economic conditions in China affecting confidence throughout the region.
We reacted by focusing more on our domestic clients rather than the multi-nationals.
In Australia, gross profit was down 2% in constant currency.
We made leadership and management changes in Australia during the second half, which, we believe, will enable us to better react to the current environment and growth opportunities that exist.
We will continue to diversify our offerings across the region, with particular focus on the domestic client base, where there are significant opportunities.
Gary James Regional Managing Director What are your priorities for 2016?
We will continue to monitor levels of demand throughout the region to ensure that we have the appropriate strategy to maximise future growth.
We will look to diversify our offerings across the region into the domestic client base, where there are significant opportunities.
Our focus will be on increasing productivity of our existing fee earners, but we will also seek to roll-out new disciplines to our existing office network.

In North America, 2015 was a record year, with growth of 18% in a business that now represents 8% of the Group.
This continues to be driven by our financial services business in New York and the tri-state area.
We have also sought to improve our profitability throughout the region.
Latin America continued to be a divergent market, with very tough economic conditions in Brazil, but very strong growth in the rest of the region.
We responded by actively managing our headcount in Brazil to ensure it remained profitable, but where possible moved these people to other countries where we saw strong growth.
North America delivered a record year, with particularly impressive growth of 18%, now representing 8% of the Group.
Patrick Hollard Regional Managing Director What are your priorities for 2016?
We will continue to actively manage our operations in Brazil to retain profitability.
In the rest of Latin America, we will continue to diversify our offerings through new disciplines being rolled out in our existing office network, as well as increasing our brand awareness.
In North America our priorities are to continue to drive the growth we have seen, particularly in our New York office.
We will continue to focus on retaining the best people, to drive further improvements in our conversion rate.
