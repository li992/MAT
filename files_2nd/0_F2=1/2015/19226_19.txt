Powers for the Company to Buy Back its Shares The Company was authorised by shareholders on 15 May 2015, at the annual general meeting, to purchase in the market up to 10% of its issued ordinary shares excluding any treasury shares, subject to certain conditions laid out in the authorising resolution.
This standard authority is renewable annually: the Directors will seek to renew this authority at the AGM.
The Directors did not exercise their authority to buy back any shares during the period.
Powers for the Company to Issue its Shares The Directors were granted authority at the previous annual general meeting on 15 May 2015, to allot shares in the Company: A up to one-third of the issued share capital: and B comprising equity securities up to two-thirds of the issued share capital but after deducting any allotments or grants made under A above in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue.
These authorities apply until the end of the AGM or, if earlier, until the close of business on 15 August 2016.
During the period, the Directors did not use their power to issue shares under the authorities provided by the shareholder resolution passed on 15 May 2015, but did satisfy options and awards under the Companys option and incentive schemes.
Following shareholder dissent to the Companys share allotment resolution at the 2015 annual general meeting, the Company will, at the AGM, seek a modified share allotment authority under two separate resolutions.
The first resolution will seek authority to allot shares up to one-third of the Companys issued share capital and the second resolution will seek authority to allot shares up to two-thirds of the Companys issued share capital in connection with a rights issue only and subject to allotments or grants made under the first resolution.
The substance of each allotment resolution will remain the same as at the 2015 annual general meeting and is in line with the Investment Association guidelines formerly guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers on the allotment of shares.
However, by proposing two separate resolutions, shareholders will now be able to more clearly express their views on the constituent elements of the previous, single allotment resolution.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise the authorities sought under either resolution, but the Directors wish to ensure that the Company has maximum flexibility in managing the Companys capital resources.
However, if they do exercise the authorities, the Directors intend to follow the Investment Association guidelines concerning its use.
Accordingly, at the AGM, shareholders will be asked to grant an authority to allot shares in the Company under two resolutions: resolution 1: up to one-third of the Companys issued share capital: and resolution 2: comprising equity securities up to two-thirds of the Companys issued share capital but after deducting any allotments or grants made under resolution 1 in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue.
These authorities will apply until the end of the next annual general meeting or until the close of business on 4 August 2017.
The Directors were granted authority at the previous annual general meeting on 15 May 2015, to disapply pre-emption rights.
It would give the Directors the authority to allot ordinary shares for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
This authority applies until the end of the AGM or, if earlier, until the close of business on 15 August 2016.
During the period, the Directors did not use their power to issue shares under this authority.
A new special resolution will be proposed at the AGM to renew the Directors powers to disapply pre-emption rights.
The new resolution, which follows the Pre-emption Groups revised Statement of Principles on disapplying pre-emption rights the PEG Principles, will seek an authority to disapply pre-emption rights over 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital not 5%, as previously.
The Directors intend to only allot shares representing more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under this authority, where that allotment is in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment within the meaning given in the PEG Principles which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
The Directors intend to follow the PEG Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling 3-year period where the principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5% of issued ordinary share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares should not take place without prior consultation with shareholders, except in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment as referred to above.
The power will expire at the earlier of 4 August 2017 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2017.
