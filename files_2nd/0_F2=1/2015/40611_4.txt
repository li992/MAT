Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT A COMPELLING BUSINESS Our Company has a number of important strengths, which we believe make us a compelling business.
We operate in an attractive market, which has powerful long-term growth drivers.
Our Investment Manager gives us a competitive advantage through its knowledge, expertise and relationships.
We have built one of the most attractive portfolios in the UK quoted real estate sector which, combined with a low cost base, generates a high-quality, sustainable and growing income stream.
This allows us to target a progressive dividend that can offer appealing risk-adjusted returns.
These strengths have helped us to secure a strong track record of delivery, as we have achieved the targets we set out at IPO: they also ensure that we remain well positioned for further success in the future.
The following pages explain more about our key strengths and how they position us for further success, building upon the excellent total Shareholder return performance delivered in 2015, as shown below: Total Shareholder return p Price Total change return 130 20.1% 24.1% 120 7.4% 10.6% 110 2.5% 0.9% 100 90 Tritax Big Box FTSE All-Share Index FTSE All-Share REIT Index 6 Source: Bloomberg Jan 15 Feb 15 Mar 15 Apr 15 May 15 Jun 15 Jul 15 Aug 15 Sep 15 Oct 15 Nov 15 Dec 15 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT: A COMPELLING BUSINESS 1.
An attractive market with powerful long-term drivers The fundamentals of the Big Box market are compelling.
Demand from tenants is strong because Big Boxes offer them significant economies of scale and cost savings not available from smaller, older buildings.
Equally they are vital for the swiftly evolving retail market and, in particular, for e-commerce, which is still at a relatively early stage of development and is growing rapidly in the UK.
At the same time, the supply of Big Boxes in the UK is highly constrained.
Their scale makes planning permission difficult to obtain in locations where they are required.
There are currently no new or very modern buildings of over 500,000 sq ft vacant or available and in the course of development.
Meanwhile, developers are not planning to construct speculative buildings of this size.
This supply demand imbalance benefits asset owners.
Building scarcity, the operational and financial efficiencies they provide, along with the significant investment in fit-out tenants make in technology and mechanisation, are the reasons they are prepared to sign long leases not often seen in other areas of the commercial property market.
Furthermore, this supply demand imbalance is producing, and is expected to continue to result in, attractive rental growth.

Our Manager gives us a competitive advantage Tritax Management LLP is our Investment Manager.
We benefit significantly from the Managers knowledge, expertise and relationships.
These allow the Manager to source and negotiate deals off-market, at attractive pricing levels, which offer good value for Shareholders and meet vendors desire for quick and certain execution.
This has given us a reputation as one of the industrys most reliable purchasers and forward-thinking owners and managers, making us the obvious choice for potential vendors of Big Boxes.
As well as exercising capital discipline and adding initial value through purchasing at attractive prices, the Managers asset management skills can create value throughout an assets life cycle, working collaboratively with tenants and using the Managers knowledge of their businesses to identify and carry out value protecting and enhancing initiatives.

An outstanding portfolio Since our IPO in December 2013, we have rapidly acquired an outstanding portfolio of 25 Big Box assets.
Our portfolio is well diversified by size, geography and tenant.
The assets are typically modern, occupy prime locations and are fully let on long leases to tenants with excellent covenant strength.
Many of our tenants have made significant investment in respect of internal fit-out and sophisticated automation, which can, and typically does, eclipse the cost of the actual building.
Such high levels of investment tends to demonstrate long-term commitment to the asset.
We believe these factors give us one of the highest quality portfolios in the UK quoted real estate sector and underpin our strategy to deliver low risk and growing income.

Attractive dividend income A stable income stream We believe that investors seeking income look for companies capable of delivering stable and reliable dividends for the longer term.

For 2016 we have increased our target dividend for the year to 6.2 pence per share.

All of our leases provide for upward only rent reviews, of which: 1 50% are reviewed to the open market, allowing us to capture the current and expected strong rental growth evidenced in the market: 1 26% include fixed and minimum rental uplift rent reviews, either providing a specified annually compounded percentage increase or a minimum and maximum annual percentage increase subject to RPI, providing predictable minimum increases in income: 1 18% have RPI linked rent reviews without a minimum level but subject to an annual percentage cap, providing a degree of inflation protection: and 6% is hybrid: The rent of our Marks and Spencer asset at Castle Donington is reviewed five yearly to the higher of open market or RPI, subject to a minimum of 1.5% pa and a maximum of 2.5% pa compounded annually.
Rent reviews typically take place every five years but we also benefit from some annual rent reviews.
Our portfolio is well balanced, with a number of rent reviews each year, which avoids having rent reviews clustered heavily in one or two years when the market might be weaker.

A strong track record of delivery We have exercised strong capital discipline, standing firm on our pricing policy and turning down numerous unsuitable opportunities.
Nonetheless, since listing, we have been successful in achieving our investment aims, acquiring an average of approximately one asset every month.
Our ability to complete transactions quickly is aided by our ready access to attractive finance.
The quality of our assets, the secure income they generate and our low cost base have enabled us to meet our objectives of an aggregate dividend of 6 pence per share in respect of 2015 and a net total return in excess of our target of 9% pa.
Since the year end we have also surpassed our original ambition to increase our NAV to more than 1 billion, and we aspire to grow further for the benefit of our Shareholders.
