THE MARKET UPDATE The second half of 2015 witnessed an increase in volatility with equity indices declining and risky credit spreads substantially widening.
Geopolitical tensions, an economic slowdown in emerging markets, Chinas devaluation of its currency, a decline in commodity prices and uncertainties over US interest rates contributed to heightened volatility in the markets.
The majority of global equity and fixed income indices posted negative returns for the year.
6 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT The last quarter of 2015 marked the first US Fed interest rate rise since the global financial crisis.
The much anticipated decision coincided with an almost immediate reaction by the worlds largest Platform Lending Club to increase its own borrowing rates for prime US consumers.
This increase in borrowing rates by Lending Club is a first signal of marketplace lenders willingness to align their pricing to base rates in order to compete with other fixed income opportunities.
The evolution of Lending Club interest rates over time and per credit grade can be seen below: Chart 1: Lending Club Interest Rate 30% 25% 20% 15% 10% 5% 0% Dec 08 Dec 09 Dec 10 Dec 11 Dec 12 Dec 13 Dec 14 Dec 15 A B C D E F G Gaps in series reflect no origination at that time.
Source: Lending Club The sell-off in equity markets driven by fears of a slowdown of the global economy, further reduction in oil prices and other factors may have impacted on the Companys share price.
As a listed entity, the Company is subject to overall market movements in equities, and whilst the Companys NAV growth remains stable and within target, the premium to NAV that the share price had accumulated in 2015 has been fully eroded by the end of the year.
A graph illustrating the movements in share price in 2015 can be seen below.

With the majority of the Companys exposure in consumer credit and small ticket SME lending, the Companys credit performance may better correlate to economic factors such as unemployment rates and wage growth rather than short term spread volatility in the credit markets.

As the Platforms gain more market share, they are likely to offer further opportunities to an alternative asset class via investing in well-diversified loan portfolios with low duration.
Stable labour markets, low interest rates despite a first rise in the US, lower oil prices and increasing consumer confidence are expected to have a positive impact on the performance of the Companys loan book.
As part of the investment process, the Investment Manager continuously assesses each Platforms underwriting and servicing quality and monitors loan book performance closely.
Moreover, the Investment Manager periodically updates the loan selection models as it gathers more information on the drivers of loan performance.
