Vesting of this award will be reported in the 2017 remuneration report.
2 The face value of each award has been calculated using the share price at time of grant 12.18 for the LTIP awards.
As receipt of these awards is conditional on performance, the actual value of these awards may be nil.
Vesting outcomes will be disclosed in the 2017 remuneration report.
3 In the 2014 Annual Report, the ROCE target range for the 2015 LTIP was stated as 9-13%.
This was to be calculated using Driving Value ROCE which excludes the impact of impairments taken post December 2013 on both attributable EBIT and Capital Employed see page 182 for the definition.
Subsequently, the Committee agreed to amend the assessment metric to Attributable ROCE which takes into account the impact of all impairments, in order to facilitate easy calculation of assessment metrics by users of the accounts.
The ROCE target range was restated to 10-14%, which recognises the lower capital base on which returns would be generated whilst retaining the original stretch.
