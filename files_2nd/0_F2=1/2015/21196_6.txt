Your Aviva Rainbows story Were delighted we can meet so many of our customers insurance and savings needs.
You could say we offer all the colours of the rainbow!
Thats especially apt for one of our customers in Changsha, in the province of Hunan, China, known to her friends as Rainbow.
Rainbow has been with ussince 2008 to meet her financial and insurance needs from savings to health cover.
And she even goes shopping and eats out with our agent, Ms Liu.
Rainbow isnt just a customer, shes a friend.
Shes also a fan of our Chunyu Online Doctor, part of her critical illness cover through Aviva.
This allows her to hold anonline consultation with a doctor when it suits her.
She finds it far quicker and more efficient than a time-consuming visit to a hospital or clinic.
Her top priority is her family, not least caring for her elderly parents.
But she also has a business to run and must travel for work.
So, when shes away and her father has had some of the inevitable aches and pains of age, she can make sure he is getting the My policy right care through the online doctor service.
Rainbow told us about anancient Chinese saying which roughly makes me translates as save something for a rainy day so you feel safe and can enjoy your life.
