Up to 10% of the issued shares may be held in treasury and may be subsequently cancelled or sold for cash in the market.
This gives the Company the ability to reissue shares quickly and cost efficiently, thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
While there are currently no shares held in treasury the Board would only authorise the resale of such shares from treasury at prices at or above the prevailing net asset value per share plus costs of the relevant sale.
If such a measure were to be implemented, this would result in a positive overall effect on the Companys net asset value.
In the interests of all shareholders, the Board will keep the matter of treasury shares under review.
