Business model Investment versus income Creating value through the mining lifecycle Mining is a long-term business and timescales can run into decades.
The period from initial exploration to the start of production often exceeds ten years and then, depending on the nature of the project and market conditions, it may take more than five years of operation to recoup the initial investment.
If possible, mines usually plan to exploit highergrade areas towards the start of the mine life in order to maximise returns from the operation.
As a result, average ore grades may decline over time, with production volumes decreasing along with revenues.
