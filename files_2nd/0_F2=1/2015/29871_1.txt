Introduction Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC TEMIT is an investment company that invests principally in emerging market companies with the aim of delivering capital growth to shareholders over the long-term.
When TEMIT was launched in June 1989, it was one of the first dedicated emerging markets funds in the UK to offer access to some of the fastest growing economies around the world.
Today, 26 years later, TEMIT continues to invest in these markets.
However, it now has many more investment opportunities to assess as an increasing number of economies come into the emerging or frontier market classifications and the number of dynamic companies open to investment continues to expand.
Emerging market companies are often under-researched and, as a result, often mispriced by the stock market, providing investors with attractive investment opportunities.
However, most individuals do not have the time, money or experience to find these opportunities.
TEMIT shareholders benefit from a large number of experienced investment professionals who are able to commit a wealth of resources, expertise and local understanding to uncover opportunities that their research indicates offers the best value emerging market investments around the world.
TEMITs research-driven investment approach and strong performance has helped it to grow to be the largest emerging market investment trust in the UK, with assets of 2.0 billion as at 31March 2015.
While the majority of the Companys shareholders are based in the UK, shares are quoted on both the London and New Zealand stock exchanges.
