74 IMI plc Financial statements FINANCE DIRECTORS INTRODUCTION Introduction from Daniel Shook Dear Shareholder Welcome to the financial statements section of our Annual Report.
My financial review commentary is set out in this section alongside the primary statements.
These financial statements are presented with the primary statements first, followed by five sections: Basis of preparation, Results for the year, Operating assets and liabilities, Capital structure and financing costs and Other notes.
I am very pleased with the progress the IMI Finance Team has made in 2015 to further strengthen our control environment and support our businesses.
In the year we fully launched a new, best-in-class Treasury Management System and made considerable progress in strengthening our financial controls.
All businesses performed two internal control reviews and declarations, providing evidence that our hard work is delivering improvements across the organisation.
Despite difficult market conditions, IMI continues to deliver good results and, importantly, advance its longer term strategic initiatives to position the Group for future growth.
The notes that follow will also provide explanations and additional disclosure to assist readers understanding and interpretation of the Annual Report and the financial statements.
