OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT AUDITORS REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT NOTICE OF MEETING INFORMATION OVERVIEW Introducing Foreign & Colonial Founded in 1868 as the first ever investment trust, Foreign & Colonial continually evolves: keeping pace with new investment opportunities and maintaining its relevance in todays world.
Our objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of publicly listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and Private Equity, with the use of gearing.
Our approach is designed to provide investors with the performance benefits of having concentrated individual investment portfolios together with the diversification benefits of lower risk and volatility that derive from being managed as part of a larger combined portfolio.
Conservatively managed and offering investors a globally diversified portfolio, Foreign & Colonial aims to be at the centre of an investors portfolio as part of a wider investment solution.
Foreign & Colonial is suitable for retail investors in the UK, professionally advised private clients and institutional investors who seek growth in capital and income from investment in global markets and who understand and are willing to accept the risks, as well as the rewards, of exposure to equities.
