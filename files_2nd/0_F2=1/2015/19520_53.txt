Governance Directors remuneration report continued | Annual report on remuneration continued Share option plan Outcome for the year ended 31 March 2015 audited Share options provide a direct and transparent link between executive pay and value creation for shareholders, as no gains are possible unless there has been an absolute increase in the share price.
Furthermore, to ensure that any share price increase is supported by a sustainable improvement in the groups underlying financial performance, additional performance conditions are applied before vesting of: two-thirds of the share options after three years: and one-third of the share options after five years.
If these performance conditions are not met, the appropriate proportion of share options will lapse, and there is no opportunity for retesting.
The vesting of share options for the executive directors for the performance periods ended 31 March 2015 is shown in thetable below, which for Alan Clark also includes share options granted in respect of services as an employee, rather than as, or incontemplation of appointment as, an executive director.
