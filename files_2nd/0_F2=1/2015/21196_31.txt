Activities during 2015 Governance, regulatory issues and reporting The Committee reviewed and agreed the Remuneration Policy, Principles and Framework Business Standard the Framework.
The Framework has been designed to take into account both the integrated assurance implementation programme framework and the SII regulations.
Under SII, it is a requirement for the Groups Remuneration Policy to be made available to all staff members, and therefore the Framework has been created as a separate document in a simple and understandable format The Committee received and considered a report from Internal Audit following an internal review of the adequacy and effectiveness of controls over the preparation, validation and evaluation of financial and non-financial bonus metrics and noted that no material issues had been identified The Committee received regular updates and briefings from management and the external advisor on regulatory issues The Committee considered and approved the implementation of malus and clawback provisions on incentive plans Share plans, performance testing and targets The Committee approved the 2015 LTIP and considered annual bonus targets for 2016 The Committee reviewed and amended plan rules where necessary The Committee considered the impact of the FLG acquisition on outstanding 2013 and 2014 LTIP targets and subsequently engaged with shareholders on adjustments to targets.
Consideration was also given to the appropriateness of the 2015 bonus targets, in light of the acquisition The Committee reviewed and approved the performance achieved for 2012 LTIP awards Senior management objectives and pay decisions The Committee benchmarked, reviewed and set salaries for the Group CEO, CFO and GE members from 1 April 2015 The Committee reviewed and approved the Group bonus pool for 2014, taking into account performance against financial KPIs and non-financial modifiers The Committee reviewed and approved the key individual objectives for 2015 for each member of the GE The Committee reviewed the detail and methodology for assessing the bonus pool for Aviva Investors, approving the maximum bonus pool and allocations.
Remuneration proposals for 2015 were considered and approved, including formal approval of the bonus targets and consideration of a new Aviva Investors LTIP The Committee ensured that remuneration outcomes were aligned with delivery against the strategic anchor, long-term sustainable growth, shareholder experience and the risk profile of the Group 106 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Governance Single total figures of remuneration for 2015 Executive Directors audited information The table below sets out the total remuneration for 2015 and 2014 for each of our EDs.

53.0% of the award will vest in April 2016.
An assumed share price of 491.68p has been used to determine the value of the award based on the average share price over the final quarter of the 2015 financial year.
3 As disclosed in last years report, Tom was eligible to receive a buyout award on a strict like for like basis to replace deferred compensation he had forfeited on resignation from his previous employer.
This award was made in 2015 once share dealing restrictions that applied during 2014 because of the FLG acquisition had lifted.
4 Pension contributions consist of employer contributions into the defined contribution section of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, excluding salary exchange contributions made by the employees, plus payments in lieu of pension above the lifetime or annual allowance caps.
From 1 May 2015, EDs are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan and receive pension contributions or a cash pension allowance from the Company of 28% of basic salary.
The cash pension allowance is payable where the annual or lifetime limits have been reached.

2015 annual bonus outcome The Groups financial performance, together with non-financial modifiers and personal performance have been used to determine ED bonuses paid in respect of 2015.
As communicated to shareholders, the targets were reviewed and adjusted to take into account the impact of the FLG acquisition.
The Committee is comfortable that the revised targets were no less difficult to achieve.
Targets and our performance against them for 2015 will be disclosed in next years report when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
The Committee believes that disclosing them so soon after the end of the relevant financial year may adversely impact the Groups business.
We have provided an indication of performance against the performance measures for 2015 in table 2.
As set out in this table, the bonuses reflect a year of strong financial performance for the Group, with performance against all financial measures with the exception of cash remittances exceeding target.
As initiated last year, the assessment of performance against financial targets for Annual Bonus outcomes has included a Quality of Earnings checkpoint step i. e. to provide further assurance that the performance reflects sustainable value for shareholders.
Equivalent considerations are applied in assessing the ROE performance for the LTIP, i. e. to ensure that LTIP outcomes are consistent with the experience of shareholders.
Shareholders approved increased at target and maximum annual bonus opportunities for the CEO as part of the Remuneration Policy adopted at the 2015 AGM.
In proposing the changes, we undertook that we would not pay more for the same performance and 2015 annual bonus outcomes reported here have been achieved against appropriately challenging hurdles.
New Executive Director Remuneration in relation to employment with Aviva Andy Briggs joined the Group as an employee on 13 April 2015, and was appointed to the Board as an ED on 29 April 2015.

It is recognised that there are challenges around employee engagement following the acquisition of FLG with significant change being experienced by some of our employees and the EDs recognise this is a critical area of focus.

2013 LTIP award vesting in respect of performance period 2013-2015 As mentioned in the Chairmans letter, the targets for both the 2013 and 2014 LTIPs were adjusted to ensure that they were appropriately calibrated for the enlarged Group to support the realisation of benefits from the acquisition and the achievement of the Groups strategic agenda.
Due to the fide-listing of FLG during the performance period, for the purposes of assessing TSR performance over the period, FLGs performance was re-invested in Aviva reflecting the subsequent conversion of FLG shares to Aviva shares.
Performance for the 2013 grant was assessed against the following companies: Aegon, Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, Axa, CNP Assurances, Direct Line Group, FLG with performance subsequently reinvested in Aviva, Legal & General, MetLife, Old Mutual, Prudential, RSA Insurance Group, Standard Life and Zurich Financial.
The Committee are satisfied that the targets are no less challenging in the context of the enlarged Group, and shareholders were supportive during the consultation process.
Given the timing of the appointment dates of our EDs, Mark is the only ED who will receive shares under the 2013 LTIP award.

As disclosed last year, Tom joined Aviva in April 2014.
Share dealing restrictions applied during 2014 because of the FLG acquisition and as a result it was not possible to make share awards during the 2014 financial year, therefore awards were based on the following share prices: A share price of 509.00 pence was used to calculate the CFO award, being the average of the middle-market closing price of an Aviva ordinary share on the three consecutive business days immediately preceding Toms start date.
A share price of 489.00 pence was used to calculate the LTIP award, being the average of the middle-market closing price of an Aviva ordinary share on the three consecutive business days immediately preceding the date of the main grant, on 24 March 2014.
The table below therefore includes some awards made in respect of 2014, but granted in 2015.

ROE targets for awards made in 2015 ROE targets determine the vesting of 50% of the LTIP award and are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return.
The 2015 targets are provided below and have been set in the context of the enlarged Group.
6 2015 LTIP ROE targets Achievement of ROE targets over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of ROE targets Less than 24.5% 0% 24.5% 10% Between 24.5% and 30% Pro rata between 10% and 50% on a straight line basis 30% and above 50% ROE is calculated as the IFRS profit after tax and non-controlling interest, excluding the impact of investment variances pension scheme income charge and economic assumption changes, over average IFRS equity excluding pension scheme net surplus deficit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company.
TSR targets for awards made in 2015 Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of the LTIP award.
Historically, FLG were a constituent of our TSR comparator group, however they fide-listed in April 2015 and so will be excluded for awards from 2015.
NN Group will be included in the comparator group going forward and it is considered an appropriate company for inclusion given its size, importance of life insurance within its portfolio and its mix of strong home position and multi-market presence.
Performance for the 2015 grant will therefore be assessed against the following companies: Aegon, Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, Axa, CNP Assurances, Direct Line Group, Legal & General, MetLife, NN Group, Old Mutual, Prudential, RSA Insurance Group, Standard Life and Zurich Financial.
The performance period for the TSR performance condition will be three years beginning 1 January 2015.
For the purposes of measuring the TSR performance condition, the Companys TSR and that of the comparator group will be based on the 90-day average TSR for the period immediately preceding the start and end of the performance period.

The vesting percentage was 50% which resulted in 128,891 shares, inclusive of shares awarded in lieu of dividends accrued, vesting at a share price of 549.85 pence.
This is the final payment made to Trevor Russell Walls retired from the Board with effect from 8 May 2013.

This is in line with the disclosure previously made in FLG acquisition documents.
All awards relate to the performance of FLG, and payments were determined by the FLG Remuneration Committee prior to the completion of the acquisition and relate to contractual arrangements between Andy and FLG.
In April 2015 Andy received an annual bonus paid by FLG in respect of services provided to FLG prior to the acquisition.
It was pro-rated for the period 1 January 2015 to 10 April 2015 and amounted to 157,461 50% of the maximum bonus available for that period taking into account achievement against performance measures.
Following the completion of the acquisition of FLG by Aviva, there were a number of long-term awards which vested as a result of the acquisition.
FLG Deferred Share Award Plan DSAP 116,362 shares - all awards vested in full one-third of annual bonuses in respect of 2013 and 2014 were deferred into shares FLG Performance Share Plan PSP 82,598 shares - PSP awards vested on the acquisition.
Performance was tested at the point of vesting, with 75% of the maximum paying out.
The awards were subject to time pro-rating to take into account the period between grant and vesting, and therefore the number of vested shares was reduced by 70% Whilst these awards were originally satisfied in FLG shares, they converted to Aviva shares at the point of acquisition given the structure of the transaction.
As set out in the announcement to the London Stock Exchange, on 14 April 2015, Andy sold these shares in April 2015 on the open market.
Andy retained a reportable interest in 222,903 Aviva shares post the acquisition and therefore met his shareholding requirement of 150% of salary at 31 December 2015.
In addition, Andy retains an interest in the FLG Long Term Incentive Plan.
FLG Long Term Incentive Plan FLG LTIP - the FLG LTIP was originally implemented by Resolution Ltd in 2009 and approved by Resolution Ltd shareholders in 2013 following modification.
It was structured as a private equity type arrangement to support a strategy of consolidation within the Life sector and an IPO of the consolidated businesses and, was therefore not a conventional share plan.
It was instead structured to reward growth in the value of the company if a stretching threshold level of performance was achieved, and was the only long-term incentive plan operated from 2009 to May 2014 The acquisition of FLG triggered payments under the plan rules.
The payments to participants were based on the offer price and achievement of a threshold level of performance i. e. percentage of absolute total return to shareholders and so were strongly aligned to shareholder value created.
Under the terms of the FLG LTIP, Andy is due to receive a total of 5.3 million under the plan 50% paid in September 2015, with the remaining 50% to be paid in September 2016.
Prior to Avivas acquisition of FLG, the FLG Remuneration Committee determined that payments under the plan would be in cash as permitted under the rules, and in line with the original plan design.

The emoluments he received in respect of this directorship for the 2015 financial year was 75,654.

Payments for loss of office audited information There were no payments for loss of office during the year.
Percentage change in remuneration of Group CEO The table below sets out the increase in the basic salary, bonus and benefits of the Group CEO and that of the wider workforce.
The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group, as all EDs are based in the UK albeit with global responsibilities, and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.

Marks bonus level was increased, as approved by shareholders in 2015 and his outcome reflects strong performance across the Group.
In comparison, for the major business units, performance during 2015 continued to be strong, but was not as strong as the outstanding results achieved in 2014, and the lower bonus outcomes for the individuals in these business units reflect that.
