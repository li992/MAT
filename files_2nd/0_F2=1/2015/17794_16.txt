STRATEGIC REPORT: COPPER Duncan Wanblad COPPER CEO Base Metals and Minerals In Chile, we have interests in two major copper operations: a 50.1% interest in the Los Bronces mine, which we manage and operate, and a 44% share in the Collahuasi mine: we also manage and operate the El Soldado mine and Chagres smelter 50.1% interest in both.
In Peru, we have an 81.9% interest in the Quellaveco project.

INTRODUCTION Our operations produce copper concentrate, copper cathodes, copper anodes and associated by-products such as molybdenum, silver and gold.
Escondida Morenci Collahuasi FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW Chuquicamata Underlying EBIT decreased by 81% to $228 million.
This El Teniente was largely due to a 20% decline in the average LME copper Los Bronces price, as well as lower by-product prices and a 7% decline Los Pelambres in sales volumes.
The decrease in revenue was partly Antamina mitigated by the effects of the weaker Chilean peso and a Grasberg $208 million reduction in on-mine cash costs of the retained Buenavista operations.
These were driven by cost-reduction initiatives Source: Wood Mackenzie and productivity improvements, including a 16% reduction in headcount at Los Bronces and an 18% reduction at Collahuasi.
At 31 December 2015, 197,631 tonnes of copper were provisionally priced at 214 c lb.
Provisional Anglo Americans share of Collahuasis production pricing of copper sales resulted in a negative underlying decreased by 3% to 200,300 tonnes owing to lower ore EBIT adjustment of $366 million 2014: $196 million.

Higher-cost oxide production Growth in mine supply outweighed underlying demand ramped down from 1 October, resulting in lost production growth in 2015, resulting in a market surplus for the of 3,000 tonnes.
In particular, prices were adversely affected by weaker construction activity and manufacturing output Production at El Soldado increased by 11% to 36,100 tonnes, in China, which accounts for almost half of global copper attributable to higher grades and increased recovery arising consumption.

LME copper prices steadily gained ground, peaking close Operational outlook to $3 lb in May.
Since then, bearish speculative funds have Production in 2016 is expected to be in line with 2015, driven prices lower, culminating in a retreat towards $2 lb when adjusted for the disposal of Anglo American Norte in the fourth quarter.
Sell-offs by investors have been fuelled and the curtailment of oxide production at Collahuasi, by volatile equity markets and concerns over Chinas which have a combined impact of around 120,000 tonnes.
A recovery in throughput at Los Bronces and Collahuasi For more information refer to the Marketplace review section is anticipated to be offset by expected lower grades, See pages 810 particularly at Los Bronces.
Full year 2016 production Operating performance guidance remains unchanged for the retained operations Production at Los Bronces was marginally lower at at 600,000-630,000 tonnes.
401,700 tonnes, with the impact of drought-related water restrictions on plant throughput offset by an increased cut-off grade and higher achieved recoveries.
The water restrictions had a net negative impact on production of 18,000 tonnes.
The operation is focused on its longer term water strategy, which aims to achieve greater resilience to extreme climatic conditions.
