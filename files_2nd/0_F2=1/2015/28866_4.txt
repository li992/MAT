Business model and strategy 15 Business model and strategy Our major source of income in our retail and commercial banking businesses is net interest income.
This is the difference between the income we earn from the loans and advances we have made to our personal, corporate and institutional customers and on our surplus funds and the interest we pay on deposits placed with us by our customers and on debt securities we have issued.
We also earn fees from financial services and other products we provide to our customers as well as rental income from assets we lease to our customers.
Our Corporate & Institutional Banking business also earns income from trading activities supporting its provision of financing and risk management services to customers, particularly Rates, Currencies and Financing.
We do business in competitive markets but we have strong franchises and good growth opportunities, and we aim to target our investment to maximise these opportunities.
Our Personal & Business Banking and Commercial & Private Banking franchises provide services to over 17 million personal and business customers in the UK and to over 1 million personal and business customers in the Republic of Ireland.
Our Corporate & Institutional Banking business focuses on large corporate clients operating in the UK and Western Europe, as well as serving global financial institutions.
