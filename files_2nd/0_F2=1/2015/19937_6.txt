See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 118.
1,322m Introduction Reported Underlying Our financial strategy remains focused on supporting the delivery of the corporate strategy.
We do so -8.5% -7.7% by ensuring the Group has access to sufficient capital to take advantage in times of growth as well as to cope during market downturns, and by monitoring business performance and taking appropriate action.
Following a successful renegotiation of the revolving credit facility during the year, we have a stable and Trading profit competitive capital base, which has been beneficial during what was a difficult trading period, particularly in the second half of 2015.
Our performance suffered as a result of the difficult markets and anticipating 124.0m this we moved swiftly to address our costs to protect returns, as discussed further below.
Reported Underlying 2015 Performance Overview -13.1% -14.0% After a reasonable start to the year the market started to deteriorate during the second quarter and continued to decline into the second half.
As noted in prior years, end-market demand volatility has long been one of the principal risks faced by the Group and one which we seek to mitigate through maintaining Headline EPS a balanced geographic and product portfolio, along with cost base flexibility.
We made progress in both areas: the portfolio balance was enhanced through the acquisition of Sidermes and growth in India and 28.1p North Asia, partially compensating for the deterioration in the European and NAFTA markets.
A variety of restructuring programmes were proactively launched during the year to reduce our cost base, Reported Underlying the benefits of which will continue to be felt going forward as we position ourselves for an eventual -16.0% -17.9% improvement in the market.
Until then we will continue to focus on our business performance, pursue all opportunities to improve our efficiency, maintain our asset and capital bases and remain vigilant for potential market opportunities.
Return on sales Against a backdrop of a 2.8% contraction in global steel production and very weak investment demand from the commodity sector, Group revenue fell, on an underlying basis, by 7.7% to 1,322m, 9.4% with underlying trading profit falling by 14.0% to 124.0m.
Reductions to operating expenses, due in part to the restructuring programmes, helped limit margin erosion to 70bps and we recorded a return Reported Underlying on sales of 9.4% for the year.
Earnings per share of 28.1 pence 33.4 pence in 2014 represents an -50bps -70bps underlying decrease of 17.9%.
The 2015 revenues were below our expectations, but the timing and speed of the market decline means that the year is best understood when split into two halves: the first half where we improved margins and the second half where we reacted quickly to cut costs and try to minimise margin erosion.
