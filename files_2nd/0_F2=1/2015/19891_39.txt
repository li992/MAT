Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance 75 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHARE INTERESTS UNAUDITED The table below shows the Executive Directors share ownership against the minimum shareholding requirements as at 31 December 2015 and the interest in NV and PLC ordinary shares of Executive Directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2015.
When calculating an Executive Directors personal shareholding the following methodology is used: Base salary at the date of measurement.
Shares in either Unilever PLC or Unilever N. V. or a combination of both will qualify provided they are personally owned by the Executive Director or by a member of his immediate family connected person.
Shares purchased under the MCIP from the annual bonus will qualify as from the moment of purchase as these are held in the individuals name and are not subject to further restrictions.
Shares or entitlements to shares that are subject only to the Director remaining in employment will qualify on a net of tax basis.
Shares awarded on a conditional basis by way of the GSIP, or the MCIP, will not qualify until the moment of vesting ie once the precise number of shares is fixed after the three-year vesting period has elapsed.
The shares will be valued on the date of measurement or, if that outcome fails the personal shareholding test, on the date of acquisition.
The share price for the relevant measurement date will be based on the average closing share prices and the euro sterling US dollar exchange rates from the 60 calendar days prior to the measurement date.
Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of 100% of their shareholding requirement for 12 months post cessation of employment at Unilever, and 50% of these shares for 24 months post cessation of employment with Unilever.
