Governance Share award plan Outcome for the year ended 31 March 2015 audited Share awards comprise performance shares and value shares to incentivise and reward executives for achieving: long-term financial performance adjusted EPS growth over three years through the vesting of performance shares: and long-term external relative performance TSR outperformance of the median of a comparator group over three, four and five years through the vesting of valueshares.
The number of shares which can be released under a value share award is dependent upon TSR outperformance compared with a comparator group identified on page 90 so that: at median or below median TSR performance, no shares will vest: but for every 10 million of additional shareholder value created above the median, a pre-determined fixed number of shares will vest.
The table below shows the vesting of the performance shares and value shares for the year ended 31 March 2015.

2 This award was made to Alan Clark in June 2010 when he was Managing Director of SABMiIler Europe and was not made in respect of his services, or in contemplation of his appointment, as an executive director, but is nevertheless disclosed for completeness, although not required to be disclosed by the regulations.
3 In accordance with the plan rules, value shares awarded before 2013 may be released from the third anniversary of the award date, but a proportion of the shares are deferred.
If released before the fourth anniversary, two-thirds are deferred: and if released after the fourth but before the fifth anniversary, one-half are deferred.
Accordingly, when Jamie Wilsons value share award granted on 1 June 2011 was released on 20 June 2014, two-thirds of the resulting shares were deferred, with only one-third of the shares 17,866 shares vesting at that time.
The share price at vesting was 34.0258.
Subsequently, when Jamie ceased to be an employee on 31 March 2015, his deferred shares were forfeited.
