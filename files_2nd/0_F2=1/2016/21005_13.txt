Our Capabilities: Product 34 PRODUCT Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To ensure we are simple to do business with, Cannes Lions significantly overhauled its customer experience this year including improvements to its accommodation services, signposting at the event itself and badge collection at the Palais.
This included more desks, longer opening hours, new printers, instant scan barcode email and smart paper badges.
As a result, peak waiting times at registration fell from 45 minutes in 2015 to 3 minutes in 2016.
These and other changes resulted in positive shifts in customer satisfaction scores for key experience indicators including badge pick up 27%, WiFi 12%, access to talks 7%, app usability 3%.
Overall Net Promoter Score NPS for the Festival was up 4% to 47%.
Making us easier to do business with is a key driver of our business and progress with Cannes Lions shows where we are getting this right.
