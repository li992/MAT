Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
General Information and Basis of preparation 1.1 General information SSE plc the Company is a company domiciled in Scotland.
The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The Groups operations and its principal activities are set out earlier in this Report at pages 1 to 65.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.
1.2 Basis of preparation Statement of compliance The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 17 May 2016.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Further details of the Groups liquidity position and going concern review are provided in note 34 of the Financial Statements on page 175.
Basis of measurement The financial statements of the Group and the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, availablefor-sale financial assets and assets of the Group pension schemes which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view.
The financial statements of the Group and Company are presented in pounds sterling.
Operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling are included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Groups foreign currencies accounting policy.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at page 127 and 129.
Summary of significant new accounting policies and reporting changes The basis of consolidation and principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and in the Accompanying Information section A1 on pages 191 to 204.
No new accounting standards have been adopted by the Group that have a material impact on the financial statements in the current year.
The following issued standards have not yet been adopted by the Group: i IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is effective on 1 January 2018 and thus to the Group from 1 April 2018, subject to European Union EU endorsement: ii IFRS 16 Leases is effective on 1 January 2019 1 April 2019 to the Group, subject to EU endorsement: iii IFRS 9: Financial instruments which will be effective on 1 January 2018 1 April 2018 to the Group, subject to EU endorsement.
The Group has commenced initial assessment of the impact of these standards on the consolidated financial statements.
However, at this stage, it is not yet practicable to quantify the impact these standards will have.
The assessment of IFRS 15 will consider matters such as bundled goods and services, the allocation of transaction price to performance obligations, treatment of customer acquisition costs and contracts with variable consideration.
The assessment of IFRS 16 will require, with certain exceptions, obligations associated with contracts currently designated as operating leases to be recognised on balance sheet as lease liabilities.
The definition of a lease has also been modified which may impact which contracts the Group accounts for as leases.
In addition to these, there are a number of other amendments and annual improvement project recommendations that are not yet effective but which have been endorsed by the EU.
These are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations which were effective on 1 January 2016 clarifies that the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
This is not expected to represent a change in Group accounting policy.
Basis of presentation The Group applies the use of adjusted accounting measures throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
These measures enable the Directors to present the underlying performance of the Group and its segments to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner.
The adjustments applied and certain terms such as adjusted operating profit.
adjusted EPS and adjusted net debt and hybrid capital are not defined under IFRS and are explained in more detail below.
i Adjusted measures The Directors assess the performance of the Group and its reportable segments based on adjusted measures.
These measures are used for internal performance management and are believed to be appropriate for explaining underlying performance to users of the accounts.
These measures are also deemed the most useful for the ordinary shareholders of the Company and for other stakeholders.
The performance of the reportable segments is reported based on adjusted profit before interest and tax adjusted operating profit.
This is reconciled to reported profit before interest and tax by adding back exceptional items and certain re-measurements see note 3 ii below and after the removal of interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The performance of the Group is reported based on adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements see below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The interest costs removed are non-cash and are subject to variation based on additional valuations of scheme liabilities.
The Groups key performance measure is adjusted earnings per share EPS, which is based on basic earnings per share before exceptional items and certain re-measurements see note 3 ii below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and after the removal of deferred taxation.
Adjusted profit after tax is presented on a basis consistent with adjusted EPS except for the exclusion of payments to holders of hybrid equity.
The financial statements also include an adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure.
This presents financing information on the basis used for internal liquidity risk management.
This measure excludes obligations due under finance leases, non-recourse debt associated with Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited see note 4.2 iv and includes cash held as collateral on commodity trading exchanges and other short-term loans.
The measure represents the capital owed to investors, lenders and equity holders other than the ordinary shareholders.
As with adjusted earnings per share, this measure is considered to be of particular relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.
Reconciliations from reported measures to adjusted measures along with further description of the rationale for those adjustments are included in the SSEs financial results explained section at pages 117 and 118. ii Exceptional items and certain re-measurements Exceptional items are those charges or credits that are considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
The trigger points for exceptional items will tend to be non-recurring although exceptional charges may impact the same asset class or segment over time.
Market conditions that have deteriorated significantly over time will only be captured to the extent observable at the balance sheet date.
Examples of items that may be considered exceptional include material asset or business impairment charges, business restructuring costs, significant gains or losses on disposal and contractual settlements following significant disputes and claims.
The Directors consider that any gain or loss on disposal of greater than 30.0m would be disclosed as being exceptional by nature of its scale.
Other gains or losses on disposal below this level may be considered to be exceptional by reference to specific circumstances which will be explained on a case-by-case basis.
Certain re-measurements are re-measurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are accounted for as held for trading or as fair value hedges in accordance with the Groups policy for such financial instruments.
This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IAS 39 where held for the Groups own use requirements which are not recorded until the underlying commodity is delivered.
iii Other additional disclosures As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, the Groups income statement discloses additional information in respect of joint ventures and associates, exceptional items and certain re-measurements to aid understanding of the Groups financial performance and to present results clearly and consistently.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements.
The Groups key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted with the most Significant Financial Judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.
4.1 Significant Financial Judgements Estimation Uncertainties The preparation of these Financial Statements has specifically considered the following Significant Financial Judgements which are all areas of estimation uncertainty.
127 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 4.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued i Impairment testing and valuation of certain Non-Current Assets Estimation Uncertainty The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets and to determine whether any impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded.
Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section at pages 191 to 204.
In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering the recoverable amount of the respective assets or cash-generating units CGUs.
The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2016 are goodwill, thermal power generation assets, wind farm CGUs, gas storage assets and exploration and production E&P assets.
Changes to the estimates and assumptions on factors such as regulation and legislation changes, power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, expected 2P reserves, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Groups income statement and balance sheet.
Further detail of the basis and assumptions used in the impairment review conducted for the financial year, and the resulting impairment charges, is included at note 16. ii Revenue recognition estimated energy consumption Estimation Uncertainty Revenue from Retail energy supply activities includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This estimation will comprise of values for billed revenue in relation to consumption from unread meters based on estimated consumption taking account of various factors including usage patterns and weather trends disclosed as trade receivables and for unbilled revenue disclosed as accrued income.
The volume of unbilled electricity or gas is calculated by assessing a number of factors such as externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers, amounts billed to customers and other adjustments.
Unbilled income is calculated by applying the tariffs relevant to the customer type to the calculated volume of electricity or gas.
This estimation methodology is subject to an internal corroboration process that provides support for the judgements made by management.
This process requires the comparison of calculated unbilled volumes to a benchmark measure of unbilled volumes which is derived using independently verified data and by assessing historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and actual meter data that is used in industry reconciliation processes for total consumption by supplier.
This aspect of the corroboration process, which requires a comparison of the estimated supplied quantity of electricity and gas that is deemed to have been delivered to customers and the aggregate supplied quantity of electricity or gas applicable to the Groups customers that is measured by industry system operators, is a key judgement.
The assessment of electricity unbilled revenue is further influenced by the impact on national settlements data or feed-in-tariff supported volumes and spill from solar PV generation.
The experience of the Group is that the industry estimated supplied quantities in gas have historically been higher than actual metered supply.
To take account of this, the Group applies a further judgement, being a percentage reduction to unbilled consumption volume, to the measurement of its unbilled revenue in the financial statements.
It is expected that this judgement will become less critical as the industry transitions to smart meter technology.
The sensitivity associated with this judgement factor is disclosed at note 21 on page 158. iii Valuation of trade receivables Estimation Uncertainty The basis of determining the provisions for bad and doubtful debts is explained at note 34 in the section on credit risk and aged debt.
While the provisions are considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to the income statement.
iv Retirement benefits Estimation Uncertainty The assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the period are based on the Groups best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries.
While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.
The value of scheme assets are impacted by the asset ceiling test which a restricts the surplus that can be recognised to assets that can be recovered fully through refunds and b may increase the value of scheme liabilities where there are minimum funding liabilities in relation to agreed contributions.
Further detail on the estimation basis is contained in note 32.
4.2 Other key accounting judgements Other key accounting judgements applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements include the following: i Business Combinations and acquisitions Accounting Judgement Business combinations and acquisitions require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, to a certain extent, on managements judgement.
The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of this purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities with any unallocated portion being recorded as goodwill.
Business combinations are disclosed in note 19. ii Energy Company Obligation ECO costs Accounting Judgement The Energy Company Obligation ECO legislation, in force since 1 January 2013, requires qualifying energy suppliers to meet defined targets by providing measures to improve the energy efficiency of and level of carbon emissions from UK domestic households.
The targets for the Groups Energy Supply business are set based on historic customer information with delivery of the measures being required by 31 March 2017.
The Group believes it is not technically obligated to provide those measures until the end of the delivery period.
As a consequence and applying applicable accounting standards, the costs of ECO are recorded when measures are delivered or other qualifying expenditure has been incurred.
iii Treatment of disputes and claims Accounting Judgement The Group is exposed to the risk of litigation, regulatory judgements and contractual disputes through the course of its normal operations.
The Group considers each instance separately in accordance with legal advice and will provide or disclose information as deemed appropriate.
Changes in the assumptions around the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources or the estimation of any obligation would change the values recognised in the financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued iv Consolidation of interest in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited Accounting Judgement On 18 March 2016, the Group completed the sale of 49.9% of the equity in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited Clyde.
Details of this transaction are included at note 19.
The Group is providing project and contract management services for and 100% of the funding for the construction of the 172.8MW extension of the wind farm.
As part of this arrangement, the Group has retained a casting vote over the engineering, procurement and construction of the extension and certain rights over the construction of the extension.
Under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the extension is considered to be a relevant activity which significantly affects the future returns from Clyde and the rights retained by the Group have been concluded to confer power to control the relevant activities of Clyde to the Group.
As a consequence, this entity has been fully consolidated into the Groups financial statements.
This means that the gain on the transaction has been recorded in equity and the co-venturers ownership share is represented as a noncontrolling interest.
On 13 May 2016, the Group agreed to waive those contractual rights which gave rise to the judgement that power to control the relevant activities existed over Clyde.
All other contractual arrangements remain in place.
As a consequence, the Group will prospectively account for its interest in Clyde as that of an investment in an equity-accounted joint venture.
One of the impacts of that change to consolidation basis will be to remove the equivalent to the 200.7m of non-recourse borrowings held by Clyde from the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
In addition, the Groups interest in the entity is expected to remain that of an equity-accounted joint venture following completion of the extension construction project.
Given this change in circumstance and on the basis the 200.7m debt item is non-recourse to the Group, this item has been excluded from the Groups adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure.
4.3 Other areas of estimation uncertainty i Provisions and contingencies The assessments undertaken in recognising provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with IAS 37.
Provisions are calculated based on estimations.
The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events has required best judgement by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss.
Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.
ii Decommissioning costs The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment assets is reviewed periodically and has been reassessed in the year to 31 March 2016.
Decommissioning costs in relation to gas exploration and production assets are based on expected lives of the fields and costs of decommissioning.
Provision is made for the estimated discounted cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date.
The dates for settlement of future decommissioning costs are uncertain and are currently expected to be incurred predominantly between 2017 and 2040. iii Gas and liquids reserves The volume of proven and probable 2P gas and liquids reserves is an estimate that affects the unit of production depreciation of producing gas and liquids property, plant and equipment.
This is also a significant input estimate to the associated impairment and decommissioning calculations.
The impact of a change in estimated proven and probable reserves is dealt with prospectively by depreciating the remaining book value of producing assets over the expected future production.
If proven and probable reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be affected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write-down impairment of the assets book value.
Segmental information The Groups operating segments are those used internally by the Board to run the business and make strategic decisions.
The Groups main businesses and operating segments are the Networks business comprising Electricity Distribution, Electricity Transmission and Gas Distribution: the Retail business comprising Energy Supply, Enterprise and Energy-related Services, and: Wholesale comprising Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation, Gas Storage and Gas Production.
In March 2014, the Group announced its intention to reorganise its activities so that there are separately auditable legal entities responsible for its Energy Supply, Energy Portfolio Management EPM and Electricity Generation activities.
This change was made to enhance the transparency of the measurement and reporting of the performance of these activities.
There is now a subsidiary company, SSE EPM Limited, which is responsible for managing the Groups commodity requirements.
The establishment of this company does not change the Groups basis of inter-segmental pricing or its basis of reporting operational performance to the Board.
The methodology in place promotes market reflectivity and closely aligns with the operational decision-making in the respective businesses.
EPM and Electricity Generation continue to be reported to the Board as a single reportable operating segment.
129 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 5.

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.1 Exceptional items In the year to 31 March 2016, the Group recognised net exceptional charges of 889.8m.
This consisted of asset impairment and related charges totalling 892.5m, exceptional provisions of 54.9m and net exceptional gains on disposal of 57.6m.
The 138.6m gain on the part disposal of Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited has been recognised directly in equity and therefore does not form part of the Income Statement and therefore total exceptional gains on disposal were 196.2m.
Detail on the accounting judgements applied in relation to this transaction and the transaction itself are included at note 4.2 iv and note 19.3.
The exceptional charges recognised can be summarised as follows: Property, plant Goodwill and Total and equipment other intangibles Inventories Other impairment Provisions Total note 15 note 14 note 20 charges related note 28 charges m m m m m m m Coal Generation i 67.6 87.9 83.2 238.7 48.3 287.0 Gas Generation ii 302.5 2.2 3.7 18.0 326.4 326.4 Gas Production iii 125.0 27.2 9.6 161.8 161.8 Gas Storage iv 150.9 150.9 150.9 Other v 11.2 3.5 14.7 6.6 21.3 646.0 40.6 91.6 114.3 892.5 54.9 947.4 i Coal-fired Generation.
On 20 May 2015, the Group announced that operations at Ferrybridge would cease at 31 March 2016 and consequently exceptional charges including the recognition of restructuring provisions, impairment of inventory and other costs have been recognised 72.0m.
On 30 March 2016, the Group announced that following a consultation process and success in securing a contract to provide ancillary services to National Grid for one year from 1 April 2016, operations at Fiddlers Ferry would continue and that SSE would enter all or part of the capacity at Fiddlers Ferry into any 2017 18 Capacity Market auction.
Nonetheless, the challenging economic and regulatory conditions facing coal-fired generation in the UK means that the long-term future of Fiddlers Ferry remains uncertain.
In addition, SSEs longer-term strategic involvement in coal-fired generation and coal procurement is now under review.
As a result, further exceptional charges have been recognised including impairment of the value of plant 67.6m and inventory 47.9m at Fiddlers Ferry and accelerated decommissioning costs recorded directly as a charge to the income statement and, included in other charges, irrecoverable current assets and financial losses relating to cessation of coal hedging activities totalling 99.5m.
Following these charges, the residual value of the Groups coal generation plants is nil.
Following the failure of Peterhead Power Station to win a capacity contract under the Capacity Market Auction for 2019 20 and the announcement, on 25 November, that the UK Government was withdrawing funding support for the proposed carbon capture and storage project at Peterhead Power Station, exceptional charges of 129.3m have been recognised in relation to the assets at the site.
The economic conditions for the Groups other main Gas-fired Generation plants in Great Britain Medway, Keadby and Marchwood remain challenging.
While the Groups long term view remains that the impact of regulatory changes will create a favourable economic environment for gas-fired generation, there has as yet been no observable recovery in spark spread margins at these plants and there remains uncertainty in relation to the enduring ability of the plants to benefit from the UK Governments Capacity Market process.
As a result, further impairment charges have been recognised of 197.1m, principally in respect of Marchwood and Medway plant and certain contractual prepayments.
Following these charges, the residual value of the Groups GB gas generation plants under review is 226.2m.
Impairment of the Groups Gas Exploration and Production assets in the North Sea has been recognised predominately due to declining wholesale gas prices.
The exceptional charges recognised include an element 121.2m related to the impairment of Greater Laggan field assets acquired at 28 October 2015 which reflects the impact of the decline in expected long term gas prices between the acquisition date and the financial year end.
The other impairments relate to the impact of the fall in wholesale gas prices on the Groups other E&P assets at Sean, Lomond, Bacton and ECA 40.6m.
Following these charges, the residual value of the Groups gas production assets is 888.0m.
Current and forecast demand for gas storage in Great Britain continues to be impacted by reduced short term price volatility and seasonal spreads in the wholesale gas market.
These factors have had different but significant impacts on the Groups facilities at Hornsea Atwick and Aldbrough.
As a result, exceptional charges of 150.9m have been recognised across both assets.
Following these charges, the residual value of the Groups gas storage facilities is 21.2m.
Other exceptional charges have been recognised in relation to impairment of system development projects, restructuring charges and exit costs associated with the strategic exit from certain non-core activities.
Further detail on the basis of impairment review across all asset categories is included in note 16 to these financial statements.
The Group recognised 57.6m of exceptional net credits arising from disposals.
On 28 May 2015, the Group recognised an exceptional gain on disposal of 39.3m in relation to the sale of three onshore wind development sites to Blue Energy.
In addition, the Group also recognised a gain on its disposal of its interest in the Galloper offshore wind development of 18.3m.
The latter disposal gain is considered to be exceptional due to the Group having previously impaired its investment in Galloper as part of its decision to scale back its commitment to offshore wind development.
Further detail is included at note 19.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued In the previous financial year, the Group recognised exceptional charges arising from and related to asset impairments amounting to 667.5m and provisions of 56.0m.
The exceptional charges recognised can be summarised as follows: Property, plant Goodwill and Total and equipment other intangibles Inventories Other impairment Provisions Total note 15 note 14 note 20 charges related note 28 charges m m m m m m m Coal Generation 222.7 41.0 45.8 309.5 4.0 313.5 Gas Generation 14.9 51.5 66.4 10.0 76.4 Gas Production 61.9 44.1 0.1 106.1 106.1 Gas Storage 162.4 162.4 1.5 163.9 Other 16.9 6.2 23.1 40.5 63.6 478.8 95.6 41.0 52.1 667.5 56.0 723.5 The impairments of Coal generation plants followed the 31 July 2014 fire at Ferrybridge and the inability of both units at Ferrybridge and one unit at Fiddlers Ferry to secure agreements to provide capacity under the auction process run by DECC in December 2014.
The impairments of Gas generation plants predominately related to development sites at Abernedd and Seabank.
The impairments of Gas Production assets related to the impact of declining wholesale prices on the Groups Sean, ECA and Lomond fields.
The charges associated with Gas Storage followed the strategic review of the Groups operations in that segment the results of which were announced on 26 March 2015.
The other charges mainly relate to asset impairments, other charges in non-core businesses and provisions for certain disputes and claims.
The exceptional disposal gains recorded related to the sale of seven street lighting PFI companies to Equitix 38.0m, the Groups share of the dividend from Environmental Energy Funds disposal of its stake in Anesco 19.6m and the gain on disposal of non-core retail assets 17.2m.
As supplemental detail, the following table represents the exceptional charges recognised in the financial year to 31 March 2014 presented in similarformat: Total Property, plant Goodwill and Other impairment Total and equipment other intangibles charges related Provisions charges m m m m m m Restructuring Non-core 35.2 2.0 36.0 73.2 58.9 132.1 Wind 17.0 75.9 47.6 140.5 140.5 Coal Generation 191.6 47.0 238.6 238.6 Gas Storage 111.4 26.3 137.7 137.7 Other 17.5 18.7 15.7 51.9 46.4 98.3 372.7 122.9 146.3 641.9 105.3 747.2 The  charges followed the announcement, on 28 March 2014, that the Group was intending to dispose of a number of non-core assets and businesses, embark upon a programme of voluntary early release for around 500 employees and scale back its commitment in relation to offshore wind developments.
The impairments of the coal plants followed a period of relatively favourable operating conditions for Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge but were necessary in context of the increasing impact on profitability of the Carbon Price Support CPS mechanism and uncertainty around future political and regulatory support for coal generation.
The impairment of Gas Storage was due to the impact of market and global factors such as North American fracking and availability of LNG on the business.
The 2014 financial statements noted that there remains inherent imprecision in the valuation processes for these long-term infrastructure assets which is dependent on macro-economic factors.
Management believe a balanced position has been taken regarding these factors.
The other charges relate to impairments of certain Retail developments and provisions for certain disputes and claims.
7.2 Certain re-measurements The Group enters into forward commodity purchase and sales contracts to meet the future demand requirements of its Energy Supply business and to optimise the value of its Generation and other Wholesale assets.
Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IAS 39 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IAS 39 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements.
The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.
The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 18 months.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
The remeasurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category also includes the income statement movement on financing derivatives and hedged items as described in note 34.
7.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates Finance No.
2 Act 2015 which received royal assent on 18 November 2015 enacted a Corporation tax rate of 19% currently 20% from 1 April 2017, and a rate of 18% from 1 April 2020.
As these changes have been substantively enacted they have the effect of reducing the groups deferred tax liabilities by 27.6m including the impact of changes recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
A further change to reduce the rate of Corporation Tax to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in Finance No.
2 Bill 2016, however as this change has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date its effect, estimated to be 21.0m, has not been brought into account in calculating the groups deferred tax liabilities.
137 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 7.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates continued A resolution was passed under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 on 22 March 2016 which reduced the rate of Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT to 0% from 35% with effect from 1 January 2016.
As this change has been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date it has the effect of reducing the groups deferred tax liabilities by 2.8m.
2 Bill 2016 announced a reduction in the rate of Supplementary Charge on ring-fenced profits to 0% previously 20% with effect from 1 January 2016.
As this change has not been enacted at the balance sheet date it has not been brought into account in calculating the groups deferred tax liabilities.
It is expected to reduce the groups deferred tax liabilities by 9.0m.

The Groups Gas Production business is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 29% combined 62%.
In addition, profits from the Sean gas field were subject to petroleum revenue tax PRT at 50% until 1 January 2016 which is deductible against corporation tax, giving an overall effective rate for the field of 75%.
Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.
Capital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on property, plant and equipment.
The rates are determined by Parliament annually, and spread the tax relief due over a number of years.
This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the expenditure on property, plant and equipment is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.
Adjustments to the deferred tax charge in respect of previous years includes an uplift in the provision required in relation to the acquired Sean gas field.
The different accounting treatment of property, plant and equipment for tax and accounting purposes means that the taxable income of the Group is not the same as the profit reported in the financial statements.
During both the year to 31 March 2016 and the previous year, the substantial impairments undertaken in relation to certain of the Groups property, plant and equipment, which are explained at note 7 meant that the charge to profit for the year significantly exceeded the amount of capital allowances due to the Group.
Short term temporary differences arise on items such as provisions for restructuring costs and onerous contracts, and retirement benefit obligations, because the treatment of such items is different for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences usually reverse in the year following that in which they arise, as is reflected in the deferred tax charge in these financial statements.
Where interest charges or other costs are capitalised in the accounts, tax relief is either given as the charges are incurred or when the costs are taken to the income statement.
141 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 10.
Taxation continued As explained at Accompanying Information A1.11 and at note 34 to the accounts, the Group measures its operating and financing derivatives at fair value under IAS 39.
Due to the financial statements of its subsidiaries being prepared under UK GAAP and following the application of the UK tax disregard regulations, the re-measurement movements have no current tax effect impacting only the deferred tax position.
Some expenses incurred by the Group, while entirely appropriate, are not allowed as an offset against taxable income when calculating the companys tax liability for the same accounting period.
Examples of such disallowable expenditure include legal expenses on investment transactions, and investment impairments.
As detailed at note 31 and explained in the Accompanying Information A1.11 ix, the Group has issued hybrid capital securities which are treated as a component of equity.
While the coupon payments relating to these securities are treated as distributions to the holders of the equity instruments, tax relief is allowed on the amount paid in the year.
These tax credits are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.
Reconciliation of tax charge to adjusted underlying current tax As noted at note 3 to the accounts, the Groups results are reported on an adjusted basis in order to allow focus on underlying business performance.
The following table explains the adjustments that are made in order to arrive at adjusted profit before tax.
This is the measure utilised in calculation of the Groups adjusted effective rate of tax.

An interim dividend of 26.9p per ordinary share 2015 26.6p was declared and paid on 18 March 2016 to those shareholders on the SSE plc share register on 22 January 2016.
Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the interim cash dividend under the terms of the Companys scrip dividend scheme.
The proposed final dividend of 62.5p per ordinary share which equates to a dividend of 629.8m based on the number of issued ordinary shares at 31 March 2016 is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share at 31 March 2016 is based on the net profit attributable to Ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 March 2016.
All earnings are from continuing operations.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest on net pension liabilities under IAS 19R and the impact of exceptional items and certain re-measurements note 7.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The Company does not hold intangible assets.
Intangible assets have been analysed as current and non-current as follows: 2016 2015 m m Current 500.1 433.5 Non-current: Goodwill 609.9 598.0 Other 249.5 170.4 1,359.5 1,201.9 i Goodwill At inception, Goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing purposes.
Certain goodwill valuations have changed in the current year following retranslation.
Commentary on the impairment testing of the related CGUs with the exception of two historic balances totalling 18.5m see note below is included at note 16.
A summary of the goodwill allocated to CGUs and the Groups operating segments is presented below: 2016 2015 Cash-generating unit Operating Segment m m Ireland wind farms Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation 124.5 112.6 GB wind farms Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation 199.9 199.9 GB Energy Supply Energy Supply 187.0 187.0 Enterprise i Enterprise 90.3 90.3 Ireland Supply ii Energy Supply 8.2 8.2 609.9 598.0 i Enterprise includes goodwill balances arising from historic acquisitions of Telecoms and Contracting businesses of 10.3m and 80.0m in relation to the acquisition of Energy Solutions Group ESG in the year to 31 March 2015.
The amount of goodwill associated with the historic businesses is not significant in context of the aggregate carrying value of the business units or the aggregate value of goodwill held by the Group.
No impairment has been recognised during the year on this balance.
ii The value associated with the Ireland supply goodwill represents deferred tax recognised on the difference between the fair value attributed to the Northern Ireland based Phoenix Energy business acquired in 2012 and the book value of those assets.
ii Allowances and Certificates Allowances and Certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates ROCs.
These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Groups Energy Supply and Generation businesses.
iii Development assets Development costs relate to the design, construction and testing of thermal and renewable generation sites and devices, including wind farms, which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits.
Costs capitalised as development intangibles include options over land rights, planning application costs, environmental impact studies and other costs incurred in bringing wind farm and other generation and network development projects to the consented stage.
These may be costs incurred directly or at a cost as part of the fair value attribution on acquisition.
Development assets also include the Groups exploration and evaluation expenditure in relation to North Sea gas production wells.
At the point the development reaches the consent stage and is approved for construction, the carrying value is transferred to Property, Plant and Equipment note 15.
At the point a project is no longer expected to reach the consented stage, the carrying amount of the project is impaired.
Exceptional impairment charges of 29.4m 2015 47.5m were recognised in the financial year in relation to the impairment of E&P prospect developments due to the impact decline in wholesale gas prices on the Gas Production segment 27.2m and CCS development asset-related impairment charges recognised as part of the overall exceptional impairment of Peterhead power station 2.2m.
The exceptional charges of 47.5m in the previous year were recognised in relation to the impairment of the Abernedd thermal power generation development and other assets.
Disposals with a book value of 2.1m 2015 12.1m were made in the year which contributed a nil 2015 1.5m gain on sale.
Further detail on the Groups disposal programme is included at note 19.3. iv Other intangible assets Included within other intangible assets are brands, customer lists, contracts, application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software packages.
Amortisation is over the shorter of the contract term or five years with the exception of certain application software assets, which are amortised over 10 years.
Exceptional impairment charges of 11.2m 2015 nil were recognised in relation to software developments in Energy-related Services, a business with an adjusted operating profit of 15.2m.
The net book value of power generation assets includes decommissioning costs with a net book value of 161.0m 2015 16.8m which includes an increase following a comprehensive review of all portfolio decommissioning liabilities see note 28. ii Gas storage and production assets include decommissioning costs with a net book value of 205.3m 2015 98.4m which includes an increase of 100.0m arising from the acquisiton of the Greater Laggan assets note 19, and an uplift in the other assets to reflect the fair value of the decommissioning provision of 23.6m.
iii Assets disposed includes operating wind farms and property.
Details of disposals related to assets held for sale at 31 March 2015 are provided in note 19.3. iv Represents the carrying value of development assets transferred from intangible assets note 14 which have reached the consent stage and have been approved for construction.
v Impairment charges relate to exceptional impairments of 646.0m and non-exceptional impairments of 6.7m these relate to gas storage and production assets.
2015 exceptional impairments of 478.8m, non-exceptional impairments nil.
147 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 15.
Property, plant and equipment continued The Company does not hold any property, plant or equipment.
Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PP&E, goodwill and other intangible assets and its interests in joint ventures and associates annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amounts may be lower than their carrying amounts or where other indicators of impairment are deemed to have arisen.
Further detail of the Groups accounting policies and methodologies for impairment testing are described at Accompanying Information sections 1.6 i and 1.7.
16.1 Goodwill impairment reviews CGUs testing The recoverable amounts of the GB Energy Supply and Enterprise Energy Services Group CGUs are determined by reference to value-in-use VIU calculations.
The VIU calculations use, as a starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board.
The Groups Corporate Model is based both on past experience and reflects the Groups forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives.
Commodity prices used are based on observable market data and, where this is not available, on internal estimates.
The recoverable amount of the wind farm CGUs is based on the fair value less costs to sell FVLCS methodology.
The basis applied has been deemed appropriate as it is consistent with the way in which the economic values of the CGUs are assessed by management and how they would be by other market participants.
The method applied is to determine fair value by assessing the discounted pre-tax cash flows expected to be earned by the individual wind farm projects within the respective CGUs.
The two identified CGUs Ireland wind farms and UK wind farms share many of the same risk factors and are accordingly discounted using the same discount rates.
16.2 PP&E, other intangibles and investment impairment reviews asset testing The recoverable amounts of the Groups PP&E, other intangible assets and interests in joint ventures and associates are determined by reference to value-in-use VIU calculations with the exception of the Groups Gas Production assets, which are based on the FVLCS methodology.
Both calculations use, as their starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board.
The Groups Corporate Model is based on past experience and reflects the Groups forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives.
Impairment testing continued 16.3 Impairment reviews The key operating and valuation assumptions, specific considerations and outcome of tests for all impairment reviews are noted in the following table.
Management have determined the pre-tax cash flows of each asset or CGU based on projected performance and its expectations of market changes or developments.
The discount rates used are pre-tax real and reflect specific risks attributable to the relevant operating segments.
The discount rates used have been benchmarked against externally published rates used by comparable quoted companies operating in the respective market sectors.
The discount rates applied in both 2016 and 2015 remain consistent across all CGUs, except where noted, reflecting the groups view of cost of capital and risk.
The recoverable amounts derived from the VIU or FVLCS calculations are compared to the carrying amount of each asset or CGU to determine whether an impairment charge requires to be recognised.
The reviews carried out for the 2016 accounts were carried out in the fourth quarter of the year, which is consistent with previous reviews.
Note that the actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions included in the assessments at the balance sheet date.
All assets and CGUs under review are in the Wholesale business with the exception of the impairment review of the goodwill associated with the Energy Services Group ESG which is a business in Enterprise and the goodwill held in relation to the GB Energy Supply business.

The projections are also based on assumptions of the UK and Irish governments continuing support for existing qualifying wind assets through ROCs or REFIT.
Cash outflows are based on planned and expected maintenance profiles and other capital or replacement costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted applying a pre-tax discount rates of between 7.5% and 9.5% based on technology and market, which is consistent with the previous year.
The Ireland and GB wind CGUs include wind farms in operation and both CGUs include projects in the construction phase.
No values associated with cash flows from assets in development are included in the goodwill impairment review.

As the programme comes to an end, some assets and liabilities remain classified as held-forsale on the balance sheet at 31 March 2016.

Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets continued 19.3 Disposals i Significant disposals On 29 October 2015, the Group agreed to sell its shareholding in Galloper Wind Farm Limited to its co-venturer RWE Innogy for cash consideration of 18.3m.
The rationale for the disposal was explained in the Groups statement on offshore wind investment on 26 March 2014.
The gain on the disposal of 18.3m was recorded as an exceptional item note 7.
On 28 May 2015, the Group also agreed to sell three onshore wind development sites Cour, Blackcraig, Whiteside Hill, 98MW to Blue Energy.
Total consideration of these assets was 52.4m.

The stake held by the co-investors has been deemed to be that of a non-controlling interest in an entity under the Groups control.
This key accounting judgement is explained at note 4.2.
The consequence of this is that the gain recorded on disposal of 138.6m was recognised directly in equity instead of in the income statement and the non-recourse to SSE loans in the entity require to be recorded on the Group balance sheet.

The most financially significant risks are likely to be: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets under perform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by and increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes liabilities of the risks highlighted.
Policy for recognising gains and losses The Group and Company recognise actuarial gains and losses immediately in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income following the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liabilities of the schemes.
169 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 32.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed are calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the schemes liabilities.
While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.
fide-risking The trustees have taken a number of steps to control the level of investment risk within the schemes over the last 12 months including reducing the schemes exposures to higher risk assets and increasing the level of protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation.
The trustees of both schemes continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the respective schemes.
Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme or the Company An asset-liability matching strategy has been adopted for a proportion of the schemes assets, which is designed to provide partial protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation.
The trustees of the respective schemes review the schemes asset allocation on an ongoing basis in light of changes in the funding position and market opportunities.
Expected contributions over the next accounting period The group and company expects to contribute approximately 34.0m to the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme, and 78.0m to the Southern Electric Scheme in the period ending 31 March 2017, these contributions include deficit repair contributions of 23.5m to the Southern Electric Scheme.
Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 21 years 2015 22 years for the Scottish Hydro Pension Scheme and 17 years 2015 17 years for the Southern Electric Pension Scheme.
Employee share-based payments 33.1 Share Schemes Summary The Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees.

Further detail of the capital management objectives, policies and procedures are included in the Financial management and balance sheet section of the Financial Overview on pages 37 to 38 of this report.
The maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Groups capital structure, and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing.
Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Groups credit ratings.
The Group has the option to purchase its own shares from the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices and economic conditions.
The use of share buy-backs is the Groups benchmark for investment decisions and is utilised at times when management believe the Groups shares are undervalued.
No share buy-back was made during the year.
The Groups debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium term bank loans including those with the European Investment Bank.
In addition the Group has issued hybrid capital securities which bring together features of both debt and equity, are perpetual and subordinate to all senior creditors.
The Group has 1.5bn of committed bank facilities which relate to the Groups revolving credit and bilateral facilities that can be accessed at short notice for use in managing the Groups short term funding requirements however these committed facilities remain undrawn for the majority of the time.
The Group capital comprises: 2016 2015 m m Total borrowings excluding finance leases 6,868.0 5,781.0 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 360.2 1,512.3 Net debt excluding hybrid capital 6,507.8 4,268.7 Hybrid capital 2,209.7 3,371.1 Cash held as collateral and other short-term loans 121.8 71.7 Balances due to partners in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited 200.7 Adjusted Net Debt and Hybrid Capital 8,395.0 7,568.1 Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent 2,984.8 2,709.4 Total capital excluding finance leases 11,379.8 10,277.5 Under the terms of its major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenant: - Interest Cover Ratio: The Company shall procure that the ratio of Operating Profit to Net Interest Payable for any relevant period is not less than 2.5 to 1.
The following definitions apply in the calculation of these financial covenants: - Operating Profit means, in relation to a relevant period, the profit on ordinary activities before taxation after adding back Net Interest Payable of the Group for that relevant period but after adjusting this amount to exclude any exceptional profits or losses and, for the avoidance of doubt, before taking account of any extraordinary profits or losses and excluding the effect of IAS 39.
- Net Interest Payable means, in respect of any relevant period, interest payable during that relevant period less interest receivable during that relevant period.
In summary, the Groups intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth.
In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently.
There were no changes to the Groups capital management approach during the year.
Financial risk management This note presents information about the fair value of the Groups financial instruments, the Groups exposure to the risks associated with those instruments, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: - Credit risk.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Risk and Trading Committee, which reports to the Executive Committee, comprises the two Executive Directors and senior managers from the Energy Portfolio Management, Generation, Retail, Corporate and Finance functions.
Its specific remit is to support the Groups risk management responsibilities by reviewing the 175 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 34.
Capital and financial risk management continued strategic, market, credit operational and liquidity risks and exposures that arise from the Groups energy portfolio management, generation, energy supply and treasury operations.
The membership and deliberations of the Risk and Trading Committee are designed to ensure strict business separation requirements are maintained.
The Groups policies for risk management are established to identify the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
These policies, and the systems used to monitor activities, are reviewed regularly by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Exposure to the commodity, currency and interest rate risks noted arise in the normal course of the Groups business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks.
The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.
The Company is required to disclose information on its financial instruments and has adopted policies identical to that of the Group, where applicable.
Separate disclosure is provided where necessary.
Before detailing the relevant qualitative and quantitative disclosures in relation to the potential risks faced by the Group, details on the different categories of financial instrument and the carrying and fair values of each of those categories is provided below.
Basis of determining fair value Certain assets and liabilities designated and carried at amortised cost are loans and receivables.
For certain current assets and liabilities their carrying value is equivalent to fair value due to short term maturity.
Assets and liabilities designated at fair value and the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities have been determined by reference to closing rate market values.
This basis has been used in valuing interest rate instruments, foreign currency hedge contracts and foreign currency denominated long-term fixed rate debt.
Commodity contracts fair values are based on published price quotations.
The fair values are stated at a specific date and may be different from the amounts which will actually be paid or received on settlement of the instruments.
The fair value of items such as property, plant and equipment, internally generated brands or the Groups customer base are not included as these are not financial instruments.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk arising from the Groups normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures.
Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided.
Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.
177 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 34.
Capital and financial risk management continued Credit risk management for the Groups Networks businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is financially controlled by the individual business units.
The Groups greatest credit risks lie with the operations of the Energy Supply business, the Wholesale procurement activities conducted by Energy Portfolio Management EPM under a trust arrangement and the activities carried out by the Groups Treasury function.
In all cases, specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied.
Exposure to credit risk in the retail supply of electricity and gas to end user customers arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables.
The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.
Domestic customers creditworthiness is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information.
Exposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty: - holds an investment grade credit rating: or - can be assessed as adequately creditworthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies: or - can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions: or - can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the Risk and Trading Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the Group Board.
Credit support clauses or side agreements are typically included or entered into to protect the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery.
As part of its normal activities, EPM transacts significant volumes of commodity derivative products through cleared exchanges to mitigate credit risk.
Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are monitored by category of credit risk and are subject to approved limits.
At 31 March 2016, EPM had pledged 211.4m 2015 235.8m of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received 44.5m 2015 41.8m of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on credit risk.
Bank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default.
Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash.
These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Groups market risks commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.
Trade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated after an allowance for impairment.
Concentrations of risk Trade receivables recorded by reported segment held at the 31 March were: 2016 2015 m m Networks Electricity Distribution 72.2 69.4 Electricity Transmission 0.9 15.4 73.1 84.8 Retail Energy Supply 524.2 595.8 Enterprise 53.9 145.9 Energy Related Services 11.4 23.3 589.5 765.0 Wholesale Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation 1,291.5 2,114.0 Gas Storage 1.1 1.5 Gas Production 1.4 0.5 1,294.0 2,116.0 Corporate Unallocated 10.2 11.7 Total 1,966.8 2,977.5 178 SSE plc Annual Report 2016 1.
Capital and financial risk management continued The Retail segment accounts for 30.0% 2015 25.7% of the Groups trade receivables.
Trade receivables associated with the Groups 8.2 million electricity and gas customers are recorded in this segment.
The Group also has significant receivables associated with its Wholesale activities which are generally settled within two to four weeks from invoicing.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is therefore subject to diversification with no exposure to individual retail customers totalling 10% of trade receivables.
The biggest customer balance, due from a wholesale customer also a wholesale supplier, is 8% 2015 11% of the total trade receivables.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2016 2015 m m Not past due 1,690.2 2,720.0 Past due but not individually impaired: 0 30 days 156.3 157.0 31 90 days 59.2 52.7 Over 90 days 208.6 202.1 2,114.3 3,131.8 Less: allowance for impairment 147.5 154.3 Net Trade receivables 1,966.8 2,977.5 The Group has past due debt which has not had an impairment allowance set aside to cover potential credit losses.
The Group has certain procedures to pursue customers in significant arrears and believes its impairment policy in relation to such balances is appropriate.
Those debts which are neither past due nor impaired are considered to be good and are expected to be recoverable.
The Group has other receivables which are financial assets totalling 23.7m 2015 25.2m.
The Company does not have trade receivables.
The movement in the allowance for impairment of trade receivables was: 2016 2015 m m Balance at 1 April 154.3 164.4 Increase in allowance for impairment 54.3 56.2 Impairment losses recognised 61.1 66.3 Balance at 31 March 147.5 154.3 At the end of each reporting period a review of the provision for bad and doubtful debts is performed.
It is an assessment of the potential amount of trade receivables which will not be paid by customers after the balance sheet date.
This amount is calculated by reference to the age, status and risk of each class of receivable.
ii Liquidity risk and going concern Liquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Group can be exposed to significant movements in its liquidity position due to changes in commodity prices, working capital requirements, the impact of the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital investment and recycling programmes.
Treasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts.
Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.
The departments operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Risk and Trading Committee and Audit Committee.
In relation to the Groups liquidity risk, the Groups policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
During the year, the Groups approach to managing liquidity was to seek to ensure that the Group had available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 6 month period.
The Group uses cash flow forecasts to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements.
Typically, the Group will fund any short term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus.
Details of the groups borrowings are disclosed at note 26.
In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at note 26, the Group has 150m of uncommitted bank lines and a 15m overdraft facility.
179 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 34.
Capital and financial risk management continued Over the course of the financial year to 31 March 2017, the Group has 700m of term loans reaching maturity.
Of these loans, 200m matures in June 2016 and 500m matures in September 2016.
This refinancing requirement has been covered with the issuance of a new 501m US Private Placement and a new 300m European Investment Bank facility, both were signed ahead of the year end 31 March 2016.
The proceeds of the US Private Placement will be received in 3 tranches 35m on 28 April 2016, 64m on 6 June 2016 and 402m on 6 September 2016, the average maturity is 9.6 years, with maturities between April 2023 and September 2027.
An utilisation request has been submitted and accepted by the European Investment Bank to draw the 300m facility in full on 20 May 2016 as a 10 year fixed rate term loan.
It is the view of the Directors that the Groups 105% funding policy will be met out its forecast borrowing requirement to September 2017.
Given the committed bank facilities of 1.5bn maintained by the Group and the current capital market conditions, the Directors have concluded that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have also taken into account the successful issuance of 4.5bn of medium to long-term debt and hybrid capital since February 2012, and the Groups credit rating.
The statement of going concern is included in the Directors Corporate Governance report on page 70.
Treasury also manage the Groups interaction with its relationship banks defined as those banks that support the companys financing activities through their ongoing participation in the committed lending facilities that are maintained by the Group.
These are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of investment grade or better allocated by a recognised major ratings group.
In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.
As at 31 March 2016, the value of outstanding cash collateral in respect of mark-to-market related margin calls on exchange traded positions was 78.3m 2015 71.7m.
The contractual cash flows shown in the following tables are the contractual undiscounted cashflows under the relevant financial instruments.
Where the contractual cashflows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate or index in the future, the contractual cashflows in the following tables have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cashflows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cashflows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the following tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
Capital and financial risk management continued The numbers in the following tables have been included in the Groups cashflow forecasts for the purposes of considering Liquidity Risk as noted above.
It should be noted that cash flows associated with future energy sales and commodity contracts which are not IAS 39 financial instruments are not included in this analysis, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS 7.
181 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 34.
The risk management activity carried out by EPM arises from the Groups requirement to source gas, electricity or other commodities such as renewable obligation certificates for Energy Supply, and to procure fuel and other commodities and provide a route-to-market for Electricity Generation.
The Groups strategy is to manage all exposures to commodity risk through volumetric limits and to measure the exposure by use of Value at Risk VaR models.
The exposure is subject to financial limits established by the Board and managed by reference to guidance agreed by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Exposures are reported to the Committee on a monthly basis and to the Board when certain trigger levels are exceeded.
Within this approach, only certain of the Groups energy commodity contracts are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial commodity contracts, it is only the fair value of IAS 39 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Groups commodity price risk under IFRS 7.
This is a consequence of the Groups accounting policy which stipulates that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 should be accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in profit or equity.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 will be accounted for as own use contracts.
As fair value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk.
Therefore, as the overall Group VaRs associated with commodity risk will be monitored for internal risk management purposes and is outside the scope of IAS 39.
In EPM, the economic volatility that the Group is exposed to related to this risk is managed through a selection of longer and shorter term contracts for commodities such as gas, electricity, coal and carbon allowances, the arms length arrangements with the Groups gas production business and through flexibility from the Groups fleet of generation assets including assets such as pumped storage generating plant, flexible hydro generating plant, standby oil plant and contracts with the gas storage business.
Capital and financial risk management continued Short-term exposures will arise from the requirement to match volumes of procured gas and electricity with demand for gas and electricity by Energy Supply customers.
In addition, exposures can arise from matching fuel and other commodity procurement with demand for these commodities arising from the Groups Generation assets.
Both can vary from expectations and result in a requirement to close the contracted positions at unfavourable prices.
Longer-term exposures are managed by EPM through longer term contracts including forwards, futures contracts and other financial instruments.
These, in turn, are used to reduce short-term market exposures.
As noted, certain commodity contracts are entered into primarily for own use purposes to supply to customers or to provide fuel to power stations.
However, as noted, a number of these contracts do not qualify for own use treatment under IAS 39 and are subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
In addition to this, the Group enters into certain contracts to manage commodity price and volume risk.
These are also subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
Finally, other physical contracts can be treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand.
The accounting policies associated with such items are explained in the Accompanying information section A1.
The consequential commodity risk which derives from these activities is quantified by the use of a Value at Risk VaR model which considers exposures in all commodities and provides an estimate of the potential change to the Groups forecast profits over a given period and to a given confidence level.
The calculated financial risk is controlled through the imposition of a number of risk limits approved by the Board and monitored and managed by the Risk and Trading Committee.
The Groups exposure to Commodity risk is subsequently reported to and monitored by the Risk and Trading Committee and to the Executive Committee by exception.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Groups IAS 39 commodity contracts.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred, and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date.
The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated on the basis that the proportion of commodity contracts that are IAS 39 financial instruments remains consistent with those at that point.
Excluded from this analysis are all commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.

The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation based on the rationale described are as follows: 2016 2015 Impact on profit Impact on and equity equity m m Incremental profit loss Commodity prices combined increase 77.6 360.1 Commodity prices combined decrease 77.6 360.1 The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical and is based on the Groups commodity contracts under IAS 39.
This is analysis only and should be used with caution as the impacts disclosed are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities impacts provided are indicative only and are based on calculations which do not consider all interrelationships, consequences and effects of such a change in those prices.
183 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 34.
Capital and financial risk management continued iv Currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling but also conducts business in foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Groups transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk.
All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long-term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates.
The policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable.
The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Groups requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.
The Group has foreign subsidiary operations with significant Euro-denominated net assets.
The Groups policy is to hedge its net investment in its foreign operations by ensuring the net assets whose functional currency cash flows are denominated in Euros are matched by borrowings in Euros.
For the acquired net assets whose functional cash flows are in Sterling, the Group will ensure Sterling denominated borrowings are in place to minimise currency risk.
Significant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Risk and Trading Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the relative proportions of instruments in foreign currencies being consistent as at the balance sheet date.
This includes only monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than Sterling and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations but not the corresponding impact of the net investment hedge.
The sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Groups exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing.
The calculations are based on linear extrapolations of rate changes which may not reflect the actual result which would impact upon the Group.
Capital and financial risk management continued A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have had the following impact on profit after taxation, based on the assumptions presented above: Equity Income Statement At 31 March At 31 March At 31 March At 31 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m US Dollars 0.7 6.5 Euro 43.2 38.5 8.1 1.7 DKK SEK NOK CHF 43.2 38.5 7.4 4.8 The impact of a decrease in rates would be an identical reduction in the annual charge.
v Interest rate risk Interest rate risk derives from the Groups exposure to changes in the value of an asset or liability or future cash flows through changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage this risk by stipulating that a minimum of 50% of Group borrowings be subject to fixed rates of interest, either directly through the debt instruments themselves or through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The floating rate borrowings are provided by banks including the European Investment Bank EIB.
Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than Sterling, cross currency swaps.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Groups financial performance.
Although interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings.
Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades.
The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise cash advances from the European Investment Bank EIB.
The impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question.
Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair value through the income statement.
In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement.
Changes in variable rate instruments and hedging instruments and hedged items recorded under fair value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement.
The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.
The net exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date can be summarised thus: 2016 2015 Carrying Carrying amount amount m m Interest bearing earning assets and liabilities: fixed 5,613.9 4,983.4 floating 1,372.1 79.3 6,986.0 4,904.1 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents 360.2 1,512.3 Derivative financial liabilities 177.4 284.8 Loans and borrowings 6,868.0 5,811.9 Finance lease obligations 300.8 319.7 6,986.0 4,904.1 Following from this, the table below represents the expected impact of a change of 100 basis points in short term interest rates at the reporting date in relation to equity and income statement.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
An increase in exchange rates would be a change to either the income statement or equity.
The assessment is based on a revision of the fair value assumptions included in the calculated exposures in the previous table.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the proportion of fixed to floating instruments being consistent as at the balance sheet date and is stated after the effect of taxation.
185 Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 34.
Capital and financial risk management continued The sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Groups exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing.
2016 2015 m m Income statement 14.3 12.3 14.3 12.3 The impact of a decrease in rates would be an identical reduction in the annual charge.
There is no impact on equity as the analysis relates to the Groups net exposure at the balance sheet date.
Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the groups covered position.
vi Primary statement disclosures For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.
The net movement reflected in the income statement can be summarised thus: 2016 2015 m m Operating Derivatives Total result on operating derivatives i 1,375.4 1,073.5 Less: Amounts settled ii 1,344.3 1,005.7 Movement in unrealised derivatives 31.1 67.8 Financing Derivatives and hedged items Total result on financing derivatives i 214.9 395.5 Less: Amounts settled ii 229.2 351.3 Movement in unrealised derivatives 14.3 44.2 Net income statement impact 16.8 112.0 i Total result on derivatives in the income statement represents the total amounts charged or credited to the income statement in respect of operating and financial derivatives.
ii Amounts settled in the year represent the result on derivatives transacted which have matured or been delivered and have been included within the total result on derivatives.
The derivative financial assets and liabilities are represented as follows: 2016 2015 m m Derivative Financial Assets Non-current 537.7 566.8 Current 1,615.0 1,999.9 2,152.7 2,566.7 Derivative Liabilities Non-current 857.5 933.4 Current 1,783.8 2,297.3 Total derivative liabilities 2,641.3 3,230.7 Net liability 488.6 664.0 186 SSE plc Annual Report 2016 1.
Capital and financial risk management continued Fair Value Hierarchy The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Financial assets Energy derivatives 378.7 1,475.3 1,854.0 Interest rate derivatives 238.1 238.1 Foreign exchange derivatives 60.6 60.6 Equity Investments 25.1 25.1 378.7 1,799.1 2,177.8 Financial liabilities Energy derivatives 436.7 1,781.6 2,218.3 Interest rate derivatives 415.5 415.5 Foreign exchange derivatives 7.5 7.5 Loans and borrowings 81.8 81.8 436.7 2,122.8 2,559.5 There were no significant transfers out of level 1 into level 2 and out of level 2 into level 1 during the year ended 31 March 2016. vii Cash flow hedges The Group designates contracts which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes either as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IAS 39.
The Groups accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in the Accompanying Information section A1.
The following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated: Cash flow hedges 2016 2016 Expected 2016 2015 2015 2015 Carrying cash 0-12 2016 2016 2016 Carrying Expected 0-12 2015 2015 2015 amount flows months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years amount cash flows months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Interest rate swaps: Assets 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.2 Liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1 Forward exchange contracts: Assets 36.5 631.9 460.5 130.3 41.2 12.0 139.6 47.2 45.2 39.0 8.2 Liabilities 7.4 180.3 89.9 90.1 0.3 62.0 558.0 279.8 174.6 103.6 29.1 812.2 550.4 220.4 41.5 50.0 697.6 327.0 219.8 142.6 8.2 viii Net investment hedge The Groups net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency as the net investment in foreign subsidiaries with denominated functional currencies being the Airtricity Supply business and the thermal plants and wind farms in Ireland.
The hedge compares the element of the net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in to the matching portion of the borrowings held by the Group.
This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates.
Gains and losses in the hedge are recognised in equity and will be transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation 2016 33.4m loss, 2015 48.7m gain.
Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement 2016 nil, 2015 nil.
