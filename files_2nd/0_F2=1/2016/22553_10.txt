BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED LONDON TOP CUSTOMERS MARKET DURING THE YEAR: National Crime Agency Government GDP growth for 2016 down to 1.8% 2015: 2.2% Secretary of State The impact of the EU referendum was a short-lived hiatus in the investment Government market in Q3 Trillium Investment volumes rebounded in Q4 to a total of 12bn for the year, in line with Government the 5 year average BAe Systems 75% of investment transactions involved overseas buyers Major Corporation Tenant demand for secondary properties remained unaffected by the prospect of Brexit PMI business confidence index remains strong at over 50 Outlook: The decision to leave the EU created uncertainty in the London commercial property market, especially in the City where the demand for space from the financial services sector is likely to decline in the medium term.
In the assets in which CLS invests, which are outside the City and prime West End, tenant demand remains robust.
A negative impact on the broader economy could affect CLS more tangibly, but the supply of commercial space in London remains constrained and by managing all of our assets in-house we are in a strong position to withstand such an impact.
In 2016 the supply of, and demand for, investment opportunities in London were constrained by the prospect of the EU referendum and by its outcome.
Consequently, in January we made our only acquisition in Greater London in the year, comprising Cassini Court and Pascal Place, Randalls Research Park, Leatherhead for 6.4 million, including costs.
These adjacent buildings provided 28,122 sq ft 2,613 sqm of offices and, with a net initial yield of 6.0% and around 10,580 sq ft of vacant space, presented the opportunity to undertake a modernisation programme, which is now under way.
Since the end of the year we have acquired a portfolio of five properties comprising 107,000 sq ft 9,940 sqm of offices in Reigate, Teddington, Sidcup and Maidenhead which will be managed within the London portfolio and Birmingham Rest of UK for 31.4 million generating a net initial yield of 8.0% from 10 tenants, and providing excellent short to medium-term asset management opportunities.
In October, Chancel House, Neasden Lane NW10 was sold to the Education Funding Agency for 18.7 million, 39% above its valuation at 31 December 2015.
It comprised 74,700 sq ft 7,081 sqm of office space: 56% of the building was income-producing from the Department of Works and Pensions until March 2018 and, with 44% of the property vacant, the sales price represented a net initial yield of 3.3%.
The London occupancy market in which we operate maintained its strength in 2016, largely ignoring the impact Brexit might have, and with a lack of new developments to satisfy this demand, rental values rose.
On average, new lettings were achieved at 5.4% above their estimated rental values ervs of 31 December 2015.
During 2016, ervs of the London portfolio rose by 2.6%, and at 31 December 2016 the London portfolio was net reversionary.
Those leases which were reversionary were 9.0 million or 21.7% under-rented: of the 1.1 million 2.6% of over-renting in London, 0.7 million was on leases which expire in 2026.
The vacancy rate for London remained low at just 4.0% 2015: 3.6%, excluding development stock.
During 2016, 142,374 sq ft 13,227 sqm became vacant, of which 43,335 sq ft 4,026 sqm was taken into development stock, and we let or renewed leases on 106,573 sq ft 9,901 sqm.

Phase 2 comprises a 8.6 million, tower by Urbanest, to whom we sold this adjacent 7-storey development of 9,181 sq ft 853 sqm of office site in 2015.
This represents just one of a number accommodation and nine residential apartments of tower developments under way in the immediate expected to reach practical completion by the end vicinity of our main development site.
