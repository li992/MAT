MARTINS ASPIRATION WAS TO PRODUCE, QUITE SIMPLY, THE BEST SAUSAGE YOU ARE LIKELY TO TASTE.
With the growth of sausage varieties came increased demand and four more shops, with Martins produce becoming a strong favourite in South East England, so much so, that in 1995 Cranswick collaborated with Martin to make his premium sausages available nationwide through our major retail customers.
Cranswick is now capable of producing in excess of 800 tonnes of gourmet sausages per week, but retains the same approach to quality and innovation that Martin developed.
Martin continues to work closely with us and tests and develops new and innovative recipes at his Heaps Sausages Cafe in Greenwich.
OUR PREMIUM SAUSAGE RANGE All of our sausages are made with the finest cuts of meat and the perfect balance of herbs and seasoning.
