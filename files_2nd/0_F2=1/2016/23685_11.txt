Advantages: Much safer than underground mining Flexible volumes depending on coal market demand   efficiency: 3D geological modelling creates optimal mining plans Automated dispatching system reduces empty runs and increases equipment utilisation rates Equipment repair and replacement programme improves technical readiness rate As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner.
The simultaneous operation of a set of equipment allows for an optimal workload and high productivity.
The room-and-pillar method is used where the coal face has been Scoop damaged and additional equipment is needed to work the coal face.
