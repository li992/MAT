n o i t u r b o i t r t c n o e s c e y u b n e e v u e r n p e u v o r e G R REGIONAL REVIEW EUROPE ANOTHER GOOD YEAR 5 Europe grew organic revenue by 2.8%, 4 the highest growth rate we have seen since 2008.
This was driven by good 3 levels of new business wins.
16 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT Like for like volumes were impacted by the timing of a number of sports events in the UK in the fourth quarter of 2015 and by weakness in the oil and gas business, where we have seen revenue declines of 25% in the year, and France which is still challenging.
Underlying operating profit grew by 2.6% 10 million on a constant currency basis, delivering a flat underlying operating margin at 7.2%.
Our ongoing focus on pricing and operational efficiencies allowed us to reinvest in the business to support the higher levels of growth, absorb the impact of lower like for like volumes in the oil and gas business, offset minimum wage pressures across the region and cover the cost of creating nine sub-regional business units.
This new structure will allow us to maximise our scale in procurement, leverage our overheads and speed up the sharing and implementation of best practices.
Europe grew organic revenue by 2.8%, the highest growth rate we have seen since 2008.
This was driven by good levels of new business wins.
Like for like revenue was slightly positive due to some pricing and flat volumes.
Our fourth quarter growth rate was impacted by the closure of some contracts and strong Sports & Leisure comparatives in the UK.
New business wins were strong in the UK, Nordics, BeNeLux, Iberia and Turkey.
Some examples of wins include the Politieacademie in the Netherlands, AXA in Spain, Darussafaka in Turkey and the Aeroports fide Paris and Macif in France.
Contract extensions include Arcelor Mittal in Germany and BT and HSBC in the UK.
