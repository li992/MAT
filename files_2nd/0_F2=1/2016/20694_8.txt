21 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Banking for the bold Flexible finance ECS Engineering Services Ltd ECS, a leading engineering company in Huthwaite near Mansfield, put in place the means to grow its business with the purchase of a new metal plate machine.
The machine was funded by Aldermore and arranged by Newark-based finance broker FUNDINGROUND Ltd.
The new Peddinghaus plate machine replaced an older unit, enabling ECS to increase production capacity and provide greater efficiency and flexibility in their use of materials.
This ultimately allows the company to deliver improved products to existing clients and to take on new orders.
Aldermore worked closely with the broker to understand ECS Engineerings requirements to ensure that the finance facility was structured appropriately and that the asset was delivered promptly.
We urgently required the new plate machine to improve versatility, efficiency and quality.
We were really grateful for both FUNDINGROUNDs proactive approach and Aldermores flexibility and speed of delivery.
Neil Smith, Technical Director at ECS Engineering
