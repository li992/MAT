Claire 42 and her husband David 46 were living in a five bedroom house in Wolverhampton with their two children when Claires friend Rachael told her Claire Walters how happy she was with her new Redrow home and inspired her to visit the Compton Park, Wolverhampton Compton Park development.
Claire and David, who runs his own double glazing firm, hadnt been planning to move, until they visited the development show home and decided to buy a Highgrove house type.
We love the space of the Highgrove: our previous house wasnt nearly as big.
I really like the idea of the living area at the back of the house being the hub of the family home.
The house has lovely high ceilings and beautiful woodwork.
And the under-floor heating is amazing.
One of the first things David looked at was the windows, which are of the same profile as those we fit so were happy with those.
Theyre beautiful and very energy efficient, keeping the warm air in and the cold out.
