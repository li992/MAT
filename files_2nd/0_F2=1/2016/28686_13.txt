Josef 43, who works at a software firm in London, wanted to buy an apartment as an investment in the first instance, with a view to retiring Josef Wolf there later.
Searching in Bournemouth, Josef visited Redrow Homes luxury The Summit, Bournemouth development, The Summit.
The following day he reserved a one bedroom apartment off plan.
We visited the plot when there were just concrete floors, the moment we met the site manager, Daryl, and later on the sales advisor, Helyn, we realised that we made the right choice and above all that we were in good hands.
Many builders would not be as flexible as Redrow Homes when it comes to buying off plan: we were given dozens of options, from kitchen to bathroom, from sockets to spotlights.
Each home has a private balcony, parking space and is a short walk from the beach, shops and restaurants.
The apartments floor-to-ceiling windows help accentuate the spacious interiors and open-plan layouts, creating a particularly light and airy feel.
