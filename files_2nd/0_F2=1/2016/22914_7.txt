Together with our Sofa Workshop subsidiary, these branded ranges are broadening our appeal to all customers, and particularly to aspirational customer segments.
During the year we have seen strong growth once again from our French Connection ranges together with the exciting launches of the House Beautiful Lydia, Country Living Lavenham and Sofa Workshop Dillon and Ellie in DFS stores.

Originally a DFS store with on-site warehouse, we moved the warehouse space off-site and in December 2015 opened both a Dwell and a Sofa Workshop alongside our DFS store.
Prompted by the broad appeal of our three store brands we have seen a wider variety of customers visiting the site.
Footfall has also increased, which we interpret as a more frequent shop by customers driven by Dwells homewares range.
Overall the conversion has released new, profitable sales space for Dwell and Sofa Workshop and increased sales from the existing DFS store.
