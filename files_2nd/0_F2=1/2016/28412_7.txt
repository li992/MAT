Non-standard credit cards Its abbl out celebrb atiing together for Laurence 89% and Joanne Vanquis Bank  When I was planning my wedding, I wanted a credit card so I could book things online and pay deposits and organise my big day.
As I made regular repayments and was using the card sensibly, Vanquis increased my credit limit, which was handy for some of the larger purchases.
I receive regular updates from Vanquis about when my payments are due and to review my bill, and they get the balance right so I feel like Im being reminded in a friendly way without being harassed.
