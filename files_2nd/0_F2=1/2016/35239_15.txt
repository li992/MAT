However we do not commit to projects that would unduly stress the balance sheet and only start schemes where we believe the risk reward ratio is attractive.
We have a track record of fide-risking our projects as they progress, and our potential profit margins allied to a long-term investment approach allow us significant flexibility on lease terms.
