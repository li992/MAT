This technology constantly monitors the immediate environment around a truck and sounds an alarm to alert the driver to the presence of any obstacle in its path or near-by.
If the obstacle is another truck an alarm will also sound in this truck.
Fatigue Warning Devices use sensors in Smartcaps worn by truck operators: these detect fatigue levels using readings from the skin and issue appropriate alerts by sounding an alarm.

360 SIMULATOR IN ANTUCOYA As part of Antofagastas commitment to eliminating fatalities at its operations, it has analysed the main causes of accidents and implemented technology-driven solutions to minimise such risks.
For example, a significant factor in fatalities is loss of control of a vehicle.
The solution at Antucoya was to install a state-of-the-art 360 simulator, so that operators training on a variety of mining equipment, such as trucks, shovels and front-end loaders, could experience the most realistic situations possible to prepare them for the challenges faced in the everyday working environment.
Antofagasta is planning to install simulators at all other operations during 2017 and 2018.
