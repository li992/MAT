The terms of the quota share reinsurance contracts are such that whilst the Group cedes approximately 50% of motor premiums written, in return for which the reinsurance partners contribute 50% of the claims cost for motor insurance policies that the Group incurs, the Group expects to retain the majority of profit generated on these policies through commissions receivable.
The final reinsurance commissions receivable are dependent upon achieving certain performance criteria, including target loss ratios.
The majority of quota share contracts are now on a rolling renewal basis, with 77% by proportion of the total 2017 programme value on two year minimum term arrangements.
These contracts provide additional security and certainty regarding the availability of the Groups reinsurance arrangements.
The Group carefully manages risk within the portfolio by working with a range of high quality, highly regarded and stable reinsurers.
