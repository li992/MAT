BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED GERMANY TOP CUSTOMERS MARKET DURING THE YEAR: City of Bochum Government GDP growth stable at 1.9% 2015: 1.7% E. ON Unemployment fell to 5.8% Major Corporation Buoyant investment market driven by international investors Kaufland Office take-up increased by 6% on 2015 level Major Corporation Rental growth of over 5% in major cities Dr Hnle Major Corporation Outlook: Vacancies are falling, rental growth in larger cities has been over 5% per annum and the economy grew by 1.9% in 2016.
Further strong economic growth is expected in 2017 which, underpinned by a widely-diversified economic structure, will benefit our tenants.
The general election will inevitably create some uncertainty, but the economy is strong enough to withstand it.
We intend to grow our portfolio in a German economy which provides attractive investment and financing opportunities in non-prime offices.
We continue to see good investment value in German commercial real estate, supported by favourable financing conditions.
In September, we acquired Parsevalstrasse 11, Dsseldorf, comprising 239,496 sq ft 22,700 sqm of high quality, mixed-use space close to the airport.
The cost of 43.6 million provided a net initial yield of 7.1% and we financed the acquisition for 7 years at a fixed rate of 0.92%.
In August, we bought Harburger Ring 35, Hamburg, adjacent to our existing holding of Harburger Ring 33, for 5.7 million, which comprised 36,028 sq ft 3,415 sqm of office space.
During 2016, 213,093 sq ft 19,797 sqm vacated or expired in the German portfolio, but 232,789 sq ft 21,627 sqm was relet or renewed and, consequently, the vacancy rate fell to 1.7% 2015: 2.5%.
New leases and renewals were achieved at 6.1% above their ervs at the end of 2015.
The valuation of the German portfolio rose by 3.8% in local currency, or by 18.4% in sterling.
The uplift was driven by a 5 bps fall in yields, whilst ervs were up 0.3% on a like-for-like basis in the year.
