Adjusted performance measures The groups results as reported under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and presented in the financial statements the statutory results are significantly impacted by movements in exchange rates relative to sterling, as well as by exceptional items and non-trading amounts relating to acquisitions.
As a result, adjusted performance measures have been used throughout the Annual Report and Accounts to describe the groups underlying performance.
The Board and Executive Committee use these adjusted measures to assess the performance of the business because they consider them more representative of the underlying ongoing trading result and allow more meaningful comparison to prior year.
Underlying measures The term underlying excludes the impact of exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other non-trading amounts relating to acquisitions collectively non-underlying items, net of any associated tax.
Underlying measures allow management and investors to compare performance without the potentially distorting effects of one-off items or non-trading items.
Non-underlying items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the group.
They are items which are exceptional by their size or are non-trading in nature, including those relating to acquisitions.
