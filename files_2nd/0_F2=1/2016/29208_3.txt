The reduction in UTP was only partially offset by a reduction in average invested capital, resulting in a modest reduction in ROIC.
We expect an improvement in ROIC to be driven by the development in profit margin when we successfully complete the Transform stage of the turnaround and make progress with the Grow phase.
