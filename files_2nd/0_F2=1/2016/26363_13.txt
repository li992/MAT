Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Summary of Group results Good underlying performance with strong improvement in statutory profit The Groups underlying profit was 7,867million, 3per cent lower than 2015, with slightly lower income and higher impairments, partly offset by lower costs.
The underlying return on required equity was 13.2 per cent and the underlying return on tangible equity was 14.1 per cent.
Statutory profit before tax more than doubled to 4,238 million, compared with 1,644 million in 2015, as the level of PPI provisions reduced significantly.
Total loans and advances to customers were 450billion, compared with 455 billion at 31December 2015, and customer deposits were similarly 5billion lower than a year ago at 413billion.
The balance sheet remains strong and the CET1 ratio at 31 December 2016 was 13.8 per cent on a pro forma basis and reflects the retention of c. 80basis points of CET1 capital to cover the estimated capital impact of the MBNA acquisition.
The Group generated c. 190basis points of CET1 capital, pre dividends, in the period and tangible net asset value per share increased to 54.8pence 31December 2015: 52.3pence.
Given the significant amount of capital generated in the year, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.7 pence per share, making a total ordinary dividend of 2.55pence per share, an increase of 13per cent on 2015 and in line with our progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.
In addition, the Board has recommended a special dividend of 0.5pence per share.
Total income 2016 2015 Change million million % Net interest income 11,435 11,482 Other income 6,065 6,155 1 Total income 17,500 17,637 1 1 Operating lease depreciation 895 764 17 Net income 16,605 16,873 2 Banking net interest margin 2.71% 2.63% 8bp Average interest-earning banking assets 435.9bn 441.9bn 1 1 Net of gains on disposal of leased assets.
Total income of 17,500 million was 1 per cent lower than 2015, with a small reduction in net interest income and a 1 per cent fall in other income.
Net interest income fell by 47 million to 11,435 million.
The net interest margin increased to 2.71per cent 2015: 2.63per cent, with lower deposit and wholesale funding costs, including the benefit from the ECN redemptions in the first quarter, more than offsetting the continuing pressure on asset pricing.
Average interest-earning banking assets reduced by 1per cent with growth in SME and Consumer Finance balances more than offset byreductions in the mortgage and run-off portfolios.
The Group expects that the net interest margin for 2017 will be greater than 2.70per cent beforeMBNA.
The Group manages the risk to its capital and earnings from adverse movements in interest rates centrally by hedging liabilities which are deemed to be stable or less sensitive to change in market interest rates.
As at 31 December 2016, the balance hedged was c. 111billion with an average duration of c. 3 years and an earning rate of approximately 1.6per cent over LIBOR.
In 2016, the benefit from the structural hedge totalled 1.7billion over LIBOR 2015: 1.8billion.
Other income increased in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year largely as a result of improved Insurance income and was higher than the third quarter of 2016, largely due to increased Commercial Banking fees and commissions and improved Insurance income.
The year-on-year reduction of 1 per cent was largely due to continued pressure on fees and commissions, including the impact of the market-wide cap on card interchange fees introduced in late 2015, lower returns in the Insurance business and reduced income from the run-off portfolio.
Operating lease depreciation increased 17 per cent to 895million due to continued growth in the Lex Autolease business and additional charges inCommercial Banking related to certain leasing assets.
Operating costs 2016 2015 Change million million % Operating costs 8,093 8,311 3 Cost:income ratio 48.7% 49.3% 0.6 pp Operating jaws 1.0% 1.0% Simplification savings annual run-rate 947 373 Operating costs were 8,093 million, 3per cent lower than 2015, driven by the continued focus on cost management and actions to simplify the business.
Investment in the business continues to increase, particularly in digital, and in 2016 the Group made further improvements to the branch network to meet changing customer preferences, investing in new distribution technology, designing new branch formats and upgrading call centretechnology.
The Simplification programme remains on track to deliver the increased target of 1.4billion of annual run-rate savings by the end of 2017, with 0.9billion of run-rate savings delivered to date.
The total spent on the Simplification programme to date is 1.6 billion with an expected further spendof 0.6billion by the end of 2017, of which around 0.2 billion will be included in restructuring costs.
The Groups market-leading cost:income ratio improved to 48.7 per cent 2015: 49.3per cent with positive operating jaws of 1 per cent.
The Group remains committed to achieving annual improvements in the cost:income ratio and continues to target a cost:income ratio of around 45per cent exiting 2019.
33 Financial results Summary of Group results continued Impairment 2016 2015 Change million million % Total impairment charge 645 568 14 Asset quality ratio 0.15% 0.14% 1bp Gross asset quality ratio 0.28% 0.28% Impaired loans as a % of closing advances 1.8% 2.1% 0.3 pp Provisions as a % of impaired loans 43.4% 46.1% 2.7 pp Provisions as a % of impaired loans excluding run-off 41.2% 43.0% 1.8 pp Asset quality remains strong with no deterioration in the underlying portfolio.
The impairment charge increased to 645million from 568million in 2015 with the asset quality ratio increasing slightly to 15 basis points.
This increase was largely due, as expected, to a reduction in the level of provision releases and write-backs.
The gross asset quality ratio excluding releases and write-backs remained unchanged at 28basis points.
Looking forward the Group expects a further reduction in releases and write-backs in 2017 and, as a result, the asset quality ratio to increase to around 25 basis points.
The average indexed loan to value LTV of the Retail mortgage portfolio improved to 44.0 per cent 31 December 2015: 46.1 per cent and the percentage of lending with an indexed LTV of greater than 100 per cent improved to 0.7 per cent 31 December 2015: 1.1 per cent.
Impaired loans continued to fall and at 31 December 2016 were 8.5billion, 1.8per cent of total loans and advances compared with 9.6billion, and2.1per cent at 31 December 2015.
Statutory profit 2016 2015 Change million million % Underlying profit 7,867 8,112 3 Volatility and other items Enhanced Capital Notes 790 101 Market volatility and asset sales 439 81 Amortisation of purchased intangibles 340 342 Restructuring costs 622 170 Fair value unwind and other items 231 192 TSB costs 745 1,544 1,631 Payment protection insurance provision 1,000 4,000 Other conduct provisions 1,085 837 Statutory profit before tax 4,238 1,644 158 Taxation 1,724 688 Profit for the year 2,514 956 163 Statutory profit before tax more than doubled to 4,238 million 2015: 1,644 million primarily due to lower PPI provisions of 1,000million 2015:4,000 million.
The charge of 790million for Enhanced Capital Notes in 2016 represented the write-off of the embedded derivative and the premium paid ontheredemption of the remaining notes in the first quarter.
Market volatility and asset sales of 439million included a gain on sale of the Groups interest in Visa Europe of 484million and negative insurance volatility of 91million.
The main item in the 2015 charge of 81 million was negative insurance volatility of 105million.
Restructuring costs were 622million in 2016 and comprised costs relating to the Simplification programme, the announced rationalisation of the non-branch property portfolio and the work on implementing the ring-fencing requirements.
A provision of 1 billion to cover further operating costs and redress relating to PPI was recognised in the third quarter and complaint levels in the second half have been around 8,300per week on average.
The Groups current PPI provision reflects our interpretation of the Financial Conduct Authoritys FCA consultation paper regarding a potential time bar of the end of June 2019 and the Plevin case.
In addition there was a charge of 1,085 million to cover a range of other conduct issues of which 475million was recognised in the fourth quarter.
The charge for the year included 280million in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts, 261million in respect of arrears-related activities on secured and unsecured retail products and 94million related to insurance products sold in Germany, together with a number of other conduct risk provisions totalling 450million across all divisions.
Statutory profit in 2015 included a charge of 745million, comprising 660million relating to the sale of TSB and 85million of TSB dual-running costs.
Taxation The tax charge was 1,724million 2015: 688million representing an effective tax rate of 41per cent 2015: 42per cent.
The high effective tax rate in 2016 was due to the banking surcharge, restrictions on the deductibility of conduct provisions, and the negative impact on the net deferred tax asset of both the change in corporation tax rate and the expected utilisation by the insurance business.
The Group continues to expect a medium term effective tax rate of around 27per cent.
34 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Return on required equity and tangible equity The underlying return on required equity was 13.2per cent 2015: 15.0per cent and the underlying return on tangible equity was 14.1percent 2015:16.0percent.
The reduction in both return measures reflects the lower underlying profit and higher underlying tax charge following implementation of the banking tax surcharge.
The return on required equity increased to 5.3 per cent 2015: 1.5per cent and the return on tangible equity increased to 6.6per cent 2015:2.6percent both largely reflecting the lower PPI provision made in the year.
Going forward, the Group remains confident in its future prospects and now expects to deliver a return on required equity of between 12.0 and 13.5per cent and a return on tangible equity of between 13.5 and 15.0 per cent in 2019.

3 Excludes balances relating to margins of 3.2billion 31December 2015: 2.5billion and settlement accounts of 1.8billion 31December 2015: 1.4billion.
Loans and advances to customers were 450billion compared with 455billion at 31December 2015.
The reduction reflects continued strong growth in Consumer Finance, up 11per cent, and SME lending, up 3per cent, with both segments outperforming the market.
This was offset by further reductions in closed portfolios, reduced lending to financial institutions and lower open book mortgage balances, reflecting the Groups prudent stance on risk and its focus on protecting margin in the current competitive low growth market.
Mortgage open book balances fell by 4.5billion to 266billion during the year, of which 3.4billion was in the first half and 1.1billion was in the second half.
Mortgage open book balances are expected to be broadly stable in 2017.
Deposits fell 1per cent to 413billion, with increased high quality deposits from Commercial clients offset by lower Retail and Consumer Finance tactical balances, largely in response to the active management of deposit and funding requirements.
The Group has maintained its strong funding position with a loan to deposit ratio of 109per cent 2015: 109per cent.
Wholesale funding decreased by 9billion to 111billion as excess liquidity is managed down.
Wholesale funding with a residual maturity of less thanone year was 35billion 2015:38billion, and the Groups term funding ratio was unchanged at 68per cent.
The Groups liquidity position remains strong, with the liquidity coverage ratio comfortably meeting regulatory requirements.

The CET1 ratio improved to 13.8 per cent 2015: 13.0per cent on a pro forma basis and reflects the retention of c. 80basis points of CET1 capital to cover the estimated capital impact of the MBNA acquisition.
The pro forma ratio includes the 2016 dividend paid by the Insurance business in February 2017.
The Group continues to be strongly capital generative and over the year generated c. 190 basis points of CET1 capital, pre dividend.
This largely comprised c. 220 basis points of underlying capital generation, along with benefits from a reduction in risk-weighted assets c. 40 basis points and the insurance dividend c. 20 basis points partially offset by conduct c. 100 basis points and other items.
This strong capital generation has enabled us to fully cover the expected CET1 capital impact of the MBNA acquisition, increase the ordinary dividend and pay a special dividend.
Going forward we now expect to generate 170 to 200 basis points of capital per annum pre dividends.
This will enable us to support sustainable growth in the business and help Britain prosper whilst delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.
The Group is pleased to announce that following their annual review the PRA has reduced our PRA Buffer to reflect the significant fide-risking undertaken by the Group in recent years.
Going forward however, there remain a number of potential regulatory capital developments including the introduction of the systemic risk buffer in 2019 and as a result the Boards view of the current level of CET1 capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties remains unchanged at around 13 per cent.
The amount of capital we believe is appropriate to hold is likely to vary from time to time depending on circumstances and the Board will continue to give due consideration, subject to the situation at the time, to the distribution of any surplus capital through the use of special dividends or share buy backs.
35 Financial results Summary of Group results continued The Groups total capital ratio remains strong at 21.4 per cent, significantly in excess of regulatory requirements.
Risk-weighted assets fell by 3per cent to 216billion with the reduction mainly arising in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of active balance sheet management including securitisations.
The leverage ratio on a pro forma basis increased to 5.0per cent 2015: 4.8per cent, largely reflecting the increase in tier 1 capital.
The tangible net asset value per share increased to 54.8 pence 31December 2015: 52.3pence after payment of the 2015 final and 2016 interim dividends totalling 2.85pence.
The increase reflects good underlying profitability partly offset by tax and other statutory items.
Dividend The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.7 pence per share, together with a capital distribution in the form of a special dividend of0.5pence per share.
This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 0.85 pence per share that was announced at the 2016 half year results.
The total ordinary dividend per share for 2016 of 2.55 pence per share has increased by 13per cent, from 2.25 pence per share in 2015 and is in line with our progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.
We continue to expect ordinary dividends to increase over the medium term with a dividend payout ratio of at least 50 per cent of sustainable earnings.
The special dividend of 0.5 pence per share represents the distribution of capital over and above the Boards view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties, and allows for the estimated capital impact of the MBNA acquisition.
