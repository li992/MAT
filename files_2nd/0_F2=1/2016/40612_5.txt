Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2016 OVERVIEW: A COMPELLING BUSINESS Pure Big Box: a focus on quality and location Since our IPO in December 2013, we have rapidly built an outstanding portfolio of 35 selectively acquired Big Boxes.
Our portfolio is well diversified by size, geography and tenant.
The assets are typically modern, in prime locations and fully let on long leases to institutional-grade tenants with upward-only rent reviews.
The character of these properties has changed they are no longer simple warehouses but are often now the central hub of an occupiers operation.
Many of our tenants have invested significant amounts in internal fit-out and sophisticated automation.
This investment may well exceed the cost of constructing the building, demonstrating tenant commitment to the asset.
We believe these factors give us one of the highest-quality portfolios in the UK quoted real estate sector and underpin our objective of delivering low-risk and growing income.
