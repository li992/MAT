Portfolio analysis by sector The Group funds spin-out companies based on a wide variety of scientific research emerging from leading research intensive institutions and does not limit itself to funding companies from particular areas of science.
The Group splits its core opportunity evaluation and business building team into four specialist divisions, Biotech, Cleantech, Healthcare and Technology.
Where the Group invests in businesses that cannot be classified within these divisions, primarily those portfolio companies which also invest in other opportunities, they are recorded in a separate sector as shown below.
Together these five sectors make up the university partnership business segment.
An update on the other two operating segments is included in the financial review on pages 34 to 37.
Total fair value includes 9.2m 2015: 8.5m attributable to minority interests represented by third party limited partners in the consolidated fund, IPVFII As can be seen from the table, the Groups portfolio by number of companies is well diversified across its four main sectors.
By fair value, however, the portfolio is currently more concentrated in the healthcare sector, largely as a result of the relative valuations of the Groups holdings in Oxford Nanopore Technologies Limited, hVIVO plc and Tissue Regenix Group plc.
