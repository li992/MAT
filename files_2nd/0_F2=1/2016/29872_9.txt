Portfolio Report Market Overview Developed and emerging equity markets both fell in the last 12 months.
The decline in emerging market equities, however, was more profound.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index declined by 8.8% for the 12 month period ended 31 March 2016.
In comparison, the MSCI World Index declined by 0.3% all data in sterling terms and on a total return basis.
One of the reasons for the recent underperformance of emerging markets when compared with developed markets was the uncertainty over the manner in which the US Federal Reserve Fed would move towards monetary policy normalisation.
Uncertainty over the end of quantitative easing in the US resulted in a rise in risk aversion and a flight to safety, resulting in outflows from emerging markets investments.
As a result, the USdollar strengthened against most emerging market currencies.
In December 2015, the Fed increased its target interest rate by 25 basis points 0.25%, citing several indicators that pointed to economic improvement.
Concerns about the global economic and financial environment, however, raised expectations that the rate of future interest rate increases would be slower than initially indicated, leading investors to refocus on the relatively undervalued emerging markets.
Although some emerging market countries faced headwinds such as soft domestic demand, low oil prices, weak exports and high inflation, emerging market economies overall continued to grow faster than developed market economies.
Chinas economy grew at a less robust pace in 2015 than in 2014, as strength in services and consumption was offset by weakness in fixed asset investment, trade, and manufacturing.
GDP growth in India outpaced that of China for the first time since 1999, with the Indian economy expanding by 7.5% in 2015 compared with Chinas 6.9%.
There have been many discussions on the accuracy of Chinas statistics, especially its GDP data, raising questions over whether the Chinese government has, over the years, been smoothing its GDP growth data by over and under reporting to achieve political targets.
The focus on Chinas GDP data has grown in recent years.
The main reason for this is that Chinas economy, as it grows, has become a significant part of the global economic system.
Like any other country, Chinas economic statistics, including its GDP number, are subject to errors and omissions.
Although it follows United Nations standards in compiling statistics, China, as an emerging economy country, faces difficulties in collecting accurate underlying data.
Additionally, China is in the midst of a transition from an export driven to a consumer led model, which could adversely impact some industries but also support others.
The growth of Chinas information technology sector is an obvious example.
Our travels to some second and third tier cities in China gave us the impression that the services sector was growing robustly, while we also noted that infrastructure and property investment had slowed down.
Services surpassed manufacturing as the largest contributor to Chinas GDP in 2013.
Thus, on the output side, with the rapid expansion of the service sector and rise of self-employment, it is also increasingly difficult to calculate total output accurately because the service sector, which is more diverse, less visible and less structured and institutionalised compared with more developed areas such as the US or Europe, is more susceptible to under reporting or omissions.
Another factor is the shift from an economy dominated by state owned enterprises to one that is now more driven by the private sector.
In general, numbers are now www.
co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 23 Portfolio Report continued collected by surveys from private companies, which are again more predisposed to bias, rather than historically, when production data was collected from state owned factories and businesses where there was greater access to production data.
More recently, some commentators have accused the Chinese government of under reporting their economic slowdown.
Their propositions are generally supported by other statistics.
For example, some have suggested that power output in China has been stagnant, indicating that the real economy is in a much worse condition.
This, however, largely ignores the fact that the structure of Chinas economy has been changing, with the output of many high power propensity sectors such as metals being replaced by low power propensity service sectors.
While there is no doubt that the accuracy of Chinas GDP data could be improved further, we believe that it remains a reasonable indicator of the general growth of the Chinese economy and is an important guide to policy direction.
Moreover, it is important to look at a range of data when accessing Chinas economic situation as opposed to purely focusing on the GDP data.
Elsewhere, Russias 2015 GDP contracted amid declining oil prices and a weakening Russian rouble.
In the fourth quarter, Brazils quarterly GDP continued to contract, but at a slower rate than in the second and third quarters.
In contrast, South Korea, Indonesia and Hungary showed signs of improvement.
Several emerging market central banks, including those of Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, raised their benchmark interest rates to control inflation and support their currencies, while some, including those of India and China, lowered their benchmark interest rates to promote economic growth.
Investor concerns about Chinas moderating economic growth and lower commodity demand, as well as the People Bank of Chinas PBOC effective currency devaluation, contributed to volatility in global stock, commodity and currency markets.
Price declines of many commodities, particularly crude oil, negatively affected certain commodity producing countries economies, financial positions and currencies, weighing further on investor sentiment.
However, the accommodative monetary policies of several major central banks provided investors with some optimism.
China took additional monetary and fiscal stimulus measures to support economic growth, bolstering investor sentiment in December.
But a plunge in Chinas domestic A-share market on 4 January 2016, which triggered the countrys new circuit breaker system and halted trading, led to declines in emerging market stocks, exacerbated by a collapse in crude oil prices.
Oil prices declined to less than US$30 per barrel, the lowest level in more than a decade in January, but rebounded to circa US$40 by the end of March.
A similar trend was seen across most commodities.
While some commodity rich markets such as Brazil and Russia were adversely impacted by these low prices, others such as commodity importers China and India benefited.
Stocks began to regain some ground in late January as crude oil prices appeared to stabilise and the PBOC further reduced the cash reserve requirement for banks.
24 Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC www.
co. uk Engulfed in political and economic instability, the Brazilian market declined by 39.9% to reach a period-low in January, before rebounding sharply in the final months to end the reporting period down by 8.6% in sterling terms.
An economy in recession, high inflation, rising interest rates and unemployment, depreciation in the currency the real and weak commodity prices led investors to avoid the market.
On the basis of considerable political and economic challenges, two international rating agencies, Standard & Poors and Moodys, downgraded the countrys credit rating to junk status.
This, allied with the continuation of one of Brazils largest corruption investigations at the state oil company, further pressured investor confidence.
Market sentiment, however, improved significantly in March when it rose by 26.6%.
The likelihood of President Dilma Rousseff s impeachment raised investors hopes for a change in leadership well before elections in 2018.
A late rally in commodity prices, buoyed by hopes that measures to restrain production by major energy and metals producers would ease oversupply issues, and appreciation in the real in March, further supported Brazilian equities.

Despite energy industry headwinds, the company reported its highest operating profits since 2012 in 2015 and also announced a higher than expected dividend.
Healthy refining margins and expectations that the rebound in oil prices in early 2016 would be likely to lead to higher than expected earnings in the first quarter of 2016 and a positive management outlook on Asian gross refining margins in 2016, further supported sentiment in the share price.
We used this opportunity to realise gains.
Listed in the UK, but with a significant exposure to emerging markets, Unilever performed relatively well.
Better than expected 2015 corporate results and continued demand in emerging markets supported the stock.
We believe that this global consumer company has the experience and range of products to take advantage of the growing demand for personal care, food, refreshment and home care products from the billions of people in emerging markets.
Guangzhou Automobile Group is a major Chinese car and commercial vehicle manufacturer.
The business is most noted for its partnership with Honda and Toyota.
Stronger than expected 2015 earnings thanks to sales volume growth and effective cost controls and a strong product pipeline, especially for sports utility vehicles drove the share price in the second half of the reporting period.
While we reduced our holdings, we believe that the Chinese car market has great potential and that the company is a well-managed means to address rising demand.

co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 27 Portfolio Report continued Brilliance China Automotive is a major Chinese automobile manufacturer with a joint venture with BMW for the production and sale of BMW 3-series and 5-series vehicles in China.
Reduced earnings in 2015, resulting from price cuts and larger dealer incentives, and muted sales growth hurt the share price.
Concerns about competition and loss of market share also played a role.
Investor sentiment, however, improved in March on expectations that new product launches could drive sales and profitability in the second half of 2016.
While we trimmed our holdings in the stock to reduce concentration and rebalance the portfolio, we believe that Brilliance China Automotive will continue to have an attractive product range which will enable it over time to benefit from the greater demand that we expect for luxury automobiles in China and thus continue to maintain a significant exposure to the stock.
Kumba Iron Ore a South African producer declined by more than 75% in the reporting period amid weak iron ore prices and low confidence in a recovery in the near term.
While we initially added to this stock over the reporting period, in view of the continued weakness in the sector and the companys decision to suspend dividends, we began reducing our holdings in the latter part of the reporting period.
Dairy Farm is a Hong Kong based regional supermarket, drug store and convenience store operator with a presence across Greater China and Southeast Asia.

c No companies held by TEMIT in this country.
d TEMIT sold out of this country in the year to 31 March 2016.
The performance of TEMITs NAV lagged that of the MSCI Emerging Market Index during the 12 month period largely because of stock selection in China although an underweight exposure helped offset some of the detraction, Thailand and South Africa.
An overweight exposure to Pakistan, which is not part of the benchmark index also had a negative impact on relative performance.
We reduced our exposure to China and Thailand but increased holdings in South Africa due to the availability of attractive investments.
The leading contributor to relative performance was an overweight allocation to the United Kingdom via the portfolios holding in Unilever, which is not part of the benchmark index.
No exposure to Greece, which underperformed its emerging market peers during the period, further supported relative returns.
Good stock selection in South Korea and Turkey, where an overweight position also helped, had a positive impact.
Holdings in Turkey were reduced, while purchases were made in South Korea as we continued to reposition the portfolio.
Overview of current themes and portfolio changes Over the past 12 months in particular, we have scrutinised the portfolio to focus on how we can improve performance and ensure that we are well positioned to benefit from the anticipated recovery in emerging markets going forward.
We have also looked in detail at how risks are assessed and controlled.
In reassessing our approach to risk, we are seeking an optimum balance between risk and reward.
This does not mean that we will become more index aware or seek to track market indices more closely.
co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 29 Portfolio Report continued As a result of the above efforts, we made significant changes to the portfolio.
The most obvious change has been the increase in diversification, with the number of holdings in TEMIT nearly doubling to 88 from 48, which should help ensure that the portfolio is not too heavily exposed to any one company, sector or market.
As a result, the top 20 stocks accounted for 55.7% of the portfolio as at 31 March 2016, compared with 71.1% at the start of the reporting period.
A full list of portfolio holdings can be found on pages 40 to 44 of this report.
New Purchases Among the 50 new stocks that were added to the portfolio, the most prevalent were in the information technology sector.
While over the years expensive valuations have resulted in few purchases in this area, the recent market environment resulted in many technology stocks falling in price and coming into our value range, allowing us to accumulate stock at a more reasonable level for a realistic five year growth story.
Major additions in this area included leading global electronics manufacturer Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the worlds largest independent integrated circuit foundry, Tencent, one of the largest and most widely used internet service portals in the world, SK Hynix, one of the biggest DRAM Dynamic Random Access Memory makers in the world, and Naspers, a major diversified media group.
Additional purchases were made in consumer staple retailers such as Lojas Americanas, which is a leading discount department retail chain with low ticket prices and a reputation for selling products at fair prices, and M. Dias Branco, which produces and sells basic food items such as crackers, pasta and flour, both of which could see greater demand for their products in Brazils weaker macroeconomic environment.
Indian pharmaceuticals companies Biocon, Dr. Reddys Laboratories and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals were also added to the portfolio.
As populations around the world, and particularly in developing countries, grow wealthier and live longer, the demand for health care support for acute and chronic ailments is likely to increase, which should benefit health care companies, especially those that command a dominant position in their market.
Purchases of America Mvil, a leading provider of wireless communications in Latin America and MTN Group, Africas largest cellular network in terms of subscribers, resulted in us initiating exposure to the telecommunication services sector during the reporting year.
We believe that both companies have the prospect of strong growth from a combination of economic growth and rising mobile phone penetration in their respective markets.
A number of selective additions were also made in the frontier markets of Argentina, Kenya and Nigeria as we ventured into this relatively newer set of emerging markets.
Purchases included MercadoLibre, operator of an online commerce platform in Latin America, KCB Group, one of the largest banks in Kenya, and Nigerian Breweries, one of the biggest brewing companies in the country.
We believe that the relatively low correlation of frontier markets to global markets provides the Company with an opportunity to diversify our investment portfolio.
Frontier markets have historically had low correlation with developed and emerging markets, as well as with other frontier markets.
This is due in part to differences in the underlying industries and growth drivers in each country.
Adding frontier markets exposure, as a component of the international portion of a portfolio, could help reduce overall volatility and provide a source of diversification.
30 Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC www.
co. uk While it is clear that frontier markets offer investors an attractive investment opportunity, we have not forgotten about the challenges.
Some investors perceive that frontier markets growth premiums are available only at the cost of heightened risk caused by factors such as political instability, low shareholder protection and corruption.
We would contend that the risks inherent in most frontier markets are more salient, but similar to the political, country and stock-specific risks in any other market, whether developed or emerging.
The real difference is a lower degree of understanding and research on the part of the global investment community.
We believe that research-oriented and detailed investment models allow investors a great deal of insight to better manage this information gap.
TEMIT currently has 5.0% invested in frontier markets compared with 4.2% in 2015.
Market-specific risks are discounted in valuations and can be managed through a rigorous investment process.
We believe that frontier markets present a strong investment case for long-term investors seeking to take advantage of this new wave of emerging markets.

co. uk Market Outlook While 2015 was a challenging time for investors in emerging markets, outflows from emerging markets tapered off in the first quarter of 2016, with flows turning positive in March as investors focused on the attractive value apparent in those markets.
In our opinion, the long-term investment case for emerging markets remains positive as economic growth rates in general continue to be faster than those of developed markets: emerging markets have much greater foreign reserves than developed markets: and the debt-to-GDP ratios of emerging market countries generally remain lower than those of developed markets.
Even with major economies like Russia and Brazil in recession, emerging markets growth in 2016 is expected to be 4.3%, more than twice the rate of the 2.1% growth projected for developed markets.
Though investors have been concerned with Chinas growth rate slowing down, we believe that the fundamentals of Chinas economy remain positive, and it is still one of the largest and fastest-growing major economies in the world, even with a moderation in its growth rate.
China is in the midst of a transition from an export-driven to a consumer-led model, which could impact some industries but also create new ones.
Market volatility is likely to continue in China and other emerging markets but, in our view, periods of heightened volatility represent potential investment opportunities, allowing us to acquire shares which we see as having fallen significantly.
Elsewhere, we remain optimistic about investing in the South Korean market over the long term.
The countrys well-established export sector spans a range of industries from shipbuilding and construction, through car manufacturing and consumer electronics to advanced technology, with levels of expertise placing the countrys businesses among leaders globally in many fields.
At the same time, a well-developed and sophisticated domestic consumer economy has developed, which is receiving further impetus from government moves to stimulate spending, encourage entrepreneurship and increase economic participation rates, particularly among women.
Thus, we continue to monitor potential opportunities in this market.
A country with a large and growing consumer base, Brazil remains a key market in the portfolio and a market in which we added exposure during the year.
Stock markets usually run ahead of the real economy, so, in our opinion, the market had already priced the economic recession.
This led us to focus on individual companies and their ability to weather or even prosper from any economic downturn.
During a recent visit to Brazil, our team met a number of companies which are surviving in the face of the negative growth rates and are actually looking forward to a strong revival as industries consolidate and the market share of well-positioned companies improves.
Thus, we view the situation in Brazil as an opportunity to buy stocks at attractive prices, especially stocks of well-managed, high-quality companies that have been affected by broad-based selloffs amid indiscriminate negative sentiment.
Emerging market countries account for nearly three quarters of the worlds land mass and four fifths of the worlds population, present considerable potential in terms of resources and demographics, and are in a strong position to benefit from technological advances.
It is also important to remember that emerging market countries represent a large share of world economic activity and equity market capitalisation.
co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 47 Portfolio Report continued The largest risk which we see to emerging markets performance in 2016 would be from unforeseen events, either geopolitical or financial.
While most known risk factors are generally already discounted into market valuations, investors tend to have a disproportionately negative reaction to surprises, and often emerging markets bear the brunt of a flight to safety on these occasions.
While heightened market volatility can be unsettling, we aim to look beyond the short term to find and invest in well-managed growth leaders at what we believe are attractive valuations.
As we look forward, it is important to note that times of stress in financial markets can offer the largest upside potential in the medium term.
