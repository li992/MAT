Further detail on counterparty and risk exposures is included in the Risk review on pages 134 to 181.
Capital in branches and subsidiaries is maintained on the basis ofhost regulators requirements and the Groups assessment ofcapital requirements under normal and stressed conditions.
Suitable processes and controls are in place to monitor and manage capital adequacy and ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements in all Group entities.
These processes are designed to ensure that we have sufficient capital available to meet local regulatory capital requirements.
Standard Chartered Bank is authorised by the PRA and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA.
The Group operates through branches and a number of significant subsidiaries including Standard Chartered Bank, Standard Chartered Bank HK Limited and Standard Chartered Bank Korea Limited.
These subsidiaries are subject to local regulation and, therefore may be subject to different rules relating to capital and RWA requirements and the implementation and phasing of Basel III.
The Groups 2016 Pillar 3 Disclosures provide further details on these subsidiaries.
