The three-year total property return is calculated assuming annual reinvestment.
Annualised three-year total return and total shareholder return are calculated on a basis consistent with the Groups long-term incentive plans.
A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level including underlying earnings per share or specifically relevant to each estate, for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Venues.
These are discussed further in the asset-specific operating reviews in the Strategic Report.
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors remuneration.
These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Groups strategy of creating and growing value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer term.
Total property return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual bonuses available to certain of the Groups employees.
