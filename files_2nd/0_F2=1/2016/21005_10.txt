Alternative performance measures The Group aims to maximise shareholder value by optimising potential for return on capital through strategic portfolio investment and divestment, by ensuring the Groups capital structure is managed to support both strategic and operational requirements, and by delivering returns through a focus on organic growth and operational discipline.
The Board considers that it is helpful to provide, where practicable, performance measures that distinguish between these different factors these are also the measures that the Board uses to assess the performance of the Group.
Accordingly, the Annual Report presents the following non-GAAP measures alongside standard accounting terms as prescribed by IFRS and the Companies Act, in order to provide this useful additional information.
Adjusted profit measures The Group uses Adjusted profit measures to assist readers in understanding underlying operational performance.
These measures exclude income statement items arising from portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to capital structure.
Such items arise from events which are non-recurring or intermittent, and while they may generate substantial income statement amounts, do not relate to the ongoing operational performance that underpins long-term value generation.
The income statement items that are excluded from Adjusted profit measures are referred to as Adjusting items.
Both Adjusted profit measures and Adjusting items are presented together with statutory measures on the face of the income statement.
In addition, the Group presents a non-GAAP profit measure, Adjusted EBITDA, in order to aid comparisons with peer group companies and provide a reference point for assessing the operational cash generation of the Group.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted Operating Profit before depreciation.
The Group measures operational profit margins with reference to Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusting items are not a defined term under IFRS, so may not be comparable to similar terminology used in other financial statements.
Details of the charges and credits presented as Adjusting items are set out in Note 7 to the financial statements.
The basis for treating these items as Adjusting is as follows: Exceptional items Exceptional items are recorded in accordance with the Groups policy set out in Note 1 to the financial statements.
They arise from both portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to the Groups capital structure, and so do not reflect current operational performance.
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations Charges for amortisation of acquired intangibles arise from the purchase consideration of a number of separate acquisitions.
These acquisitions are portfolio investment decisions that took place at different times over several years, and so the associated amortisation does not reflect current operational performance.
Share-based payments As a result of the IPO a number of employee share schemes have been introduced, as set out in Note 10 to the financial statements.
As a result, there is a lack of comparability between periods in respect of share scheme costs.
As this arises from a change triggered by the IPO change in capital structure, these costs have been treated as Adjusting items.
Gains on disposal Gains on disposal of businesses arise from divestment decisions that are part of strategic portfolio management, and do not reflect current operational performance.
Finance costs Certain elements of finance costs incurred as a result of debt refinancing and are therefore a result of changes to the Groups capital structure.
In addition, as part of the IPO, shareholder debt was converted to equity, and as a result there is a lack of comparability between periods in respect of the interest previously incurred on this shareholder debt.
Tax related to adjusting items The elements of the overall Group tax charge relating to the above Adjusting items are also treated as Adjusting.
These elements of the tax charge are calculated with reference to the specific tax treatment of each individual Adjusting item, taking into account its tax deductibility, the tax jurisdiction concerned and any previously recognised tax assets or liabilities.
24 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Adjusted cash flow measures The Group uses Adjusted cash flow measures for the same purpose as Adjusted profit measures, in order to assist readers of the accounts in understanding the ongoing operational performance of the Group.
The two measures used are Adjusted Cash Generated from Operations, and Free Cash Flow.
These are reconciled to IFRS measures as follows: m 2016 2015 Cash generated from operations 95.9 79.9 Add back: acquisition-related contingent employment cash flow 4.0 Add back: other exceptional cash flow 7.6 12.1 Adjusted cash generated from operations 107.5 92.0 m 2016 2015 Net cash from operating activities 92.4 78.7 Add back: acquisition-related contingent employment cash flow 4.0 Add back: other exceptional cash flow 7.6 12.1 Less: capital expenditure 13.1 10.9 Free cash flow 90.9 79.9 The Group monitors its operational balance sheet efficiency with reference to operational cash conversion, defined as Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA.
Organic growth measures In order to assess whether the Group is achieving its strategic goal of driving organic growth, it is helpful to compare like-for-like operational results between periods.
Reported income statement measures, both Adjusted and statutory, can be significantly affected by the following factors which mask like-for-like comparability: acquisitions and disposals of businesses lead to a lack of comparability between periods due to consolidation of only part of a years results for these businesses: changes in exchange rates used to record the results of non-sterling businesses results in a lack of comparability between periods as equivalent local currency amounts are recorded at different sterling amounts in different periods: and event timing differences between periods.
The Group has no significant biennial events, but when annual events are held at different times of year this can affect the comparability of half-year results.
The Group therefore defines Organic growth measures, which are calculated with the following adjustments: results of acquired and disposed businesses are excluded where the Group results include only part-year results in either current or prior periods: prior year consolidated results are restated at current year exchange rates for non-sterling businesses: and prior year results are adjusted such that comparative results of events that have been held at different times of year are included in the same period as the current year results.

In order to present a consistent measure of earnings between periods, the Group presents Proforma measures of EPS in which major changes to the number of shares in issue are presented as if they had occurred on the first day of the comparative period.
In presenting the 2016 financial statements, the IPO which completed on 12 February 2016 is treated as such a major change, and so accordingly Proforma EPS is calculated using a weighted average number of shares as if the IPO had occurred at the beginning of the 2015 financial year.
Details are set out in Note 14 of the financial statements.
