Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 10 Dedicated to Meeting Our Commitments Advancing towards our 2018 production goals Having already surpassed our gold production targets, we must ensure that our silver mines deliver as planned in the coming years: successfully turning around performance at Fresnillo with accelerated development rates and plant optimisation: increasing the rate of development to sustain capacity utilisation at Saucito: and delivering the second phase of San Julin.
We also seek to replenish reserves and improve productivity at each of our mines.
