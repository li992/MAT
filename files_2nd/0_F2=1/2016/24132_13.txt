Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 30 Key Performance Indicators 1 Operate Our performance in the year Silver and gold production both increased in the year: silver, with the start-up of San Julin, and higher ore grades at Fresnillo and Cinega, and gold mainly as a result of the reduction in inventories from the leaching pads at Herradura.
The devaluation of the Mexican peso, combined with our continued focus on efficiency and controlling costs, led to lower cost per tonne at every mine.

Commissioning of the flotation plant phase II has been delayed from year end 2016 to 2Q 2017 due to a combination of external factors.
Construction began on the new Pyrites facility, with the first phase leaching plant on track to come on line in 1Q 2018.
The Centauro Extension project at Herradura, encompassing a second line to the dynamic leaching plant, was approved and construction began, with start-up expected in 2018.
