The directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over a three year period, taking into account its recent historical performance, forecasts, principal risks and mitigating factors.
A three year period is considered the appropriate timeframe to assess the Groups prospects as it is consistent with the Groups strategic planning and review period, management incentive schemes and medium term financing considerations.
The strategic review incorporates plans at both the Group and Operating Division level.
The plans consider the Groups cash flows, committed funding liquidity positions, forecast future funding and key financial metrics.
Using the strategic plan as a base, we have modelled a range of severe but plausible scenarios reflecting the Groups principal risks to establish their effect on the Groups cash and bank facilities.
The directors, having carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, along with their potential financial impact, consider that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 August 2019.
