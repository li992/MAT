As companies seek to outsource their quality assurance activities, Intertek is uniquely positioned to be their end-toend Quality Assurance partner.
Companies are facing an increased number of challenges driven by the growing complexity in their operations creating unprecedented levels of supply chain risk.
From increasingly decentralised manufacturing to multiple distribution channels with the release of immediate news in social media, the risks of doing business in an increasingly transparent global market place are escalating fast.
As a result, demand is growing among companies for Total Quality Assurance solutions that extend above and beyond the quality and safety of physical components, products and assets to embrace and maximise the reliability of their processes and management.
At Intertek, our global scale means we have more than 1,000 Testing, Inspection and Certification laboratories in over 100 countries across the world.
And our 42,000 employees include 3,000 Assurance auditors carrying out more than 100,000 audits every year.
We have evolved our Quality Assurance offering to meet the growing needs of our customers with our ATIC solutions.
