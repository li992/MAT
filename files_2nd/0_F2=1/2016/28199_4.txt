OUR STRATEGY BUILD AND ADVANCE LONG-TERM GROWTH PIPELINE THROUGH OPPORTUNISTIC M&A AND GREENFIELD EXPLORATION TARGETS FOR 2017 While generating free cash flow from existing operations, we want to secure high-quality sources of long-term growth through Complete in-fill drilling and resource estimate at Nezhda our own greenfield exploration programme and opportunistic M&A.
We are actively looking at targets within the Former Soviet Union, Integrate Kapan mine in Armenia where we can create value with our core competencies.
Pursue further targets in the In 2016, we made significant progress on both fronts.
