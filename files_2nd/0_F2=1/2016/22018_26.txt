In respect of shares held in the BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust, the trustee abstains from voting those shares.
If there is an offer for the shares, the trustee does not have to accept or reject the offer but will have regard to the interests of the participants, may consult them to obtain their views on the offer and may otherwise take the action with respect to the offer it thinks fair.
