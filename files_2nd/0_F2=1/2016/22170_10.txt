Future projects are expected to be focused in the health, transport and education sectors, where we have a strong track record, and the capital value of these projects is estimated to be worth in the regionof 6 billion over the next five years.
Canada continues to have a major PPP investment programme, which hasa capital value estimated to be worth around C$60 billion over the next10 to 15 years.
Our target markets, which are estimated to be worth around C$20 billion over this period, are in Ontario and British Columbia as wellas target projects in other provinces where a growing pipeline of opportunities is starting to emerge.
However, the competitive landscape remains challenging in Canada and we therefore continue to apply a very selective approach to the contracts for which we bid to ensure we achieve our target returns on investment.
We have yet to secure our first PPP project in the Middle East and North Africa, although interest in alternative forms of project finance continues toincrease, including opportunities to use private finance models to deliverbuilding and infrastructure projects, as the prolonged low oil priceaffects the ability of some Gulf states to achieve their ambitions for investing in social infrastructure.
