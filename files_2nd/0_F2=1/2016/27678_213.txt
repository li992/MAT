These are reversed on acquisition in the statement of financial position and replaced by goodwill and other intangible assets, including the value of the acquired present value of in-force business acquired PVIF.
In determining AOP, the Group recognises deferred revenue, acquisition costs and deferred revenue in relation to policies sold by acquired businesses prior to the acquisition date.
The Group excludes the impairment of goodwill, the impairment of investments in associated undertakings, the amortisation and impairment of acquired other intangible assets, acquired PVIF and the movements in certain acquisition date provisions from the determination of AOP.
Costs incurred on completed acquisitions are also excluded from AOP.
Certain deferred consideration recognised as compensation expenses under accounting rules is excluded from the determination of AOP where these payments meet the criteria that suggest they are capital in nature.
The net effect of these adjustments to determine AOP are summarised below: Y ear ended 31 December 2016 m Institutional plc Emerging Old Mutual Asset Head Markets Wealth Nedbank Management Office Total Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 64 46 110 Impairment of investment in associated undertakings 50 50 Amortisation of acquired PVIF 4 45 49 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 8 8 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 14 38 2 54 Acquisition costs 17 5 22 Deferred consideration and other acquisition date provisions 6 7 1 76 138 50 7 7 278 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 177 Y ear ended 31 December 2015 m Institutional plc Emerging Old Mutual Asset Head Markets Wealth Nedbank Management Office Total Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 23 23 Amortisation of acquired PVIF 7 51 58 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 13 13 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 13 56 69 Acquisition costs 4 10 14 Deferred consideration and other acquisition date provisions 16 16 24 120 23 167 The impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and impairment of investment in associated undertakings relate to: Emerging Markets The goodwill impairment loss of 64 million relates to the Old Mutual Southern and East Africa OMSEA cash generating unit.

Refer to note I2 b for further information.
c Net profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments The net profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments is analysed below: m Y ear ended Y ear ended 31 December 31 December Notes 2016 2015 Emerging Markets 3 15 Nedbank 12 Old Mutual Wealth 52 Old Mutual plc 10 Net profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments continuing operations 1 37 Net profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments discontinued operations K1 a 18 1 Net profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments 19 36 Emerging Markets Current period transaction During the year, Emerging Markets reduced or disposed of its holdings in a number of associated undertakings resulting in a net profit on disposal of 3 million.
Prior period transaction On 10 December 2015, Old Mutual Investment Group, a subsidiary of the Group, acquired an additional 50% stake in African Infrastructure Investment Managers Pty Limited AIIM.
The accounting related to the step up in ownership from 50% to 100% effectively involved a simultaneous sale of 50% of the business, followed by an acquisition of the fair value of 100% of the business.
The profit of 15 million realised in the financial year ended 31 December 2015 represents the difference between the fair value of the initial 50% and the carrying amount of the investment in AIIM at 10 December 2015.
Nedbank Current period transactions On 3 October 2016, Nedbank acquired an additional 10.9% stake in Banco Unico, SA.
The accounting related to the step up in ownership from 38.3% to 50% plus one share is such that it effectively requires a simultaneous sale of 38.3% followed by an acquisition of the fair value of 50% plus one share of the business.
Consequently a loss of 1 1 million, comprising of a loss on step up acquisition of the associate and a release of foreign currency translation reserves, was realised on the transaction.
In addition, a loss of 1 million was recognised on conversion of preference shares to ordinary shares by ETI.
Consistent with usual Group practice, these losses were recognised in profit or loss but excluded from the determination of AOP.

d Short-term fluctuations in investment return Profit before tax, as disclosed in the consolidated IFRS income statement, includes actual investment returns earned on the shareholder assets of the Groups life assurance and property & casualty businesses.
AOP is stated after recalculating shareholder asset investment returns based on a long-term investment return rate.
The difference between the actual and the long-term investment returns is referred to as the short-term fluctuation in investment return.
Long-term rates of investment return are based on achieved rates of return appropriate to the underlying asset base, adjusted for current inflation expectations, default assumptions, costs of investment management and consensus economic investment forecasts.
The underlying rates are principally derived with reference to 10-year government bond rates, cash and money market rates and an explicit equity risk premium for South African businesses.
The rates set out below reflect the apportionment of underlying investments in cash deposits, money market instruments and equity assets.
Long-term rates of return are reviewed annually by the Board.
The Boards review of the long-term rates of return seeks to ensure that the returns credited to AOP are consistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long term.
For Emerging Markets, the return is applied to an average value of investible shareholders assets, adjusted for net fund flows.
For Old Mutual Wealth, the return is applied to average investible assets.

These include investments in the Companys ordinary shares and the subordinated liabilities and ordinary shares issued by the Group.
These investment returns are eliminated within the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before tax, but are included in AOP.
This ensures consistency of treatment with the measures in the related policyholder liability.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the investment return adjustment increased AOP by 43 million year ended 31 December 2015: 31 million.
f Dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities Dividends declared to the holders of the Groups perpetual preferred callable securities on an AOP basis were 17 million for the year ended 31 December 2016 year ended 31 December 2015: 31 million.
For the purpose of determining AOP, these are recognised in finance costs on an accrual basis.
In accordance with IFRS, the total cash distribution is recognised directly in equity.
g Institutional Asset Management equity plans Institutional Asset Management has a number of long-term incentive arrangements with senior employees in its asset management affiliates.
As part of the incentive schemes in the Institutional Asset Management business, the Group has granted put options over the equity of certain affiliates to senior affiliate employees.
The impact of revaluing these instruments in accordance with IFRS is excluded from AOP.
At 31 December 2016, the impact of revaluing these instruments and the exclusion of acquisition related compensation expense with Landmark employees was a loss of 20 million year ended 31 December 2015: loss of 9 million.
h Credit-related fair value losses on Group debt instruments The widening of the credit spread on the Groups debt instruments can cause the market value of these instruments to decrease, resulting in gains being recognised in profit or loss.
Conversely, if the credit spread narrows the market value of debt instruments will increase causing losses to be recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In the Directors view, such movements are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and will reverse over time until the date of maturity.
Therefore they have been excluded from AOP.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, due to the narrowing of credit spreads, a net loss of 24 million was recognised year ended 31 December 2015: net gain of 7 million.
i Old Mutual Wealth business transformation costs In 2013, Old Mutual Wealth UK business embarked on a significant programme to develop new platform capabilities and to outsource UK business administration.
This will involve replacing many aspects of the existing UK platform, and on completion certain elements of service provision will be migrated to International Financial Data Services IFDS under a long-term outsourcing agreement.
Management has determined that the cost of developing the new technology cannot be capitalised, hence these costs and the costs of decommissioning existing technology and migrating of services to IFDS are excluded from AOP.
Only costs that are directly attributable to the programme are excluded from AOP as management is of the view that this long-term investment in operational capability is a non-operating item.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, these costs totalled 102 million year ended 31 December 2015: 97 million.
