We committed to an additional stake in one existing PPP project during the year for 37.0 million.
In addition, equity and loan note subscriptions of 155.2 million were injected into existing projects in the portfolio as they progressed through, or completed, construction.
During 2016, the Group completed the realisation of five investments for a total consideration of 146.6 million.
Cash yield received from projects during the year totalled 34.8 million.
The movement in fair value of 214.4 million is analysed in the table below.
The fair value movement includes a net benefit of 27.5 million from the amendment of benchmark discount rates for certain investments in response to our understanding and experience of the secondary market.

Foreign exchange movements are addressed further in the Financial Review section.
The adverse fair value movement of 17.2 million relating to value enhancements and other changes arose partly due to the matters described in the Chief Executive Officers Review in relation to the Groups investments in New Royal Adelaide Hospital and Manchester Waste VL Co.
There were also value reductions on some other investments, offset by value enhancements.
