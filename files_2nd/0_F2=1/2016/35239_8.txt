Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2016 26 STRATEGIC REPORT Create well-designed space Developments for delivery in 2019 Brunel Building, Paddington W2 and 80 Charlotte Street, Fitzrovia W1 will provide good quality, well-priced product in locations benefitting from Crossrail.
Investing in improving areas Paddington is served by a major London rail terminus and underground station, but its rental performance has lagged behind many central London hotspots in this cycle.
However, we think that its outlook will be much improved by the time we deliver this property in 2019.
Crossrail will open in 2018 greatly improving the locations eastbound connectivity.
For instance it will take four minutes to travel by train to Tottenham Court Road.
In addition the area is seeing significant investment in the built environment and public realm both by ourselves and other parties.
Buying well, improving our interest We acquired the leasehold of the original 78,000 sq ft building, which forms the site of Brunel Building W2, for 23.4m in 2001.
We kept it occupied until December 2015, when it was cleared ahead of demolition.
During our ownership Brunel Building, Paddington, we achieved planning for a new 240,000 sq ft office development as well as an adjoining residential and is well placed by a Crossrail retail block.
We also negotiated with the freeholder and the intermediate long leaseholder converting station, which is expected to our position to a 999-year long leasehold with a 2.5% ground rent on the offices.
The planning significantly improve the uplift represented an increase of 208% in our developable area.

The building, designed by Fletcher Priest architects, will have column-free floors, two major terraces on the upper floors, and has 17,000 sq ft floorplates which are designed to be multi-let.
It will open onto a new public canalside walkway and sits opposite one entrance to Paddington Crossrail station.
Laing ORourke is the contractor on a fixed price contract.
The ERV is 62.50 per sq ft, and we estimate our break-even rent is only c. 46 per sq ft. STRATEGIC REPORT 27 Brunel Building W2 80 Charlotte Street, Fitzrovia, will be our new flagship in the heart of our largest village, which is also fast improving.
Investing in improving areas Fitzrovia is one of Londons most improving areas.
There has been considerable investment in the past few years which has attracted major occupiers such as Capita, Este Lauder and Facebook.
We have already had considerable success at Charlotte Building, 1-2 Stephen Street and 90 Whitfield Street and expect the momentum to continue following the major changes to the eastern end of Oxford Street ahead of the opening of the new Tottenham Court Road Crossrail station in 2018.
Significant investment in the public realm is planned, including improvements to Tottenham Court Road with the introduction of increased pedestrianisation and public spaces.
Buying well, improving our interest 80 Charlotte Street W1 is a major one and a half acre site.
The majority of the buildings have been home to Saatchi & Saatchi for 40 years.
In 2016 Saatchi completed its move to two new buildings that we had created at Turnmill EC1 and 40 Chancery Lane WC2.
As a result we will now be able to complete the site demolition.
Creating the right product A complete island site in central London is a rare opportunity and we also had the advantage of owning nearby properties.
This allowed Derwent London to create a 380,000 sq ft scheme adding 62% to the net lettable area.
The island site will comprise 302,000 sq ft of offices, which will have 40,000 sq ft floorplates capable of being multi-let.
During 2016 we enhanced the planning to enable us to deliver 2.9m floor to ceiling heights across all the office space.
The average ERV on the offices is 80 per sq ft, compared with a break-even rent of c. 58 per sq ft. We are also introducing 14,000 sq ft retail, 14,000 sq ft of private residential and a pocket park.
At the adjoining Asta House we are developing 31,000 sq ft of residential space, of which 32% is affordable, plus 12,000 sq ft of offices.
Since the year end, Arup has agreed to pre-let 133,600 sq ft for an annual rent of 9.7m.
