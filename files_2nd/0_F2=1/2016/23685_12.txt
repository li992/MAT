North America consumed 1.1 million 2012 tonnes of rails in 2016, a 24% decline from 29.2 76.0 14.4 2015 levels, amid reduced CAPEX spending 119.6 at Class-I railroads due to weak energy E&P activity and lower coal shipments.
Demand for Long Products Flat products Tubular products wire rod and plate was stable.
Finished steel product imports, which significantly influenced the US steel industry in 2015, dropped by 16% year-on-year to 23 million tonnes in 2016 amid anti-dumping duties and pending trade cases against certain producers.
Despite efforts to promote healthy competition and eliminate import dumping activity, weak North American demand undermined local steel prices.
Prices dropped in 2016 by 2% to US$599 per tonne for flat products, by 9% to US$586 per tonne for rebar, and by 22% to US$881 per tonne for OCTG.
