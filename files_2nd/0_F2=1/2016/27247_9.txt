FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 ANNUAL REPORT BUSINESS MODEL CONTINUED What Are Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans?
continued The below chart shows the typical capital structure of a borrower.
Sample Capital Structure Senior secured floating rate loans earn a variable rate of interest that includes a stated spread also known as the margin or coupon, which reflects issuer risk, over a widely accepted base rate such as LIBOR.
The floating rate on senior secured floating rate loans typically resets every 30 to 90 days in line with the prevailing rate of LIBOR and, because such loans reset on a regular basis, the yield is described as floating.
The Investment Managers experience is that LIBOR floors are a common feature of almost all new loan issues in the U. S. : LIBOR floors guarantee a minimum level of LIBOR to investors irrespective of the prevailing interest rate.
If LIBOR exceeds the floor then such loans pay the prevailing LIBOR as well as the credit spread.
The return is generated by LIBOR or the LIBOR floor, the spread over LIBOR paid by the borrower due to the terms of the underlying loan and the discount.
The discount occurs because new issues are commonly priced, in the Investment Managers experience, at a discount to the par value of the loan.
