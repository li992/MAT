Salary levels are determined taking into account pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Company and market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies in the FTSE 250.
Salaries are normally reviewed in July each year unless responsibilities change.
This year salaries will increase by 1.25% which is in line with the average increase for the UK workforce.

The Committee was of the view that the bonus plan had become overly complex.
Having taken advice, it was agreed that the number of performance measures should be reduced for FY17.
A significant part of the bonus will remain subject to non-financial measures reflecting the strong customer focus in the business.
The bonus measures will be as follows: Financial objectives 30% of bonus Non-financial objectives 50% of bonus Personal objectives 20% of bonus Profit before tax 25% Core renewable Up to five stretching customers 25% personal objectives Net debt 5% A reduction in customer dissatisfaction 25% The financial and non-financial objectives for Richard Harpin and Johnathan Ford will be based on Group performance.
The financial objectives for Martin Bennett will be based on Group and UK performance and the non-financial objectives will be based on UK performance.
The Committee considers the forward looking performance targets to be commercially sensitive but more detailed disclosure will be provided in next years remuneration report.
The Committee will have discretion to scale back any bonus payments if it is deemed appropriate.
