Wind speed Generation variation to long term mean variation to budget 2013 adjusted 3% 8% 2014 -2% -3% 2015 5% 8% 2016 -6% -6% Variation to budget lies within reasonable statistical parameters.
The annual standard deviation of wind speed is 6 per cent.
and the annual standard deviation of generation is 10 per cent.
2016 saw below budget power prices in Q1-Q3.
However, power prices in Q4 were above budget and forecast power prices have risen.
Overall, below budget generation and below budget power prices contributed to below budget cash generation and dividend cover of 1.4x.
Overall portfolio availability was above budget.
Notable issues were: failure of a resistor in the substation at Bin Mountain, which resulted in the wind farm being ofine for six weeks while a replacement was ordered and manufactured resistor required to prevent grid instability when energising the wind farm : a turbine being ofine at Lindhurst from April to November, awaiting a replacement blade following a lightning strike: warranty snagging and upgrade works at Little Cheyne Court, including converter and gearbox upgrade works over the summer period: and implementation of a technical solution by Siemens at Maerdy to resolve yaw gear issues, the effectiveness of which is being confirmed over the winter period.
Insurance proceeds or liquidated damages have been or are expected to be received in respect of all of the above issues.
13 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 Investment Managers Report continued Portfolio Performance continued Wind energy true-ups for Cotton Farm, Earls Hall Farm, Kildrummy and Middlemoor were agreed in the year: Cotton Farm and Earls Hall Farm resulted in no net payment: Kildrummy resulted in a payment of 1.2 million from BayWa to the Group: and Middlemoor resulted in a payment of 2.2 million from the Group to Innogy.
Also in the year, 2 million was received by the Group from Velocita in settlement of the Maerdy wind energy true-up agreed in December 2015 and reected in the 2015 financial statements.
The true-up mechanism is designed to mitigate the risk associated with investing in a wind farm before sufficient operational data are available.
Wind energy true-ups in respect of Stroupster and Clyde Extension remain outstanding as disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements.
Health and Safety There were no major incidents in the year to 31 December 2016.
A health and safety audit was conducted across January and February 2016 by an independent consultant.
No material areas of concern were identied.
Acquisitions During the year, the Investment Manager priced 40 wind farms totalling 1,334MW.
Of the 40 wind farms priced: 2 investments were made by the Group Clyde and Screggagh : 10 were acquired by other buyers: 24 are no longer being pursued by the Group: and 4 are subject to continuing discussions.
The Group invested 195.5 million including acquisition costs, excluding acquired cash to acquire a 28.2 per cent.
stake in the 350MW Clyde wind farm on 18 March 2016.
stake, with the Greater Manchester Pension Fund and the London Pensions Fund Authority investing 150 million alongside the Group 21.7 per cent.
The Group has enjoyed a strong relationship with SSE since listing March 2013 and the transaction demonstrates the attractiveness to utilities of the Groups unlevered investment model.
The Group acquired 100 per cent.
of the 20MW Screggagh wind farm on 30 June 2016 for 28.0 million including acquisition costs, excluding acquired cash.
The transaction was executed in three weeks from the granting of exclusivity and reects the Groups ability to select the best investments and efficiently process a wide range of transaction types and sizes.
Financial Performance Dividend cover of 1.4x for the year remained robust despite below budget generation and below budget power prices target dividend cover 1.7x.

GAV is the sum of: DCF valuations of the Groups investments: cash at Group and wind farm SPV level : and other relevant assets and liabilities of the Group.
The DCF valuation of the Groups investments represents the largest component of GAV and the key sensitivities are considered to be the discount rate used in the DCF valuation and long term assumptions in relation to energy yield, power prices and ination.
The unlevered discount rate used in the DCF valuation is between 8 and 9 per cent..
The market discount rate has remained constant since listing.
is considered to be a reasonable range of alternative assumptions for discount rate.
Base case energy yield assumptions are P50 50 per cent.

probability of exceedance over a 10 year period and P10 10 per cent.
probability of exceedance over a 10 year period sensitivities reect the future variability of wind and the uncertainty associated with the long term data source being representative of the long term mean.
Given their basis on long term operating data, it is not anticipated that base case energy yield assumptions will be adjusted other than any wind energy true-ups with compensating purchase price adjustments.
Long term power price forecasts are provided by a leading market consultant, updated quarterly and adjusted by the Investment Manager where more conservative assumptions are considered appropriate.
Base case real power prices increase from approximately 45 MWh 2017 to approximately 65 MWh 2040.
The sensitivity below assumes a 10 per cent.

Clyde 18 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Investment Managers Report continued Outlook The regulatory outlook for operational wind farms in the UK remains stable owing to the UK Governments policy of grandfathering for operational projects.
The Group invests in operational wind farms, backed by known and xed support mechanisms.
There is currently over 10GW of operational onshore wind capacity plus over 5GW offshore.
Installed capacity is set to grow over the next few years to over 12GW onshore plus over 12GW offshore, despite recent policy changes for new projects, as assets in construction come into operation.
In monetary terms, the secondary market for operational UK wind farms is approximately 35 billion, increasing to 60 billion in the medium term.
The Group currently has a market share of approximately 3 per cent..
The Company does not expect any material change to its business as a result of the UK exiting the European Union.
Being solely UK focused and deliberately low-risk, all of the Groups assets and liabilities are inside the UK and sterling denominated.
In addition, the regulatory regime under which the assets operate is robust, longstanding and rooted in UK legislation.
As an owner of operational wind farms, the key risk faced by the Group is power price.
In general, independent forecasters expect UK wholesale power prices to rise in real terms from current levels, driven by higher gas and carbon prices combined with the ongoing phasing out of coal-red power stations.
The long term power price forecast is updated each quarter and reected in the reported NAV.
Long term power price forecasts fell through 2015 and the first half of 2016, reecting falls in global oil and gas prices, and achieved power prices were below budget in Q1-Q3 2016.
However, power prices in Q4 were above budget and forecast power prices have risen reecting post EU referendum sterling devaluation and recovery in global oil and gas prices.
In general, the outlook for the Group is very encouraging, with proven operational and financial performance from the existing portfolio combined with a healthy pipeline of attractive further investment opportunities.
