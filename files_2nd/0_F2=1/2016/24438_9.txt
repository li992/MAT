NON-FINANCIAL KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS We are on a journey to integrate social responsibility SR into our business strategy.
Part of that journey involves repositioning our SR targets as non-financial KPIs.
Our non-financial KPIs have five areas of focus, with a clear commitment against each one.
These commitments are delivered through a series of projects with measurable targets.
The Chief Executive is responsible for delivering the overall programme and Operating Board Directors have been assigned to be a champion for each of the areas as illustrated opposite.
This group meets quarterly to review progress at a steering group convened by the Company Secretary.
