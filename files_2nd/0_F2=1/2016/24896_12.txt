Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Spain Strong profit growth, up 46% to 13.9m FY15: 9.5m Customer numbers up 11% from 1.1m to 1.2m Continued strong partnership with Endesa The Spanish business has delivered good customer and strong profit progression principally reflecting the growth of the Membership business.
Operational performance Endesa, our largest partner in Spain, has continued to offer our products through its sales channels and we are pleased that we have also agreed terms for our FY17 marketing campaigns.
We have an active business development pipeline and are in discussions with other potential partners.
Customer numbers increased 11% to 1.2m at the end of March 2016.
The majority of new customers were acquired through Endesas sales channels where customers are offered an electrical assistance product on an introductory offer, typically at a discount of 50%, with renewals at the full price of 69 in the second year.
Retention in the year was 77%, marginally lower than the prior year FY15: 79%, reflecting the high proportion of customers in the first renewal cycle, where retention rates are lower than more mature customers.
Our claims handling business in Spain continues to perform well.
In line with the prior year the business completed 0.7m jobs FY15: 0.7m.
Our network comprises around 2,000 sub-contractors and 174 Reparalia franchised engineers.
Financial performance Revenue increased by 15% to 132.8m FY15: 115.9m driven by a 37% increase in Membership revenue to 50.4m FY15: 36.9m and a 4% increase in revenue in the Claims business to 82.4m FY15: 79.0m.
The increase in the Membership business reflects a higher number of customers renewing on full price products, while the Claims business benefited from a small increase in job volumes.
Income per customer increased by 7 to 41 FY15: 34, again reflecting the higher mix of renewing customers in part offset by new customers who joined on the introductory offer.
20 | HomeServe plc Strategic report Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Chief Executives review The increase in operating costs principally related to higher customer numbers in the Membership business and slightly higher volumes in the Claims business.
Adjusted operating profit increased 4.4m to 13.9m FY15: 9.5m, reflecting higher revenue in the Membership business, partially offset by the expected increase in amortisation in the period.
Spain reported an adjusted operating margin of 10%, two percentage points higher than the prior year, reflecting the increase in Membership profits.
In accordance with Group policy, where a partner originates customers on our behalf, the cost of acquisition is capitalised, held as an intangible asset and amortised as an operating expense.
During FY16, we paid 20.2m FY15: 20.3m in respect of customers acquired by Endesa and as at 31 March 2016, the intangible asset amounted to 42.1m FY15: 35.9m.
Amortisation in FY16 was 9.9m, 2.4m higher than the prior year FY15: 7.5m.
