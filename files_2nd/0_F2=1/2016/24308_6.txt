Our global approach creates a platform from which we can serve growing markets ALL-WHEEL DRIVE GROWTH CREATES EXPANSION FOR GKN IN CHINA GKN Driveline has expanded production capacity in China to cater for the strong growth in all-wheel drive vehicles from consumers in Asia.
Through its joint venture, Shanghai GKN HUAYA Driveline Systems Co Ltd SDS, GKN has more than doubled its all-wheel drive production capacity in Shanghai to manufacture high quality driveline units for a combination of Chinese domestic and international car manufacturers.
GKN has also invested in recruiting world-class engineering talent for its new engineering centre in China to ensure that programmes are executed to the highest standard at a local level.
com we invest in technologies to ensure we remain a leader in our markets AT THE FOREFRONT OF ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING GKN Powder Metallurgy is exploiting both sides of additive manufacturing AM, the technology set to revolutionise the manufacturing industry.
A joint venture agreement with TLS Technik will manufacture titanium powders for AM applications in North America.
At the same time, GKN is using its capabilities in metal AM and powder-to-part manufacture to develop eDrive technology, and has already created helical gear prototypes for a new eDrive transmission concept for a major German OEM.
The ability to rapidly manufacture prototypes alongside accelerated development cycles and increased freedom of design presents numerous opportunities for this new technology.
