RIGHT SIZERS DOWNSIZING, NOT DOWNGRADING ORIGINALLY LOOKING TO BUY A COTTAGE, DOWNSIZERS ANDREW AND JEAN CHURCHWe wandered around the show TAYLOR WERE WON OVER BY THE EASE AND home and liked everything we SIMPLICITY OF A NEW HOME WITH saw: especially the character.
TRADITIONAL TOUCHES Andrew Church-Taylor Having sold their large house in Whalley, the couple had set out to buy a Lawson Rise, Whalley cottage in the Ribble Valley, but every property they viewed would have needed a lot of work and upkeep.
They had been searching for a smaller home that would still be able to accommodate three grown-up children and their families for Christmas and other events, when a local shop owner suggested they take a look at Redrows Lawson Rise development.
A new home hadnt been on our radar, but we went to take a look and were very impressed.
Keen gardeners Andrew and Jean also relished the opportunity to make the garden their own, and returned the next day to sign up for a Balmoral house, in the same Arts and Crafts style as the show home.
The cul-fide-sac location and stone-fronted design also appealed to the retired solicitor and his wife, a former nurse.
A few minutes walk from the centre of the village where Andrew was born and where the couple had brought up their children, the development is also close to Clitheroe, surrounded by beautiful Lancashire countryside and boasts easy access to Blackburn, Preston and Burnley.
