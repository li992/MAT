Strategic Report Engine Repair & Overhaul 2016 Performance Revenue Engine Repair & 2016 2015 Inc dec $m $m % North America 459.0 520.1 12 % Overhaul 2016 Europe & ROW 82.4 99.1 17 % Total 541.4 619.2 13 % Performance Engine Repair & Overhauls revenue decreased by 13% to $541.4 million 2015: $619.2 million.
Conditions in EROs market remain challenging and, while organic revenue was down 11% for the year as a whole, there was a small improvement in EROs operating performance in the second half of the year, in line with our expectations.
Volumes in legacy mid-cabin and rotorcraft engine overhauls remained depressed throughout the year, with reduced workscopes and competitive market pricing.
Engine trading and demand for lease engines was significantly reduced, and this together with strong competitive pressures and OEM actions put further pressure on margins.
The footprint restructuring programme and cost saving activities taken in the first half delivered the planned lower cost base which contributed to improved second half results.
Whilst the small thrust engine repair and overhaul market remains competitive and volatile month-to-month, our ERO businesses did see improvements in market share over the second half of the year in the PT6 and Tay markets.
EROs footprint rationalisation programme, which began in 2014, remains on track, and is now close to completion.
The new overhaul facility at Dallas Fort Worth Airport DFW has commenced production with the successful transfer of overhaul operations from the Neosho and Forest Park facilities in the second half of the year.
The sale of the Forest Park site is planned for this year.
The new test cell facility at DFW has now started production on several engine models.
We anticipate the test facility reaching full production levels in the first half of 2017.
As the new DFW facilities become fully operational in 2017, we expect the continued operational improvements and further footprint consolidation in the Dallas metroplex will help to improve flexibility, customer service and financial performance and provide a more stable base from which to execute a long-term strategy for value creation from our ERO businesses.
