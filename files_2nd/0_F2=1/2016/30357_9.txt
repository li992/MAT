The scalability of the mortgage and card platforms continued to enhance Group operational leverage, with only a 1.1 per cent increase in underlying costs compared to income growth of 12.1 per cent generating the 6.3 percentage point improvement in cost:income ratio to 57.2 per cent.
This increase in cost efficiency, achieved across both operational areas and central functions, was achieved while continuing to invest in the business with investment spend maintained in line with income.
Growth did not come at the expense of quality.
Cost of risk increased by only 1 basis point to 13 basis points, entirely as a consequence of higher card receivables.

Aspects of the results are adjusted for certain items, which are listed below, to reflect how the Executive assesses the Groups underlying performance without distortions caused by items that are not reflective of the Groups ongoing business activities.
Charges for such items were lower by 55.2 per cent in 2016, as the reduction in share based payments related to the IPO more than offset an increase in the cost of simplification and investment in strategic items.
The following items have been excluded from underlying profits: IPO share based payments These costs relate to share based payment charges triggered by our successful IPO in 2014, which we are recognising over their vesting period.
By their nature, these payments are not reflective of ongoing trading performance and are not, therefore, considered part of the underlying results.
Strategic items We incurred strategic investment costs of 6.7 million in 2016, largely related to digital investment spend.
These costs have been partly offset by fair value adjustments of 4.3 million arising from the Northern Rock acquisition which will not occur in future periods.
Investments in building our digital capability are strategic investment items that are not considered part of the underlying results.
Simplification costs Now that our organisational structure is well established we have taken the opportunity to focus on simplification activity, including fide-layering our organisation structure, the benefit of which is seen in our stable underlying cost base.
This has led to one-off costs incurred in 2016 including those in relation to a number of senior leavers.
These costs include accelerated share based payment charges.
These are not considered part of the underlying results.

Where these derivatives are held to maturity, fair value movements recorded in this heading represent timing differences that will reverse over their lives, but can result in volatility within and between specific reporting periods.
Therefore, excluding these from underlying profit better represents the underlying performance of the Group.
Before 2016 fair value gains and losses on financial instruments were included within the underlying performance.
These are now excluded from underlying results to remove this volatile item from the underlying business result.
Prior periods presented have been adjusted to ensure consistency, however the change has no material impact on those periods.
Our effective tax rate in 2016 was 27.9%.
The overall tax rate for UK banks increased by 8 percentage points in 2016 as a result of the bank tax surcharge, adding 12.5 million to the Groups tax charge.
In 2016, the Group recognised a corporation tax charge of 54.3 million.
The reconciliations of the Groups statutory and underlying results are reported above and in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures APMs, in addition to underlying profit, in the analysis and discussion of its financial performance and financial position.
APMs do not have standardised definitions and may not be directly comparable to measures defined within IFRS.

58 Virgin Money Group Annual Report 2016 I Financial results Summary of Group results Income benefited from growth in asset balances 2016 2015 m m Change Net interest income 519.0 456.1 13.8% Other income 67.9 67.4 0.7% Total income 586.9 523.5 12.1% Net interest margin 1.60% 1.65% 5 bps Average interest earning assets 32,521 27,577 17.9% During 2016 we increased net interest income by 13.8 per cent to 519.0 million.
This was driven by strong balance growth across the mortgage and card books, reflecting the strength and potential of our lending franchise.
The continued strong growth in mortgage lending was a key driver of income growth in the year.
Growth in the credit card portfolio and further optimisation of our funding base continued to support net interest margin NIM.
Ongoing active management of retail funding costs in the context of lower pricing in the market, and initial drawings from TFS, contributed to a reduction in the weighted average cost of funds from 143 basis points in 2015 to 130 basis points in 2016.
This benefit was however tempered by the continued strength of growth in our mortgage portfolio, where new business was priced below back book spread, as well as by the one-off impact of the 25 basis point reduction in Bank base rate in August 2016, arising from the delay in repricing deposits compared to repricing assets.
Taken together, these factors moderated NIM to 160 basis points in 2016.
Other income increased by 0.7 per cent to 67.9 million reflecting an increase from our investment funds business.
Costs remained tightly controlled 2016 2015 m m Change Costs 336.0 332.5 1.1% Cost:income ratio 57.2% 63.5% 6.3 pp Our operational leverage is derived from our scalable operating model, which combined with disciplined management of costs, continued to deliver enhancements to our operating profitability.
Set against lending and income growth of 19.4 per cent and 12.1 per cent respectively, cost growth including the FSCS levy in 2016 was constrained to just 1.1 per cent.
This produced positive JAWS of 11.0 per cent and reduced the cost:income ratio by 6.3 percentage points to 57.2 per cent.
Improvements were made across the business with the ongoing programme of operational efficiency initiatives and the ability to leverage our central functions being key drivers.
As a consequence, the cost per customer in each product category reduced in the year.
Excluding the cost of the FSCS levy, operating costs increased by 2.6 per cent year on year.
Our strong cost performance did not come at the expense of investment into the business.
In 2016 the level of investment spend was grown in line with income.

The cost of risk for mortgages was flat between 2015 and 2016 at 0.01 per cent and the underlying impairment charge fell in absolute terms.
This stability reflected the continued high asset quality of the mortgage portfolio and our strategic approach to risk management, combined with the benign economic environment, leading to a further reduction in the low level of defaults.
Impaired loans as a percentage of mortgage loans and advances were unchanged from 2015 at 0.3 per cent.
Against that stable level of impairments, the coverage ratio of provisions to impaired mortgage loans increased to 11.4 per cent in 2016 from 10.3per cent in the prior year.
60 Virgin Money Group Annual Report 2016 I Financial results Summary of Group results In credit cards, set against growth of 55.0 per cent in balances, the impairment charge for the portfolio increased by only 27.5 per cent to 34.8 million.
The resulting cost of risk for credit cards decreased by 30 basis points to 1.70 per cent in 2016, from 2.00 per cent in 2015.
This underlines the continued high credit quality of new and existing cards and the low rate of default during the early stages of card lives.
Performance of individual cohorts of cards remains strong with all cohorts showing a cost of risk in line with or better than expectations.
In the credit card book, impaired loans as a percentage of loans and advances decreased to 1.3 per cent in 2016 from 1.7 per cent in 2015.
Similarly to the mortgage book, the coverage ratio of provisions to impaired credit card balances increased to reach 121.6 per cent in 2016 from 113.5 per cent in 2015.
Impaired loans as a percentage of loans and advances for the Group was unchanged from 2015 at 0.4 per cent at 31 December 2016.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increased to 40.0 per cent at 31 December 2016, from 35.6 per cent at 31 December 2015.
This rise reflects the increased proportion of card receivables, where provisions as a percentage of impaired loans are higher than for secured mortgage lending.

The strength of income growth and improved operational leverage, combined with our rigorous approach to underwriting and asset quality, has driven material enhancement to returns achieved in 2016.
This growth has been achieved despite the introduction of the bank tax surcharge for the first time in 2016.
Return on tangible equity increased to 12.4 per cent in 2016, higher than both our cost of capital and the 10.9 per cent generated in 2015.
At the same time, the statutory return on assets grew by 3 basis points to 0.40 per cent in 2016, from 0.37per cent in 2015.

The leverage ratio was 4.4 per cent at the end of 2016, compared with 4.0 per cent at the end of 2015.
Growth in the asset base was more than offset by the impact of the issuance of the new AT1 capital and the strength of retained earnings growth.
The AT1 issuance provides us with significant capacity for future high credit quality mortgage growth that is, relative to other lending types, leverage intensive.
Dividend The strength of both our profitability and our capital base continues to give the Board confidence to recommend the payment of a dividend.
In addition to the interim dividend for 2016 of 1.6 pence per ordinary share, paid to shareholders on 23 September 2016, the Board has recommended a final dividend of 3.5 pence per ordinary share in respect of 2016 which will be paid, subject to approval at our AGM, in May 2017.
Our intention is to pay an interim and final dividend for 2017, subject to performance.
Conclusion 2016 represents a further year of significant financial progress for Virgin Money.
The strong high quality lending growth combined with further operational leverage has driven improved returns for our shareholders.
This has been achieved with no degradation of asset quality, further diversification of the funding base and with continued focus on the strength of the capital base and capital ratios.
As a consequence, we are well placed to continue growing our business, generating further operational leverage and continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders.
