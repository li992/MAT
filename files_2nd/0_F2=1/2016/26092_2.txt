Long-term growth strategy Delivering against our promises KAZ Minerals has a strong track record of delivering against its targets.
The current growth strategy for the Group began in 2011 when the Board approved the development of Bozshakol, followed by Aktogay in 2012.
The Group disposed of non-core assets in 2013, realising $2.2 billion of cash proceeds, and carried out a major corporate restructuring in 2014.
Following the restructuring KAZ Minerals retained higher margin operating assets in the East Region and two greenfield projects in development, Bozshakol and Aktogay.
By the end of 2016 the construction of the two major growth projects was completed.
The Group has built a strong track record of operational performance over this period of change, consistently meeting its copper production guidance.
