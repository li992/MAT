Reducing leverage Largely as a result of the Groups profit out-turn, year-end leverage net debt to EBITDA increased to 2.1x 31 December 2015: 1.8x with net debt as at 31 December 2016 of 259.9m 31 December 2015: 235.9m.
In response, management has made leverage reduction a key short-term priority, particularly given that leverage is likely to increase to June 2017 due to the seasonality of the Group, and has identified a number of actions to strengthen its balance sheet.
These include: Targeting significant asset disposals, and in this context SIG has disposed of Carpet & Flooring and has agreed to sell, subject to contract, Drywall Qatar: More tightly focusing on cash generation and working capital management: Moderating capital expenditure: Suspending its infill acquisition programme: and Rebasing the dividend.
While SIGs medium-term target remains to return leverage to a 1.0 - 1.5x range, the Group recognises that this may take until 2018 to achieve.
In taking actions to reduce leverage the Group will therefore ensure that its balance sheet is able to withstand any near-term fluctuations in market demand.
Notwithstanding the current higher leverage, SIG retains significant funding headroom, having successfully refinanced 131m of private placement notes in June 2016, on attractive terms with existing debt providers.
This refinancing was achieved through the issuance of 89m of new private placement notes on a bilateral basis, with a ten year maturity, and by increasing the Groups existing revolving credit facility RCF by 100m to 350m, with a five year term.
As a result, the Group increased its total debt facilities by 75m to 549m as at 31 December 2016 31 December 2015: 474m, and only 162m was drawn from the Groups 350m RCF at the year-end.
Non-underlying items Non-underlying items during the period totalled 183.8m 2015: 37.3m and were: A non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment charge of 100.4m 2015: nil in relation to the Groups French specialist roofing business, Larivire acquired by SIG in May 2007 for 297m, reflecting more cautious market forecasts and broader market uncertainty.
However, Larivire retains a strong market leading position and good long-term prospects.
The remaining carrying value of the goodwill associated with this business is 80.5m: Losses on sale or agreed sale of businesses and associated impairment charges of 40.1m 2015: nil and 2016 operating losses of 5.8m 2015: 1.2m relating to the disposal of Carpet & Flooring and the agreed sale, subject to contract, of Drywall Qatar: Non-cash impairment charges of 10.2m 2015: nil relating to goodwill associated with the Groups Polish business: Net restructuring charges of 13.3m 2015: 8.3m mainly relating to the Groups supply chain programme:
