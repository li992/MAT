SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our Marketplace.
The Superdry brand competes with all clothing and accessory retailers on an indirect basis, however, we occupy a niche position within the branded fashion market defined by our unique product range and the design detail we are famous for.
From this established position, we continue to innovate and extend our product range to adapt to customer needs and market trends.
We believe there are very few brands with our global reach and diverse customer base.
We sell our product consumers through stores and e-commerce channels, competing with traditional retailers and brands, pure e-commerce and multi-channel businesses.
The impact of online retailing is becoming more evident as customers shopping habits change with online channels increasingly used to research and purchase products.
We are embracing this and continually enhance our customers experience on-line to provide a sector leading multi-channel proposition.
For more information on our e-commerce strategy, please refer to page 23.
Superdry started its international expansion early on in its development and is now sold in 51 countries with 55% of total sales volume generated outside of the UK based on retail selling price.
Our short to medium-term focus is to grow the retail proposition in Western Europe where we are growing rapidly, particularly in Germany.
In financial year 2016 FY16 88% of our new space was in markets outside the UK and this is a trend that will continue.
