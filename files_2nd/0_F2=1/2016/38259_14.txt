Financial Statements GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY GOING CONCERN The Group has two diverse operating divisions, both of which operate in a growing market.
Management have undertaken an assessment of the future prospects of the Group and the wider risks that the Group is exposed to.
In this assessment of whether the Group should adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements, management have considered: Operating risk: The management team prepare a Group budget for each financial year and a cashflow forecast for the following 18 months which allows the Board to monitor the financial position of the Group and to consider appropriate risks which the business may face from a financial perspective.
Included in this review are future cashflow, both acquisition costs and subsequent cashflow generation, associated with acquisitions agreed but not completed at the end of the 2016 financial year.
The Board receives monthly management reports covering key operational matters, monthly comparison to budget and updated forecasts on a half yearly basis for the full financial year to ensure that the business is trading in line with its expectations.
Financing risk: The Company has worked to structure its financing facilities for the medium and long term as well as utilising short term facilities to meet the Groups working capital requirements.
The syndicated loan facility of US$825m entered into in 2015, comprising US$350m of term debt and US$475m of delayed drawdown acquisition facilities, had been drawn down to the extent of US$350m and US$464m respectively as at 31 December 2016.
As part of the Al Zahra acquisition approved by shareholders on 29 December 2016, the Company finalised a new loan facility, amending and restating the existing syndicated facility, with JP Morgan Chase Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, of a total of US$1.4bn, with US$825m of this replacing the existing syndicated loan facility and the remainder available for the Al Zahra acquisition.
The Group has banking arrangements through a spread of local and international banking groups.
Debt covenants are reviewed by the board each month.
The Board believes that the level of cash in the Group and the spread of bankers providing these facilities mitigates the financing risks that the Group faces from both its acquisitive growth strategy and in relation to working capital requirements.
Customer and Supplier risk: Both the Healthcare and the Distribution divisions, and hence the Group as a whole, have delivered a robust performance in 2016.
All major financial and non-financial KPIs showed good improvement during the year.
In the Healthcare division, trade receivables are monitored regularly, provisions made where necessary and the Group has no history of significant bad debts.
In the Distribution division, the increase in revenue and product flow has again, as in prior years, had an adverse effect on the Groups working capital position, however the smaller percentage contribution of the division this year as part of the overall Group, lessens the effect of this on overall Group working capital.
In any event, trade receivables are monitored regularly and management maintain a close working relationship with all major suppliers to monitor performance as well as signs of financial risk.
The Board has reviewed a high level budget for 2017 as well as considered growth forecasts for the healthcare sector in UAE, in particular the continued positive impact from the introduction of mandatory healthcare insurance in Dubai, and from the Groups newly opened and newly acquired businesses, and considers the Groups future forecasts to be reasonable.
Impairment risk: The Board has considered the carrying value and useful economic lives of inventories, accounts receivable, property and equipment and intangible assets and concluded that there are no indicators of material impairment of these items and therefore no material cash flow impact associated with any loss in those areas.
In its review, management also considered other areas of potential risk, including regulatory risk, insurance and legal risks and potential areas of material contingent liability and found no matters which are likely to affect the viability of the Group in the medium term.
The Board has reviewed and considered managements formal assessment of the going concern concept of accounting and the cash flow forecast that has been prepared for the period to 30 June 2018 and has concluded that this assessment and forecast indicates that the Group has positive cash flows with sufficient headroom and will comply with all debt covenants.
The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
VIABILITY In order to protect longer term shareholder value, the Board have always considered how Group performance and its strategic decisions will affect the financial and operational prospects of the Group in the longer term.
This year, as recommended by provision C. 2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have considered a formal assessment of the prospects of the Group over a longer period than the 12 months review period required under the Going Concern basis of accounting.
Management conducted a formal viability review looking forward for a period of three years.
This period was selected as the most appropriate timeframe over which the future prospects of the Group should be considered given the Groups changing nature and significant growth, the time taken to fully integrate acquired businesses and ramp-up newly opened facilities and the maturity date of current debt obligations.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 83 Financial Statements Directors Statements continued In its review, management considered the current position of the Group and the following principal financial risks associated with the business: Risks associated with investments.
The impact of market competition.
Potential instability associated with the macroeconomic environment in which the Company operates.
The three year review considered the Groups profitability, cash flows, banking covenants and other key financial ratios over the period.
The plan makes certain assumptions about the ability to refinance debt as it falls due and the acceptable performance of the core revenue streams and market segments.
The plan is stress tested using sensitivity analysis which reflects severe but plausible combinations of the principal financial risks of the business and then the potential impact of each scenario, using certain assumption on the following levers which were stress tested: reductions in revenue per patient: reduction in market share impacting the number of patients and occupancies: increase manpower cost due to shortage of talent: cost escalation due to inflation and new tax regime: impact on revenue due to currency fluctuation on overseas acquisition: increase in accounts receivable debtor days due to increase in insurance business: a larger increase in accounts receivable debtor days than expected: and increase in interest rate.
Where appropriate, an analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of any of these principal risks actually occurring.
Based on the results of this formal assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of the assessment.
