Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017 The CEOs and CFOs salary will remain at the same level as for 2016 at 524,500 and 355,500 respectively.
The annual bonus for 2017 will again be based on 60% Group trading profit performance, 25% on personal and customer performance measures and 15% on strategic measures.
The maximum opportunity remains unchanged at 125% of salary for both the CEO and CFO.
The CEO and CFO will receive grants of 250% and 210% of salary respectively under the SLP in 2017.
Shareholders will note the reduction on last years SLP grants as the Committee determined that reduced grant sizes for Executive Directors were appropriate for 2017 given the reduced size of the Group following the demerger and the current business direction.
The SLP awards will continue to be based on absolute total shareholder return for threequarters of the award and the remaining portion on relative TSR, the targets for which are set out on page 49.
Other key activities undertaken by the Committee in the year The Committee met seven times in the year.
Other than the activities associated with the Demerger, other activities carried out in the year included: approval of the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report: finalisation of the Remuneration Policy: reviewing performance outcomes for awards vesting in 2016 under the annual and long-term plans: setting targets for awards made in the year: reviewing an independent report on remuneration risk from the Chief Risk Officer and reviewing the executive remuneration arrangements in the context of regulatory developments, particularly the provisions of Solvency II.
As part of the remuneration review in the context of the Demerger, the Committee reviewed proposals by management for the treatment of the all-employee share plans, including a compensation payment in respect of the reduced value of the 2014 Sharesave award.
This and further activities in relation to remuneration arrangements for the broader workforce are described on page 62.
I trust this report gives a helpful summary of our Remuneration Policy and its application and that we can look forward to your support for our proposals at the AGM on 17 May 2017.
