Somerset Forestry has posted strong profits over the past few years and Darren was looking to move from his flat into a three-bedroom terraced home with his wife and two children.
The mortgage on his flat was with a major high street lender, and as a long-time customer, he went to them first.
However, during the application process Darren found that the high street bank didnt fully understand his accounts or his business.
Focusing on growing his business, Darren had been paying himself only what he needed to get by and investing the rest in new machinery and equipment, some of which he had financed with Aldermore.
He approached us about taking out a mortgage for his new home and our specialist underwriters were able to review his accounts and approve his application.
With the high street banks, all they look at is what you earn and what you pay in tax.
Aldermore was different, the team understands how a self-employed business works Everything went very smoothly.
