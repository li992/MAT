Figures published by the Energy Ombudsman in February 2016 showed that only four out of 100,000 customer complaints were accepted for further investigation in the first three quarters of the year, meaning 99.969% of customer issues were resolved by SSE, in house, ensuring that customer complaints are resolved efficiently and satisfactorily.
Maintaining a flexible range of electricity generation assets The focus on efficient operations in the Wholesale business meant that after 50 proud years of service the Ferrybridge coal-fired power station ceased operations due to its worsening economic outlook.
Elsewhere, in November 2015 the 735MW Keadby gas-fired power station came out of deep mothball to return to service and make a contribution to the maintenance of the UK electricity system.
SSE continues to move from a coal and gas weighted portfolio towards one comprised largely of gas and renewables.
Reducing the number and duration of power cuts The focus of the RIIO ED1 price control has been delivering efficient operations and the best possible experience for electricity distribution customers.
Over the year the Distribution networks withstood severe flooding and 12 Atlantic storms.
Restoring power safely and efficiently is the priority and continued investment in automation, network reinforcement and tree cutting saw reductions in both Customer Interruptions and Customer Minutes Lost in 2015 16 compared with the previous year and to record low levels.
Adding to the value of Disciplined investment electricity networks The replacement Beauly-Denny electricity transmission line was energised in November 2015 providing the potential for new lowcarbon generation to connect to the grid, as well as network resilience and secure supplies to consumers.
There will be further investment in Transmission and the Caithness-Moray transmission reinforcement will be SHE Transmissions flagship project and its largest single capital investment to date.
It is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2018.
