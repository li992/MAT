With liquidity balances of 201 million, this represents gearing of 14.7% calculated in accordance with AIC guidance.
The long-term notes are fair valued using market-derived gilt yields and corporate credit spreads, with the result that over 2016 we experienced a mark-to-market accounting loss as rates moved lower than the fixed interest.
At the year end, the fair value was 156 million compared to the par value of 151 million.
