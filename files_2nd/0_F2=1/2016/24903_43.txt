Committee chairmanship fees apply only to the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The Chairman does not receive a NED basic fee or an additional fee for chairing the Nominations Committee.
Fees may be reviewed every year, and are set within a range of defines by a market benchmark of comparable size companies.
Benchmarking is typically undertaken every three years.
