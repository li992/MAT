com stock code: NTG The depreciation rate challenge Over recent reporting periods Northgate has made revisions to depreciation rates applied to vehicles for hire in order to comply with IFRS requirements.
This has distorted the year-on-year comparison of the income statement and therefore made the underlying results less transparent.
This section aims to explain the reasons However, the matching of future market Example 1: Vehicle 1 why Northgate is required to continually values to net book value on the disposal disposal scenario assess and make adjustments to date requires significant judgement for depreciation rates, and also demonstrate the following key reasons: the impact that this has had on our 1.
