VIABILITY STATEMENT In this years Annual Report, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Board to express its view of the longer term viability of the Company and to explain how they have assessed the Companys prospects, taking into account the Companys current position and principal risks, over an appropriate period determined by the Board.
In line with FRCs Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, the Board has carried out a robust assessment of those risks that would threaten the Groups business model, future performance, solvency, liquidity and its resilience to the threats to its viability posed by material risks, and determined to review these over a three year period.
The Company chose a three year period as this best reflects the budgeting and planning process and the expected timescales for strategy implementation.
Key areas considered included: macro ecocnomic factors, including prevailing marketing conditions in key geographic areas and key currency requirements: internal factors including planned store openings, sales modelling profiles and expected capital expenditure requirements, brand profiles and supplier relationships: and the impact of the EU referendum and related uncertainty.
Based on the Boards assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue operating and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period assessed, assuming no major changes in its relationship with key suppliers.
The key risks and uncertainties can be found on pages 36 to 40 together with the steps the Company has taken to mitigate them.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 7 July 2016, and signed on its behalf by: Dave Forsey Chief Executive 41
