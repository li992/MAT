74 IMI plc Financial statements Finance Directors Introduction Introduction from Daniel Shook Dear Shareholder Welcome to the financial statements section of our Annual Report.
My financial review commentary is set out in this section alongside the primary statements.
These financial statements are presented with the primary statements first, followed by five sections: Basis of preparation, Results for the year, Operating assets and liabilities, Capital structure and financing costs and Other notes.
IMI continues to enhance its overall control environment and financial risk management.
Operational improvements in the year have delivered further working capital reductions and the Groups pension position remains strong despite adverse discount rate and inflation movements during the year.
Although market conditions remain challenging, IMI is strengthening its business foundations to enable us to benefit long-term.
The notes that follow will also provide explanations and additional disclosure to assist readers understanding and interpretation of the Annual Report and the financial statements.
