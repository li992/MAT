PageGroup Annual Report 2016 16 PEOPLE STRATEGIC Key Performance Indicators How measured: Direct and Indirect GHG emissions calculated in line with the UK Total GHG emissions Governments 2016 DEFRA reporting standards.
Principally based on data from a sample of our offices, covering 65% of the Group by headcount, and extrapolated for the Group Total energy-derived emissions as a whole.
CO e tonnes 2 Source of emissions 2015 2016 Why its important: The emissions calculations look at the CO e impact of our operations in 2 Direct GHG emissions 1,705 1,662 absolute terms.
Indirect GHG emissions 4,981 4,703 How we performed in 2016: Direct GHG emissions relating to the combustion of fuel decreased by 2.5% to 1,662 tonnes CO e, while Indirect GHG emissions, through the purchase 2 of energy such as electricity, decreased by 5.6% to 4,703 tonnes.
How measured: Intensity values for GHG emissions are based on property and vehicle energyIntensity values of derived emissions per 1,000 headcount.
Headcount is viewed as being the most representative GHG emissions metric for PageGroups activity levels and is unaffected by issues such as business mix or foreign exchange variations.
CO e tonnes per 1,000 employees 2 2015 2016 Why its important: Intensity values help to normalise the GHG metrics and place them in Energy-derived emissions 1,209 1,052 the context of the Groups changing business profile, particularly in terms of increases in headcount.
It helps to identify where progress has been made on emission reduction.
How we performed in 2016: Energy-derived emissions were reduced by 13.0% compared with 2015, largely due to relocations to more energy efficient offices, changes in fuel sources, and an increase in headcount without a corresponding increase in the number of offices.
2015 Direct and Indirect GHG emissions were originally reported as 1,527 and 4,935 respectively.
These have been restated to reflect the change in the use of IEA conversion factors for non-UK countries in 2016.
The 2015 Intensity value of energy-derived emissions has been restated from 1,118 to 1,209 on the same basis.
The source of data and calculation methods year-on-year are on a consistent basis.
The movements in KPIs are in line with expectations.
Emissions have been calculated in line Greenhouse Gas Emissions GHG with the 2016 DEFRA reporting standards, In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors and calculated using 2016 DEFRA Report Regulations, PageGroup reports on all direct greenhouse gas GHG emissions conversion factors for fuels, gases and UK relating to the combustion of fuel and the operation of any facility, together with any fugitive electricity, and International Energy Agency emissions : and indirect GHG emissions through the purchase of electricity, heat, steam conversion factors for non-UK electricity or cooling.
Since 2014, we have gathered energy data from our major offices.
This is in conjunction with The intensity values are based on our environmental policy that focuses on implementing efficiency measures in our offices to emissions derived from property energy reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.
As a result, we enhanced the quality of and vehicle fuel per 1,000 headcount.
our 2013 and 2014 data collation, and the data collation process has continued since 2015.
This factor was chosen as being most representative of the Groups activity The Groups total 2016 emissions from energy and fuel used in its properties and vehicles, levels, and being unaffected by issues together with comparable data for the previous three years, are reported below.
such as business mix or foreign exchange Total energy derived emissions tonnes CO e properties and vehicles variations.
2016 emissions improved by 2 18.8% compared with 2015.

These offices represent 65% of the global headcount in 2016.
The emissions derived emissions emissions deriving from for the remaining offices were calculated by extrapolating headcount.
Emissions from fuel property energy consumption amounted consumed by Group owned or leased vehicles were calculated using the fuel consumed to nearly 80% of total emissions.
This by the German based car fleet.
This represents around 15% of the Groups global car fleet is due to factors such as relocation to of just under 1,100 vehicles.
The emissions for vehicles in other countries were calculated more energy efficient offices, as was the by first extrapolating the Germanys fuel consumption per vehicle and then calculating the case with our relocation in New York City, resulting emissions.
There were no fugitive emissions related to refrigerants topped up as change of fuel sources, as was the case part of air conditioning maintenance.
