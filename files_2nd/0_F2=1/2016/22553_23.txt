This payment is subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the Board, is of the opinion that Mr Klotzs contribution and time commitment has gone far beyond that expected at the time of his appointment to Executive Chairman and his agreed fee level.
The one-off award level has been set such that it represents Mr Klotzs average historical award level under the PIP Element A which over its five year life has paid out on average 82.5% of maximum.
Hence, the award is commensurate with the bonus payments he has earned in recent years.
Included in the Taxable Benefits column is a long service gift to the value of 9,249.
2 Mr Widlund received total pension contributions of 32,550 2015: 31,000 of which 4,069 was paid into his SIPP and, in accordance with the Policy, 28,481 was paid as salary 3 Companies associated with Mr Mortstedt provided consultancy services which related to specific advice which was outside the terms of Mr Mortstedts contract of employment.
The Committee has reviewed the fees for these services, and is of the opinion that the market rate for the services would have far exceeded the amount paid 4 The Bonus total comprises 50% of the Element A 2016 contribution into the Director's Plan Account and the award made of deferred shares in respect of Element B subject to shareholder approval of the PIP see below for details of calculations.
The deferred shares do not vest until three years after the date of grant.
In accordance with the Regulations, as the Element B award has not been granted at the date of this Report, the value of the Element B award disclosed in the table has been calculated using the average market value of a share for the 30 day period to 31 December 2016 of 1,559.9 pence 5 The LTIP is the difference between the values calculated in 4 above in respect of for PIP Element A and the 2016 payment see page 63 for details of calculation and is the payment of part of the deferred performance-based element under the PIP.
The date of payment will be 24 March 2017.
The value of the notional shares under Element A has been based on the average market value of a share for the 30 day period to 31 December 2016 of 1,559.9 pence in accordance with the Regulations ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE TABLE AUDITED INFORMATION 2016 PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE PIP The Remuneration Committee determined the 2016 PIP contribution and forfeiture outcomes during 2016.

For 2016, the CEO and CFO received ratings of 4.38 and 3.82, respectively.
The CEO and CFO are assessed on an annual basis and in the same way as all employees.

61 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2016 The following table sets out the maximum bonus which can be earned in respect of each KPI, expressed as a percentage of salary: Performance Breakdown % CEO CFO Max Bonus Max Bonus KPI Target Target Total Shareholder Return 30 20.0 Effective management of the balance sheet ROE 10 10.0 Vacancy rate 25 5.0 Administration cost ratio as % of Net Rental 25 25.0 Personal Performance 15 10.0 EPRA NAV Growth 10 7.5 NAV Growth 10 7.5 Core Profit over Budget 25 15.0 Available Bonus Target as a % of salary 150 100.0 The following table sets out the calculation of the second payment under Cycle 2 of the PIP which is disclosed in the Bonus column of the Single Total Figure of Remuneration as the performance conditions are satisfied in respect of 2016: Performance Breakdown CEO CFO KPI Total Shareholder Return growth Effective management of balance sheet ROE 29,529 23,950 Vacancy rate 81,375 13,200 Administration cost ratio as % of Net Rental 70,938 57,535 Personal Performance Rating 42,770 20,169 EPRA NAV growth 32,550 19,800 NAV growth 32,550 19,800 Core Profit over Budget 81,375 39,600 2016 Total Bonus 371,087 194,054 Bonus as a % of Salary 114.0% 73.5% Bonus Achieved as a % of Total Available Bonus 76.0% 73.5% As set out in the table above, TSR performance fell short of the forfeiture threshold.
In line with not achieving this KPI no contribution was made to the Executive Directors PIP accounts for 2016 in respect of this element.
This performance level was also below the minimum threshold performance level in respect of the forfeiture provision on deferred PIP amounts.
However, the Committee has determined that it will exercise its discretion not to apply the forfeiture to the deferred PIP balance after undertaking a holistic assessment of the Companys underlying financial and strategic performance for 2016.
Since the introduction of the PIP, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index grew by 92%, whilst the Companys TSR had been 159%, of which, through awards being capped annually, Directors had been paid for an increase of only 81%.

Mr Bengt Mortstedt was appointed a director on 7 March 2017 and holds 2,807,255 shares.

It is expected that within five years of becoming an Executive Director, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should build a holding with a value of at least 100% of salary, and the Chief Financial Officer at least 75%.
This further aligns the interests of Directors to those of shareholders and the requirement is to be increased substantially in the revised Policy.
At the year end, the Executive Directors beneficial shareholdings, represented the following percentages of salary: Henry Klotz: 428% 2015: 306% shareholding requirement met Fredrik Widlund: 107% 2015: 120% shareholding requirement met John Whiteley: 81% 2015: 84% shareholding requirement met The Executive Director, Sten Mortstedt, has an interest in shares which is substantially in excess of the minimum requirement.
