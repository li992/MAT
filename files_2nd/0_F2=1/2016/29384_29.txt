Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.

As permitted by Section 408 2, information about the Companys employee numbers and costs is not presented.
This is the Companys first year reporting under FRS 101.

196 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance Accounts Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The preparation of the accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key estimates and assumptions used in these parent company financial statements are set out below.
Taxation The Company has not recognised deferred tax assets of nil 2015: 27m relating to losses and 19m 2015: 3m relating to other temporary differences.
The Company derecognised UK tax assets relating to revenue losses brought forward and other temporary differences due to the impact of the pension contributions on the outlook for the UK tax base.
The treatment of these assets is reviewed regularly and is dependent on the ability to recover them against forecast UK taxable profits of the tax group.
Further detail on the Companys deferred taxation position is included in note 13.
Retirement benefits The financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Company uses previous experience and independent actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates.
The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates, are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated accounts.
At 31 July 2016 there is a retirement benefit asset of 327m 2015: 169m which arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme.
If the pension schemes were wound up while they still had members, the schemes would need to buy out the benefits of all members.
The buyouts would cost significantly more than the present value of the scheme liabilities calculated inaccordance with IAS 19: Employee benefits.
Investment carrying value Investments in subsidiary undertakings and loans due from subsidiaries are reviewed regularly, and tested if there are any indications of impairment, or problems with recoverability.
The recoverable amounts of investments are determined based on valuations of the underlying trading operations.
The recoverability of loans is assessed by looking at the credit quality of the subsidiary and any support available to the subsidiary.
These calculations require the use of estimates including projected future cash-flows and other future events.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the retranslation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the term of the lease.
Where a leasehold property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, provision ismade for the anticipated future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the relevant assets by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.
Ingeneral, the rates used are: Freehold and long leasehold property 2%: Short leasehold property over the period of the lease: Plant, machinery, etc.
10% to 20%: Fixtures, fittings, tools and other equipment 10% to 33%.
Investments in shares in Group companies The Companys investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises.
Financial instruments The policies disclosed in the Group accounting policies on pages 139 to 143 for recognition, measurement and presentation of financial instruments are applied in the Company accounts.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 197 Company accounting policies Continued Taxation Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method.
A deferred tax asset is recognised where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilise the available relief.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions Provisions for disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, vacant leasehold property and legal claims are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
Post-retirement benefits The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
For defined benefit plans the liability for each scheme recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation atthe balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, andthat have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full when they occur and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Contributions are expensed as incurred.
The Company also has post-retirement healthcare schemes that are accounted for on a similar basis to the defined benefit plans.
Share-based payment The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised over the vesting period to reflect the value of the employee services received.
The charge relating to grants to employees of the Company is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account and the charge for grants to employees of other group companies is recognised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary.
The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using established option pricing models, principally binomial models.
The probability of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which include profitability targets, is used toestimate the number of share options that are likely to vest.
For cash-settled share-based payment schemes, a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance sheet date.
For equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised.
The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
