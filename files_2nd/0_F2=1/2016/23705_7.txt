We measure energy use through carbon dioxide emissions, which we are committed to steadily reducing.
This year we reduced our total carbon footprint by 6% to 54,503 tonnes of CO e, exceeding our short-term 2016 reduction target of 5%.
2 The reduction was predominantly due to more efficient equipment at a data centre and office consolidation.
By 2018, we are aiming to reduce our CO e emissions per US$1,000 of revenue by 5%.
