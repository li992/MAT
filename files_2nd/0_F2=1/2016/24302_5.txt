10 Our Market Long-Term Demand Drivers for Animal Genetic Improvement 2.
Supply Constraints and Uncertainty Volatile weather and increasing competition for scarce resources, There are sustainable long-term such as water and land, can constrain animal protein production.
These factors can also affect the availability of raw materials, drivers of global demand for particularly animal feed, which indirectly impacts protein production.
This puts pressure on producers to be as efficient animal protein and the way it aspossible.
More Integrated Supply Chains is critical to addressing the Supply chains are vertically integrating, resulting in fewer associated challenges.
This increases transparency of where food comes from, giving consumers more influence over food producers, and driving demand for higher-quality animal protein and more disease-resistant animals, with less use of drugs.
Protein Producers Becoming Larger and Increasing Use of Technology Producers are increasingly looking to technology to become more efficient.
For example, dairy farmers are rapidly adopting embryo technology, so they can select both male and female parents anddeliver a step change in the quality of their milking herds.
Growing Demand for Animal Protein Producers also seek efficiency gains through scale.
In porcine, The global population is expected to grow by over 1 billion large scale integrated production represents the majority between 2015 and 2030, with the proportion of urbanised of capacity in the US and Brazil, and is growing fast in China.
populations increasing from 54% to 60% of the total over Largerproducers typically measure performance in more detail thesame period.
Urbanised populations tend to become and better understand the benefits of superior genetics.
wealthier, leading to greater appetite for animal protein.
