32 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2016 INVESTMENT REVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGERS REVIEW OUTLOOK Left to right Darren Gillen, Scott Beveridge, Joe Bauernfreund, Tom Treanor and Daniel lee In the previous section of this report we have highlighted how our actions and those of the companies in which we invest have unlocked some of the value in the portfolio over the past 12 months.
The emphasis on building up high-conviction positions in companies where we see scope for both NAV growth and discount contraction will continue, as will our hard work and that of the management teams we back in finding ways to realise value.
Despite a satisfactory year for both absolute and relative performance, we are confident that the portfolio contains further potential upside from a series of events.
The outlook for the portfolio is promising.
On a weighted average discount of 32%, the portfolio is cheaper than it was a year ago notwithstanding the fact that there are several situations where we are confident discounts will narrow materially in the near-term.
There are likely to be transactions within the unlisted portfolios of various holding companies as well as an expected IPO and potential trade sale of two significant companies held by our closed-end funds.
We also continue to work with the boards of our holdings to explore various avenues to reduce discounts.
We look forward to your continued support.
Joe Bauernfreund Chief Executive Officer 10 November 2016
