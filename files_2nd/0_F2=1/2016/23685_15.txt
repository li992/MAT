Energy-saving measures The Group worked to increase energy efficiency at its operations in 2016 by generating more electricity in-house and reducing the share of energy resources that it purchased.
Initiatives to optimise the use of light, heat, fuel, compressed gas and separation products generated significant savings.
Steel segment Steelmaking The power plants energy structure was optimised by increasing the usage of associated gases from the blast furnaces and coking facilities.
This reduced natural gas consumption to 16.8 million cubic metres.
Further measures were undertaken to improve the accounting of energy sources natural gas, electricity, and drinking water in EVRAZ NTMK reduction order to better monitor resource usage.
in energy purchases for 2016 Overall, 37.9 million cubic metres of natural gas were used in 2016, which is 6.5 million 66% yoy cubic metres less than in 2015.
Electricity consumption totalled 312.3 million kWh, down by 9.4 million kWh year-on-year.
EVRAZ ZSMK Russia which a 42% reduction came from outsourcing oxygen production, 12% was the result of Evraz Yuzhkoks Ukraine EVRAZ ZSMKs energy efficiency programme increasing on-site electricity generation, and continued in 2016, including measures aimed another 12% was due to lower consumption.
Evraz Yuzhkoks energy efficiency at reducing the amount of electricity used to programme included: shutting down undercompress air at the Prokatnaya compressor A total of 446 million kWh was purchased utilised power stations, replacing inefficient station, shutting off natural gas supplies to from external producers during the reporting equipment, and installing frequency some equipment at oxygen convertor shop 1 period, which is 461 million kWh less than in convertors on pumps in a number of during operational downtime, and using less 2015 as a result of these measures.
Natural gas consumption totalled 1,178 These measures reduced electricity Natural gas consumption totalled 611.4 million million cubic metres in 2016, up by 69 million consumption by roughly 995 thousand kWh cubic metres in the reporting period, a decrease cubic metres year-on-year as a result of in 2016, to a total of 51.6 million kWh, of of 40 million cubic metres year-on-year, due increased gas usage by the blast furnaces, which 11.5 million kWh were purchased and to fuel balance optimisation.
Overall electricity which was required to maintain the optimal 40.1 million kWh were generated on-site.
usage amounted to 4,132 million kWh, which is balance of energy costs.
36 million kWh less than in 2015, thanks to the Total consumption for the year was up by 3 measures mentioned above.
EVRAZ DMZ Ukraine million kWh compared with 2015.
The increase was due to the need to use equipment with EVRAZ NTMK Russia In 2016, EVRAZ DMZ undertook numerous high energy consumption during major repairs initiatives to reduce spending on energy that were conducted in 2016: gas and air EVRAZ NTMK implemented several projects as purchases and maximise its consumption of blowers, as well as gas pipelines.
Without the part of its energy efficiency programme, leading associated gases from blast furnaces and programme, overall consumption would have to a 66% reduction in electricity purchases, of coking facilities.
84 CSR report Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Mining Reduction in energy consumption for 2016 14.2% yoy in Coal segment 34.8% yoy in Steel, North America segment Evrazruda Russia Coal segment Evrazrudas energy efficiency programme The main efforts of the Coal segments ongoing energy efficiency programme in 2016 were for 2016 included reducing electricity aimed at reducing heat energy and electricity consumption: consumption by replacing incandescent switching to less energy-intensive equipment shutting down excess capacity light bulbs with LEDs in the underground using equipment more efficiently tunnels of the Tashtagolskaya and Kazkaya shutting down the enrichment plants drying machines during the summer mines, as well as changing the bearing material in the ball mills at the Abagursky The result was a 49 million kWh overall reduction in energy consumption to 295 million kWh.
Total electricity consumption was 434 million kWh, which was 12 million Steel, North America segment kWh less than in 2015 as a result of the programme.
Evraz North Americas operations continued implementing energy-saving measures in 2016.
Evraz Sukha Balka Ukraine During the rebuild of the slab reheat furnace in Portland, our technical team upgraded the refractory material to a high-tech product that provides significantly higher insulation coefficients Installing energy saving lighting in the than other technologies.
As a result, we expect energy savings of approximately four therms per main haulageways as part of the energy short ton, or ca.
371 TJ in energy savings annually at full utilisation.
efficiency programme reduced electricity consumption by 0.65 million kWh to For 2016, electricity and natural gas consumption declined year-on-year in-line with production 139.76 million kWh.
