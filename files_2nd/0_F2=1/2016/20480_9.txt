Profit commission Admiral is potentially able to earn material amounts of profit commission revenue from coand reinsurance partners, depending on the profitability of the insurance business underwritten by the partner.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement in line with the booked loss ratios on Admirals retained underwriting.
In 2016 Admiral recognised UK car insurance profit commission revenue of 52.7 million down from 85.2 million in 2015.
If reserve releases from business that was originally ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts that have since been commuted, are added to profit commission, the total for 2016 would be 69.8 million compared to 174.0 million in 2015, a decrease of 60%.
The decrease arose mainly due to less positive development of prior year booked loss ratios as a result of the change in Ogden discount rate.
