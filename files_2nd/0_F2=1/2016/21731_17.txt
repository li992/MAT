Rock solid a component journey DRILL BITS Erosion in drill bits presents a serious challenge in mining when productivity is crucial.
Rotary blasthole drills operate in variable ground formations.
Bodycotes carburising treatment increases the wear resistance of the drill bit parts, thus The drill bit components extending product life and operating efficiencies.
begin life as casehardening steel forgings.
The bit legs and rollers are machined to achieve the design required for best performance through difficult terrain.
The parts undergo painting operation to prevent hardening the sections which require better ductility.
Carburising increases the surface hardness, or wear resistance, in the drill bit.
A 3D printed insert is applied as masking to ensure that only the unpainted areas will be treated in the carburising process.
Before returning the parts, Bodycote inspects and performs quality checks for hardness.
