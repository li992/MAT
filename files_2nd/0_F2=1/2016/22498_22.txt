This reflects a write up of deferred tax assets due to the introduction of the bank corporation tax surcharge, more than offsetting the surcharge payable on profits for the period since 1 January 2016.

The principal activities of FFI are those of provision of instalment credit mainly asset backed finance to business customers to assist in their acquisition of business equipment and financial brokering to third party lenders.
Cash consideration of 3.6 million was paid and a contingent consideration of 1.3 million is expected to be paid in the future for the equity of the business.
Additions in goodwill of 0.3 million and intangible assets on acquisition of 1.5million in 2015 relates to the 100% acquisition of Mackay Stewart and Brown Limited, a Scottish Independent Financial Adviser with 72.0 million of client assets, for cash consideration of 1.8 million for the equity of the business.
These acquisitions are not regarded as material in the context of the groups financial statements and therefore information required for material acquisitions by IFRS 3 has not been disclosed.
Disposal of 6.9 million goodwill in 2016 relates to the sale of Asset Managements corporate advice and investment management activities.
Disposal of 10.4 million goodwill in 2015 relates to the Seydler disposal of 4.2 million and the write off of fully impaired goodwill of 6.2 million relating to the wind up of Fortune Asset Management Limited.
Intangible assets on acquisition relates to broker and customer relationships and are amortised over a period of eight to 20 years.
In the 2016 financial year, 5.1 million 2015: 5.0 million of the amortisation charge is included in amortisation of intangible assets on acquisition and 17.2 million 2015: 13.5 million of the amortisation charge is included in administrative expenses shown in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment tests for goodwill At 31 July 2016, goodwill has been allocated to nine individual CGUs of which seven are within the Banking division, one is the Securities division and the remaining one is the Asset Management division.
Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out annually by assessing the recoverable amount of the groups CGUs, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The recoverable amounts for all CGUs were measured based on value in use.
A value in use calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent board approved budgets and three year plans to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The key assumptions underlying managements three year plans, which are based on past experience and forecast market conditions, are expected market-making conditions in the Securities CGU, expected total client asset growth rate and revenue margin in the Asset Management CGU and expected loan book growth rates and net return on loan book in the Banking CGUs.
Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 110 The Notes continued 15.
Intangible assets continued For cash flows beyond the groups three year planning horizon, a terminal value was calculated using a prudent annual growth rate of 0% 2015: Banking division and Securities division 0%, Asset Management division 2%.
These cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market rates appropriate to the CGU as set out in the table below.
For the 2016 calculation, the pre-tax discount rates have been adjusted in each year to reflect the expected future change in corporation tax rate in each CGU.
As such, the pre-tax discount rates in the table are an average of the rate used in that CGU.
At 31 July 2016, the results of the review indicate there is no goodwill impairment.
The inputs used in the value in use calculations are sensitive, primarily to the impact of changes in the assumptions for future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
Having performed stress tested value in use calculations, the group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Details of the CGUs in which the goodwill carrying amount is significant in comparison with total goodwill, together with the pre-tax discount rate used in determining value in use, are disclosed separately in the table below: 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 Pre-tax Pre-tax Goodwill discount rate Goodwill discount rate Cash generating unit million % million % Winterflood Securities 23.3 15.3 23.3 12.5 Close Brothers Asset Management 33.7 11.0 33.7 11.0 Close Brothers Asset Finance 9.0 13.0 7.4 12.3 Other 19.9 11.713.0 19.8 11.012.5 85.9 84.2 16.

Capital The groups policy is to be well capitalised and its approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
The Prudential Regulation Authority PRA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition, a number of subsidiaries are regulated for prudential purposes by either the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
The groups Pillar 1 information is presented on page 115.
Under Pillar 2, the group completes an annual self assessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP is reviewed by the PRA which culminates in the PRA setting Individual Capital Guidance ICG on the level of capital the group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website www.
The group maintains a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to ensure the group meets the Pillar 1 capital requirements and ICG at all times.
As a result, the group maintains capital adequacy ratios above minimum regulatory requirements.
The groups individual regulated entities complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2016 and 2015.
A full analysis of the composition of regulatory capital and Pillar 1 risk weighted assets, a reconciliation between equity and common equity tier 1 capital after deductions and a table showing the movement in common equity tier 1 during the year are shown on the following pages.
At 31 July 2016, the groups common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 13.5% 31 July 2015: 13.7%.
Common equity tier 1 capital increased to 901.4 million 31 July 2015: 813.2 million primarily due to growth in profit attributable to shareholders.
Risk weighted assets increased to 6,682.5 million 31 July 2015: 5,932.1 million as a result of growth in credit and counterparty risk associated with the loan book.
Notional risk weighted assets for operational risk also increased reflecting increased performance over recent years.
The composition of capital remained broadly stable with 97.4% 31 July 2015: 95.9% of the total capital consisting of common equity tier 1 capital.

Contingent liabilities, guarantees and commitments Contingent liabilities Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS A principal subsidiary of the group, CBL, by virtue of being a regulated deposit-taker, contributes to the FSCS which provides compensation to customers of financial institutions in the event that an institution is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit-taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
At 31 July 2016, the group has accrued 1.0 million 2015: 1.9 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of the FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
The facilities are expected to be repaid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit-takers, except for an estimated shortfall of 1.0 billion which the FSCS is recovering by levying the industry in three equal annual instalments beginning in 2013 2014, in addition to the ongoing interest charges on the outstanding loans.
The amount of future levies payable by the group depends on a number of factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS, the groups participation in the deposit-taking market at 31 December, the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members.

The surplus of the scheme disclosed below has been accounted for as an asset of the group within note 17 Other assets and other liabilities.
The group has the unconditional right to any surpluses that arise within the scheme once all benefits have been secured in full.
As such no asset ceiling has been applied, and accordingly the scheme surplus is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet.

The valuation of the schemes liabilities is sensitive to the key assumptions used in the valuation.
The effect of a change in those assumptions in 2016 and 2015 is set out below.
The analysis reflects the variation of the individual assumptions.
The variation in price inflation includes all inflation-linked pension increases in deferment and in payment.
Impact on defined benefit obligation increase decrease 2016 2015 Key assumption Sensitivity % million % million Discount rate 0.25% increase 5.0 2.2 5.0 1.9 Price inflation RPI and CPI 0.25% increase 2.0 0.9 2.5 1.0 Mortality Increase in life expectancy at age 65 by one year 3.0 1.3 3.0 1.2 Changes in the assumptions used in the valuation due to external factors would affect the carrying value of the scheme.
The most significant risks are: Market factors movements in equity and bond markets : 80% of the schemes assets are invested in global equities and the schemes liabilities are measured with reference to corporate bond yields.
The performance of both of these asset classes can be volatile.
Underperformance of either of these markets would have an adverse impact on the carrying value of the scheme.
Inflation: Deferred pensions and pensions in payment increase at specified periods in line with inflation subject to certain caps and floors in place.
Changes in inflation may impact scheme liabilities.
Life expectancy: Change in the life expectancy of the schemes members may impact scheme liabilities.
The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the scheme liabilities is 18 years.

Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities where prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency to provide ongoing pricing information: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in less active markets for identical assets or liabilities or those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Investments classified as Level 1 predominantly comprise UK government securities and liquid listed equity shares.
Investments classified as Level 2 predominantly comprise less liquid listed equity shares, investment grade corporate bonds and over the counter derivatives.
Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 125 At 31 July 2016, investments classified as Level 3 predominantly comprise a legacy investment property fund.
The valuation of this investment is determined using its net asset value which is updated quarterly.
The group believes that there is no reasonably possible change to the inputs used in the valuation of this position which would have a material effect on the groups consolidated income statement.
In 2016 a number of listed equity shares have been classified as Level 2 classified as Level 1 in 2015 following an assessment of the frequency of transactions in these shares.
The prior year has been re-presented for comparability.
Aside from this there were no significant transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 in 2016 and 2015.

c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a reduction in earnings and or value, as a result of the failure of a counterparty or associated party with whom the group has contracted to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Credit risk across the group mainly arises through the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
The Banking division applies consistent and prudent lending criteria to mitigate credit risk.
Its lending activities are predominantly secured across a diverse range of asset classes and are generally short term in nature with low average loan size.
This ensures concentration risk is controlled in both the loan book and associated collateral.
The group has established limits for all counterparties with whom it places deposits, enters into derivative contracts or whose debt securities are held and the credit quality of the counterparties is monitored.
While these amounts may be material, the counterparties are all regulated institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and fall within the large exposure limits set by regulatory requirements.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as Winterflood trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any counterparty risk is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 127 Maximum exposure to credit risk The table below presents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking account of any collateral and credit risk mitigation, arising from its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments.
For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk represents the contractual nominal amounts.
31 July 31 July 2016 2015 million million On balance sheet Cash and balances at central banks 847.4 1,038.0 Settlement balances 478.1 398.3 Loans and advances to banks 121.5 84.6 Loans and advances to customers 6,431.6 5,737.8 Debt securities 221.3 149.5 Loans to money brokers against stock advanced 52.4 38.4 Derivative financial instruments 44.7 19.7 Other financial assets 42.3 36.5 8,239.3 7,502.8 Off balance sheet Undrawn commitments 962.7 862.4 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 9,202.0 8,365.2 Assets pledged and received as collateral The group pledges assets for repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements which are generally conducted under terms that are customary to standard securitised borrowing contracts.
The group has securitised without recourse 1,443.9 million 31 July 2015: 1,164.8 million of its insurance premium and motor loan receivables in return for debt securities in issue of 1,015.9 million 31 July 2015: 847.7 million, which includes 168.1 million 31 July 2015: nil debt securities in issue retained for liquidity purposes.
As the group has retained exposure to substantially all the credit risk and rewards of the residual benefit of the underlying assets it continues to recognise these assets in loans and advances to customers in its consolidated balance sheet.
The group accesses the Funding for Lending Scheme which enables it to borrow highly liquid UK Treasury Bills from the Bank of England in exchange for eligible collateral.
At 31 July 2016, asset finance loan receivables of 737.4 million 31 July 2015: 705.6 million and some of the 168.1 million 31 July 2015: nil debt securities in issue retained for liquidity purposes were positioned in exchange for 451.0 million 31 July 2015: 375.0 million Treasury Bills drawn.
The term of these transactions is four years from the date of drawdown.
The group also had repurchase agreements whereby the Treasury Bills were lent in exchange for cash included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
The Treasury Bills are not recorded on the groups consolidated balance sheet as ownership remains with the Bank of England.
The risk and rewards of the loans and advances to customers remain with the group and continue to be recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced of 52.4 million 31 July 2015: 38.4 million is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by Winterflood.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short-term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
The majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 23 of the Strategic Report.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria are applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 128 The Notes continued 28.
Financial risk management continued Financial assets: Loans and advances to customers Credit risk management and monitoring The overall credit risk appetite is set by the group board.
The monitoring of credit policy is the responsibility of the Banking divisions risk and compliance committees.
All large loans are subject to approval by the Banking divisions credit committees.
Retail, Commercial and Property Finance each use credit underwriting and monitoring measures appropriate to the diverse and specialised nature of their lending.
The Banking division has a dual approach to mitigating credit risk by: Lending on a secured basis with emphasis on both the customers ability to repay and the quality of the underlying security to minimise any loss should the customer not be able to repay: and Where the security collateralising a loan is less tangible, or in cases of higher loan to valuation LTV, greater scrutiny is applied both analytically and in terms of escalation of sanctioning authority.
The Banking divisions collections and recoveries processes are designed to provide a fair, consistent and effective operation for arrears management.
The Banking division seeks to engage in early communication with borrowers experiencing difficulty in meeting their repayments, to obtain their commitment to maintaining or re-establishing a regular payment plan.
The Banking division maintains a forbearance policy to support customers in financial difficulty and ensures the necessary processes and policies are in place to enable consistently fair treatment of each customer.
At the same time, the Banking division ensures these processes and policies do not restrict the ability to manage customers based on their individual circumstances.
This includes considering whether it is appropriate to change the terms and conditions of a loan, e. g. by extending its term, changing the type of loan, deferring interest or by capitalising arrears to assist a customer in financial difficulties.
The Banking Division seeks to ensure that any forbearance results in a fair outcome for the customer and will not repossess an asset unless all other reasonable attempts to resolve the position have failed.
The loan loss provision takes account of the credit risk that arises from forbearance.
At 31 July 2016, and following a review of the forbearance policy during the year, the gross carrying amount of exposures with forbearance measures was 123.5 million 31 July 2015: 109.2 million.
Retail Finance is predominantly high volume secured lending with a small average loan size.
Credit issues are identified early via largely automated tracking processes.
Remedial actions are implemented promptly to restore customers to a performing status or recovery methods are applied to minimise potential loss.
Commercial Finance is a combination of several niche lending businesses with a diverse mix of loans in terms of assets financed, and average loan size and LTV percentage.
Credit quality is predominately assessed on an individual loan by loan basis.
Recovery activity is executed promptly by experts in the specialised assets.
This approach allows remedial action to be implemented at the appropriate time to minimise potential loss.
Property Finance is a portfolio of higher value, low volume lending with credit quality assessed on an individual loan by loan basis.
Loans are continually monitored to determine whether they are performing satisfactorily.
In Property and Commercial Finance performing loans with elevated levels of credit risk may be placed on watch lists depending on the perceived severity of the credit risk.
Much of the Banking divisions lending is short term and the average loan size is small with the result that individual loans have little capacity to materially impact the groups earnings.
Credit risk reporting Loans and advances to customers, as disclosed in note 11, are analysed between the following categories for credit risk reporting: i Neither past due nor impaired These loans and advances to customers reflect the application of consistent and conservative lending criteria on inception and the quality and level of security held.
The contractual repayments are monitored to ensure that classification as neither past due nor impaired remains appropriate and also demonstrates the short-term nature of the lending, with 3.5 billion 2015: 3.1 billion having a contractual maturity of less than 12 months.
Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 129 The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are neither past due nor impaired.

This includes loans which are individually assessed for impairment but where the value of security is sufficient to meet the required repayments.
This also includes loans to customers which are past due for technical reasons such as delays in payment processing or rescheduling of payment terms.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are past due but for which no impairment provision has been raised.

Impaired loans and advances to customers are analysed according to whether the impairment provisions are individually or collectively assessed.
Individually assessed provisions are determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the financial condition of the customer and an estimate of potential recovery from the realisation of security.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Property Finance business and by the invoice finance business within Commercial Finance.
Collectively assessed provisions are considered on a portfolio basis, to reflect the homogeneous nature of the assets.
A percentage of the portfolio is impaired by evaluating the ageing of missed payments combined with the historical recovery rates for that particular portfolio as discussed in note 2 a.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Retail Finance businesses and the asset finance business within Commercial Finance.
The gross impaired loans are quoted without taking account of any collateral or security held, which could reduce the potential loss.
The application of conservative LTV ratios on inception and the emphasis on the quality of the security provided are reflected in the low provision to gross impaired balance ratio coverage ratio of 38% 2015: 35%.
The following table shows gross impaired loans and advances to customers and the provision thereon split by assessment method.
31 July 2016 31 July 2015 Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances to customers Individually Collectively Individually Collectively assessed assessed Total assessed assessed Total million million million million million million Gross impaired loans 75.4 83.1 158.5 69.7 92.6 162.3 Provisions 37.4 22.3 59.7 34.7 21.4 56.1 Net impaired loans 38.0 60.8 98.8 35.0 71.2 106.2 Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 130 The Notes continued 28.
Financial risk management continued The amount of interest income accrued on impaired loans and advances to customers was 16.2 million 31 July 2015: 14.6 million.
The group holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of residential and commercial property and charges over business assets such as equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.
Analysis by LTV ratio is provided below based on the groups lending facilities to customers where the exposure at origination exceeded 1.0 million, excluding Property Finance facilities written pre 2009.
Lending below this threshold has greater homogeneity predominately in the motor and premium finance businesses with typical LTV ratio between 80% to 90%.
The value of collateral used in determining the LTV ratio is based upon data captured at loan origination, or where available, a more recent updated valuation.
Gross loans and advances to customers where exposure at origination exceeded 1.0 million: Asset Invoice finance finance Property Total million million million million LTV Less than 70% 68.9 134.2 1,228.1 1,431.2 70% to 90% 115.7 182.5 25.1 323.3 Greater than 90% 139.3 4.0 143.3 At 31 July 2016 323.9 320.7 1,253.2 1,897.8 Asset Invoice finance finance Property Total million million million million LTV Less than 70% 59.3 149.8 1,002.6 1,211.7 70% to 90% 75.5 126.9 20.3 222.7 Greater than 90% 88.2 2.3 90.5 At 31 July 2015 223.0 279.0 1,022.9 1,524.9 Financial assets: Settlement balances Credit risk management and monitoring The credit risk presented by settlement balances in the Securities division is limited as such balances represent delivery versus payment transactions where delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment.
The credit risk is therefore limited to the change in market price of a security between trade date and settlement date and not the absolute value of the trade.
Winterflood is a market-maker and trades on a principal only basis with regulated counterparties including stockbrokers, wealth managers, institutions and hedge funds who are either authorised and regulated by the PRA and or FCA or equivalent regulator in the respective country.
Credit risk reporting Settlement balances are classified as neither past due nor impaired when the respective trades have not yet reached their settlement date.
Settlement balances are classified as past due but not impaired when trades fail to be settled on their contractual settlement date.
The credit risk presented by settlement balances which are past due is mitigated by the delivery versus payment mechanism, as well as by Winterflood trading only with regulated counterparties.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place as part of an overall risk management framework and settlement balances past due are actively managed.
The following table shows the ageing of settlement balances: 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 Neither past Past due Neither past Past due due nor but not due nor but not impaired impaired Total impaired impaired Total million million million million million million Within one month 449.9 25.8 475.7 378.9 16.2 395.1 Between one and three months 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Between three months and one year 0.6 0.6 0.9 0.9 Over one year 0.8 0.8 1.3 1.3 449.9 28.2 478.1 378.9 19.4 398.3 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2016 131 d Market risk Market risk is the risk that a change in the value of an underlying market variable, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, will give rise to an adverse movement in the value of the groups assets and arises primarily in the Securities division.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves.
The groups policy is to match repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities naturally where possible or by using interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 14.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
Changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts: 2016 2015 million million 1.0% increase 4.7 4.3 0.5% decrease 2.4 2.2 Changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2016 2015 million million 1.0% increase 8.7 11.3 0.5% decrease 4.3 5.7 Foreign currency risk The group has a limited number of currency investments and has chosen not to hedge these exposures.
These investments are predominantly in euros.
Foreign exchange differences which arise from the translation of these operations are recognised directly in equity.
A change in the euro exchange rate would decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2016 2015 million million 20% strengthening of sterling against the euro 2.6 5.6 The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of treasury operations in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, using exchange rate derivative contracts where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 14.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.
Market price risks Trading financial instruments: Equity shares and debt securities The groups trading activities relate to Winterflood.
The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk.

With respect to the long and short positions on debt securities 1.7 million and 0.1 million 2015: 2.7 million and 0.6 million were due to mature within one year respectively.
The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 1.3 million decrease 2015: 1.7 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a nil impact 2015: nil on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly market-making where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly, the sensitivity referred to above is purely hypothetical.
Non-trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments are disclosed in notes 12 and 13. e Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that liabilities cannot be met when they fall due or can only be met at an uneconomic price and arises mainly in the Banking division.
The group has a prudent liquidity position with total available funding at 31 July 2016 of 8.2 billion 31 July 2015: 7.5 billion.
This funding is significantly in excess of its loans and advances to customers at 31 July 2016 of 6.4 billion 31 July 2015: 5.7 billion.
The group has a large portfolio of high quality liquid assets principally including cash placed on deposit with the Bank of England.

Company transition to FRS 102 For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 July 2015 the company prepared its financial statements in accordance with previously extant United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
This is the first year that the company has presented its results under FRS 102.
The date of transition was 1 August 2014.
The company has taken advantage of FRS 102 transitional provision to account for its investment in subsidiaries at deemed cost, which is the carrying amount at the date of transition as determined under UK GAAP.
The company has applied the accounting policies disclosed in note 1 where applicable, as they are consistent with FRS 102 with the exception of tax on share-based payments which is similar to UK GAAP.
There are no changes in accounting policies which require reconciliation of profit after tax for the year ended 31 July 2015, and shareholders funds at 1 August 2014 and 31 July 2015, between UK GAAP as previously reported and FRS 102.
Reclassification of interest free loan to subsidiary Following the adoption of FRS 102, the interest free loan to subsidiary that was previously presented as fixed assets has been reclassified in the company balance sheet as a current asset.
This reclassification has no impact on shareholders funds or the profit after tax of the company accounts.
