50 STRATEGIC REPORT Investment activity With virtually all our transactions in the second half of the year, 2016 was another year of net property disposals.
Our one acquisition has given us the option to refurbish Phase 2 of The White Chapel Building.
We comfortably exceeded our initial sales target during the year with virtually all our transactions in the second half.
The three major office property sales comprised investments where we considered that the potential to add further significant short term value was limited.
At Balmoral Grove N7 we had previously conditionally sold the property for residential redevelopment.
All these conditions, including receipt of planning consent, were achieved during the year.
We retain a potential overage interest in this property as well as at Riverwalk House SW1, which was sold in 2012 and where the residential development was completed in 2016.
Any future profits will be dependent on the success of each scheme, and currently no value is attributed to these potential gains in our balance sheet.
Earlier in the year we sold our remaining available residential units at The Corner House, 73 Charlotte Street W1, David Silverman and Queens W2.
In total we raised 224.7m of cash Executive Director from sales in 2016.
As there were few acquisition opportunities that met our criteria during the year we acquired only one property, which was the long leasehold interest in one of the lower ground floors at The White Chapel Building.
This has given us the option to refurbish Phase 2 as discussed on page 48.
