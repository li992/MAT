40 STRATEGIC REPORT Valuation The valuation themes were positives from rental growth and our on-site developments, but these were offset by an outward movement in yields and the impact of a rise in Stamp Duty Land Tax.
The Groups investment portfolio was valued at 5.0bn at 31 December 2016, a similar level to last year.
The valuation themes were positives from rental growth and our on-site developments, but these were offset by an outward movement in valuation yields.
In addition we benefitted from an uplift on 132-142 Hampstead Road NW1 where we had conditionally agreed to sell the property.
As a result the valuation would have been flat apart from the additional impact of a rise in Stamp Duty Land Tax in March 2016 that lowered values by around 1%.
The net outcome was a valuation deficit for the year of 20.9m, before accounting adjustments of 23.3m see note 16 giving a total reported deficit of 44.2m.
This equated to a marginal underlying valuation decrease of 0.2% which followed a 16.5% increase in 2015.
The result was an outperformance when measured against our capital value benchmarks, Nigel George the IPD Quarterly Index for Central London Offices, Executive Director which decreased by 0.7%, and the wider IPD UK All Property Index which fell by 1.3%.
