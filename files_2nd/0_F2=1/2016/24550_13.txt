Managing a Listed Private Equity Company Throughout HVPEs ongoing cycle of Commitments, Investment, Growth, and Realisation, the Independent Board along with the Investment Manager uses tools and policies to manage the risk and reward for the benefit of the Companys shareholders.
Public Versus Private Equity Cycles The timing mismatch between public and private equity cycles requires active management within a listed private equity company.
HVPEs Board and the Investment Manager must carefully monitor the Balance Sheet to ensure that shareholder returns are optimised and that risks are controlled over the long term.
The Board and Investment Manager believe that successful private equity management requires consistent investment through the cycle, which in turn calls for patient capital in order to deliver strong NAV growth.
Fees The fee structure and flow within a listed private equity fund-of-funds is very different from a single fund or a traditional limited partnership.
As conditions across economic cycles vary, terms and fees reflect the current market situation.
HVPEs Board of Directors seeks to ensure that shareholders interests are safeguarded throughout the cycle of the portfolio and that net returns to shareholders are optimised.
Capital Flows and Underlying Liquidity Capital flows within the fund-of-funds structure differ from a single fund or a traditional limited partnership.
HVPE makes commitments to funds that can take many years to draw down into the portfolio.
An investment in the Company requires a firm understanding of the underlying cashflow and liquidity profile of the portfolio.
A private equity portfolio is traditionally considered to be relatively illiquid with respect to the timing of a sale when compared to a listed stock.
The liquidity events profiled within the Investment Managers Review are an important element in analysing the portfolio alongside the traditional measures of maturity.
The Board and the Investment Manager take all of these factors into consideration when making decisions about the timing of commitments to newly-formed funds.

HVPE can use its debt facility to fund commitments on a short-term basis.
Balance Sheet Management The Board and Investment Manager seek to utilise the strength of HVPEs balance sheet to benefit shareholders.
The strength of the balance sheet is reflected in the Companys ability to: Commit capital to new HarbourVest funds Invest in its ongoing HarbourVest fund commitments Purchase co-investments The Private Equity Cycle Stock market cycles typically run for five to seven years, punctuated by corrections of greater or lesser degrees.
Conversely, private equity investment takes place over periods of a decade or more, with a typical HarbourVest fund-of-funds managed over 14 years.
As a permanent capital vehicle, HVPE must take a long-term approach to the market cycle in order to optimise returns.
The Companys cash balance and $500 million credit line enable it to make commitments on a regular and consistent basis, including periods when short-term cash flows from realisation activity may be limited due to adverse movements in the public markets.
By ensuring an even flow of commitments, overall returns are expected to be enhanced over the cycle through consistent investment at times when market pricing is low and by avoiding over-commitment during market peaks.

37 Commitment Ratios HVPE and many of its listed peers utilise the metric Commitment Coverage Ratio calculated by dividing the sum of cash and available credit facility by unfunded commitments as a measure of balance sheet risk.
The Companys listed private equity peers typically have a shorter-term investment pipeline, and HVPEs unfunded commitments may appear relatively high in comparison.
HVPEs Investment Manager has created a metric to provide greater insight into the Companys balance sheet position and a more relevant comparison to listed peers.
The Rolling Coverage Ratio reflects the sum of cash, the available credit facility, and the realisations expected to be received during the current year, taken as a percentage of the expected cash investment in HarbourVest funds over the current year plus the next two years.
In considering forecast investments over a three-year period rather than total unfunded commitments, this calculation enables a more useful comparison of HVPEs coverage ratio relative to its peers.

2015 U. S. Venture At over $28 billion, fundraising for the year was healthy, although slightly down from the peak in 2014: pipeline of opportunities $100 in early 2016 is strong with realisations expected to drive future commitments.
Billion Europe Increased investor appetite helped by strong realisations, along with a number of successful large-cap fund raises, pushed overall fundraising up by 42% year over year.
Asia Despite relatively weak capital inflows into China-focused funds, Asia fundraising in 2015 hit $37 billion, slightly shy of 2014: outlook is strong with a pipeline of country funds returning to raise capital, primarily 2014 in China and Australia.
Emerging Markets Reflecting the economic challenges of the region, fundraising fell nearly 50% from the prior year with Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America experiencing the largest decreases.
Looking ahead, fundraising levels for 2016 are expected to decline.

Investment activity in 2016 is expected to improve modestly.
U. S. Venture At nearly $60 billion, investment activity for the year reached its highest annual level since 2000 with capital flowing predominantly to technology companies.
Capital invested has exceeded capital raised in each of the past nine years.
Europe Deal activity for the year reached a post-Global Financial Crisis high, with transaction volumes increasing to 125 billion up 38% over 2014 and driven mainly by deals valued at less than 1 billion, which 2000 2015 were up 75%.
Asia More than $50 billion in transactions closed in 2015, up 25% from the prior year, with over 60% of that activity based in China and India.

A healthy pipeline may be overshadowed by ongoing public market volatility.
Europe Both the M&A and IPO exit markets saw more than a 10% increase by value in activity from 2014, but sluggish GDP growth is expected to result in less activity going forward.
Asia Totaling nearly $38 billion, exits in 2015 fell short of 2014 levels with China and India responsible for almost half of the activity.
