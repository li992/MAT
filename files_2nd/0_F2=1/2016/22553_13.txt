But 2016 proved the strength of the Paris office letting market, and a continuing fall in supply bodes well for rents.
Robust valuations reflect a market dominated by domestic investors and a lack of supply.
Overall, we remain cautious of further investment in France until signs of recovery and political stability have returned.

60 40 Financing Strategy The Groups strategy is to hold its 20 investment properties predominantly in single-purpose 0 vehicles financed primarily by non-recourse bank debt in the currency used to purchase the asset.
In this way credit and liquidity risk can most easily be managed, around 50% of the Groups exposure to foreign currency is naturally hedged, and the most efficient use can be made of the Groups assets.
Bank debt ordinarily attracts covenants on loan-to-value and on interest and debt service cover.
None of the Groups debt was in breach of covenants at 31 December 2016.
The Group had 55 loans across the portfolio from 24 banks, plus a debenture, secured notes and an unsecured bond.
To the extent that Group borrowings are not at fixed rates, the Groups exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the use of financial derivatives, particularly interest rate caps and swaps.
Since 2015, medium-term interest swap rates have been close to short-term rates, and the Board chose to take advantage of these conditions, fixing medium-term debt taken out during the year predominantly with co-terminus interest rate swaps.
During the year the Group financed or refinanced 14 loans to a value of 177 million at a weighted average all-in rate of 1.90%, and of these 119 million was fixed at a weighted average all-in rate of 1.75%.

In September, 7.2 million was distributed as an interim distribution to shareholders for 2016 by means of a tender offer buy-back of 1 in 100 shares at 1,750 pence per share.

TOTAL RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS The prospect of the possible fallout from Brexit adversely affected the share prices of much of the property sector, including that of CLS, and so for the first time in ten years the share price ended the year below the level at which it started it, and consequently total shareholder return in 2016 was a negative 16.0%.
Nevertheless, in the five years to 31 December 2016, our total shareholder return of 159.1%, which represented a compound annual return of 21.0%, was one of the best performances in the listed real estate sector.
Since the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange, it has outperformed the FTSE Real Estate and FTSE All Share indices, as set out in the graph on page 11.
