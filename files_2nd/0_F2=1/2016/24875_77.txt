Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Policy implementation 2017 Salaries During 2016, the Committee undertook the annual benchmarking of executive packages.

This avoids the risk of the Company inadvertently providing a profit forecast or giving our international competitors access to sensitive information or an unfair advantage.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made are published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the EIP.

Taxable travel benefits refers to certain accommodation expenses for Non-Executive Directors that are wholly related to their attendance at Board meetings and are in accordance with normal Hikma expense policy.
These expenses are treated as a taxable benefit by the UK authorities and the above figure includes the corresponding tax contribution.
Other expenses refers to costs associated with Mr Samih Darwazah, the founder and Life President of Hikma, who passed away in 2015.
The Company paid certain medical, transport and accommodation expenses related to his treatment whilst ill and following his death held commemorative events.
The expenses were paid in recognition of the high level of regard in which he was held and in acknowledgement of his unique contribution to the Company.

These fees were paid in 2017 and, in accordance with regulations, will be included in the 2017 table.

External appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-for-profit appointments, and that these can broaden the experience, network and knowledge of the Director, from which Hikma can benefit.
Executive Directors may accept external appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest and are allowed to retain any fees.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of $28,000 2015: $10,000 and $10,000 2015: $10,000 respectively relating to external appointments which are detailed in their Director profiles on page 71.
The process for controlling these appointments is described in the governance statement on page 80.
Closing statement We have continued to develop our approach to remuneration reporting this year and the Committee hopes that this has aided your understanding of our Remuneration Policy and practices.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or observations.
