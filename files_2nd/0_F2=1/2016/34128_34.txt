Borrowings We focus on improving our cash flows allied to a relatively conservative debt structure secured principally against the freehold estate.
For the year we had healthy Group interest cover of 6.2 times 2015: 5.4 times based on cash generated from operations against interest paid.
Our financing policy is to fund our current needs through a mix of debt, equity and cash flow to allow us to selectively build out our development pipeline and achieve our strategic growth objectives, which we believe improve returns for shareholders.
We aim to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term facilities in place to finance our committed development programme, secured against the freehold portfolio, with debt serviced by our strong operational cash flows.
