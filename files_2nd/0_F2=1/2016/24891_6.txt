The deposit was first drilled in early 2009 and by 2012, its feasibility study had been approved by the Board.
Mine development was able to begin in 2012 with construction of the processing plant commencing in 2014 on receipt of the requisite government permits.
Hochschild purchased the remaining minority interests inlate 2013 and funded this acquisition and the construction of the project through existing cash resources and the issuing of a senior note in January 2014.
