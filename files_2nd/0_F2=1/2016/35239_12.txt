The immediate impact of the EU 3 12 referendum vote was for yields to move out c. 25bp to reflect heightened uncertainty and some early forced sales by the open-ended funds which created an initial sharp adjustment.
However the market quickly stabilised: tenants have been resilient and 2 8 the weaker level of sterling has attracted fresh investment interest as demonstrated by the 4.1bn of deals in Q4.
West End annual activity at 4.4bn held up better and was only 8% lower than in 2015, seeing a much higher degree of domestic interest, 1 4 which accounted for 46% of the transactions as opposed to 30% for the market as a whole.
There have already been a number of significant transactions in Q1 2017 which suggests that demand remains robust.
The London Completed Proposed Vacancy rate office occupier is likely to face additional costs Under construction Completed average following the rise in business rates introduced from April 2017, and it is widely expected that some Source: CBRE financial and associated jobs will move to other cities in the EU.
The latter will ultimately depend on the outcome of UK-EU negotiations, but a number of Central London office investment transactions banks have already suggested that several thousand bn jobs are earmarked to move.
Despite these 20 challenges we believe that there is still scope for selective rental growth, although this is unlikely to occur across all our London villages.
