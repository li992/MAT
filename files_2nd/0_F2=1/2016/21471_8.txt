While we were targeting this milestone, the Bank was product-centric with an aggressive client acquisition approach.
Having over two million clients now, this phase is over and we target growth through increasing product to client ratio.
NUMBER OF RETAIL BANKING CLIENTS Product to In order to better connect with the various segments of the retail client Client 2.0 base, Bank of Georgia operates a multi-brand strategy.
Over 2 Million Retail Clients CAGR 14.3% We began implementing our Express Banking strategy in 2012 by rolling out small-format, Express branches offering predominantly transactional banking services to clients through ATMs and Express Pay terminals.
Under the Bank of Georgia brand we target the mass retail segment.
This is our flagship brand and the most significant profit contributor.
We are currently transforming our service delivery to mass retail clients from a product-centric to a customer-centric one.
In April 2015, we launched Solo a fundamentally different approach to premium banking.
As part of the new strategy, the Banks Solo clients are given access to exclusive products and the finest concierge-style 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 environment at our newly designed Solo lounges and are provided with new lifestyle opportunities, such as exclusive events and handpicked lifestyle products.

Express serves as a platform for bringing the currently under-banked population into banking and its main focus is to enable its client base to transact in a fast and easy way.
In 2016, we installed 140 new Express Pay terminals, resulting in 2,729 total Express Pay terminals as of the end of the year.
We are now leaders in Georgia in the payment systems market.
We have combined our travel card for the Tbilisi bus and metro of which we are the sole provider and our contactless card with a loyalty programme linked to the customers current account to create an Express card and issued 566,394 such cards in 2016.
At the end of the year we had 1,279,113 Express cards outstanding.
We also sell only a limited number of banking products to our Express banking clients.
Currently, 85 out of a total of 128 Express branches are located in Tbilisi and going forward we would like to roll out Express branches in regions to reach a wider population.
The all-in cost of opening a new Express branch is just US$ 50,000.
Nowadays, Express is the major growth driver in our fee and commission income from the Retail Banking segment and a strong franchise attracting the unbanked population to the Bank, eventually growing them into mass retail customers.
BANK OF GEORGIA UNPARALLELED MASS RETAIL BANKING FRANCHISE Under the Bank of Georgia brand, we serve mass retail clients.
However, we now have a relationship with c. 2.1 million clients and our challenge by 2018, as declared in 2015, was to increase the product to client ratio from a low 1.7 at the end of 2015, to 3.0 in 2018.
To this end, we are shifting our business model from product to client-centric.
During 2016, we worked on three main areas to achieve our goal of higher product to client ratio in this segment.
We recognise that our current service model and branches are built around products and they are not convenient to our clients.
We have product specialist bankers and separate corners for various products and clients must navigate the branch space to get all the services they need.
To address this, we have trained our bankers to become universal product bankers and also freed up their time from processes that do not involve client interaction, by moving those processes to the back office.
We also redesigned the branches to build them around the client and make their experience comfortable.
In 2016, we moved to a focused service model in 15 branches, so called live-labs, where clients have a single touchpoint to acquire products and receive consultation.
In the medium term, we intend to convert the Bank of Georgia brand into a single touchpoint front office organisation.
We are launching our first client-centric branch in April 2017 and are aiming to complete the redesign of most of the branches by the end of 2017.
SOLO A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PREMIUM BANKING The Solo brand is used for servicing the emerging mass affluent segment.
Our new Solo model was introduced in 2015.
It is a fundamentally different approach to premium banking.
As a part of the new strategy, the Banks Solo clients are given access to exclusive products and the finest concierge-style environment at our newly designed Solo lounges and are provided with new lifestyle opportunities, such as exclusive events and handpicked lifestyle products.
To qualify for Solo services one needs to have an income of GEL 3,000 per month.
At Solo lounges, clients are served by personal bankers and, in addition to the banking products, are offered luxury goods at cost and other lifestyle offers including a travel magazine and entertainment.
In 2016 Solo organised the concerts with the world famous artists.
The events were limited to Solo clients only, which created further interest in the Solo franchise.
We intend to grow the number of Solo clients to 40,000 by the end of 2018, from the current 19,267 level.
Net profit per Solo client stood at GEL 1,692 in 2016, over 26 times what we have in the mass retail segment under the Bank of Georgia brand.
