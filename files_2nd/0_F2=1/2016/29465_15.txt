Strategic Report Financial overview and performance SSE Wholesale Wholesale overview Sustainably sourcing and producing energy SSEs Wholesale segment consists of three business areas: Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation: Gas Storage: and Gas Production.
It makes a sustainable contribution to the fulfilment of SSEs core purpose and achievement of its financial goals, through excellence in the flexible provision, storage and delivery of energy and related services for customers in wholesale energy markets in Great Britain and Ireland.
This is achieved through maintaining a diverse portfolio of assets, contracts and innovative energy solutions: and the ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and opportunities.
