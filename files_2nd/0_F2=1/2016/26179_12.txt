2 Interest rates 31 December 2016, the impact on Portfolio valuation would consequently be much reduced.
Each of the projects in the Portfolio are funded effectively with xed-rate nancing, either through the use of interest rate swaps or through xed-rate or index-linked bond finance.
Changes to interest rates therefore have little impact on the finance costs of the projects and therefore the returns received by JLIF are largely insulated from this risk.
Long term gilt yields in the UK, Continental Europe and North America continued to decrease over 2016 and remain at historically low levels.
There is the potential that these could increase over time.
Historically, there appears only limited correlation between movements in gilt rates and discount rates used to value PPP projects.
The current Portfolio WADR of 7.87% is signicantly higher than the Portfolio weighted average gilt rate, a differential that remains at an historic high since launch.
