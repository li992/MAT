USP increasing footprint by 9.4m households Our business continues to grow strongly, and with a solid foundation of almost 70 partners and 2.3m customers, the business has made a step change in its expansion, with the agreement to acquire USP, a business with over 300 partnerships and 0.4m customers.
Operational performance The USA remains our most significant opportunity with 128m households of which we now have affinity partner relationships that provide services to 32m.
On 31 March 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire USP, a leading provider of home assistance policies, which once completed will increase our footprint by a further 9.4m households.
During the year we signed 11 new utility affinity partnerships and extended our relationship with certain current partners, adding a total of 2.8m utility households.
Our pipeline of potential partnerships is strong, with negotiations at all stages of the process.
The agreement with USP marks a step change in the expansion of the business in the USA.
USP employs a similar business model to us, having partnerships with around 300 water municipals and a small number of utility companies.
USP is the exclusive home warranty partner of the National League of Cities, an organisation dedicated to helping city leaders and an advocate for 19,000 cities, towns and villages across the USA.
USP has 0.4m customers and 0.6m policies.
This acquisition will bring significant opportunity to increase penetration of the existing 9.4m USP partner households and provide customers with a broader range of home assistance products.
Combining USP with our business, we will offer our products to 42m households through an affinity brand and serve over 2.7m customers.
The acquisition is expected to complete in the first half of FY17, following ordinary course regulatory approvals.
HomeServe plc | 15 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report United States of America continued During FY15 we signed an affinity partnership with AARP, a membership organisation providing services to over 22m households in the USA.
Having now established our relationship with AARP, we are growing the number of customers and expect that it will become one of our largest partners in the USA.
Customer numbers increased 17% to 2.3m FY15: 2.0m with 0.7m gross new customers added in the year FY15: 0.7m.
Direct mail continues to be the most significant channel but we have also seen an increase in new customers acquired through our partner and digital channels.
Our response rates and payback periods have continued to be attractive and in line with our expectations.
A focus on customer service combined with a number of operational improvements to our retention processes, has ensured we continue to maintain our high level of retention at 82% FY15: 82%.
Moreover, this is despite the continued increase in new customers, who typically have a lower year one retention rate.
Our network of 152 directly employed technicians and almost 1,000 sub-contractors completed 0.4m jobs with an increasing number of water heater installations FY15 jobs: 0.3m.
16 | HomeServe plc Strategic report Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Chief Executives review Financial performance Revenue was up 14% to $228.4m FY15: $199.8m due to higher renewal income and marketing activity.
Income per customer was $91 FY15: $94 principally reflecting the number of new customers who join with just one product, the mix of products and an increasing repair cost as we expand product coverage.
Excluding the impact of USP, we expect income per customer to be broadly stable in FY17.
Adjusted operating costs in the USA were $210.9m, up 11% on prior year FY15: $190.1m principally reflecting the increase in customer numbers, partner commissions and continued investment in business development and marketing.
Adjusted operating profit increased 81% to $17.5m FY15: $9.7m while the adjusted operating profit margin increased 3 percentage points to 8% from 5% in the prior year.
We are confident that, in the longer-term, adjusted operating margin will be around 20%, similar to that achieved in the UK.
