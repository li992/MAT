Market Review The private equity market in the year to 30 September 2016 has continued to see a limited supply of investment opportunities helping prices remain at a high level.
Market Deal Volumes Deal volumes in the year to 30 September 2016 were significantly below the levels seen in previous years, even with a return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.

Although the average entry multiple for UK buyouts valued at over 10 million fell slightly from 11.4x in the year to September 2015 to 10.8x EBITDA this year, it remains above the five and ten-year average, both of which stand at 10.4x source: CMBOR.
Investment Activity A number of factors, relating both to private equity in particular and to financial markets more broadly, have increased asset prices as well as liquidity in the M&A and credit markets.
At the same time, Electras portfolio of assets has matured as our investment strategy has successfully created a portfolio of growth businesses which are of increasing interest to strategic and financial buyers alike.
We have capitalised on this to deliver a record level of realisations during the year, 903 million in total.
The Buyouts and Co-investments portfolio alone has generated realisations of 781 million and the weighted average exit multiple in this part of the portfolio was 13.4x EBITDA.
This includes three exits to strategic buyers and one in an IPO.
