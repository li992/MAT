the UK & Ireland is largely attributable to the market and operational challenges at SIGD and Offsite Construction.
On a statutory basis the Groups gross margin decreased by 40bps to 26.4% 2015: 26.8%.
Operating costs and profit SIGs underlying operating cost base increased by 74.6m to 639.5m in 2016 2015: 564.9m due to a currency impact of 39.9m, additional costs from acquisitions of 23.6m, and net cost inflation of 11.1m.
The combination of lower gross margin and higher costs meant that the Groups underlying operating profit declined 8.6% to 91.3m 2015: 99.9m with underlying operating margin declining 80bps to 3.3% 2015: 4.1%.
In the UK & Ireland, underlying operating profit fell 14.5% to 53.2m 2015: 62.2m and underlying operating margin declined 90bps to 3.8% 2015: 4.7%.
In Mainland Europe, underlying operating profit increased 8.4% to 48.9m 2015: 45.1m, including 5.8m foreign exchange benefit, with underlying operating margin decreasing slightly, down 30bps to 3.6% 2015: 3.9%.
The Group made a statutory operating loss of 91.0m 2015: profit of 65.9m in 2016.
SIGs underlying net finance costs increased by 2.5m to 13.8m 2015: 11.3m, mainly due to higher borrowings which, together with the decline in operating profit, resulted in underlying profit before tax decreasing 12.5% to 77.5m 2015: 88.6m.
Underlying basic earnings per share from continuing operations declined 14.2% to 9.7p 2015: 11.3p.
Return on Capital Employed Post-tax Return on Capital Employed ROCE is one of the Groups primary performance metrics and is calculated on a rolling 12 month basis as underlying operating profit less tax, divided by average net assets plus average net debt.
Going forward, SIG is focusing on sales growth and cash generation in order to improve its ROCE.
Acquisitions In 2016 SIG acquired six infill businesses for a gross cash consideration of 21.1m 2015: 78.1m, together with a contingent consideration of up to 10.8m dependent on future performance.
Three of the acquisitions were in the UK and three were in Mainland Europe.
SIG has since suspended its infill acquisition programme as part of its actions to manage leverage.
