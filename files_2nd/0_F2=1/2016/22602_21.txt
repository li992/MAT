Events after the balance sheet date On 16 February 2017, Cobham provided an update on KC-46, 2016 results and 2017 guidance.
Within this statement, we highlighted that the net debt EBITDA ratio was 3.0x and that the Balance Sheet is not strong enough to properly support the operations of the Group, given the important role it plays in many customer programmes.
Having considered its options, the Board has concluded that it is in the Groups best interests to reduce its target net debt EBITDA ratio from 2x to 1.5x and accordingly announced on 2 March 2017 that it has decided to raise new equity finance of 500m by way of a rights issue during the second quarter of 2017.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten on a standby basis by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Cazenove and Barclays Bank plc.
The underwriting is subject to customary conditions, which allow the underwriters to not fund the equity in a number of circumstances including there being a material adverse change in the affairs of the Company or financial markets.
