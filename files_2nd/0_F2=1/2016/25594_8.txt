Strategic Report Performance and Financials Alternative Performance Measures The Strategic Report includes both statutory and adjusted measures, the latter of which, in managements view, reflects the underlying performance of the business and provides a more meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Our APMs and KPIs are aligned to our strategy and together are used to measure the performance of our business and form the basis of the performance measures for remuneration.
Adjusted results exclude Key adjustments for Adjusted EBITA, profit before tax and EPS certain items because if Adjusted EBITA is calculated by adding back exceptional items and high end production tax credits to included, these items could EBITA.
Further adjustments, which include amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business distort the understanding of combinations and net financing costs, are made to remove their effect from adjusted profit before tax our performance for the year and EPS.
The tax effect of all these adjustments is reflected to calculate an adjusted tax charge.
These and the comparability adjustments are detailed below.
Production The ability to access tax credits, which are rebates based on production spend, is tax credits fundamental to our Studios business when assessing the viability of investment in green-lighting decisions, especially with regards to high-end drama.
ITV reports tax credits generated in the US and other countries e. g. Ireland, Hungary, Canada and South Africa within cost of sales, whereas in the UK tax credits for high-end drama must be classified as a corporation tax item.
However, in our view all tax credits relate directly to the production of programmes.
Therefore to align treatment, regardless of production location, and to reflect the way the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis, these are recognised in adjusted EBITA.
Exceptional This includes acquisition related costs further detail below, reorganisation and items restructuring costs, non-recurring legal costs, gains or losses on disposal of non-core assets and impairment of intangible assets.
These items are excluded to reflect performance in a consistent manner and are in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
They are typically gains or losses arising from events that are not considered part of the core operations of the business or are considered to be one-off in nature.
We also adjust for the tax effect of these items.
Note 2.2 includes further detail on exceptional items.
Acquisition related costs We structure our acquisitions with earnouts or put and call options, to allow part of the consideration to be based on the future performance of the business as well as lock in creative talent.
Where consideration paid or contingent consideration payable in the future is employment linked, it is treated as an expense under accounting rules and therefore on a statutory basis is part of our reported results.
However, we exclude all consideration of this type from adjusted profit after tax and adjusted EPS as, in our view, these items are part of the capital transaction.
Page 44 of the Financial and Performance Review explains this further.
Restructuring and reorganisation costs These arise from Group-wide initiatives to reduce the ongoing cost base and improve efficiency in the business.
They are non-recurring costs and because of their size and nature, are excluded from our adjusted measures.
Amortisation Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired through business and combinations is not included within adjusted earnings.
As these costs are  related, and in line with our treatment of other acquisition-related costs, we consider of intangible them to be capital in nature and they do not reflect the underlying trading performance assets of the Group.
Amortisation of software licences and development is included within our adjusted results as management consider these assets to be core to supporting the operations of the business.
Net financing Net financing costs are adjusted to reflect the underlying cash cost of interest for the costs business providing a more meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and funded on a day-to-day basis.
The adjustments made remove the impact of mark-tomarket on swaps and foreign exchange, imputed pension interest and other financial gains and losses, which do not reflect the relevant interest cash cost to the business.

28 million adjustment relates to production tax credits which we consider to be a contribution to production costs and working capital in nature rather than a corporate tax item.
Exceptional items largely relate to acquisition costs, primarily employment linked consideration, as well as restructuring costs and pension curtailment cost.
77 million adjustment relates to amortisation on acquisition related intangible assets.
We include only amortisation on purchased intangibles such as software within adjusted PBT.
25 million adjustment is primarily for non-cash interest cost.
This provides a more meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and funded on a day-to-day basis.
Tax adjustments are the tax effects of the adjustments made to reconcile PBT and adjusted PBT.

Profit to cash conversion This is our measure of cash generation used for working capital management.
It is calculated as adjusted cash flow as a proportion of adjusted EBITA.
Profit to cash conversion is based on adjusted measures to reflect the cash generation of our underlying business after operating capex, excluding the effect of exceptional items, non-cash expenses such as depreciation and share based payments.
