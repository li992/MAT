Commenting, Mel Ewell, Chief Executive, said: We have delivered underlying PBT in line with our previously stated range, but we are disappointed with the overall financial performance of the Group in 2016.
Although the Board believes that the Groups strategic direction is correct, implementation has proved challenging.
Accordingly, since November we have slowed or stopped a number of internal initiatives, which will allow our team to refocus on customers and sales growth in order to generate cash and improve ROCE.
This will ensure that we build on SIGs significant potential in 2017.
One consequence of our 2016 profit is that leverage is now higher than our targeted 1.0 1.5x range.
Leverage reduction is a key short-term priority and we have already identified a number of actions to strengthen the balance sheet, including the rebasing of our dividend.
Going forward, we will take all necessary steps to ensure the Groups balance sheet is able to withstand any near-term fluctuations in market demand.
We have also announced today the appointment of Meinie Oldersma as our new Group Chief Executive.
Meinie brings over 30 years of distribution experience and a strong customer focus to SIG.
Together with the recent arrival of Nick Maddock as Chief Financial Officer this completes the recruitment of the executive team to take the business forward.
In the meantime I remain fully committed to the business until Meinie is on board.
Trading in the first two months of 2017 has been in line with the Boards expectations, although markets remain competitive and we are experiencing some supplier price inflation.
The longer term outlook in our core markets continues to offer considerable opportunity and SIG remains a good business with strong market positions which is capable of delivering much more.
