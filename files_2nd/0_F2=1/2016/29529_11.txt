CLIENT SEGMENT REVIEWS Client segment reviews We have four client segments.
Corporate & Institutional Banking and Private Banking are run globally, with clients in those segments supported by relationship managers with global oversight.
Commercial Banking and Retail Banking are run regionally with global oversight of segment strategy, systems and products.
Clients are served by country-level relationship managers with specific knowledge of the local market.
Items not directly managed by client segments are included in Central & other items.
The following table highlights theperformance of our client segments during 2016.

IFRS 9 does not permit the prior year to be restated.
