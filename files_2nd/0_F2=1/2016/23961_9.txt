Key performance indicators Focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses We measure contract retention as a percentage by First Student and First Transit contract retention revenues of all the contracts subject to bid in the % year rather than as a percentage of the contract portfolio as a whole.
In First Student and First Transit we typically expect contract retention levels of around 90%.
In First Student, our contract retention rate during the 2015 bid season was 86%, towards the upper end of our expectations this year, given our focus on improving contract returns, which yielded an average price increase of 5.3%.
In First Transit, our contract retention rate was 90% in the year.
