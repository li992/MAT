We continue to invest in research and development to bring new innovative Nitrile products to market and cement our position as the Nitrile latex innovation market leader.
As part of our strategy to maintain our leadership position in Nitrile latex, the Innovation Group continues to extend its fundamental research partnership and sponsorships with local universities inMalaysia.
Most recently this was extended to UTM Universiti Teknologi Malaysia with the sponsorship of a Masters Degree focused on emulsion polymerisation in latex acrylic systems.
On successful completion, the student will join the Innovation Group inKluang.
Further programmes were introduced during the year with an award for the best Polymer Science PhD thesis at the Malaysian Institute of Chemistry Institut Kimia Malaysia.
