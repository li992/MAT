Just Because You Can, Doesnt Mean You Should How personalisation can get altogether too personal for comfort by Jeremy Bullmore For years, youve been unable to do something.
Then new technology comes along and suddenly you can.
Its an entirely human instinct but not one to be thoughtlessly followed.
Its unwise to assume that just because youre now free to do something from which you were previously debarred, it must be in your interest to grab it.
Read Jeremy Bullmores essay on pages 111 and 112.
