Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report New markets including digital innovation 0.3m customers in Italy Investment in digital technology Intention to expand to further international territories Our New Markets segment consists of our investment in new territories, digital and innovation initiatives.
During the year we successfully exited our German business with no material loss on the sale.
In Italy, we have 0.3m customers through our test agreement with Enel FY15: 0.2m and we have commenced the testing of alternative products and channels with other potential partners.
Key to establishing a sustainable business in Italy is the signing of a long-term agreement with a leading utility.
We have established a digital hub to develop an end to end, consistent, user friendly digital experience for our customers.
A new Chief Digital Officer has been appointed to lead this activity and to enhance self-serve functionality at all stages of the customer journey and enable more effective product sales.
We have committed to provide 2m seed funding to a digital start-up called DAD.
DAD connects consumers to DIY experts to help fix home repairs.
We have also commenced the appraisal of extending our services to other international markets with a view to entering the home services market in partnership with local utilities, similar to the initial successful joint ventures with South Staffordshire Water in the UK and Veolia in France.
While still early days, we have identified a number of attractive markets where, through our current affinity partnerships, we believe we can partner with local utilities.
Financial performance Our New Markets businesses reported revenue of 20.1m FY15: 13.8m reflecting the higher number of customers in Italy.
Our investment in New Markets resulted in a loss of 5.9m FY15: 5.9m and we would expect a similar level of investment in FY17.
