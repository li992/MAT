Directors shareholdings The executive directors shareholding guidelines have been structured to encourage executive directors to acquire and maintain a meaningful shareholding in Fidessa.
For executive directors this is a minimum value equal to 100% of salary for the Chief Executive Office and 100% for the Chief Financial Officer.
The values of Chris Aspinwalls shareholding has been substantially greater than the guideline throughout 2016 and several multiples of his salary.
Andy Skelton, having only recently been appointed as Chief Financial Officer, will be building his shareholding so that he satisfies the guideline over the coming years: the table below provides further details.
There is no shareholding guideline for the non-executive directors.
