INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT Market Environment The U. S. loan market, as measured by the S&P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, returned 10.16% for 2016.
"After a challenging start in January and February, a ""risk on theme prevailed for the remainder of the year which meant that lower rated assets outperformed the better quality high single B BB credits on which the Fund focuses."
In the U. S. demand for loans continued to be seen from collaterised loan obligation CLO managers and retail funds and they reported annual inflows of $71 billion and $5.4 billion respectively.
For the majority of the year, demand exceeded supply, which meant that a lot of the issuance that came to market was opportunistic, i. e. repricing of existing facilities or owners looking to take dividends or draw small add on facilities.
The value of the Index ended the year at $887 billion, just $7 billion up for the year and, within that, approximately 80.9% of the Index names were trading at bid prices of 99 or above as compared to 29.9% at the same time last year.
The U. S. trailing 12 month default rate ended 2016 at 1.58% by amount which was just marginally up, 0.04%, on the 2015 number.
In Europe the S&P European Leveraged Loan Index ELLI recorded a full year total return of 5.72% and the average bid finished at 98.62, well up over the year from a 96.91 start point.
Demand was strong and CLO issuance totalled 16.8bn, the largest annual issuance level pre crisis.
During the year, more new deals were printed than got repaid and the ELLI actually rose in value to 114 billion, the highest level since 2010 and the first time it has grown for eight years.
In Europe, the trailing 12-month default rate ended the year at 2.40%.
Portfolio Management During 2016 the Portfolio remained very much weighted towards USD issuance which accounted for 93.3% of the Portfolio at the end of December.
The bond allocation remained well below the 20% of NAV permitted, at 3.5%, as we remained focused on keeping duration low and limiting potential areas of volatility.
We continued to allocate to better rated assets, and the BBB BB weighting ended the year at 52.4%, up from 47.9% at the end of 2015.
Outlook Our outlook for the loan market remains positive.
Generally we feel that issuers are performing steadily, leverage is being controlled and cash cover metrics are strong.
The market today is pricing in approximately a 2.7% implied default rate, which is in line with our 2017 expectations of 2-3%.
We believe that moderate U. S. economic growth will lead to further interest rate increases, which should be constructive for senior floating rate loans.
We continue to believe that loans will be attractive given the returns on offer, the expected low volatility compared to other risk asset classes and their senior secured nature.
