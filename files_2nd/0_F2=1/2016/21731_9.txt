Brak Brake through a component journe e through a component journey y BRAKE DISCS Vehicles are exposed to environmental elements which cause corrosion, such as snow, ice, road salt, and acid rain.
The Ferritic Nitrocarburising FNC process makes it easier to maintain clean brakes, important for safety critical components.
Bodycotes FNC treatment strengthens the surface providing optimal corrosion protection and wear.
The brake rotors begin life as iron sand castings.
Brake rotors are treated in Bodycotes proprietary The braking surfaces FNC furnaces.
nitrogen enriched atmosphere, the rotor surfaces are hardened and strengthened.
The parts are stress relieved to eliminate stress introduced in the casting process.
The parts are inspected and tested for core hardness.
After this, the parts are painted and assembled into the brake systems.
