Consistently applying our Sales Growth Drivers to our Growth and Specialist Brands, combined with effective cost management, delivers quality sales with high operating margins.
This generates the strong cash flows that are a recognised strength of our business.
We use this cash to reinvest to support growth, pay down debt or return to shareholders through dividends, which we are committed to growing by at least 10 per cent a year over the medium term.

Through portfolio management we focus on connecting our brands with consumers to enhance brand equity and build sales.
For us, innovation means creating a drumbeat of initiatives: small, frequent innovations that keep our brands fresh and relevant.
Excellence in customer engagement requires strong partnerships with retailers that support their business and maximise the impact of our brands at the point of sale.
Pricing opportunities are evaluated by brand, pack size and sales channel.
We assess excise structures when making pricing decisions and focus on driving revenue growth while continuing to give consumers value for money.
