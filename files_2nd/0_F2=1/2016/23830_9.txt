According to CRU, the increase in Pellets are the most efficient source of IRON ORE PELLETS imports reflected lower Chinese domestic iron for a blast furnace, reducing energy The pellet premium that the Group received production due to environmental requirements in the iron making process in 2016 improved throughout the year, restrictions on output.
In addition, supply and emitting the lowest levels of waste recovering from lows seen at the start of side structural reforms in the Chinese steel and emissions compared to sinter fines the year to finish the year more strongly.
