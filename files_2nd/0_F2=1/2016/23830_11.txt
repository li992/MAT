AN EFFICIENT AND WELL INVESTED PRODUCTION PROCESS The diagram below illustrates the pellet production process from ore extraction through to pelletising.
Open cut, hard rock iron ore mining, using truck and shovel.
DRILLING BL ASTING E XCAVATION HAUL AGE RELOADING ORE TO STATIONS CRUSHER The ore is crushed and screened before entering one of two crushing plants.
DRY FINE SCREENING MEDIUM COARSE MAGNETIC CRUSHING CRUSHING CRUSHING SEPAR ATION The ore is ground to produce concentrate which is then upgraded to 67% Fe content.
Waste material is removed to the tailings storage area.
