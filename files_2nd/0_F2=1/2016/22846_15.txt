An amount of 15,000 was paid to each of them inthe period to 3 September 2016.
2 PSP award figures have been updated with the actual share price on the date of vesting on 1 November 2015 of 88.5p.
The reported figure in FY2015 was 46,709 for Suzanne Harlow and 149,226 for Michael Sharp and was based on the three month average share price to year end.
The total for 2015 has therefore been adjusted.
3 Appointed to the board on 26 January 2015 so the 2015 disclosure is not a full year.
4 Stepped down from the board on 24 June 2016, hence the 2016 disclosure is not a full year and does not include payments made after that date.
The following provides details of how the single figure for FY2016 has been calculated: Base salary Matt Smith and Suzanne Harlow received a salary increase of 1.5% on 1 April 2016.
Benefits Executive directors receive a benefits allowance which can be used to purchase benefits under the Group scheme.

Michael Sharp received a cash contribution in lieu of pension of 20% of base salary 104,037.
PSPs No PSP awards were granted in November 2013 and therefore there is no long-term incentive award which vests based on performance to 3 September 2016.
Annual bonus for FY2016 The maximum bonus for the year was 100% of base salary: the bonus was based 100% on PBT.
Bonuses start accruing for meeting threshold levels of performance with the maximum bonus only being payable for achieving performance significantly in excess of this level.

2 Michael Sharps award was pro-rated to 96,760 shares following his departure from the Company.
These awards are based 70% on EPS growth targets and 30% on financial measures that underpin our strategy.
Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 57 THE ANNUAL REPORT ON  The EPS targets are 3% per annum 25% vesting to 10% per annum 100% vesting.
The strategic measures are as follows: Key strategic pillars Proposed metric 7.5% of award each Delivering a compelling customer proposition Group gross margin improvement Increasing availability and choice through multi-channel Online EBITDA growth rate Focusing on UK retail UK GTV growth Expanding the brand internationally International EBITDA growth rate Each strategic measure will vest independently.
Each financial strategic measure will be subject to a single hurdle performance test ie each measure will either vest at 0% or in full.
In order for the award to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award and, specifically, vesting of any strategic measure will besubject to a ROCE underpin.
The definition of ROCE was refined in November 2014 and capital employed now includes acapitalised value of future store rental payments and profitability items on a pre-rental basis.
Financial strategic targets are specific, measurable and the performance hurdle is set at a level which is considered by the Committee to be sufficiently stretching.
The financial targets for the strategic measures are considered by the board to be marketsensitive and therefore we will not disclose these measures at the current time.
However, indications of performance against strategic targets will be provided during the vesting period.
We will also disclose the targets in full, along with actual performance against targets, at the time of vesting.
Shareholding guidelines In order to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders and to demonstrate the executive directors ongoing personal financial commitment to the business, executive directors are expected to build and maintain a holding ofDebenhams shares equal to 100% of base salary.
Executives are expected to retain 50% of any post-tax shares that vest under any share incentive plans until this shareholding isreached.
The Committee is aware that some shareholder guidance indicates that the minimum shareholding guideline for executive directors should be 200% of base salary.
In the context of our reward levels and our current PSP opportunity, the Committee considers that the current guideline of 100% of salary remains appropriate.
The Committee will consider its position again, however, when we review the wider policy ahead of the 2018 AGM.

The Committee set stretching targets for these metrics taking into account our long-term strategic plan.
Theexact targets were not disclosed at the time of award as they were considered to be commercially sensitive.
Notwithstanding that the Group has made further progress against its strategic priorities, due to the very stretching nature of the targets set for the strategic measures, performance is currently behind target.
Vesting will be determined in FY2018 and FY2019 respectively based on performance over the three year performance period.
