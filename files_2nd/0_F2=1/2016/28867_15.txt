50 Simple solutions After buying mobile phone operator EE, telecoms group BT wanted to convert the bank loan it used for the acquisition into a longer-dated format.
We acted as a lead bond arranger as well as a crosscurrency swap market hedge coordinator, and billing and delivery bank on the five-year bond.
