Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Other financial information Banking net interest margin The banking net interest margin is calculated by dividing banking net interest income by average interest-earning banking assets.
Non-banking net interest income includes the net interest expense reported by the Insurance business, net interest income earned from non-banking assets, negative fair value adjustments relating to certain past liability management exercises and consolidation adjustments between net interest and other income to eliminate the impact of certain intragroup transactions.
Non-banking assets include loans and advances within Commercial Banking where the predominant income stream is fees rather than net interest, and loans sold by Commercial Banking and Retail to Insurance to back annuitant liabilities.
The table below shows the reconciliation between the statutory net interest income and the underlying net interest income.

The change in the year was largely driven by areduction in the net interest income reported by the non-banking businesses, the continued reduction in run-off non-banking assets together withachange to the funding cost charged to the remaining run-off non-banking assets to better reflect their maturity profile.
The insurance gross up of 1,898 million 2015: 38 million largely represents amounts payable to unitholders in consolidated open-ended investment vehicles managed by the Insurance business.
The increased expense in the year reflects strong market performance in the second half of 2016.

IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement.
The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments.
As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group.
Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition toresults based on the actual return.
The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurancevolatility.
