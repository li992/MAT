The most significant individual new investments were in respect of Photobox Group, Retirement Bridge Group and the Debt portfolio.
Buyouts and Co-investments Photobox Group is Europes leading digital consumer service for personalised products and gifts.
Photoboxs services allow consumers to turn their digital photographs into a range of products, from traditional prints and greetings cards to photobooks, calendars and canvases.
Photobox is the market leader in Europe and is uniquely placed, due to its scale, to capture further growth as the overall trend for personalised gifts continues.
Our strategy is to accelerate growth through improving the rate and economics of customer acquisition as well as product innovation, and to ensure that growth is delivered effectively and efficiently.
Electra invested 89 million alongside another private equity firm in the acquisition of Photobox, which was concluded at an attractive valuation in January.
In May, Electra invested 45 million alongside another private equity firm in the acquisition of Retirement Bridge Group, an originator, consolidator and servicer of home reversion equity release plans with a portfolio of more than 3,500 properties across the UK.
The investment offers an attractive risk-adjusted return benefiting from a cash yield and downside protection from the high level of asset backing.
The intention is to optimise the return from the existing portfolio and to explore opportunities for organic and acquisition-led growth.
32 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 Secondaries The EP1 Secondary Portfolio EP1 acquired two further secondary fund positions.
In common with its previous acquisitions, these funds were purchased at a discount to net asset value, comprise mature underlying assets and are cash-generative.
Electra supported the acquisitions with a follow-on investment of 7 million, taking its total investment in EP1 to 93 million.
Commitments outstanding to secondaries were 34 million compared to 31 million at 30 September 2015.
Debt Electra has invested 32 million in the equity of two collateralised loan obligation funds CLOs, namely Tymon Park and Cordatus VI.
CLO equity offers strong risk-adjusted returns from a diversified portfolio of senior debt issued by predominantly private equity-backed issuers: much of the return is delivered as cash yield.
In December, Electra provided a 10 million mezzanine loan to support the acquisition of Bowlplex by Hollywood Bowl, formerly known as The Original Bowling Company.
Later in the same month Electra invested a further 11 million to acquire an interest in Hollywood Bowls senior debt at a discount to par.
Upon the IPO of the business in September, both of these holdings were repaid with interest.
In April, Electra invested 9 million to acquire a portion of the senior debt in Sparrows, a global provider of engineering products and services to the energy industry.
Sparrows is a market-leading business providing an essential service in offshore oil and gas operations.
Electras investment has been concluded at an attractive valuation and benefits from a cash yield.
Non-core Investment Portfolio A further 12 million was drawn down by private equity funds in which Electra is a limited partner.
Commitments outstanding to private equity funds were 14 million compared to 21 million at 30 September 2015.

Buyouts and Co-investments The largest realisation during the year was in respect of Elian.
Electra received proceeds of 199 million from the 435 million sale of the company to Intertrust Group in September.
Epiris led the 180 million buyout of Elian in 2014 and worked closely with the management team to reposition the business through revenue diversification, operational excellence and transformational M&A.
This strategy was successfully implemented, including through the acquisitions of Allied Trust and SFM in 2015.
Revenues and profits increased by 40% and 60% respectively over the two years of Electras investment, while the value of the business more than doubled.
Including income and proceeds from a previous repayment, Electra realised a return of 2.6x original cost, an IRR of 54%.
Hollywood Bowl announced a successful IPO valuing the company at 266 million in September.
Epiris led the 91 million buyout of Hollywood Bowl in 2014 and worked closely with the management team to accelerate earnings growth through increased investment and operational focus: and to reposition the business through M&A.
This strategy was successfully implemented, with strong organic growth and the acquisition of Bowlplex in December 2015.
Revenues and profits increased by 35% and 80% respectively over the two years of Electras investment, while the value of the business almost trebled.
Upon admission, Electra received cash proceeds of 153 million giving a total return on its equity investment, including the value of its 18% retained interest in the company, of 3.9x original cost, an IRR of 101%.
In October 2015, AXIO completed the sale of its Asian healthcare business, MIMS, for $250 million.
This was the third major realisation from its portfolio following the sale of JOC Group and Breakbulk in 2014.
In the same month AXIO refinanced its aviation business, OAG.
Electra received proceeds from these two transactions and from cash flow amounting to 110 million during the year, taking total cash proceeds from its investments in AXIO excluding proceeds subsequently received from the sale of Vidal to 193 million or 2.1x original cost.
Electra received 95 million of loan repayments following completion of the merger of the Park Resorts Group and Parkdean Holidays in November 2015.
Total proceeds received by Electra from this investment are now 110 million or 0.8x of original cost.
34 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 The investment in Zensar Technologies was sold in October 2015 for a consideration of 82 million.
Epiris supported the company as it grew and then sought an exit once the markets valuation of the shares reflected the companys scale and growth.
Over the five years prior to exit, profits growth and rerating resulted in the value of Electras investment more than trebling.
The investment generated a return of 19x on original cost over the 18 years of the investment, an IRR of 18%.
In July, Electra announced that it had partially realised its holding in Allflex, the global leader in animal intelligence and monitoring technologies for livestock, pets, fish and other species.
Electra received total proceeds of 57 million, equivalent to a return of 0.8x cost, from the redemption of preferred equity and from the sale of approximately 28% of its 15% equity interest.
Electra originally invested in Allflex in 1998, eventually selling the business in 2013, generating a return of 15x original cost and an IRR of 28%.
Following the sale, Electra made a new equity investment for a minority stake in the current business alongside BC Partners.
The total return on the current investment now stands at 1.9x original cost, a 24% IRR.
In February 2016, Electra sold its interest in fine art materials supplier Daler-Rowney.
Following a period of underperformance in 2014, Epiris strengthened the management team and initiated a performance improvement programme.
These actions cemented the companys attractive positions in niche markets, improved its operational and financial performance, and created good growth prospects for the years to come: as a result the business was well positioned for an exit to a strategic buyer.
Electra received proceeds of 33 million from the sale, equivalent to a return of 1.7x original cost, a 12% IRR.
Electras investment in Kalle, the global manufacturer of artificial sausage casings and sponge cloths, was realised in April 2016, with Electra receiving cash proceeds of 23 million.
Including the proceeds received from a previous refinancing in 2013, Electra realised a return of 3.2x original cost, an IRR of 22%.
In respect of Buyouts and Co-investments, over the past five years Electra has achieved an average uplift over the prior valuation on realisation of 58%: Uplif Uplift % t % 229 240 220 200 170 180 160 135 140 120 100 76 80 73 70 69 66 Weighted average 58% 58 60 49 46 50 46 37 35 34 40 20 16 20 13 7 0 -20 14 Except where the prior valuation at the time reflected the impending realisation, in which case the prior, prior valuation has been used.

36 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 Buyouts and Co-investments In the year to 30 September 2016 the total return of 687 million from the Buyouts and Co-investments portfolio included 212 million of realised gains with the balance being unrealised.
Unrealised appreciation included 108 million of valuation growth resulting from: the revaluation of retained interests in investments where Electra has achieved a partial realisation: and investments where Electra agreed a transaction that had not completed at the year-end.
A further 262 million resulted from organic growth in maintainable earnings, 52 million in respect of debt reduction by portfolio companies and 28 million as a result of changes in multiples used for valuation.
The contribution of bolt-on acquisitions made in the year to unrealised valuation growth was 25 million.

Typically Epiris derives the multiple using a market approach which references observable market inputs, generally the market valuations of quoted comparable companies and the price at which unquoted comparable companies have changed ownership.
Differences between these comparable companies and the investee company being valued are reflected by adjusting the multiple, generally by applying a discount, for points of difference such as relative size, growth, profitability or return on capital.
The unrealised gain from multiple changes of 28 million in the year under review may be disaggregated into a reduction of 123 million from changes in the market valuations of quoted comparable companies and an increase of 151 million from changes in adjustments for points of difference.
The latter, which is tested using a tool known as calibration which is explained in more detail in the Principles of Valuation of Investments on page 103, generally reflects progress in implementing Epiris strategy to improve performance and reposition investee companies.
The largest individual movement was in respect of Parkdean Resorts, which at 30 September 2015 was valued on the basis of the merger which completed in November 2015: this investment contributed a reduction of 53 million from changes in the market valuations of quoted comparable companies and an increase of 95 million from changes in adjustments for points of difference.
In respect of maintainable earnings, Epiris usually uses reported earnings for the most recent twelve-month period, adjusted if necessary to represent a reasonable estimate of maintainable earnings.
Such adjustments might include exceptional or non-recurring items, the impact of discontinued activities and acquisitions, or forecast material changes in earnings.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 37 Further Information Governance Financial Statements The Managers Report Strategic and Business Review Overview The unrealised gain from earnings growth of 262 million in the year under review may be disaggregated into an increase of 207 million from growth in reported earnings for the most recent twelve-month period, and an increase of 55 million from changes in adjustments to reflect maintainable earnings.
This latter includes 42 million in relation to adjustments to reflect the increased value of portfolio companies earnings derived from overseas operations as a result of the weakening of Sterling against other major currencies since mid-June: and 13 million relating to other adjustments to maintainable earnings.
The largest individual movement was in respect of Parkdean Resorts, which contributed an increase of 112 million from earnings growth.
At 30 September 2015 this investment was valued using the valuation agreed for the mergers of Electras holiday park assets with Parkdean Holidays to form Parkdean Resorts: this transaction was announced in August 2015 and completed in November 2015.
A portion of this 112 million could therefore be considered to result from earnings growth achieved between the date upon which the merger valuation was agreed and 30 September 2015.
Approximately a further 29 million of unrealised gain results from the effect of the weakening of Sterling against other major currencies since mid-June on the valuation of investments denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The most significant realised returns were generated by Elian, Hollywood Bowl and Allflex, as discussed above.
The largest unrealised increases in valuation arose in respect of Parkdean Resorts, AXIO, Audiotonix and Innovia.
The merger of the Park Resorts Group with Parkdean Holidays to create Parkdean Resorts completed in November 2015.
Electra initially invested in Park Resorts in 2012, buying the companys senior debt before taking an equity position in a refinancing led by Epiris in 2013.
This refinancing allowed Epiris to implement its strategy to improve performance and consolidate the sector, which increased group EBITDA from 32 million in 2012 to 68 million in 2015.
The merger combined two complementary portfolios of holiday parks to create a nationwide operator with 2015 EBITDA of over 100 million.
Earnings have grown further from this level during 2016 as a result of strong financial performance coupled with the successful execution of the merger integration plan.
This has resulted in a 188 million increase in the valuation of Electras investment during the year.
The total return on the investment now stands at 3.7x original cost.
The investment in AXIO has continued to benefit from Epiris strategy to reposition each component business with strategic clarity, operational improvement, growth investment and M&A.
In October 2016, AXIO agreed to sell its European healthcare information business, Vidal, to M3, Inc. subject to certain conditions.
Following completion of this sale in November 2016, AXIO has returned to Electra 2.7x original cost in cash.
Amongst the three remaining businesses, performance in OAG and RISI continues to be strong while, in June 2016, TechInsights acquired Chipworks to create the market leader in advanced technology intelligence and patent advisory services.
In aggregate, these three businesses have more than trebled earnings since the investment was made.
The valuation of Electras investment increased by 130 million during the year as a result of the agreement to sell Vidal, earnings growth, an increase in the valuation multiple and cash flow.
The total return on the investment, which was made in 2013, now stands at 4.6x original cost.
Audiotonixs financial performance remains strong.
The continued investment in research and development has resulted in successful new product launches along with a growing pipeline of future products.
The company sells to over 90 countries and over 50% of its revenues are in US Dollars.
The recent devaluation of Sterling has benefited Audiotonixs earnings, which are reported in Sterling.
The valuation of Electras investment has increased by 50 million as a result of earnings growth and cash flow.
The total return on the investment now stands at 3.3x original cash cost.
38 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 Innovias earnings have increased substantially over the past year.
Product mix, production of substrate for 5 and 10 notes and operational improvements have contributed to earnings growth.
In April 2016 Innovia sold its cellophane manufacturing business to Futamura Chemicals Co. Ltd. allowing it to focus on its core product areas of polymer banknote substrate, where it is the global market leader, and BOPP films, where it is building on its double bubble technology to develop products for its core and new markets.
The valuation of Electras investment has increased by 50 million during the year as a result of earnings growth and an increase in the valuation multiple.
The total return on the investment now stands at 2.5x original cost.
The largest valuation decreases were in respect of Hotter Shoes and TGI Fridays.
The valuation of Electras investment in Hotter has reduced to 31 million, or 0.4x original cost.
The investment in Hotter was written down significantly at 31 March 2016 as a result of earnings declines and a consequent reduction in the valuation multiple in the first half of the year.
Following this underperformance, a new management team has been recruited and is implementing an operational improvement plan with a focus on cost reductions and cash and stock management.
Earnings have stabilised and Epiris and the management team are focusing on delivering the improvement plan over the short term.
TGI Fridays earnings are performing in line with the investment case, reflecting a successful store opening programme offset by some weakness in like-for-like performance as a result of UK casual dining market conditions.
The valuation of Electras investment in TGI Fridays reduced by 23 million to 0.9x original cost as a result of a decline in comparable company multiples.
The table below shows the valuation changes in respect of Electras Buyouts and Co-investments portfolio.

More than 85% of the increase in the simple average was due to those investments where Electra has either achieved a partial exit during the year or sold some or all of its investment following the year end: such investments have been valued at the valuation of the transaction in question.
Buyouts and Co-investments Profit Growth The distribution of Electras Buyouts and Co-investments portfolio by EBITDA growth in the last year compared to the previous year is shown below.
Aggregate portfolio company EBITDA attributable to Electras interest increased by 14%, of which approximately one percentage point was due to bolt-on acquisitions, compared to 12%, of which approximately 2% was due to bolt-on acquisitions, at 30 September 2015.
This analysis calculates portfolio company EBITDA attributable to Electras interest by multiplying Electras investment valuation as a proportion of the total equity valuation at 30 September 2016 by EBITDA for the most recent twelve-month period and for the preceding twelve-month period in respect of each portfolio company.
Thus it is a measure of the growth in Electras share of historical portfolio company earnings.
