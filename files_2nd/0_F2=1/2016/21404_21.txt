The acquisition supports Ontics strategy to deliver continued profitable growth in mature avionics and electronics products with high intellectual property content.
This business will be transitioned into Ontics existing UK facility in Cheltenham over the course of 2017.
The cash payment for this acquisition was made in January 2017.
Additionally, Ontic further extended its licensed product portfolio during the year with the addition of important new licensors: signing its first product licences with Ultra Electronics for electronic engine control equipment used on commercial aircraft, and with Safran Nacelles, to support the Saab 2000 nacelles and AWACS CFM56 thrust reverser.
Ontic also expanded its existing licensor relationships by increasing its portfolio of JT15D products from Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. Ontic continues to assess a strong pipeline of opportunities in relation to new products and licence adoptions.
