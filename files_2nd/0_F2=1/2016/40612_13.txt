OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2016 Our Big Boxes are among the most sought-after in the UK and our tenants include some of the biggest names in retail, logistics, consumer products and automotive.
A portfolio of strategically located, high-quality assets that meet tenants needs Occupational supply and demand is most favourable for landlords of strategically located, large and modern Big Boxes.

In such circumstances they will be committed to the asset.
If the occupier is also financially strong they will often make significant investment to the property and continue to invest into their occupation of the location throughout the life of the lease.
Changes which benefit the tenant can often also provide points of opportunity for the owners of these investments to benefit from capital value growth.
Our asset management strategy focuses on creating value throughout an assets life cycle.
