Investment Managers Aberforth Partners LLP the firm, Managers or Aberforth act as Alternative Investment Fund Manager and Secretaries to the Company.
The business was established in 1990 to provide institutional and wholesale investors with a high level of resources focused exclusively on small UK quoted companies.
Since then funds under management have grown to 2.3 billion as at 31 December 2016.
The firm is wholly owned by five partners four of whom are investment managers.
Seven investment managers work as a team managing the Companys portfolio on a collegiate basis: Euan Macdonald, Keith Muir, Richard Newbery, Peter Shaw, Christopher Watt, Alistair Whyte and Mark Williamson.
These services can be terminated by either party at any time by giving six months notice of termination.
Compensation would be payable in respect of this six month period only if termination were to occur sooner.
Aberforth receives an annual management fee, payable quarterly in advance, equal to 0.75% of the net assets up to 1 billion, and 0.65% thereafter.
The management fee amounted to 8,296,000 in the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: 8,755,000.
The secretarial fee amounted to 79,940 excluding VAT during 2016.
It is adjusted annually in line with the Retail Prices Index and is subject to VAT, which is currently irrecoverable by the Company.
The Board reviews the Companys investment management and secretarial arrangements on an on-going basis and formally at its October meeting, where each Director completes a Managers Evaluation questionnaire.
The Board then considers the results of the questionnaire and discusses the following matters, amongst others, in its review: investment performance in relation to the investment objective, policy and strategy: the continuity and quality of personnel managing the assets: the level of the management fee: the quality of reporting to the Board: the alignment of interests between the Managers and the Companys shareholders: the administrative services provided by the Secretaries: and the level of satisfaction of major shareholders with the Managers.
Following the most recent review, the Board was of the opinion that the continued appointment of Aberforth as investment managers, on the terms agreed, remains in the best interests of shareholders.

In carrying out such duties, the Depositary acts in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company.
The Depositary is contractually liable to the Company for the loss of any securities entrusted to it.
The Depositary is also liable to the Company for all other losses suffered as a result of the Depositarys fraud, negligence and or failure to fulfil its duties properly.
National Westminster Bank plc receives an annual fee, payable quarterly in arrears, of 0.0125% of the net assets of the Company and their appointment may be terminated at any time by giving at least six months notice.
A Depositary may only be removed from office when a new Depositary is appointed by the Company.
Capital Structure and Share Buy-Backs At 31 December 2016, the Companys authorised share capital consisted of 333,299,254 Ordinary Shares of 1p of which 94,403,292 were issued and fully paid.
During the year, 620,500 shares 0.7% of the Companys issued share capital with a nominal value of 6,205 were bought back and cancelled at a total cost of 6,282,000.
No shares are held in treasury.
Subject to the requirement that purchases by the Company of its own shares are made only at a level that enhances the net asset value per share NAV, the principal objective of any such purchase is to seek to sustain as low a discount between the Companys NAV and share price as seems possible.
Accordingly, it is the intention to continue to use the share purchase facility within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
Continuation of the Company The Company has no fixed duration.
However, in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association, shareholders are asked every three years to vote on the continuation of the Company and an ordinary resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 1 March 2017.
The Directors are recommending that the Companys shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
If such resolution is not passed, the Directors will prepare and submit to shareholders for approval by special resolution proposals for the unitisation or appropriate reconstruction of the Company.
In putting forward such proposals the Directors will seek, inter alia, to provide shareholders with a means whereby they can defer any liability to capital gains tax on their investment at that time.
If such proposals are not approved, shareholders will, within 180 days of the Annual General Meeting, have the opportunity of passing an ordinary resolution requiring the Company to be wound up.
On a winding up, after meeting the liabilities of the Company, the surplus assets will be paid to the holders of Ordinary Shares and distributed, pro rata, among such holders.
Going Concern In accordance with the report Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council, the Audit Committee has undertaken and documented an assessment of whether the Company is a going concern.
The Committee then reported the results of its assessment to the Board.
The Companys business activities, capital structure and borrowing facility, together with the factors likely to affect its development and performance are set out in the Strategic Report.
In addition, the Annual Report includes the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk, details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable equity securities, which, if necessary, can be sold to meet any funding requirements, though funding flexibility can typically be achieved through the use of the bank debt facility.
The Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to meet its day-to-day working capital requirements and the Directors believe that shareholders are likely to support a recommendation for the Companys continuation.
In summary and taking into consideration all available information, the Directors have concluded it is appropriate to continue to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
