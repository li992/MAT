Every year, we publish various thought papers, both online through the Knowledge and insight section of our website and in print.
These are always well-received by clients and intermediaries and are used as a tool to generate healthy debate on a variety of current market topics.
In addition to keeping clients and advisers informed through a variety of regular updates, we also host numerous events throughout the year.
A particular highlight this year was our partnership with The Spectator to host a three-part series focusing on whether Britain should leave the European Union, the future of party politics and the 2016 US presidential election.
The total audience for these events was in excess of 3,000 guests and showcased our ability to be at the forefront of key market events.
