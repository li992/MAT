07 Additional information Additional unaudited financial information I IFRS profit and loss information I a Analysis of long-term insurance business pre-tax IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns by driver This schedule classifies the Groups pre-tax operating earnings from long-term insurance operations into the underlying drivers of those profits, using the following categories: Spread income represents the difference between net investment income or premium income in the case of the UK annuities new business and amounts credited to certain policyholder accounts.
It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
With-profits business represents the gross of tax shareholders transfer from the with-profits fund for the year.
Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality and morbidity.
Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the year attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance, as well as items that are more appropriately included in other sources of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
DAC adjustments comprise DAC amortisation for the year, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.
Analysis of pre-tax IFRS operating profit by source and margin analysis of Group long-term insurance business The following analysis expresses certain of the Groups sources of operating profit as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other suitable driver.

Analysis of Asia operating profit drivers: Spread income increased on a constant exchange rate basis by 17 per cent to 192 million in 2016 AER: 29 per cent, predominantly reflecting the growth of the Asia non-linked policyholder liabilities.
Fee income increased by 2 per cent on a constant exchange rate basis to 174 million in 2016 AER: 13 per cent, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unit-linked liabilities.
Insurance margin increased on a constant exchange rate basis by 24 per cent to 1,040 million in 2016 AER: 38 per cent, primarily reflecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
Insurance margin includes non-recurring items of 49 million 2015: 17 million on CER basis: 15 million on AER basis.
Margin on revenues increased by 98 million on a constant exchange rate basis from 1,821 million to 1,919 million in 2016, primarily reflecting higher regular premium income recognised in the year.
Acquisition costs increased on a constant exchange rate basis by 8 per cent to 1,285 million in 2016, AER: 19 per cent compared to the 19 per cent increase in APE sales AER: 33 per cent increase, resulting in a decrease in the acquisition costs ratio.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE sales.
If with-profits APE sales were excluded from the denominator the acquisition cost ratio would become 70 per cent, which is broadly in line with the 69 per cent on a constant exchange rate basis in 2015.
Administration expenses increased on a constant exchange rate basis by 13 per cent to 832 million in 2016 AER: 24 per cent as the business continues to expand.
On a constant exchange rate basis, the administration expense ratio has increased from 279 basis points in 2015 to 287 basis points in 2016, the result of changes in country and product mix.

Analysis of US operating profit drivers: Spread income declined on a constant exchange rate basis by 5 per cent to 802 million in 2016 AER increased by 8 per cent.
The reported spread margin decreased to 217 basis points from 241 basis points in 2015, primarily due to lower investment yields.
Spread income benefited from swap transactions previously entered into to more closely match the asset and liability duration.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 153 basis points 2015 CER: 167 basis points and AER: 166 basis points.
Fee income increased on a constant exchange rate basis by 3 per cent to 1,942 million in 2016 AER: 16 per cent, primarily due to positive net inflows from variable annuity business and fund appreciation during the second half of the year.
Fee income margin has remained broadly in line with the prior year at 190 basis points 2015 CER and AER: 192 basis points.
Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Insurance margin of 888 million in 2016 was broadly in line with last year on a constant exchange rate basis, with higher income from the variable annuity guarantees offset by a decline in the contribution from the closed books of acquired business.
Acquisition costs, which are commissions and expenses incurred to acquire new business, including those that are not deferrable, have decreased by 17 per cent at a constant exchange rate basis, largely due to lower sales in 2016.
Administration expenses increased to 959 million in 2016 compared to 934 million for 2015 at constant exchange rates AER 828 million, primarily as a result of higher asset-based commissions.
These are paid on policy anniversary dates and are treated as an administration expense in this analysis.
Excluding these trail commissions, the resulting administration expense ratio would be 34 basis points 2015 CER and AER: 36 basis points.

Broadly: a Spread business is the net operating profit for fixed annuity, fixed indexed annuity and guaranteed investment contracts and largely comprises spread income less costs.
b Fee business represents profits from variable annuity products.
As well as fee income, revenue for this product line includes spread income from investments directed to the general account and other variable annuity fees included in insurance margin.
c Life and other business includes the profits from the REALIC business and other closed life books.
Revenue allocated to this product line includes spread income and premiums and policy charges for life protection, which are included in insurance margin after claim costs.
Insurance margin forms the vast majority of revenue.

370 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 07 Additional information Analysis of UK operating profit drivers: Spread income reduced from 258 million in 2015 to 177 million in 2016, mainly due to lower annuity sales.
Spread income has two components: A contribution from new annuity business which was lower at 41 million in 2016 compared to 123 million in 2015, as we withdrew our participation from this business.
IFRS accounting based on grandfathered GAAP permits up front recognition of a considerable proportion of the spread to be earned over the entire term of the new contracts.
A contribution from in-force annuity and other business, which was broadly in line with last year at 136 million 2015: 135 million, equivalent to 42 basis points of average reserves 2015: 43 basis points.
Fee income principally represents asset management fees from unit-linked business, including direct investment only business to group pension schemes, where liability flows are driven by a small number of large single mandate transactions and fee income mostly arises within our UK asset management business.
Excluding these schemes, the fee margin on the remaining balances was 40 basis points 2015: 43 basis points.
The lower 2016 insurance margin mainly reflects the more positive experience variance seen in 2015 compared to 2016, together with the fall in annual mortality profits following the extension of our longevity reinsurance programme in 2015 and 2016.
Margin on revenues represents premium charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
Acquisition costs incurred were broadly consistent with 2015 at 89 million, equivalent to 8 per cent of total APE sales in 2016 2015: 8 per cent.
The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
The year on year comparison of the ratio is therefore impacted by the level of with-profits business where acquisition costs are funded by the estate in the year and the contribution from the bulk annuities transactions in the prior year.
Acquisition costs expressed as a percentage of shareholder-backed APE sales excluding the bulk annuity transactions were 37 per cent 2015: 36 per cent.
The contribution from longevity reinsurance and other management actions to improve solvency during 2016 was 332 million 2015: 400 million.
Further explanation and analysis is provided in Additional Unaudited IFRS Financial Information section I d. The 2016 provision for the cost of undertaking a review of past non-advised annuity sales and potential redress of 175 million is explained in note C11, Provisions.
Notes to sources of earnings tables i The ratio for acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of APE sales including with-profits sales.
Acquisition costs include only those relating to shareholder-backed business.
ii Margin represents the operating return earned in the year as a proportion of the relevant class of policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus.
iii The 2015 comparative information has been presented at AER and CER so as to eliminate the impact of exchange translation.
CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rates.
All CER profit figures have been translated at current year average rates.
For Asia CER average liability calculations, the policyholder liabilities have been translated using current year opening and closing exchange rates.
For the US CER average liability calculations, the policyholder liabilities have been translated at the current year month end closing exchange rates.
iv For UK and Asia, opening and closing policyholder liabilities have been used to derive an average balance for the year, as a proxy for average balances throughout the year.
The calculation of average liabilities for Jackson is generally derived from month end balances throughout the year, as opposed to opening and closing balances only.
In 2016, given the significant equity market fluctuations in certain months during the year, average liabilities for fee income in Jackson have been calculated using daily balances instead of month end balances in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the fee income, which is charged on the daily account balance.
The 2015 average liabilities for fee income in Jackson have been calculated based on average of month end balances.
The alternative use of the daily balances to calculate the average would have resulted in no change to the margin on the CER basis.
Average liabilities for spread income are based on the general account liabilities to which spread income attaches.
Average liabilities used to calculate the administration expense margin exclude the REALIC liabilities reinsured to third parties prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
Average liabilities are adjusted for business acquisitions and disposals in the year.
v The DAC adjustments contain a credit of 28 million in respect of joint ventures and associate in 2016 2015: AER credit of 3 million.
vi In order to show the Asia long-term business on a comparable basis, the 2015 comparative results exclude the contribution from the held for sale Korea life business.

co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 373 Additional unaudited financial information Continued I IFRS profit and loss information continued I d Contribution to UK Life financial metrics from specific management actions undertaken to position the balance sheet more efficiently under the new Solvency II regime During 2016 management actions were taken to improve the solvency of UK insurance operations and to mitigate market risks.
These actions included extending the reinsurance of longevity risk to cover a further 5.4 billion of IFRS annuity liabilities.
As at 31 December 2016, the total IFRS annuity liabilities subject to longevity reinsurance were 14.4 billion.
Management actions also repositioned the fixed income asset portfolio to improve the trade-off between yield and credit risk and to increase the proportion of the annuity business that benefits from the matching adjustment under Solvency II.
During 2015, longevity risk of 6.4 billion on a Pillar 1 basis was reinsured.
In addition, a number of other management actions were also taken to reposition the fixed income portfolio and improve matching adjustment efficiency.
The effect of these actions on the UKs long-term IFRS operating profit, underlying free surplus generation and EEV operating profit is shown in the tables below.

The 31 December 2016 estimated solvency position includes the impact of recalculated transitionals at the valuation date which has reduced the Group shareholder surplus from 12.9 billion to 12.5 billion.
In accordance with Solvency II requirements, these results allow for: Capital in Jackson in excess of 250 per cent of the US local Risk Based Capital requirement.
As agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority, this is incorporated in the result above as follows: Own funds: represents Jacksons local US Risk Based available capital less 100 per cent of the US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : Solvency Capital Requirement: represents 150 per cent of Jacksons local US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : and No diversification benefits are taken into account between Jackson and the rest of the Group.
Matching adjustment for UK annuities and volatility adjustment for US dollar denominated Hong Kong with-profits business, based on approvals from the Prudential Regulation Authority and calibrations published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority: and UK transitional measures, which have been recalculated at the valuation date, reducing the estimated Group shareholder surplus from 12.9 billion to 12.5 billion.
The formal Quantitative Reporting Templates Solvency II regulatory templates will include transitional measures without this recalculation.
The Group shareholder Solvency II capital position excludes: A portion of Solvency II surplus capital 1.4 billion at 31 December 2016 relating to the Groups Asian life operations, including due to contract boundaries: The contribution to Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement from ring-fenced with-profits funds in surplus representing 3.7 billion of surplus capital from UK with-profits funds at 31 December 2016 and from the shareholders share of the estate of with-profits funds: and The contribution to Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement from pension funds in surplus.
It also excludes unrealised gains on certain derivative instruments taken out to protect Jackson against declines in long-term interest rates.
At Jacksons request, the Department of Insurance Financial Services renewed its approval to carry these instruments at book value in the local statutory returns for the period 31 December 2016 to 1 October 2017.
At 31 December 2016, this approval had the effect of decreasing local statutory capital and surplus and by extension Solvency II Own Funds and Solvency II surplus by 0.3 billion, net of tax.
This arrangement reflects an elective long-standing practice first put in place in 2009, which can be unwound at Jacksons discretion.
Korea is included in the Solvency II results above, pending local regulatory approval for the sale, which once complete will increase the shareholder Solvency II ratio by around 1 percentage point.

While the surplus position of the UK with-profits funds remains strong on a Solvency II basis, it is ring-fenced from the shareholder balance sheet and is therefore excluded from both the Group and the UK shareholder Solvency II surplus results.

In combining these solvency positions, the contribution to own funds from these ring-fenced funds will be set equal to their aggregate solvency capital requirements, estimated at 6.2 billion ie the solvency surplus in these ring-fenced funds will not be captured in the templates.
There will be no impact on the reported Group Solvency II surplus.

co. uk 07 Additional information II d Reconciliation of expected transfer of value of in-force business VIF and required capital to free surplus The tables below show how the value of in-force business VIF generated by the in-force long-term business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over the next 40 years.
Although a small amount less than 3 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare our 2016 results.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2016, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2016 over the same 40-year period.
In particular, it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the estate.
It also excludes any free surplus emerging after 2056.
Asia operations exclude the cash flows in respect of the held for sale Korea life business.
The above amounts can be reconciled to the new business amounts as follows: 2016 m Asia US UK Total Undiscounted expected free surplus generation for years 2017 to 2056 5,350 2,101 639 8,090 Less: discount effect 2,968 746 259 3,973 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2017 to 2056 2,382 1,355 380 4,117 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2056 292 1 293 Less: Free surplus investment in new business 476 298 129 903 Other items 168 267 16 419 Post-tax EEV new business profit 2,030 790 268 3,088 Other items represent the impact of the time value of options and guarantees on new business, foreign exchange effects and other non-modelled items.
Foreign exchange effects arise as EEV new business profit amounts are translated at average exchange rates and the expected free surplus generation uses year end closing rates.

In order to show the cash flows for UK insurance operations on a comparable basis, the 2015 comparative results for UK insurance operations reflect the impact of the implementation of Solvency II at 1 January 2016 see note 2 for details.
The contribution from the Korea life business has been removed from expected free surplus generation following its reclassification as held for sale.
At 31 December 2016, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years 2017 to 2021 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as those underpinning our 2016 embedded value reporting was 15.8 billion, an increase of 3.3 billion from the 12.5 billion expected over an equivalent period from the end of 2015, after allowing for the effect of the implementation of Solvency II on the opening balance sheet.
This increase primarily reflects the new business written in 2016, which is expected to generate 1,788 million of free surplus over the next five years.
At 31 December 2016, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 64.0 billion, up from the 52.4 billion expected at the end of 2015, after allowing for the effect of the implementation of Solvency II on the opening balance sheet, reflecting the effect of new business written across all three business operations of 8.1 billion and a positive foreign exchange translation effect of 6.8 billion.
These positive effects have been offset by the negative impact of 0.7 billion for the removal of the contribution from the Korea life business following its reclassification as held for sale and a 0.3 billion net effect reflecting operating, market assumption changes and other items.
In Asia, these include the negative impact from movements in long-term interest rates and other regular operating assumption changes.
In the US, these mainly reflect the positive effect of higher future separate account growth due to the increase in interest rates and the impact of an increase in equity market returns in 2016, partially offset by the negative effect from the acceleration of free surplus from the contingent financing of specific US statutory reserves.
In the UK, these mainly arise from the positive effect of higher than assumed investment returns on with-profits funds, partially offset by the negative effect of longevity reinsurance transactions entered into during the year.
The longevity reinsurance transactions executed this year had the effect of accelerating the generation of future free surplus into 2016.
The overall growth in the Groups undiscounted value of free surplus reflects our ability to write both growing and profitable new business.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2016 from life business in-force at the end of 2016 was 4.0 billion including 0.8 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2016 realisation at the end of 2015 of 2.7 billion.

2 Operating profits are determined on the basis of including longer-term investment returns.
EEV and IFRS operating profits are stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns against long-term assumptions, gain on dilution of Groups holdings, the costs arising from the domestication of the Hong Kong business, profit loss attaching to the sale of Japan life and profit loss attaching to the held for sale Korea life business.
Separately on the IFRS basis, operating profit also excludes amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments.
In addition, for EEV basis results, operating profit excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions, the market value movement on core borrowings and in 2012, the gain arising on the acquisition of REALIC.
3 Funds under management comprise funds of the Group held in the statement of financial position and external funds that are managed by Prudential asset management operations.

co. uk 07 Additional information II h Reconciliation between IFRS and EEV shareholders funds The table below shows the reconciliation of EEV shareholders funds and IFRS shareholders funds at the end of the year: 31 Dec 2016 31 Dec 2015 m m EEV shareholders funds 38,968 32,359 note a Less: Value of in-force business of long-term business 24,937 22,431 Deferred acquisition costs assigned zero value for EEV purposes 9,170 7,010 notes b, c Other 8,535 3,983 IFRS shareholders funds 14,666 12,955 Notes a The EEV shareholders funds comprises the present value of the shareholders interest in the value of in-force business, net worth of long-term business operations and IFRS shareholders funds of asset management and other operations.
The value of in-force business reflects the present value of future shareholder cash flows from long-term in-force business which are not captured as shareholders interest on an IFRS basis.
Net worth represents the net assets for EEV reporting purposes that reflect the regulatory basis position, sometimes with adjustments to achieve consistency with the IFRS treatment of certain items.
b Other adjustments represent asset and liability valuation differences between IFRS and the local regulatory reporting basis used to value net worth for long-term insurance operations.
It also includes the mark to market of the Groups core borrowings which are fair valued under EEV but not IFRS.
The most significant valuation differences relate to changes in the valuation of insurance liabilities.
For example, in Jackson where IFRS liabilities are higher than the local regulatory basis as they are principally based on policyholder account balances with a deferred acquisition costs recognised as an asset whereas the local regulatory basis used for EEV is based on future cash flows due to the policyholder on a prudent basis with consideration of an expense allowance as applicable, but with no separate deferred acquisition cost asset.
c The 2016 EEV results for UK insurance operations have been prepared on a basis that reflects the Solvency II regime, effective from 1 January 2016.
The 2015 EEV results for UK insurance operations were prepared on a basis reflecting the Solvency I regime.
As noted in b above, other adjustments represent asset and liability valuation differences between IFRS and the local regulatory basis used to value net worth for long-term insurance operations.
At 31 December 2016 for the UK this would be the difference between IFRS and Solvency II, and at 31 December 2015 the difference between IFRS and Solvency I. II i Reconciliation of APE new business sales to earned premiums The Group reports annual premium equivalent APE new business sales as a measure of the new policies sold in the period.
This differs from the IFRS measure of premiums earned as shown below: 2016 m 2015 m Annual premium equivalents APE as published 6,320 5,466 note a Adjustment to include 100% of single premiums on new business sold in the period 25,057 24,918 Contribution from the held for sale Korea life business 192 305 note b Premiums from in-force business and other adjustments 7,412 5,974 Gross premiums earned 38,981 36,663 Outward reinsurance premiums 2,020 1,157 Earned premiums, net of reinsurance as shown in the IFRS financial statements 36,961 35,506 Notes a APE new business sales only include one-tenth of single premiums, recorded on policies sold in the period.
Gross premiums earned include 100 per cent of such premiums.
b Other adjustments principally include amounts in respect of the following: G ross premiums earned includes premiums from existing in-force business as well as new business.
The most significant amount is recorded in Asia, where a significant portion of regular premium business is written.
Asia in-force premiums form the vast majority of the other adjustment amount: A PE includes new policies written in the period which are classified as investment contracts without discretionary participation features under IFRS 4, arising mainly in Jackson for guaranteed investment contracts and in the UK for certain unit-linked savings and similar contracts.
These are excluded from gross premiums earned and recorded as deposits: A PE new business sales are annualised while gross premiums earned are recorded only when revenues are due: and F or the purpose of reporting APE new business sales, we include the Groups share of amounts sold by the Groups insurance joint ventures.
Under IFRS, joint ventures are equity accounted and so no amounts are included within gross premiums earned.
