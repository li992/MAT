SSEs financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
SSE applies the use of a number of adjusted accounting measures throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements in order to present the underlying performance of the Group to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner.
Further detail on the basis of presentation is included in note 3 to the Financial Statements.
The adjustments made by SSE can be explained as follows: 1 Exceptional Items Exceptional charges or credits are considered unusual by nature or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the underlying performance of the Group to be properly understood.
2 Movements on derivatives certain re-measurements The Group enters into forward contracts to buy or sell electricity, gas and other commodities to meet the future demand requirements of its Energy Supply business or to optimise the value of its Wholesale assets.
Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IAS 39 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IAS 39 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements.
The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.
The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 18 months.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
The re-measurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category also includes income statement movement on financing derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
3 Interest on net pension liabilities IAS 19R The Groups interest charges relating to defined benefit pension schemes are derived from the net liabilities of the schemes as valued under IAS 19R.
This will mean that the charge recognised in any given year will be dependent on the impact of actuarial assumptions such as inflation and discount rates.
To avoid income statement volatility derived from this basis of measurement and reflecting the non-cash nature of these charges, the Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures.
4 Tax and interest on JVs and Associates The Group is required to report profit before interest and tax operating profit including its share of the profit after tax of its equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
However, for internal performance management purposes and for consistency of treatment, SSE reports its adjusted operating profit before its share of the interest and tax on joint ventures and associates.
5 Deferred tax In line with its long standing approach, SSE adjusts for deferred tax when arriving at adjusted profit after tax and its adjusted effective rate of tax.
6 Hybrid capital securities The characteristics of hybrid capital securities mean they qualify for recognition as equity rather than debt under IFRSs.
Consequently, their coupon payments are presented within dividends rather than within interest.
The coupon payments are due to other equity holders and consequently are not included in SSEs EPS measures.
SSE also presents its adjusted net debt measure inclusive of hybrid capital together as one balance.
7 Finance lease SSEs loans and borrowings includes finance lease liabilities primarily in relation to its tolling contract with Marchwood Power Limited.
The Group excludes these liabilities from its adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure to better reflect the Groups funding position.
8 Outstanding liquid funds and other short-term loans Outstanding liquid funds are SSE cash balances held by counterparties as collateral at the year end.
SSE includes these as cash until they are utilised.
Loans with a maturity of less than three months are also included in this adjustment.
