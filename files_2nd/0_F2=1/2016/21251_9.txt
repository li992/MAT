This is calculated as follows: 2016 2015 m m Underlying profit from operations section b and Note 5 89 132 Add: Subordinated debt interest receivable 29 24 Interest receivable on PPP financial assets 21 24 Less: Non-recourse borrowings finance cost 24 19 Underlying profit before tax 115 161 Non-underlying items section b and Note 5 6 10 Statutory profit before tax 109 151 Refer to Note 8 and Note 9. d Underlying earnings per share In line with the Groups measurement of underlying performance, the Group also presents its earnings per share on an underlying continuing basis.
The table below reconciles this to the statutory earnings per share.
Reconciliation from statutory EPS to performance EPS 2016 2015 Pence Pence Statutory earnings loss per ordinary share 3.5 30.1 Less: earnings from discontinued operations 3.5 0.1 Statutory loss per ordinary share from continuing operations 30.2 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 0.9 0.8 Other non-underlying items 6.1 9.7 Underlying earnings loss per ordinary share from continuing operations performance 7.0 19.7 e Revenue including share of joint ventures and associates JVAs The Group uses a revenue measure which is inclusive of its share of revenue generated from its JVAs.
As the Group uses revenue as a measure of the level of activity performed by the Group during the year, the Board believes that including revenue that is earned from its JVAs better reflects the size of the business and the volume of work carried out and more appropriately compares to PFO.
This differs from the statutory measure of revenue which presents Group revenue from its subsidiaries.
A reconciliation of the statutory measure of revenue to the Groups performance measure is shown in the tables in section b.
A comparison of the growth rates in statutory and performance revenue can be found in section i. f Recourse net cash borrowings The Group also measures its performance based on its net cash borrowings position at the period end.
This is analysed using only elements that are recourse to the Group and excludes the liability component of the Companys preference shares, which is debt in nature according to statutory measures, as this is excluded from the definition of net debt in the covenants set out in the Groups facilities.
Non-recourse elements are cash and debt that are ringfenced within certain infrastructure concession project companies.

com AR2016 48 Measuring our performance Providing clarity on the Groups alternative performance measures continued g Average net cash borrowings The Group uses an average net cash borrowings measure as this reflects its financing requirements throughout the period.
The Group calculates its average net cash borrowings based on the average opening and closing figures for each month through the period.
The average net cash borrowings measure excludes non-recourse cash and debt and the liability component of the Companys preference shares, and this performance measure shows average net borrowings of 46 million for 2016.
Using a statutory measure inclusive of non-recourse elements and the liability component of the Companys preference shares gives average net borrowings of 230 million for 2016. h Directors valuation of the Investments portfolio The Group uses a different methodology to assess the value of its Investments portfolio.
As described on pages 30 to 32 the Directors valuation has been undertaken using forecast cash flows for each project based on progress to date and market expectations of future performance.
These cash flows have been discounted using different discount rates depending on project risk and maturity, reflecting secondary market transaction experience.
As such, the Board believes that this measure better reflects the potential returns to the Group from this portfolio.
The Directors have valued the Investments portfolio at 1.2 billion at the year end.
The Directors valuation will differ from the statutory carrying value of these investments, which are accounted for using the relevant standards in accordance with IFRS rather than a discounted cash flow approach.
i Constant exchange rates CER The Group operates across a variety of geographic locations and in its statutory results, the results of its overseas entities are translated into the Groups presentational currency at average rates of exchange for the period.
The Groups key exchange rates applied in deriving its statutory results are shown in Note 3.
To measure changes in the Groups performance compared with the previous period without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Group provides growth rates on a CER basis.
These measures remove the effects of currency movements by retranslating the prior periods figures at the current periods exchange rates, using average rates for revenue and closing rates for order book.
