Introduction to Cairn We are committed to working responsibly as part of our strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders.
This means working in a safe, secure, environmentally and socially responsible manner.
During 2016, we made good progress against our strategic objectives, increasing the recently discovered, significant Senegal resource base and progressing our North Sea developments through to first oil and future cash flow in 2017 and beyond.
