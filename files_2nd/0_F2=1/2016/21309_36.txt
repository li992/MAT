barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 267 Presentation of information Barclays approach to disclosures The Group aims to continually enhance its disclosures and their usefulness to the readers of the financial statements in light of developing market practice and areas of focus.
Consequently Barclays disclosures go beyond the minimum standards required by accounting standards and other regulatory requirements.
Barclays continue to support the recommendations and guidance made by the Enhanced Disclosure Taskforce EDTF.
The EDTF was formed by the Financial Stability Board with a remit to broaden and deepen the risk disclosures of global banks in a number of areas, including liquidity and funding, credit risk and market risk.
Barclays has adopted the recommendations across the Annual Report and Pillar 3 Report.
In line with the Financial Reporting Councils guidance on Clear and Concise reporting.
Barclays has focused reporting on material items and sought to reorganise information to aid users understanding.
It is Barclays view that best in class disclosures will continue to evolve in light of ongoing market and stakeholder engagement with the banking sector.
Barclays is committed to engaging with a published Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure the Code.
The Code sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance which states that UK banks will: provide high quality, meaningful and decision-useful disclosures review and enhance their financial instrument disclosures for key areas of interest assess the applicability and relevance of good practice recommendations to their disclosures acknowledging the importance of such guidance seek to enhance the comparability of financial statement disclosures across the UK banking sector and clearly differentiate in their annual reports between information that is audited and information that is unaudited.
British Bankers Association BBA Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure Barclays has adopted the BBA Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure and has prepared the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts in compliance with the Code.
Statutory Accounts The consolidated accounts of Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries are set out on pages 277 to 281 along with the accounts of Barclays PLC itself on pages 282 to 283.
The accounting policies on pages 284 to 288 and the notes commencing on page 289 apply equally to both sets of accounts unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with The Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS.
On 1 March 2016, Barclays announced its intention to sell down the Groups interest in BAGL.
This sell down is intended to be to a level which will permit deconsolidation from an accounting and regulatory perspective, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals as required.
As the Africa Banking Business meets requirements for presentation as a discontinued operation, these results have been presented as two lines on the face of the Group income statement, representing the profit after tax and non-controlling interest in respect of the discontinued operation.
Capital Requirements Country-by-Country Reporting HM Treasury has transposed the requirements set out under CRD IV and issued the Capital Requirements Country-by-Country Reporting Regulations 2013.
The legislation requires Barclays PLC to publish additional information in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016.

What we have audited The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise: the Consolidated and Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 the Consolidated and Parent Company income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended the Consolidated and Parent Company cash flow statement for the year then ended the Consolidated and Parent Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and applicable law.
Our audit approach Overview Overall Group materiality: 320 million which represents 5% of Barclays Core profit before tax excluding notable items as per the reconciliation on page 260.
Barclays Core profit before tax excluding notable items is a key financial measure disclosed in the Financial Review.
Notable items and Non-Core activities are excluded as they are not a true representation of the underlying performance of the business.
Materiality We planned and scoped our audit for 2016 reflecting the Groups reorganisation in response to the Groups new reporting segments disclosed in Barclays restatement document published in April 2016.
As a result we defined Barclays UK and the Investment Bank, which forms part of Barclays International, Audit scope as significant components of the Group, subject to an audit of their complete financial information.
For the remaining components, including the discontinued operation Africa Banking, we performed audits of specific financial statement line items and accounts based on the financial significance of the component.
The areas of focus for our audit to which we allocated the greatest amount of our resources and effort were: impairment of loans and advances to customers Areas of focus valuation and accounting of financial instruments held at fair value conduct redress costs over PPI litigation and regulatory provisions IT systems and controls over financial reporting and provision for uncertain tax positions.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 275 Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms report Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Barclays PLC In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2016 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in managements report on internal control over financial reporting included in the Directors Report appearing on page 88 of the Annual Report to Shareholders.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board US.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company: ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company: and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
