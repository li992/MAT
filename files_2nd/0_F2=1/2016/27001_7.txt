Strategic Report REGIONAL PERFORMANCE UNITED STATES RevPAR for the US region during 2016 decreased by 4.2% to 86.52 with growth in the newly refurbished regional US hotels being offset by slower performance in the New York properties.
New York New York RevPAR fell by 9.9% as a result of a 4.2% point fall in occupancy and a 5.0% fall in average room rate.
This was driven by an increase in the citys hotel room inventory, the impact from the refurbishment of the east tower of ONE UN New York and the conversion to theatre space of food & beverage and conference areas at Millennium Broadway Hotel New York.
Excluding the impact of refurbishment at ONE UN New York, US and New York RevPAR fell by 1.3% and 5.7% respectively.
Regional US RevPAR for the regional US estate increased by 4.0% to 57.49 reflecting improved revenue performance at the recently refurbished hotels.
