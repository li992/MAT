OVERVIEW TRIG is a leading renewable energy infrastructure company investing in multiple renewable energy technologies, jurisdictions and climate systems.
A Guernsey company, TRIG was launched on the London Stock Exchange through an Initial Public Offering in July 2013, raising 300 million which was invested in an initial portfolio of 18 wholly-owned projects in the UK, France and Ireland.
Since the IPO, the Company has raised more than 520 million through equity issues and increased the portfolio by acquiring a further 35 projects creating a diversified portfolio of 53 onshore wind and solar photovoltaic projects.
TRIG continues to review a broad pipeline of projects with a view to further investment and diversification.
The Company aims to provide investors with attractive long-term returns whilst seeking to preserve the capital value 1 of its investment portfolio through the reinvestment of surplus cash flows and active portfolio management.
With highly experienced Managers TRIG has access to leading resources in specialised investment and operations teams at InfraRed and RES which deploy resources together in the management of TRIG and its portfolio.
Shareholders benefit from a competitive and simple fee structure that is the result of the operating scale of both of the Managers, reflecting their committed, long-term approach to the infrastructure and renewables markets.
1 Achievement of these long-term targets is not guaranteed and may be dependent on a number of factors, not least the reversion of wholesale power prices, after their recent falls, to an expected long-term growth trend at a rate above prevailing inflation.

2 Dividends are paid gross as the Company is registered in Guernsey.
The Company also offers shareholders a scrip dividend alternative to cash dividends as this can be advantageous to certain investors.
3 Based on a theoretical investment at 100p under the current Share Issuance Programme, investors may factor in the possibility of a long-term IRR of in the region of 7% to 9% net of fees and expenses via active management of the investment portfolio and reinvestment of excess cash flows.
In considering the ability of the Company to achieve its long-term objectives, the Investment Manager uses its judgement to assess a number of factors such as the potential for recovery of forecast power prices in the longer term, inflation rates and further movements in discount rates, as well as the potential upside from repowering and or otherwise enhancing the performance or extending the life of projects in the portfolio and from scale efficiencies across an expanding portfolio given the Companys growth strategy.

Diversification Across Regulatory Regimes and Contract Types TRIG aims to invest across multiple energy markets in projects whose revenues are supported by a strong government commitment to renewable energy generation as a key part of their energy mix.
While investments in the UK, France and Ireland form the current portfolio, a number of other markets, including Scandinavia, Benelux and Germany, offer a profile which may be attractive to TRIG.
TRIGs portfolio revenues reflect the different regulatory jurisdictions in which TRIG is invested with revenue sources ranging from contracted feed-in tariffs FITs, Renewables Obligation Certificates ROCs, embedded benefits and a variety of wholesale power purchase agreements PPAs with contracting counterparties which are, for the most part, major utilities.
The chart below illustrates the expected project-level revenues from TRIGs current investment portfolio split by revenue type over time.

Some of these revenues have floor price arrangements.
In the longer term in the absence of further contracting or re-contracting of the revenues, it is anticipated that the majority of revenues will be based on variable market prices although some of these may be contracted based on, for example, season-ahead or month-ahead pricing.
Diversification Across Weather Systems From a meteorological perspective, while short-term volatility is to be expected, wind and solar resources demonstrate a high degree of predictability over the long term.
In addition, TRIGs portfolio demonstrates the benefit of diversity as a result of the geographical spread of the projects and the energy yield performance of solar and wind technologies not being positively correlated.
Given the complexity of wind flows, even within a specific geographical area, energy yield outcomes do vary from location to location and from time to time but these tend to even out over the long-term.
For solar, the key factor driving irradiation levels is latitude, although the precise meteorological conditions prevailing local irradiation intensity, duration and temperature have a bearing on the energy output performance.
Weather risk can be reduced within a portfolio by combining a large number of plants spread over a wide geography and by combining wind and solar.
THE RENEWABLES INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 13 243977 Renewable R&A pp008-pp022 22 02 2017 15:58 Page 14 STRATEGIC REPORT continued With stronger summer solar irradiation counterbalancing the lower typical summer wind speeds versus the winter, the portfolio also has the benefit of a more balanced revenue mix through the year than would be the case for a fund investing only in either wind or solar.
In TRIGs portfolio in a typical year, approximately 70% of the total annual solar production is expected to occur in the six months between April and September against 40% for wind and approximately 30% between October and March against 60% for wind.
TRIG is able to mitigate the risk of miscalculating energy output and therefore mispricing by buying projects with some operating history the portfolio has on average more than 5 years of operating track record as well as by including acquisition price adjustment mechanisms based on yield performance on newer or development projects.
Diversification by counterparty TRIG manages a project portfolio with an array of contractual counterparties, which provides a spread of operational risk by reducing reliance on any one supplier, as well as enabling TRIGs Managers to assess relative performance and seek to deliver best practices across the portfolio.
Key power offtake counterparties include SSE, EDF, Scottish Power, Statkraft and E. ON.
Equipment counterparties include Siemens, Vestas, Canadian Solar and ReneSola among others.
For maintenance, on-site services are provided in particular by RES, Fred.
Olsen group and Akuo Energy, although RES in its role as portfolio-wide Operations Manager works closely with all providers, including smaller ones, to ensure delivery of services are optimised for the benefit of TRIG.
Further details of TRIGs counterparties are set out in section 2.10 below.

During the year, the portfolio produced a total of 1,469 gigawatt hours GWh of electricity, an increase of 9% over the production of 1,344GWh in 2015, reflecting the growth in the portfolios generating capacity.
Actual generation across the year was 9% below budget, of which 7% resulted from lower-than-expected weather resource predominantly lower wind speeds with the remaining 2% mainly relating to uncompensated grid outages, including those noted in the interim results.
Wind speeds in the UK and Ireland were 5% below long term averages for the year, equating to an 8% shortfall in generation for that segment.
In addition, the UK and Ireland wind portfolio suffered a number of grid outages during the year, the most significant at the Taurbeg wind farm, resulting in a 10% shortfall in segment production overall.
Lower winds were also recorded across several of the South of France wind projects causing a 6% shortfall in production against segment budget.
The UK and France solar portfolio ended the year 10% below budget production.
The French portfolio performed slightly above budget whilst the larger UK portfolio suffered from a major grid outage at the Parley site over several summer months as well as some downtime due to capital works performed under warranty.

In January 2016, the Group acquired a significant minority interest in a portfolio of 15 ground-mounted and solar rooftop solar PV projects for 57.2 million 43.7 million.
The vendor was Akuo Energy Group, which was also the original developer of the portfolio.
The transaction comprised the purchase of a 49% interest in the holding company of the portfolio company as well as 100% of a mezzanine loan.
Akuo continues to hold the remaining majority equity stake and to provide the assets with O&M services.
The projects, with a gross capacity of 49 MW, are located in mainland France, Corsica and two overseas departments all operating under French jurisdiction.
Their revenues are wholly derived from French feed-in tariffs.
The portfolio benefits from long term, fixed index-linked power purchase agreements with EDF of up to 20 years.
Deferred consideration for Earlseat wind farm was paid during the year of 1.5 million.
The asset was originally purchased in November 2014 with limited operational history so an adjustment was agreed based upon an updated energy yield assessment once 18 months of operational data was available.

The consideration was 10.6 million 8.9 million and the vendor was Ventures123.
Akuo will continue to own the remaining 49% of the project and will provide O&M services.
As with the other Akuo assets, Midi benefits from a long-term power purchase agreement with EDF, providing fixed, index-linked revenues.
In November 2016, TRIG completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in Freasdail wind farm, a 22.6MW onshore wind project, for 18.5 million.
The project is located on the Kintyre Peninsula in Scotland and has an expected 25-year lifespan.
The project is in an advanced stage of construction and is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2017.
Freasdail wind farm was acquired from RES, TRIGs Operations Manager.
In November 2016, TRIG completed a further investment of 5.9 million 5.0 million into the TRIG Akuo holding company which enabled it to buy out most of the remaining minority investors in the underlying solar portfolio companies.
The additional net capacity owned by TRIG as at 31 December 2016 increased as a result of this further purchase to 710MW.

Being investment entities, The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Limited TRIG UK and The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Investments Limited TRIG UK I, the Companys subsidiaries, through which investments are purchased, are measured at fair value as opposed to being consolidated on a line-by-line basis, meaning their cash, debt and working capital balances are included as an aggregate number in the fair value of investments rather than the Groups current assets.
In order to provide shareholders with more transparency into the Groups capacity for investment, ability to make distributions, operating costs and gearing levels, adjusted results have been reported in the pro forma tables below.
The pro forma tables that follow show the Groups results for the year and the comparative period on a non-statutory Expanded basis, where TRIG UK and TRIG UK I are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, compared to the Statutory IFRS financial statements the Statutory IFRS basis.
The Directors consider the non-statutory Expanded basis to be a more helpful basis for users of the accounts to understand the performance and position of the Company because key balances of the Group including cash and debt balances carried in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I and expenses incurred in TRIG UK are shown in full rather than being netted off.

Analysis of Expanded basis income statement Profit before tax for the year to 31 December 2016 was 67.9 million, generating earnings per share of 8.8p.
The net operating income for 2016 of 87.8 million is significantly greater than the income for the previous year 26.2 million.
This reflects an uplift in the portfolio valuation during the year, as well as the fact that the previous years results are after the adverse impact on the portfolio valuation of the 8 July 2015 UK Summer Budget of 20.2 million which included the removal of the Climate Change Levy exemption for renewably sourced electricity.
Also income has increased versus 2015 partly because the portfolio has increased in size and partly because of a larger valuation gain power price forecasts reduced less in 2016 compared to 2015 and there has been a greater reduction in valuation discount rates in 2016 compared to 2015.
Portfolio value movements which make up operating income are more fully described in Section 2.7 of this Strategic Report.
The increase in expenses in the year ended 31 December 2016 as compared to the previous year reflects the increase in the size of the portfolio.

The strengthening of the euro against sterling during 2016 has increased the value of the euro-denominated assets in TRIGs investment portfolio, with foreign exchange gains recognised in the portfolio of 16.0 million 2015: 3.0 million loss.
This was partially offset by the foreign exchange losses on hedges held outside the portfolio of 7.1 million 2015: 1.9 million gain.
Portfolio value movements included in operating income are more fully described in Section 2.7 of this Strategic Report.
The net foreign exchange gain in the period is hence 8.9 million 2015: 1.1 million loss.
Finance costs relate to the interest and fees incurred relating to the Groups revolving acquisition facility.

A valuation is carried out on a six monthly basis as at 31 December and 30 June each year.
For non-market traded investments being all the investments in the current portfolio, the valuation is based on a discounted cash flow methodology, and adjusted in accordance with the European Venture Capital Associations valuation guidelines where appropriate to comply with IFRS 13 and IAS 39, given the special nature of infrastructure investments.
Where an investment is traded, a market quote is used.
The valuation for each investment reflected in the portfolio valuation is derived from the application of an appropriate discount rate to reflect the perceived risk to the investment's future cash flows to give the present value of those cash flows.
The Investment Manager exercises its judgment in assessing both the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the projects expected life and the financial models produced by each project company and the appropriate discount rate to apply.
This is the same method as applied since the inception of the Company.
The Directors Valuation of the portfolio as at 31 December 2016 was 818.7 million.
This valuation compares to 712.3 million as at 31 December 2015 and 759.5 million as at 30 June 2016.

The VALUATION SENSITIVITIES The Investment Manager has provided sensitivity analysis to show the impact of changes in key assumptions adopted to arrive at the valuation.
For each of the sensitivities, it is assumed that potential changes occur independently of each other with no effect on any other base case assumption, and that the number of investments in the portfolio remains static throughout the model life.
All of the NAV per share sensitivities assume 833.8 million Ordinary Shares as at 31 December 2016 which includes those in issue as well as approximately 0.8 million shares due to be issued in March 2017 as partpayment of the Managers fees.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in key assumptions as follows: Discount rate assumptions The weighted average valuation discount rate applied to calculate the portfolio valuation is 8.4% as at 31 December 2016.
The sensitivity shows the impact on valuation of increasing or decreasing this rate by 0.5%.
Discount rate sensitivity -0.5% Base 8.4% 0.5% Directors valuation 32.0m 818.7m -30.1m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share 3.8p share -3.6p share Energy yield assumptions The table below shows the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in the energy yield applied to cash flows from project companies in the portfolio.
The terms P90, P50 and P10 are explained below.
Energy yield sensitivity P90 10-year Base P50 P10 10-year Directors valuation -80.4m 818.7m 77.8m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -9.6p share 9.3p share The base case assumes a P50 level of output.
The P50 output is the estimated annual amount of electricity generation in MWh that has a 50% probability of being exceeded both in any single year and over the long term and a 50% probability of being under achieved.
Hence the P50 is the expected level of generation over the long term.
The sensitivity illustrates the effect of assuming P90 10-year a downside case and P10 10-year an upside case energy production scenarios.
A P90 10-year downside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 90% probability of being exceeded over a 10 year period.
A P10 10-year upside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 10% probability of being exceeded over a 10 year period.
This means that the portfolio aggregate production outcome for any given 10 year period would be expected to fall somewhere between these P90 and P10 levels with an 80% confidence level, with a 10% probability of it falling below that range of outcomes and a 10% probability of it exceeding that range.
The sensitivity includes the portfolio effect which reduces the variability because of the diversification of the portfolio.
The sensitivity is applied throughout the life of each asset in the portfolio even though this exceeds 10 years in all cases.
Power price assumptions The sensitivity considers a flat 10% movement in power prices for all years, i. e. the effect of adjusting the forecast electricity price assumptions in each of the jurisdictions applicable to the portfolio down by 10% and up by 10% from the base case assumptions for each year throughout the operating life of the portfolio.
Power price sensitivity -10% Base 10% Directors valuation -63.6m 818.7m 64.3m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -7.6p share 7.7p share THE RENEWABLES INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 39 243977 Renewable R&A pp036-pp041 22 02 2017 15:58 Page 40 STRATEGIC REPORT continued Inflation assumptions The projects income streams are principally a mix of subsidies, which are amended each year with inflation, and power prices, which the sensitivity assumes will move with inflation.
The projects management, maintenance and tax expenses typically move with inflation but debt payments are fixed.
This results in the portfolio returns and valuation being positively correlated to inflation.
The portfolio valuation assumes 2.75% p. a. inflation for the UK and 2.0% p. a. for each of France and Ireland.
The sensitivity illustrates the effect of a 0.5% decrease and a 0.5% increase from the assumed annual inflation rates in the financial model for each year throughout the operating life of the portfolio.
Inflation rate sensitivity -0.5% Base 0.5% Directors valuation -39.8m 818.7m 45.0m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -4.8p share 5.4p share Operating costs at project company level The sensitivity shows the effect of a 10% decrease and a 10% increase to the base case for annual operating costs for the portfolio, in each case assuming that the change to the base case for operating costs occurs with effect from 1 January 2017 and that change to the base case remains reflected consistently thereafter during the life of the projects.
Operating cost sensitivity -10% Base 10% Directors valuation 27.9m 818.7m -27.9m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share 3.3p share -3.3p share Euro sterling exchange rates This sensitivity shows the effect of a 10% decrease and a 10% increase in the value of the euro relative to sterling used for the 31 December 2016 valuation based on a 31 December 2016 exchange rate of 1.1709 to 1.
In each case it is assumed that the change in exchange rate occurs from 1 January 2017 and thereafter remains constant at the new level throughout the life of the projects.
As at the year-end, 15% of the portfolio was located in France and Ireland comprising euro-denominated assets.
The Group has entered into forward hedging of the expected euro distributions for the next 18 months and in addition placed further hedges to reach a position where approximately 50% of the valuation of euro-denominated assets is hedged.
The hedge reduces the sensitivity of the portfolio value to foreign exchange movements and accordingly the impact is shown net of the benefit of the foreign exchange hedge in place.
Exchange rate sensitivity -10% Base 10% Directors valuation -5.3m 818.7m 5.3m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -0.6p share 0.6p share The euro sterling exchange rate sensitivity does not attempt to illustrate the indirect influences of currencies on UK power prices which are interrelated with other influences on power prices.
Interest rates applying to project company debt and cash balances This shows the sensitivity of the portfolio valuation to the effects of a reduction of 1% and an increase of 2% in interest rates.
The change is assumed with effect from 1 January 2017 and continues unchanged throughout the life of the assets.
The portfolio is relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates.
This is an advantage of TRIGs approach of favouring long-term structured project financing over shorter term corporate debt which is secured with the substantial majority of this debt having the benefit of long-term interest rate swaps which fix the interest cost to the projects.
Interest rate sensitivity -1% Base 2% Directors valuation 1.9m 818.7m -3.8m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share 0.2p share -0.5p share 40 THE RENEWABLES INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 243977 Renewable R&A pp036-pp041 22 02 2017 15:58 Page 41 Corporation Tax Rate Sensitivity The profits of each project company are subject to corporation tax in their home jurisdictions at the applicable rates the tax rates adopted in the valuation are set out in Note 4 to the financial statements.

TRIGs approach to risk is one of systematic assessment, on an investment project basis on acquisition, and as part of the overall portfolio management over time as external dynamics shift.
The Managers and the Board have considered and reviewed the major risks.
The key event has been the Brexit vote in June 2016, which adds further uncertainty.
It is noted that the outturn of the exit negotiations could lead to a second independence referendum for Scotland, discussed further below, and that the UK government may have a wider range of options when selling energy policy in the future, but with the Climate Change Act expected to provide a positive overall direction for renewables.
No other material changes in the major risks were noted.
This subject is covered under the commentary below on both Electricity Prices and Government Support for Renewables.

The Brexit Vote: The UKs vote on 23 June 2016 to leave the EU has resulted in political and economic uncertainty with consequent market volatility.
The full implications of the Brexit vote are still difficult to assess with the Article 50 leaving negotiations yet to unfold.
The impact of Brexit is already partially addressed under the major risk factors above, although one additional uncertainty is how Brexit may affect Scotland and in particular how any further potential independence initiatives might impact on its currency potentially leaving sterling for the euro materially increasing the Groups currency exposure and on the renewables market, including future new capacity deployment, the treatment of subsidies or the trajectory of power prices.
