Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Annual Report and Accounts 2016 | Severn Trent Plc | 89 Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder The new regulatory period, AMP6, brought with it considerable uncertainty, driven by changes to the regulatory regime which shifted the balance of risk and reward.
New mechanisms were introduced, such as Outcome Delivery Incentives ODIs and total expenditure Totex, giving companies the opportunity to outperform the regulatory allowance, but at the same time creating a risk of underperformance.
I am pleased to report that our executive team has successfully navigated the business through this first year, delivering impressive returns on regulated capital measured by return on regulatory capital value RoRCV and return on regulated equity RoRE.
Furthermore, our service levels have continued to improve, with a strong performance on operational metrics against a backdrop of a 4 reduction in our average household bill in 2015 16.
This performance is, therefore, reected in The Committee determines, on behalf of the payments under our incentive plans during the year.

There is a detailed breakdown of the targets set and the payments under the annual Philip Remnant bonus and long term incentive plan LTIP on pages 96 and 97.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Application of the policy for 2016 17 We operate under the framework approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM and Iset out below a brief overview of how the policy will be applied in the year ahead: Base salaries: An increase of 2% will be applied to base salaries with effect from1 July 2016 in line with the average level of increase for the wider workforce.
Benets and pension: There will be no changes to benets and pensions during2016 17.
Annual bonus: Will continue to be based on the same metrics as for 2015 16 Severn Trent Water STW profit before interest and tax PBIT, STW ODIs, Business Services PBIT, health and safety, and personal objectives.
However, the weighting in respect of health and safety will be increased from 5% to 8% with a consequential reduction in the STW PBIT weighting.
The Committee considers the forward looking targets to be commercially sensitive but full disclosure of the targets and performance outcome will be set out in next years Remuneration Report.
The maximum bonus opportunity remains 120% of salary and 50% of any bonus paid will be deferred inshares for three years.
Long term incentives: Awards worth 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive officer and 100% for the Chief Financial officer will be granted in June 2016 grants worth 125% and 80% of base salary were made in 2015.
The award level for the Managing Director, Wholesale Operations is 80% of base salary.
The increase in award levels for the Chief Executive officer and Chief Financial officer is within our LTIP policy and reects the strong performance of the Company and individuals, their career progression and the higher RoRE stretch target for the 2016 17 awards.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2016 will require average RoRE to equal Ofwats Final Determination 5.65% for 25% of the award to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting for outperforming the Final Determination by 1.39 times 7.85%.
The Committee considers that the 1.39 times Final Determination RoRE stretch target is challenging because it would require very significant outperformance on ODIs, Financing and Totex efficiencies: it is signicantly ahead of the current market consensus: and 1.39 times Final Determination would be almost three times the level of outperformance achieved on average, had RoRE applied over AMP5 1.14 times Final Determination.

This reects the Chairmans strong performance, the fact that the lastreview was in April 2014 and the desire to move closer to the median of the FTSE 51-150.
Structure of the report This letter and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2016 AGM.
There is no vote on the Policy Report this year.
The Policy Report, set out for reference on the following pages, reects the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2015 supported by 98% of votes cast.
It is currently intended that this policy will continue to apply until the 2018 AGM when it will be subject to approval again by shareholders as required under the regulations.
I hope that you remain supportive of our Remuneration Policy and will approve the resolution on the Annual Report on Remuneration at the AGM.

Annual bonus The Committee may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus to a departing Executive Director, subject to performance and pro-rated to reect the proportion of the year worked.
The bonus would be paid at the same time as for the other Directors and, if the Executive Director has left employment by that date, it may be paid solely in cash.
Any outstanding deferred bonus shares will vest on cessation of employment unless the departure is a result of summary dismissal.
LTIP & legacy SMP The default treatment is that all awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an Executive Director will be considered a good leaver in certain prescribed circumstances or by the discretion of the Committee.
If an Executive Director is a good leaver, the award will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date, subject to performance and time pro-rating as set outbelow.
The Committee also has the discretion to determine that the awards for a good leaver should vest early e. g. on cessation of employment subject to performance with time pro-rating as set out below.

For the recruitment awards granted on appointment to Liv Gareld, James Bowling and Emma FitzGerald, notime pro-rata reduction will be applied in a good leaver situation.
This is in recognition of the fact that the expected value of the forfeited awards from their previous employment was signicantly higher in each case with much of it being non-performance related and which would not have been scaled back for a similar event.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.

Annual bonuses and long term incentives will be awarded in line with the maximum limits outlined in the policy on page 92.
Participation in the bonus plan will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make additional cash and or share based awards if deferred pay is forfeited by an Executive Director on leaving a previous employer.
Such awards would take into account the nature of awards forfeited i. e. cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and any performance conditions.
Awards would typically be made under the terms of the LTIP or under the exemptions permitted under the Listing Rules.
Non-performance related payments unrelated to the forfeiture of awards, i. e. golden hellos, will not be made.
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses and other incidental expenses as appropriate.

Key objectives for Liv Gareld Chief Executive officer related to growth and further improving the financial strength of the business, customer experience and organisational effectiveness.
Activities included education and engagement sessions for all employees on delivering outcomes for customers and end to end process reviews in operational areas, which has contributed towards 95% of operational measures being stable or improved, ODI outperformance, net reward of 23.2 million and a reduction in customer complaints, down 28% year on year.
We have been recognised by the Environment Agency as being a leader on environmental performance and we have delivered 8.4% RoRE which was in the upper range of Ofwat expectations.
In addition, the business has been strengthened by the Water Plus joint venture established with United Utilities to deliver a market leading non-household retail offer when the market opens in 2017.
As a result, the Remuneration Committee decided to award Liv Gareld a personal performance bonus at 85% of the maximum.
The objectives for James Bowling Chief Financial officer related to the delivery of the finance strategy and plans, including rebalancing xed and oating debt and creating procurement savings.
Delivering on our finance strategy, active treasury management initiatives were undertaken during the year to rebalance the debt portfolio and lower index linked debt costs.
This has helped deliver a 31.4 million reduction in net finance costs excluding pensions year on year and led to an effective finance cost of 4.5%, down from 5.4%.
In addition, bad debt charges decreased from 1.8%of turnover to 1.5% as a result of improved collection performance on amounts billed in the year and better management of aged debt balances.
Procurement savings have contributed to wholesale Totex of 1,017 million, 38 million lower than the Final Determination.
Power costs have reduced by 2.1 million and we continue to make good progress on renewable energy, generating 33% of our energy needs through the renewables programme and on track for 50% by 2020.
As a result, the Remuneration Committee decided to award James Bowling a personal performance bonus at 70% of the maximum.
5% of the 2015 16 bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors related to health and safety performance targets as per the annual bonus outturn table on page 96, which were not achieved.
Therefore the proportion of annual bonus weighting against this objective for 2016 17 has been increased from 5% to 8% with a consequential reduction in the STW PBIT target 47% and more challenging targets set.
The bonuses awarded for 2015 16 were 105.8% of base salary for Liv Gareld 702,142 and 104.0% of base salary for James Bowling 416,000 out of a maximum bonus opportunity of 120% of salary for both Directors.
Bonuses are paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares deferred for three years.
The deferred shares will be granted in June 2016.
The deferred shares are not subject to any further performance conditions.

The awards are subject to an RoRCV performance condition measured over three financial years.
Average RoRCV is compared with the baseline gure set out in the Ofwat Final Determination.
0% of each award vests if average RoRCV equals that set in the Final Determination, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% vesting for 1.02 times Final Determination and 100% vesting for 1.07 times Final Determination.
Ofwat are no longer publishing a baseline RoRCV gure in AMP6.
This impacts the third measurement year of the 2013 LTIP award.
Therefore, we have calculated the equivalent baseline gure using the component numbers set out in the Ofwat Final Determination for AMP6.
To ensure consistency between this equivalent baseline and RoRCV, the baseline gure was adjusted to take into account the impact of expected income to be received under Pay As You Go which dictates what portion of total expenditure is directly passed through into customers bills which is how operating expenditure was historically treated, and what is added to STWs asset base which is how capital expenditure was historically treated.
This gives a baseline gure of 3.49% for 2015 16.
The Committee considered the level of RoRCV outperformance of the Ofwat Final Determination for the 2013 LTIP.
In order to derive a comparable measure of RoRCV for the final year of the 2013 LTIP, the Committee decided, to ensure comparability with the equivalent baseline, that instead of using outturn Opex and Infrastructure Renewals Expenditure IRE as adopted in the last two years of AMP5 it was more appropriate to multiply the actual total expenditure for 2015 16 by the Pay as You Go ratio from the Final Determination.
This had the effect of reducing the level of outperformance for 2015 16.
Taking this into account, the average RoRCV over the three years ending in 2015 16 reduced from 1.28 times the RoRCV baseline to 1.23 times, resulting in 100% vesting.
The level of vesting was considered appropriate given the Companys strong financial and operational performance over the performance period.

Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Annual Report and Accounts 2016 | Severn Trent Plc | 101 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards for 2016 will be 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive officer, 100% for the Chief Financial officer and 80% for the Managing Director, Wholesale Operations and will be made in June 2016.
Grants worth 125% and 80% of salary were made to the Chief Executive officer and the Chief Financial officer last year.
The increase in award levels for the Chief Executive officer and Chief Financial officer is within our current LTIP policy and reects the strong performance of the Company and individuals, their career progression and the higher RoRE stretch target for the 2016 awards.
The Committee was also aware that the previous award levels were signicantly below the market median of 200% of salary in the FTSE 51-150, the Companys current benchmark.
When considering the appropriate award levels the Committee has taken into account the overall competitiveness of the reward packages.
The awards will be based on return on regulatory equity RoRE over the three year period to 31 March 2019.
Our three year average RoRE performance will be compared with the baseline RoRE gure set by Ofwat in our Final Determination.
25% of the award will vest if average RoRE matches the baseline gure of 5.65%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for outperforming the baseline by 1.39 times equivalent to 7.85%.
This represents an increase to the stretch target from 1.29 times the Final Determination used for the 2015 awards.
The target range has been set taking into account internal and external forecasts.
The stretch target 1.39 times Final Determination requires very significant outperformance on ODIs, Financing and Totex efficiencies and is signicantly ahead of the current market consensus.
1.39 times Final Determination is equivalent to almost three times the level of outperformance achieved on average had RoRE applied over AMP5 1.14times Final Determination.
Appointment to the Board of Emma FitzGerald Emma FitzGerald, Managing Director, Wholesale Operations, was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2016.

The Chairmans fee increase reects his strong performance, the fact that the last review was inApril 2014, andthe desire to move closer to the median of the FTSE 51-150.
The current fee levels are set out in the table below: Fees Chairmans fee 275,000 Base fee paid to all Non-Executive Directors 52,400 Supplementary fees: Senior Independent Director 10,000 Audit Committee Chairman 15,000 Remuneration Committee Chairman 15,000 Corporate Responsibility Committee Chairman 13,000 The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors normally serve for terms of three years.
