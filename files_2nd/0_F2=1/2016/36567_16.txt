The subsidiary undertakings of the Group in the year are listed in note 19 to the financial statements.
Business review The Groups focus is on UK and Continental European industrial investments which in the opinion of the Board have high income yields compared to relatively low financing costs.
To date these investments have been in the UK, Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
A smaller part of the Groups activity is dedicated to opportunistic property investment opportunities which to date have included land and residential investments.
More detailed information about the Groups business, activities and financial performance is incorporated into this report by reference and can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 23.

Hansteen Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 53 Directors report continued Post balance sheet events A second dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016 of 3.7p per share will be payable on 18 May 2017 to shareholders on the register on 21 April 2017.
Based on the number of shares in issue at 31 December 2016 this will result in a distribution of 27.5 million.
On 22 February 2017 the Board made an offer for the entire issued ordinary share capital of Industrial Multi Property Trust PLC IMPT.
Under the terms of the offer, IMPT shareholders will receive 300p in cash for each IMPT share held which values the entire issued ordinary share capital of IMPT at 25.2 million.
Hansteen has since acquired, as disclosed on 17 March 2017, 21.71% of IMPTs share capital and at the first close for the offer on 15 March 2017 had received valid acceptances of 28.44%, which in aggregate represent 50.15% of IMPTs share capital.
As stated in the Chairmans Review, we announced that contracts have been exchanged on terms for the sale of Hansteens German and Dutch portfolios.
More details are contained in the RNS announcement and a circular will be posted to shareholders shortly.
Financial instruments and risk management The Board agrees and reviews policies and financial instruments for risk management.
Further information on financial instruments is contained innote 36 to the financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed are detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 22 and 23.
Going concern and future developments The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position as well as the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and the borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 23.
In addition, note 36 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups debt maturity profile for its long-term funding is detailed in the Strategic Report on page 18.
None of the Groups significant current bank loan facilities are due to expire within the next 12 months.
As part of its risk management process the Group has considered its forecast cash flows and forecast covenant compliance taking into account: the impact on the various loan covenants of reductions in the property valuations, decline in rental income and increase in interest rates: and the impact of potential events arising from adverse movements in general economic conditions on the Groups operating cash flow generation, including tenancy failures and increased vacancies.
These forecasts show that the Group has sufficient headroom and available finance to manage its business risks successfully.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Long-term Viability Statement In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Code, and in light of the Groups current position and the principal risks detailed on pages 22 and 23, the Directors have assessed the Groups prospects and viability.
The Directors assessment is over a three-year period to December 2019 in line with the typical lease lengths of its tenants.
The review is based on a detailed three-year forecast, taking into account financial and operating positions, forecast cash flows, debt maturity and renewal prospects, forecast covenant compliance and REIT compliance along with current and available mitigating actions.
The financial model has been stress tested for severe but plausible scenarios, both individually and in aggregate, specifically to understand the impact of reductions in property valuations, declines in rental income and therefore operating profit and increases in interest rates along with current and available mitigating actions.
The stress tests enable the Group to model the impact of a variety of external and internal events that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and allow the Board to assess the effectiveness of any management actions that may be required to mitigate the impacts of the events.
The nature of the Groups business as the owner and asset manager of a diverse high-yielding portfolio of industrial property principally located in three different countries let to a wide variety of tenants reduces the impact of adverse changes in the general economic environment or market conditions in any one sector or country on the overall Group.
The Groups property portfolio comprises predominantly light industrial units.
These are the most simple, flexible and economical of all commercialproperty types and have shown themselves to be extraordinarily adaptable to changing working practices and new occupational trends.
Furthermore, in the main the properties are valued at substantially below replacement cost and let at rents below the levels necessary tojustify new builds.
Taken together these factors operate to limit the supply of new stock and help to maintain the demand for the existing stock.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities asthey fall due over the three-year period of their detailed assessment.

Quantification and reporting methodology We have followed the 2013 UK Government environmental reporting guidance.
DEFRA greenhouse gas conversion factors have been used for the purposes of this report.
We have used the operational control approach, which therefore only includes information regarding those emissions for which we have direct control and influence on.
We have therefore included carbon emissions derived from gas, electricity, heating oil and district heating consumptions attributable to Hansteen.
Energy consumption is assessed as attributable to Hansteen if it is used for the benefit of vacant property space or for common parts or communal facilities at properties which are held directly or managed by Hansteen.

Base year We have used 2013 as our base year as it is the first year for which we have reliable data and it was typical in respect of our operations.
Intensity measurement 2 2 We have chosen the metric gross global Scope 1 and 2 emissions in tonnes of CO e per vacant m, per m and per m revenue as these are 2 common metrics for our industry sector.
