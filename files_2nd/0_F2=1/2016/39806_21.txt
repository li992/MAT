SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 98 Governance Remuneration Policy The key aim of the Remuneration Policy is to align the interests of Executive Directors with those of the shareholders by supporting the delivery of strategy.
The structure of the remuneration framework is designed to reflect the strategic direction of the business and to align it with the Companys KPIs.
In setting the Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into consideration, amongst other matters, investor guidelines and the maximum amount of remuneration the Executive Directors could receive should all targets be met.
The Executive Directors remuneration is set within a remuneration framework which applies to all employees across the Group.
Each of the key elements of the remuneration package is designed to drive the creation of long-term shareholder value, without encouraging Executive Directors to take inappropriate risk.
Each year, with the support of external advisers, the Committee undertakes a review of the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
It has oversight of the remuneration of the Leadership Team, who are the senior managers immediately below Board level.
It considers the responsibilities, experience and performance of the Executive Directors and pay across the Group.
Changes to the Policy since approval at the 2014 AGM are outlined in the Chairmans letter on pages 85 and 86 and are detailed in the table below.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, this policy will be effective for the 2017 performance year and will apply to incentive awards with performance periods beginning on 1 January 2017.

Additional notes Remuneration Policy: the policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the pay and benefits for employees across the Group.
All employees are eligible for an annual Bonus on the same performance measures which are consistent with those of the Executive Directors save that those below Board level have a fourth target based on their individual performance score.
The maximum Bonus opportunity is fixed according to seniority banding across the Company.
The LTIP performance conditions are the same for all participants and the size of awards are determined by seniority.
Subject to consultation with major shareholders, the Committee retains the ability to adjust and or to set different LTIP and Bonus performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or divestment of a Group business, or change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Payments from existing awards: Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy.

Governance 101 Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements Policy on recruitment In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the proportion of the vesting period remaining, and will seek to do no more than match the fair value of awards foregone.
In limited circumstances where employees are awarded benefits for which Executive Directors are not eligible, such as share retention awards, the Committee would consider honouring existing awards should these employees be appointed to the Board.
Chart 4: Recruitment policy Component Approach Maximum opportunity Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined taking into account the experience and skills of the individual, pay across the Group, relevant market data and their previous salary Bonus The structure set out in the Remuneration Policy table will apply to new appointees 150 per cent of salary with the relevant maximum being pro-rated for their first year of employment DSBP The structure set out in the Remuneration Policy table will apply to new appointees 50 per cent of the bonus awarded will be deferred LTIP New appointees will be eligible for awards under the LTIP on the same terms as the 200 per cent of salary other Executive Directors 300 per cent in exceptional circumstances Pension New appointees will be offered membership of the SEGRO plc Group Personal 20 per cent of salary Pension Plan or a cash alternative.
Policy on termination payments The Company retains the right to terminate the service contract of any Executive Director subject to contractually agreed payments in lieu of notice which are limited to annual salary plus any specified benefits.
Payments are normally phased over the 12-month notice period, based on the principle of a Directors duty to seek alternative employment and thereby mitigate their loss.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith, for example: in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors office or employment.
In determining compensation, the Committee will take into account the circumstances of the departure, best practice and the provisions of the Code, and will take legal advice on the Companys liability to pay compensation.
Under the rules of the LTIP and the DSBP, the Committee has discretion to declare a Director leaving the Company to be a good leaver as defined under the respective rules of the schemes.
In respect of LTIP, this would normally allow the Directors, who the Committee determines to be good leavers, to receive their shares at the end of the holding period, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, with any vesting pro-rated in accordance with the proportion of the vesting period served.
In respect of DSBP, this would normally allow the Directors, who the Committee determines to be good leavers, to receive their shares, in full, at the end of the holding period.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of their statutory employment rights or any other claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Company will be entitled to negotiate settlement terms financial or otherwise with the Director that the Committee considers to be reasonable in all the circumstances and in the best interests of the Company and to enter into a Settlement Agreement with the Director to effect both the terms agreed under the Service Agreement and any additional statutory or other claims, including bonus and or share awards, in line with the policies described above.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Employee Benefit Trust, in consultation with the Company, has the discretion to determine whether, and the extent to which, awards vest.
Financial performance and institutional guidelines would be taken into account in exercising this discretion.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on termination of their appointment.
Policy on Executive Directors external appointments With the support of the Chairman and Chief Executive, the Executive Directors may normally be permitted to take one non-executive directorship outside the Group, as these roles can broaden the experience brought to the Board.
Such appointments require Board approval and the time commitment the appointment will require is taken into consideration.
Executive Directors may retain fees for external appointments.

In 2016, it consulted with shareholders on changes to the Policy covered in the Chairmans letter.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is available for meetings with shareholders should they have any concerns about remuneration matters which they wish to discuss.
