We have also SSE is committed to delivering value for customers successfully taken forward our planned disposal and creating and sustaining long-term value for of over 1bn of non-core assets to support shareholders.
Its first financial objective is to deliver future growth.
Our performance has reaffirmed annual dividend increases that at least keep pace with that SSE is right to maintain its consistent and inflation, while ensuring that the dividend is covered long-term strategic framework against a volatile by adjusted EPS at a level that is sustainable over time.
An increase in the dividend per share to 89.4p demonstrates that in a challenging year SSE has Given the challenging operating environment, delivered to shareholders what it said it would.
how sure are you that SSEs divided commitment can be met in the future?
Annual increases in the dividend, so that it at least keeps pace with RPI inflation, is SSEs financial objective and its strategic framework is built towards achieving that aim.
Despite the general uncertainties in a sector like energy SSE is aiming for a return to growth and adjusted earnings per share of at least 120 pence in 2016 17 and to deliver a full-year dividend that at least keeps pace with RPI inflation in 2016 17.
What factors will affect SSEs financial performance in the next three years?
Whilst the mist has cleared in some areas, there remains regulatory uncertainties affecting all three business segments.
This, alongside commodity prices and macro-economic risks means there are plenty of challenges.
Nevertheless, as a result of our investment over the last five years, the majority of our asset base and profit now relates to  Networks and government-mandated renewable sources of energy.
Over the three years to 2018 19 we expect dividend cover could range from around 1.2 times to around 1.4 times, based on dividend increase that at least keep pace with RPI inflation.
