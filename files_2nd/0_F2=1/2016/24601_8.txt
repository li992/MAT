The survey tracks our employees sense of belonging, discretionary effort, ENGAGEMENT personal motivation and job satisfaction.
Hays is a cyclical business and constantly exposed to the prevailing economic climate.
It is therefore essential that we maintain engagement to ensure retention and productivity.
Despite the amount of change that employees have experienced since 2009 for instance with new systems and ways of working, as well as fast changing economic environments, continued high levels of individual engagement and performance have enabled Hays to outperform our competitors and retain our position as the market leader in specialist recruitment services.
Employee engagement is a key performance indicator which measures our success in attracting, training and developing people.
Therefore a primary objective for Hays has been to sustain this high level of engagement across all regions a challenge that has spawned a multitude of approaches to achieving ongoing employee commitment and driving performance.
Results In 2016 our global engagement score was 83% and employee participation in the annual TALKback survey was 84%, which is an excellent response rate for an international support services business.
There is a clear focus on culture, quality of leadership and reward.
