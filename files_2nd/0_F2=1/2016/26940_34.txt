5 As disclosed in the Prospectus, the Executive Directors received a higher variable reward for 2015 in the form of Share Awards in recognition of their significant contribution to the successful private placement and admission of Metro Bank to the London Stock Exchange, as well as their overall performance in 2015.
No other normal annual variable reward for the 2015 performance year was awarded to these individuals.
The Listing Share Awards were subject to continued employment and Admission occurring and were granted to the Executive Directors in March 2016 hence they were not included in note 10 to the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 but referenced in note 37 and in the Prospectus.
Further details are included in the share interests table.
No further performance conditions apply to vesting.
To date 20% of the award has vested March 2016 and the remaining 80% will vest annually on 30 April, 16% each year.
