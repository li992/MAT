OUR BUSINESS MODEL We drive organic growth by sectorising and sub-sectorising our business.
This approach differentiates us, and allows us to get closer to our customers to create an innovative and bespoke offer that meets their needs.
Organic growth is occasionally supplemented with small and medium sized acquisitions where they add capability or scale in our existing markets.
We focus on operational execution and generate efficiencies by optimising our supply chain and managing our food and OUR PEOPLE labour costs.
These efficiencies enable us to reinvest in the significant growth opportunities around the Group and improve margins.
Our organic revenue growth, the scale it creates and our focus on costs and efficiencies give us a competitive advantage.
We can provide our clients and consumers the best value in terms of quality and cost and this, combined with sectorisation, helps drive organic revenue growth.
At the centre of it all are our people.
They win new business, manage our units efficiently and effectively and bring innovative and high quality food and services to our clients.
