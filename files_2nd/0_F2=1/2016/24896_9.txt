12 | HomeServe plc Strategic report Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Chief Executives review Operational performance We continue to have strong relationships with our partners and we are pleased to confirm that during the year we renewed six of our utility partnerships on similar commercial terms.
We proactively engage our partners in developing successful marketing campaigns, with an increasing number of new customers referred to us through our partners call centres.
During October, we signed a five year agreement for Aviva to underwrite our home assistance products and we are also developing a home assistance offering for Avivas UK customers.
Customer numbers increased 3% from 2.1m to 2.2m principally reflecting a good marketing performance combined with 0.1m customers added through the acquisition of Home Energy Services Limited.
Leading with our comprehensive water product, we acquired 0.4m gross new customers FY15: 0.3m, the majority of which were acquired through direct mail as this continues to perform well.
We continue to see customers buying multiple policies through our digital channels and have also seen strong momentum in our partner channels, doubling the number of new customers acquired through this channel.
As expected, retention has reduced slightly as the number of year one customers, who typically have lower renewal rates, has increased.
Importantly we continue to see strong retention rates for customers who have been with us for more than a year.
In this case, the retention rate for customers in years two and beyond was 87% in FY16 FY15: 85%.
In light of the increased number of new customers in FY16, we expect the blended retention rate will reduce slightly in FY17 with year end customer numbers of around 2.2m.
During the year we acquired a gas services business, Home Energy Services Limited, for net cash outflow of 3.2m in the year.
This business, based in Nottingham, combined with our existing network, significantly increases our gas delivery capability and serves as a platform for further development.
HomeServe plc | 13 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report United Kingdom continued Delivering good customer service is central to our business and during the year we enhanced the claims experience, enabling more digital interaction, while also investing in our engineer network.
We now have over 700 directly employed engineers, up from 444 last year.
Our customers continue to benefit from the comprehensive levels of cover in our products and this year we completed 0.8m repairs, 0.1m more than last year.
We see good levels of satisfaction, as indicated informally on Reevoo and Trust Pilot where our scores are currently 93% and 8.3 respectively FY15: 94% and 8.2 respectively.
We invested in business development and innovation building good momentum and prospects as we enter FY17.
We now have a pipeline of partner opportunities with a mix of utilities and non utilities, some with small policy books.
Signing new partners along with the opportunity to acquire small policy books will be an important factor in enabling the UK business to grow further in the future.
We have developed and tested a water leak detector which can identify water leaks with functionality to automatically notify the homeowner, enabling them to then book a repair with us.
The product will be available through certain partnerships during FY17.
We continue to evolve our smart home plans and while still small in scale, we have developed a franchised heating installation network which we expect to extend in FY17.
Financial performance Revenue in the year was 2% higher than the prior year at 291.8m FY15: 285.5m principally reflecting a small increase in policy income, the acquisition of Home Energy Serves Limited and repair network revenue.
Revenue in the UK business is analysed as policy income of 200.2m FY15: 198.3m, which included post acquisition income from Home Energy Services Limited 4.2m, repair network revenue of 81.0m FY15: 76.8m and other income of 10.6m FY15: 10.4m.
Other income relates to revenue in respect of pay on use repairs, third party claims handling services and transactions with other Group companies.
The increase in repair network revenue again reflects the increase in the number of repair jobs completed in the year.
Income per customer was 94 FY15: 93 with a 7 increase in income from our Year 2 customers to 125 FY15: 118 reflecting price initiatives and increasing levels of cover taken by customers, which was, in part offset by the higher proportion of new customers who typically join on an introductory offer.
Going forward, we expect net income per customer to increase as we see the benefits of more targeted customer engagement following implementation of the new Pega Customer Management System.
Adjusted operating costs were 233.8m FY15: 229.1m, 2% higher than prior year, with indirect cost savings more than offset by an increase in direct costs due to higher volumes of activity and post acquisition costs from Home Energy Services Limited.
Adjusted operating profit was 58.0m, 3% higher than the prior year FY15: 56.4m resulting in a sustainable 20% profit margin.
