Strategic Report ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 PARTNER NETWORK The Group has well established relationships with the most prestigious academic research institutions across the United States.
Allied Minds aims to gain direct access to technologies at the forefront of research by working to deepen our relationships with selected institutions and selectively adding highly regarded research centres across the US.
The Group continues to expand its relationships with US government laboratories and other federal funded research and development centers FFRDCs, with the objective of commercialising select technological inventions developed in the corresponding US federal government laboratory.
In particular, Allied Minds has formalised new technology commercialisation agreements with leading FFRDCs such as the Aerospace Corporation and the MITRE Corporation.
In addition we have added a third leg to our origination platform in the form of corporate partnerships.
This began with the formation of our ABLS partnership with BMS, and has continued with our strategic alliance with GE Ventures formed in September 2016.
We continue to actively explore additional sources of world-class technology innovation.
During the year Allied Minds engaged with nearly 50 new research institutions, bringing the total US universities and federal laboratories in the Allied Minds partner network to 207.
The investment team reviewed more than 2,700 new technologies developed by the partner network, and following extensive due diligence on over 20 of the most promising, formed and funded four new businesses, resulting in a total Group portfolio of 17 subsidiary businesses following the closure of ABLS I, Vatic Materials and the Discontinued Subsidiaries postperiod end, and executed options to license three additional technologies.
