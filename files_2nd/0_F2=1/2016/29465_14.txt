Strategic Report Financial overview and performance The Weather Assessing the impact Weather in 2015 16 of the weather on SSEs businesses The operational performance and financial results of SSEs principal 7% businesses are each affected by the weather because of its impact Above the 1981-2010 on production of energy from renewable sources Wholesale : its average rainfall impact on electricity transmission and distribution lines Networks : and its impact on the amount of gas and electricity used by customers Retail.
Rainfall It is the role of SSEs dedicated meteorologist Therefore, the weather has a direct impact to monitor and understand the weather on SSEs performance against its core Directly affects hydroelectric patterns and conduct forecasts for temperature, purpose of providing the energy people generation in the north and rainfall and wind.
This allows SSE to: need in a reliable and sustainable way.

Above or below average temperatures can significantly impact total demand for energy.
2015 16 was marginally cooler than 2014 15 and 0.4C warmer than the average over 1981-2010.
Customer consumption volumes were reduced.
On a weather-corrected basis, and acknowledging the impacts from improvements in household energy efficiency, consumption of gas fell by 2.7% and electricity fell by 2.1% compared to the previous year.

Wind Optimum speeds drive generation but excess can limit capacity and damage networks.
GB wind speeds in 2015 16 were very close to the average over 2000 to 2010 and overall the year was 0.4 knots windier than 2014 15.
This contributed to an increase of over 1GW 7% of renewable energy output from SSEs onshore and offshore wind farms than in Above the 1981-2010 the previous year.
average rainfall 1GW Extra renewable generation in 2015 16 0.4 knots Above the GB wind average in 2014 15 0 0.4 C Above the 1981-2010 average temperature The 30 year interval 1981 2010 is a common benchmark based on the recommendations of the International Meteorological Conference.
A 30 year interval is sufficiently long to filter out many of the short-term fluctuations and anomalies, but sufficiently short so as to be used to reflect longer term climatic trends.
