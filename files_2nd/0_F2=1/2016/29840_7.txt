Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Members 2016 2015 Residential Club 568,986 551,322 Business Club 29,627 30,191 TOTAL CLUB 598,613 581,513 Whilst we continue to regard our Business Club as an exciting long-term opportunity, the dynamics of this market make it extremely difficult to grow in the current energy wholesale pricing environment.
Our focus will therefore remain on the domestic market, until market conditions become more favourable.
Within the residential Club, there is a significant difference in average expected customer lifetimes between Members and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate, depending on whether they are an owner-occupier, and on the number of services we are providing to them.
The most attractive category, with a calculated expected average lifetime of around 25 years, are owneroccupiers taking our Double Gold bundle.
Our focus on attracting this type of Member has been reflected in an increasing proportion of new Members switching all their services to us landline, broadband, mobile, electricity and or gas over the last two years as can be seen from the figures below: PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEMBERS TAKING DOUBLE GOLD BUNDLE In March 2015 we made it more attractive for owner-occupiers to take this bundle from us by introducing a range of additional benefits and a new two-year fixed energy tariff.
The subsequent step change in the second half of FY16 reflects the national launch of Project Daffodil, our free LED replacement light bulb service.

As a result, we are very pleased to have seen a further increase to around 55% in the proportion of new Members gathered by our Partners who are now taking our Double Gold bundle.
Within our membership base churn has increased slightly compared with last year.
This is best illustrated by the level of individual energy supply point churn, which has risen to an average of around 1.1% per month, driven by higher levels of switching throughout the energy market, and reflecting the record gap between the introductory fixed price deals available from other suppliers and the range of tariffs we offer.
Whilst never pleasing to see churn levels rising, the proportion of energy customers leaving us remains below the industry average: ENERGY SUPPLY POINT CHURN 16 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 FY11 16.3% FY12 13.3% FY13 11.2% FY14 10.4% FY15 11.2% FY16 13.1% Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Average revenue per Member has fallen slightly for a third consecutive year, as the combined impact of falling average energy consumption and lower retail energy tariffs outweighed the benefit from the higher penetration of communications services particularly mobile that we are now seeing: AVERAGE REVENUE PER MEMBER These revenue figures relate solely to our Customer Management operating segment, the figures for 2008 to 2014 inclusive are restated as detailed in the 2015 Annual Report Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 17 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 190 286 316 329 459 482 505 634 801 819 1,064 1,149 1,137 1,186 1,359 1,304 1,279 1,226 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Services The full range of services we offer includes landline telephony calls and line rental, broadband, mobile, gas, electricity, and our CashBack card.
At the year end, we supplied a total of 2,181,704 services to Club Members 2015: 2,093,447, an increase of 4.2% during the year.

This increase means that penetration of mobile within our residential Club has now reached almost 30%, a substantial increase from less than 13% just six years earlier, and the direct result of a strategic decision to place mobile at the heart of our retail proposition.
We improved the competitiveness of our mobile service by launching a new range of price plans in January 2016, and anticipate making 4G available to our Members this autumn which should provide a further boost to the number of mobile services we provide.
CashBack Our exclusive CashBack card has proven an important Member acquisition and retention tool.
It gives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly bill from us.
Since launching the programme, the total value of CashBack credited to Members now exceeds 28m.
We have seen a 7% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 179,639 2015: 167,434, with around 50% of new residential Club Members gathered directly by our Partners applying for a card.
We believe this continuing strong demand demonstrates the attractiveness of this unique membership benefit, and would be even higher were it not for the difficulties faced by some new Members in funding the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in advance with our prepayment card.
18 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements CashBack earned by our Members using our online shopping portal has increased further, with retail spend now running at over 1m each month.
We continue to develop ways to make it easier for our Members to earn CashBack: we introduced a wizard that automatically notifies Members that CashBack is available when they visit one of our online retail partners, and our new mobile app helps them locate all the nearby retail outlets where they can earn CashBack with their CashBack card.
The CashBack that we pay to our Members each month is funded entirely by the retailers in the programme, and many Members achieve a reduction of 20% to 30% on the amount they pay for their utilities simply by using their CashBack card instead of an alternative payment card for most of their regular household shopping, and or our online shopping portal.
Member Service and Support We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single support centre based in the UK.
We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members: we readily invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects of our Members interactions with us in order to ensure the overall quality of their experience.
We have been delighted at the consistently high ratings we receive in Which?
magazine for the quality of the service and support provided to our Members, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.
We were particularly proud to be placed second behind Amazon for customer satisfaction in a recent major national cross-industry survey published by the UK Institute of Customer Service.
This provides yet another independent third party validation of the strong NPS scores we measure internally, in addition to the continuing awards and recognition we receive from Which?
Partners Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business.
In contrast to the routes to market adopted by other suppliers of similar household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenuesharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy higher-spending Members who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be least likely to churn: by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income.
This ensures that cases of misselling are both inadvertent and extremely rare.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 19 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED We provide a variety of training and personal development courses, both online and classroom-based, designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners effectively and successfully: all of these courses are free to attend.
In addition, we offer a hire purchase scheme which gives Partners access to a Tablet so they can present the benefits of our unique Discount Club more effectively.
Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini, remains extremely popular with around 800 vehicles now delivered 2015: c. 700.
Owners inform us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new Members and Partners.
IT Systems We are taking advantage of the current slower organic growth to review and improve some of the systems and processes which have evolved over the course of the last 18 years, and to prepare for the introduction of new services eg: 4G mobile, insurance and water.
Despite our operating costs already being lower than those of any of our peers on a like-for-like basis, we have identified scope for significant further improvement.
Whilst the additional costs required to enhance our current IT systems to obtain these operating efficiencies and introduce these new services are meaningful, we are confident that this investment will pay dividends over the medium term both through efficiency gains and from the revenues generated by the new services being supported.
