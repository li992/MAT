Financial review Key performance indicators In assessing the financial performance of the Group, management uses a range of Key Performance Indicators KPIs which focus on the Groups financial strength, the delivery of sustainable returns and cost management.
Non-IFRS performance measures Barclays management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the business performance between financial periods, and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group.
They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by Barclays management.
However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well.
Refer to pages 259 - 266 for further information, reconciliations and calculations of non-IFRS performance measures included throughout this document, and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.
