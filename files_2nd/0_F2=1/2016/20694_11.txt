He first met one of our representatives at a London property show, and decided to approach us directly for a five-year fixed rate limited-edition deal.
I approached Aldermore primarily as I found their product range interesting and very attractive when compared to the other rates available on the market at the time.
With the uncertainty caused by the EU referendum vote, Mr Cheema was looking for a deal to provide him with longerterm security, and chose Aldermores five-year fixed product to give him just that.
Our specialist team was able to take Mr Cheemas application through to offer in just 17 working days.
Dealing with Aldermore was very pleasant and the process was very smooth.
I found Aldermore very responsive, professional and precise.
They placed a much higher emphasis on providing help to the customer compared to other lenders.
