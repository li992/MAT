As an example, we recently assisted a customer whose husband had passed away and needed a change of name processed on their account.
The webchat service made this easy to do and avoided her having to talk about the loss of her husband on the telephone.
The changes were made in minutes and the ease of service shows how were expanding ourchannels to continuously put customers at the heart of all we do.
We are excited to help as many customers as we can in ways they nd the most convenient for them.

22 | Severn Trent Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategy in action DRIVE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND CONTINUOUS INNOVATION We have begun an exciting programme of investment in renewable energy technology, aiming to generate 50% of the electricity we use from renewable energy by 2020.
A component of this plan is building solar photovoltaic arrays on unused land at our water and waste water treatment works.
One of the largest of these is at Barnhurst Treatment Works in Wolverhampton, where a 2.8MW array of 11,000 solar panels has been built to provide electricity for the equipment we use.
This covers an area equivalent to four football pitches, generating enough electricity to power the equivalent of around 800 homes!
Further information on our renewables initiatives can be found on page 39.
Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Annual Report and Accounts 2016 | Severn Trent Plc | 23 INVESTING RESPONSIBLY FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH The Water Framework Directive is driving the need for phosphorus removal from sewage to very low levels.
As current UK technologies are unlikely to be capable of achieving this, we have invested in a ground breaking trial at our Packington Sewage Treatment Works to investigate potential alternatives, including low energy, no chemical and phosphorus recovery technologies.
Around 120 million investment in AMP6 to remove phosphorus from over 100 sewage treatment workswill help ensure we invest in technologies capable of delivering effective solutions, whilst saving costs.
24 | Severn Trent Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategy in action CHANGE THE MARKET FOR THE BETTER In March 2016, we announced our joint venture, Water Plus, with United Utilities which combines our non-household retail businesses, centrally located in Stoke-on-Trent.
With the non-household retail market in England opening for competition in 2017, this joint venture will combine the complementary skills of both companies, including sales, customer service, business strategy and credit management, to deliver an attractive proposition for large and smallbusiness customers across England and Scotland.
Bringing our businesses together creates synergies to provide an efficient and cost-effective operation focused on improved customer service and growth.

Employee support for the programme has been very high and throughout the year we have undertaken a number of initiatives, including healthy heart days, skin check clinics, healthy eating promotion, skippingchallenges and wellbeing kiosks.
Our biggest success so far has been our Pedometer Challenge which was held in December 2015 and saw 20% of the business taking part.
