The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
There are no special control rights in relation to the Companys shares and the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Voting rights The following paragraph details the position in relation to voting rights set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
However, the Company recognises that best practice is now to hold a poll on all shareholder resolutions.
It is the Companys current practice, therefore, to hold a poll and it is committed to doing so going forward.
Subject to any special rights or restrictions attaching to any class of shares, at a general meeting or class meeting, on a show of hands, every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy entitled to vote shall have one vote and on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every share held by him her.
In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior member who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
Under the Companies Act 2006, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting.
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member.
A corporation which is a member of the Company may authorise one or more individuals to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company, or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares.
A person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of such corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.
Restrictions on voting No member shall, unless the directors of the Company otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him her to attend or vote at a general meeting of the Company either in person or by proxy if any call or other sum presently payable by him her to the Company in respect of shares in the Company remains unpaid.
Further, if a member has been served with a notice by the Company under the Companies Act 2006 requesting information concerning interests in shares and has failed in relation to any shares to provide the Company, within 14 days of the notice, with such information, the directors of the Company may determine that such member shall not be entitled in respect of such shares to attend or vote either in person or by proxy at any general meeting or at any separate general or class meeting of the holders of that class of shares.
Proxy forms must be submitted not less than 48 hours or such shorter time as the Board may determine excluding, at the Boards discretion, any part of any day that is not a working day before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it was demanded, not less than 24 hours or such shorter time as the Board may determine before the time appointed for the taking of the poll at which it is to be used.
Variation of rights Whenever the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class may, subject to statute and unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to the shares of that class, be varied or abrogated either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.
At every such separate general meeting, the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class.
These provisions also apply to the variation or abrogation of the special rights attached to some only of the shares of any class as if the shares concerned and the remaining shares of such class formed separate classes.
The rights attached to any class of shares shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of such shares or the terms upon which such shares are for the time being held, be deemed not to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with, or subsequent to, the first mentioned shares or by the purchase by the Company of its own shares.
Transfer of shares Subject to any procedures set out by the directors in accordance with the Articles of Association, all transfers of shares shall be effected by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to the directors of the Company.
The instrument of transfer shall be executed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and except in the case of fully paid shares by, or on behalf of, the transferee.
The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members of the Company.
The directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share unless such share is listed on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and traded on the London Stock Exchanges main market for listed securities.
The directors may also refuse to register a transfer of a share in uncertificated form where the Company is entitled to refuse or is excepted from the requirement under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 to register the transfer and they may refuse any such transfer in favour of more than four transferees.
The directors may also refuse to register any transfer of a share on which the Company has a lien.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 126 The directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share in certificated form unless the relevant instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share, is duly stamped or adjudged or certified as not chargeable to stamp duty, is lodged at the transfer office or at such other place as the directors may determine, is accompanied by the relevant share certificate s and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and is in favour of not more than four transferees jointly.
If the directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company in the case of a share in certificated form or the date on which the operator instruction as defined in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 was received by the Company in the case of a share in uncertificated form or in either case such longer or shorter period if any as the Listing Rules may from time to time permit or require, send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

Financial instruments The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company are detailed in Section 3.6 of the Financial Statements.
Acquisition of own shares In 2013, the Company initiated a share buy-back programme with a view to maximising shareholder value and optimising capital allocation.
The Board considered that the share buy-back programme would maximise shareholder value by increasing the capital gain per share that would be expected in the event of a successful hydrocarbon discovery and that it would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Therefore, the Company entered into an irrevocable and non-discretionary agreement with its brokers, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies, to repurchase on the Companys behalf and within certain pre-set parameters up to US$300m of ordinary shares in the Company for cancellation.
The Board decided to suspend the share buy-back programme as of 21 March 2014 and therefore no further shares have been repurchased by the Company since that date.
Appointment and replacement of directors The Companys Articles of Association provide that directors can be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution, or by the Board.
The nomination committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment and replacement of directors.
Further details of the rules governing the appointment and replacement of directors are set out in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 78 to 90, the Nomination Committee Report on pages 96 and 97 and in the Companys Articles of Association.
Directors indemnities As permitted by the Companys Articles of Association, the directors have the benefit of an indemnity which is a qualifying third party indemnity provision as defined in Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 a Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provision.
The indemnity was in force throughout the last financial year and is currently in force.
In May 2014, the Company entered into standalone deeds of indemnity with each of the directors, pursuant to which the directors have the benefit of an indemnity which is a Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provision.
The indemnities came into force upon execution of the deeds of indemnity and are currently in force.
The Company also purchased and maintained throughout the financial year directors and officers liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors.
Powers of the directors Subject to the Companys Articles of Association, UK legislation and any directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company is managed by the Board.
