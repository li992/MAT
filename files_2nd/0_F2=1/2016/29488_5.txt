Regeneration across the generations 30 years of St. Modwen th In 2016 we celebrated our 30 anniversary as a listed company.
Since 1986 weve established our proud reputation as the UKs leading regeneration specialist: weve built new communities, created new jobs and investment, and cleaned up thousands of acres of brownfield land.
We owe much of this success to our strong presence in key areas across the UK.
Today we own and manage a 1.75bn portfolio of over 100 development projects and 6,000 acres of land for ongoing development.
To mark this milestone we launched a series of initiatives, including a national schools photography competition supported by a number of organisations and experts in urban design, architecture, education and photography, such as The Princes Foundation for Building Community.
A celebratory film and book were also produced to capture what 30 years of regeneration really looks like.
