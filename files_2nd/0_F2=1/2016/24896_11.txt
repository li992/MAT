Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report France Renewed sales momentum following Lyonnaise des Eaux partnership Strong customer growth, up 7% to 1.0m FY15: 0.9m Good profit growth, up 7% to 31.4m FY15: 29.5m This has been an excellent year for our French business which has recently rebranded to HomeServe France formerly Domo.
The partnership with Lyonnaise des Eaux LDE has provided fresh sales momentum with resulting strong growth in customer numbers.
The business now has a dedicated business development team and is building a pipeline of affinity partner prospects.
Operational performance We continue to have a strong relationship with Veolia, the leading water provider in France, and have introduced call transfers from their call centres to assist with new customer acquisition activity.
Our partnership with LDE, which was signed at the end of FY15, gained momentum in the first full year of working together.
LDE offers our products in its call centres and has achieved good results, with around a third of the gross new customers acquired in the current year being under the LDE brand.
With renewed sales momentum across the business, customer numbers were up 7% and we passed the 1.0m milestone, having added 0.2m gross new customers in the year FY15: 0.1m.
Direct mail continues to be an important channel and is performing as we anticipated.
However, sales through our partners sales channels have developed well and following the launch of the new partnership with LDE, we have seen a particular increase in this channel in the year.
Customer loyalty remains high with a retention rate of 89% FY15: 89%.
All of our repairs in France are managed through our network of around 700 sub-contractors FY15: 700, who broadly completed the same number of repairs as the prior year.
18 | HomeServe plc Strategic report Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Chief Executives review Financial performance Revenue was up 9% to 105.0m FY15: 96.1m due to continued strong renewals and the strength of sales through the LDE affinity partnership.
Adjusted operating costs increased by 11% to 73.6m principally reflecting increased investment in marketing, business development, partner commissions and relocation costs associated with the move from two sites to one purpose built facility in Lyon.
Despite this increased investment, adjusted operating profit was 31.4m, 7% higher than the prior year, principally due to the benefit of higher customer numbers and our pricing strategy.
Adjusted operating profit margin remained high at 30% FY15: 31%.
In line with the prior year, income per customer was 101 FY15: 101 reflecting the current maturity of the customer base, although this may reduce slightly in the future as the proportion of new customers increases, given they typically initially only hold one policy.
In accordance with Group policy, where a partner originates customers on our behalf, the cost of acquisition is capitalised, held as an intangible asset and amortised as an operating expense.
During FY16, we paid 4.2m FY15: nil in respect of customers acquired by LDE, the associated amortisation during the year was 0.4m FY15: nil.
