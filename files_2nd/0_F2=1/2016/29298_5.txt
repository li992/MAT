Current trading and outlook Trading in the first two months of 2017 has been in line with the Boards expectations, although markets remain competitive and we are experiencing some supplier price inflation.
The longer term outlook in our core markets continues to offer considerable opportunity and SIG remains a good business with strong market positions which is capable of delivering much more.
For 2017 SIG continues to expect the new build residential market to be the best performing sector in the UK construction market, with the commercial sector more uncertain.
In Mainland Europe economic indicators have strengthened and we have seen improving quarterly LFL sales performance.
Our major markets face increased political uncertainty, with Article 50 expected to be triggered in the UK this week and forthcoming elections in France and Germany.
Notwithstanding this uncertainty, the Board sees significant opportunity within the business to drive improved operational performance.
The Group will provide a further update on trading and outlook on the day of its Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2017. Dividend The Board has proposed that the final dividend be rebased to 1.83p per ordinary share in line with its dividend policy of 2 3x earnings cover.
Together with the interim dividend of 1.83p, this provides a total dividend of 3.66p for the year 2015: 4.60p.
Subject to approval at the Groups AGM, the final dividend is expected to be paid on 7 July 2017 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 9 June 2017.
