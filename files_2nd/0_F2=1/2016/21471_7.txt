Ordinary Dividends paid by the Banking Business.
Ordinary dividends are linked to the recurring profit from our Banking Business, with an aim of a 25-40% dividend payout ratio.
Bank of Georgia is by far the largest and most valuable asset in our Group, which provides a stable dividend flow to our shareholders.
Implementing our strategy successfully should improve the quality of ordinary dividend generation capabilities of Bank of Georgia and make it more sustainable over a long period of time.
For information on this years dividend, see page 31.
Special Capital Returns SCR, generated by our Investment Business.
We updated our strategy in December 2014 and introduced the Investment Business and the concept of Special Capital Returns SCR.
The Investment Business aims to deliver SCRs from divestments of our portfolio of companies.
Our aim over a five-year period is to deliver SCRs of at least 50% in aggregate of the ordinary dividends delivered by the Banking Business over the 2015-2019 period.
We view SCRs in three different forms: cash dividends, BGEO share buybacks and the potential distribution of shares in our listed portfolio company.
We are also aiming to buyback shares for our management trust, rather than issue new ones as we historically used to do.
The aim is not to increase the Groups outstanding number of shares from the current 39.5 million level.

We also believe that the Group will be adding value for our shareholders by investing in opportunities which currently are not accessible to our shareholders, changing management and governance, institutionalising and scaling up the companies and, most importantly, unlocking value by exiting from these companies over time.
Our Plan A in exit is to take the Company public.
This way, as far as possible, it is our firm intention to create an opportunity for our shareholders to participate in such offerings.
