Buy-to-let loans grew by 24.2% 1.1 billion to 5.5 billion, accounting for 18.4% of total secured loans 2015: 17.3%.
This increase is in line with growth in the private rental sector, with the proportion of buy-to-let mortgage lending in line with the market.
In particular, the market experienced an increase in buy-to-let lending during the first three months of 2016, ahead of the stamp duty changes which came into effect on 1 April 2016.
Growth in buy-to-let lending has been undertaken in a controlled manner, with the intention of keeping the portfolio mix broadly in line with the market average position.
The credit card portfolio has grown by 54.5% 876.7 million during 2016, in line with the target of 3 billion of receivables by the end of 2017.
This growth has not been at the expense of credit quality, as shown by the reduction in the proportion of impaired balances to total book of 0.4% in the year.
Credit risk categorisation Description Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are not in arrears and which do not meet the impaired asset definition.
This segment can include assets subject to forbearance solutions.
Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are categorised as neither past due nor impaired, and are currently subject to one of the defined and inforbearance forbearance solutions.
Past due and notimpaired Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment and the asset does not meet the definition of impaired assets, as the expected recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.
This category is not applicable for unsecured lending.
Arrears For secured lending, where the customers payment shortfall exceeds 1% of the current monthly contractual payment amount.
For unsecured lending, customers are classified as in arrears at one day past due.
Impaired assets Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment, including changes in customer behaviour or circumstances, and where the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the expected recoverable amount.
Unsecured lending assets are treated as impaired at one day past due.
All fraud and operational risk loans are categorised as impaired irrespective of the expected recoverable amount.

The criteria the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of impairment are disclosed on page 147.
All loans, where specific circumstances indicate that a loss is likely to be incurred for example, mortgage accounts which have entered possession or loans where fraud has been confirmed, are individually assessed for impairment by reviewing expected future cash flows including those that could arise from the realisation of security.

This has been driven primarily by a reduction in secured and unsecured arrears rates.
Additionally, new lending during the period, although having a diluting effect, has shown strong arrears performance.

Unsecured impaired assets have increased by 5.0 million during the year, reducing as a proportion of gross balances from 1.7% to 1.3% at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 respectively.
This reflects improved arrears performance and the diluting effect of new lending which is yet to mature.
Impairment provisions have increased by 8.3 million during the period and have reduced as a percentage of gross balances from 1.9% at 31 December 2015 to 1.6% at 31 December 2016.
The impairment provisions as a proportion of impaired balances have increased however, from 113.9% to 121.9% at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 respectively.
Impairment provisions have remained consistent on older tranches of debt while increasing on newer tranches to take into account the maturing of the book.

The average indexed LTVs of the overall mortgage portfolio have increased by 0.4% as at 31 December 2016.
This reflects the overall book growth, with an increased proportion of residential new lending.
The value of loans with a LTV greater than 100% increased from 9.9 million as at 31 December 2015 to 15.2 million as at 31 December 2016.
This increase is due to a small number of cases in Northern Ireland which experienced a 7.1% decrease in the indexed value for properties during the period.
The average LTV for new business has remained at 68.0% as at 31 December 2016, despite a reduction in the proportion of buyto-let new business.
Buy-to-let mortgages have lower LTVs due to the 75% cap enforced at origination, therefore, this reduction is not sufficiently material to change the overall new business LTV.

For these loans, the exposure was 1.5 million greater than the collateral held as at 31 December 2016.
This has increased from 1.0 million as at 31 December 2015 reflecting a small number of cases in Northern Ireland where negative house price movements were observed during the year.
The recoverable amount used for impairment provision purposes reflects this level of collateral.

As a result, the proportion of residential interest only mortgages excluding part-and-part in the portfolio continues to reduce, moving from 19.1% to 15.0% during 2016.
The Group regularly reviews the effectiveness of the interest only policy and contact strategies to ensure the delivery of fair customer outcomes.
Loans which are forborne are grouped with other assets portraying similar risk characteristics and assessed collectively for impairment, for example, all customers with a payment arrangement are grouped together and assessed on a collective basis.
The loans are not considered to be impaired unless they meet the Groups definition of an impaired asset.
Retail unsecured loans and advances subject to forbearance totalled 12.7 million 31 December 2015: 10.7 million.
Credit risk provisioning for the retail unsecured portfolio is undertaken on a collective basis, except for fraud cases, which are provided for in full, on an individual basis.
The approach used is based on PDs for various behavioural and arrears status segments, measuring the likelihood of default and the probability of charge-off given default.

Derivative financial instruments The Group reduces exposure to credit risk through central clearing for eligible derivatives and daily posting of cash collateral on such transactions, as detailed in note 34 to the financial statements.
For over-the-counter OTC transactions, exposure is reduced by the use of master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.

2 Encumbered loans and advances to customers of 9,425.6 million 2015: 7,524.1 million consists of securitised mortgages and other loan pools positioned with the Bank of England that have been pledged as collateral for funding and liquidity transactions.
At 31 December 2016, 2,302.3 million 2015: 755.0 million of loan pools have been pledged as collateral in respect of secured loans and repo agreements refer note 17 to the financial statements.
3 Other encumbered assets are assets that cannot be used for secured funding due to legal or other reasons.
These comprise the mandatory reserve and the minimum requirement for the BACS payment system of 168.1 million 2015: 160.5 million and cash reserves supporting secured funding structures of 354.4 million 2015: 384.3 million.
4 Unencumbered asserts which are classified as Available for collateral are readily available to secure funding or to meet collateral requirements.
Loans and advances to customers are classified as Available for collateral only if they are already in such a form that they can be used immediately to raise funding.
5 Other unencumbered assets are assets which are not subject to any restrictions and are not readily available for use.
6 These amounts represent Treasury Bills received by the Group through FLS, which are not recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group is permitted to re-pledge these securities to generate on-balance sheet financial assets, such as cash, or to fund lending.
These items are classified as encumbered where the Group has used them in repurchase transactions or unencumbered where it has not.
The Groups total level of asset encumbrance remained at 27.0% at 31 December 2016.
Encumbered assets increased by 1,244.2 million year-on-year, in line with balance growth, due to wholesale funding to support increased lending.
Encumbrance of assets predominantly arises from the use of the BoE funding and liquidity facilities and from the Gosforth RMBS programme.
The Group manages the volume of available unencumbered collateral to meet requirements arising from current and future secured funding transactions.
Available collateral provides a source of contingent funding for use in stress conditions, as identified within the Contingency Funding Plan.
The Group maintains a portfolio of liquid assets in accordance with risk appetite.
Liquid assets are held predominantly in high-quality unencumbered securities issued by the UK Government or supranationals and deposits with central banks.
The portfolio mix is aligned to the liquidity coverage requirement defined in European liquidity regulatory standards.
Other liquidity resources represent additional unencumbered liquid assets held over and above high-quality liquid assets.

The tables overleaf analyse assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date.
The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms, and readers are therefore advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
In practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.
Amounts in respect of RMBS in issue have a maximum contractual maturity consistent with underlying mortgage assets in excess of five years : the cashflow profile below reflects that securitisation documents will require repayment of the securities in line with repayments of the underlying mortgages, which may be in advance of the legal maturity date.

The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
These differ from balance sheet values due to the effects of discounting on certain balance sheet items and due to the inclusion of contractual future interest flows.
As a result, the Groups contractual cashflow profile of customer deposits has shortened.
The reduced retail funding tenor has been partially offset by a lengthening of the wholesale funding profile.
The following tables allocate the undiscounted derivative cash outflows into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period between the balance sheet date and the contractual maturity date.
Cash flows for the floating legs of derivative transactions are calculated based on market indications of future interest rates.
As a result, totals in these tables arenot intended to be identical to tables on OTC derivatives or the notes to the financial statements by definition.
