2014 2015 2016 In Spring 2016 we undertook an improved employee survey process, measuring both engagement and enablement across our business.
Due to the fact that this process is significantly different to past survey data, we are not able to provide any direct like-for-like comparisons, however, this year we have included data for the UK Norm from the Korn Ferry Hay Group Engagement Survey, to provide a comparison.
In future, employee surveys will form part of our annual programme, allowing comparisons to be included from 2016 onwards.
