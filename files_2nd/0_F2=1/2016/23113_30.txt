As there is a stated Group policy to charge the net defined benefit pension scheme and cost to participating subsidiaries, only the Companys share is recognised on transition to FRS 101.
A deferred tax asset has also been recorded on the newly recognised defined benefit pension liability, and a receivable from subsidiary undertakings reflects pension contributions paid on behalf of subsidiaries.
This adjustment is the only adjustment with a net impact on equity.
b As part of the FRS 101 transition, derivative financial instruments, income tax liabilities and deferred tax, netted within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables named debtors and creditors under previous UK GAAP have been disclosed separately on a gross basis.
c Under previous UK GAAP, computer software costs were classified as property, plant and equipment.
Under FRS 101, computer software costs are capitalised as intangible assets.
At 30 April 2015, computer software costs of 6m have been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
d Under FRS 101, at 1 May 2014 and 30 April 2015, 12m and 201m of amounts due to subsidiaries previously netted within amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings have been reclassified from other receivables to other payables, respectively.
