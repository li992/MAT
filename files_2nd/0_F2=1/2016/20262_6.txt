Strategic priorities As outlined in the market review, there are a number of key market trends which are having a significant impact on the asset management industry.
To stay competitive we need to respond to these changes and remain focused on servicing our clients: delivering value to end-customers: providing high quality investment expertise across all asset classes: recruiting and retaining talented and motivated employees: and operating an efficient business.
By doing so, we will grow our assets under management and create long term value for our shareholders and wider stakeholders.
Our strategic priorities to be a leading diversified asset manager are therefore to: Enhance, develop and grow our investment capabilities to meet the changing profile and needs of our clients and end-customers Provide high levels of client service and access new pools of investor capital Achieve long term business efficiencies and maintain a healthy balance sheet Recruit, develop and retain talented and motivated employees Such strategies inevitably have associated risks macro, industry wide and Aberdeen specific.
A joined up approach, from the Board through to all employees, and from front-office to internal audit, is therefore fundamental to our ability to deliver on our objectives.
Over the next four pages we set out how we aim to achieve these strategies over the near and longer term: the progress we have made during the year: the risks associated with each: and the KPIs we use to measure and monitor performance.
These link through to our Remuneration report on p68.
