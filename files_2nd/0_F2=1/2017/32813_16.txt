Every private equity investment is made with a clear exitstrategy in place from the very beginning.
Once theinvestment plan has been implemented during thegrowth phase, managers turn their attention to maximising the value of their investment ahead of a sale.
This could take the form of an IPO on a public exchange, or an M&A transaction involving a trade buyeror secondary private equity investor.
While IPOs tend to make the headlines, the majority of exits are achieved via trade sales.
Private equity managers have a key advantage over theirpublic market peers in that they are better able totime a sale to maximise value.
During significant market corrections, as exemplified by the global financialcrisis, managers can simply delay exits andawait more favourable conditions in which to realisetheir investments.
