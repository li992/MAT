Financial review Key performance indicators In assessing the financial performance of the Group, management uses a range of KPIs which focus on the Groups financial strength, the delivery of sustainable returns and cost management.
Significant strategic progress was made in 2017 with the closure of Barclays Non-Core and sell down of our stake in Barclays Africa, marking the completion of our restructuring and enabling us to set new targets for Group returns and costs.
The Non-Core segment was closed on 1 July 2017 with RWAs of 23bn, below guidance of approximately 25bn as set out in the 2016 KPIs.
With the closure of Non-Core we no longer have a Core and Non-Core distinction within the Group and hence the previous target of Group RoTE to converge with Core RoTE has been updated.
The Group is now targeting RoTE, excluding litigation and conduct, of greater than 9% in 2019 and greater than 10% in 2020, based on a Group CET1 ratio of c. 13%.
Guidance for Group operating expenses, excluding litigation and conduct, is 13.6-13.9bn in 2019 and to have a cost: income ratio of below 60%.
