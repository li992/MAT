Directors remuneration report Annual remuneration implementation report continued Disclosure of Performance Targets for 2015 The Committee discussed at length its approach to disclosure of performance targets.
Its position that early disclosure of targets would be commercially detrimental because of the highly competitive nature of the market in which it operates still holds but it considers that performance targets for the 2015 annual bonus and 2015 LTIP vesting are no longer commercially sensitive.
Annual bonus In setting the bonus targets the Committee gave careful consideration to the business plan and to the research analyst consensus forecasts at the time.
The targets and performance measured on an adjusted basis for the 2015 annual bonus are shown in the table below.
2014 15 Performance vs Performance Metric Target Performance Target UK and Ireland paid-for Products Growth 2.2m 3.3m 150% UK and Ireland Operating Profit 1,300m 1,350m 104% UK and Ireland Operating Cash Flow 1,170m 1,414m 121% On the basis of this performance the Committee determined that the bonus was paid at 100% of maximum for the Group CEO and 100% for the Group COO & CFO.
LTIP The LTIP that vested in 2015 for the 2012-15 performance period was based 70% on three equally weighted operational performance measures of average EPS growth, Operating Cash Flow and Revenue Growth measured on an adjusted basis.
30% of the award was based on relative TSR performance versus the FTSE 100.
The operation of the Plan and the award payout table was the same as for the 2016-19 plan set out on pages 62 to 63.
The targets and actual performance for Operating Cash Flow and Revenue Growth were as follows: UK and Ireland Operating cash flow UK and Ireland Revenue growth Performance vs Performance vs Target Performance Target Points Target Performance Target Points 2012-13 1,275m 1,396m 109% 3.33 5.0% 6.5% 130% 3.33 2013-14 1,150m 1,284m 112% 3.33 5.0% 5.3% 106% 3.33 2014-15 1,170m 1,414m 121% 3.33 5.0% 5.4% 108% 3.33 Total 10.00 10.00 The adjusted UK and Ireland basic EPS growth target of 7.3% RPI 5% per annum was exceeded with actual performance at 10% per annum.
The total points achieved of 30.00 was therefore in excess of the 21 points required for full vesting of this element of the award.
Relative TSR performance was at 77% and therefore 23% of this element of the award vested.
Total vesting overall was therefore 93% of the maximum.
How do we intend to implement the remuneration policy next year?
In the context of the 21st Century Fox Offer the Committee has determined that the existing remuneration policy will be implemented as follows for the year ending 30 June 2018.
Base salary The average salary increase for our employees, effective 1 July 2017, was 3.0% for those earning less than 31,000, and 2.0% for all other employees, with increases up to 10% for outstanding performance, promotions and market adjustments.
The Committee decided to make base salary adjustments of 2.5% each for the Group CEO and Group COO & CFO, effective 1 July 2017, in line with the parameters for our employees.
Taxable benefits and pension No changes.
Annual Bonus and Co-Investment Plan The performance measures for the annual bonus remain unchanged for the coming year, namely revenue growth, operating profit and operating cash flow.
The Committee believes that these measures provide clear line of sight to the key imperatives for the business.
We expect that both of the Executive Directors will participate in the CIP for this year.
The performance conditions for the vesting of shares are as per the details set out on page 60.
Long Term Incentive Plan award The Committee agreed that Jeremy Darroch would be granted an award of 600,000 shares and Andrew Griffith would be granted an award of 350,000 shares on 27 July 2017.
This is the Year 2 award of the 20162019 Plan.
These awards will normally vest on 29 July 2019 subject to the performance measures being achieved.
The performance conditions for this award are the same as for the 2016 award.
Should the 21st Century Fox Offer complete before the end of the performance periods for the LTIP and CIP awards, the awards will vest on a cash-settled, time-pro-rated basis on the date on which the Offer completes, with no performance conditions attached.
If the Offer is withdrawn or lapses the awards would vest on the normal vesting date based on the performance conditions, and be settled in shares.
