108 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Employee share plans Details of employee share plans are set out in note 23 to the accounts.
The Company introduced a new Executive Share Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, and reflects current legislation, best practice and corporate governance requirements including recovery and withholding provisions.
In addition, the new Plan includes flexibility to grant performance-related share awards, other share awards and deferred bonus awards.
The Plan will be used primarily to grant performance-related awards and deferred bonus awards to executive Directors and selected senior employees.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the ability to continue to grant long term share-based incentives as part of a balanced remuneration package will create a strong alignment of long term interest between senior management and shareholders.
Initial performance awards were made to executive Directors and selected senior management in July 2015, following shareholder approval of the Plan.
The first grants of the merit deferred bonus awards were made in July 2016, shortly after the payment of the cash element of the bonus.
Dilution limits The Company operates three share plans: the 2005 Performance Share Plan, under which no further awards can be made: the 2015 Executive Share Plan, under which all new discretionary awards are made: and the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, a tax approved share plan for UK employees.
Overall dilution through the issuance of new shares for employee share schemes including treasury shares may not exceed an amount equivalent to 10% of the Companys issued share capital over a 10-year period and for discretionary share awards to senior management, 5% over a 10-year period.
Over the last 10 years, the Company has granted discretionary awards over 3.3% of the Companys issued share capital and a further 0.5% in respect of the SIP.
All awards under these three plans have been settled by treasury shares or market-purchased shares held via a trust.
Appointment and replacement of directors With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation.
Directors can be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general meeting or by the Board.

Inaccordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code each of the Directors, being eligible, will offer themselves for election or re-election at this years Annual General Meeting.

Power of Directors The powers of Directors are described in the Matters Reserved for the Board, copies of which are available on request from the Company Secretary, and are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report on page 76.
Essential contracts and change of control There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company, principally bank loan agreements, private placement debt and employee share plans.
There are two significant agreements, in terms of the likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole, containing such provisions: the 550m syndicated revolving credit facility which, if within 10 days of a change of control notice to the Loan agent, can result in 30 days notice being given to the Company by any Lender, for all amounts outstanding to that Lender, to be immediately due and payable, at which time the commitment of that Lender will be cancelled.
If all of the Lenders give this notice the whole facility would be cancelled: and the US$250m US Private Placement Note Purchase Agreement under which, in the event of a change of control, theCompany is required to make an offer to the holders of the US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal amount of the notes together with interest accrued.
The Group has contractual arrangements with a wide range of suppliers.
The Group is not unduly dependent upon contractual arrangements with any particular customer.
Whilst the loss or disruption to certain of these arrangements could temporarily affect the Groups business, noneis considered to be essential.

109 Governance Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Other Statutory Information continued Allotment authority Under the Companies Act 2006 the Directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so.
At the Annual General Meeting an ordinary resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to allot and issue new shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 12,500,000 up to 125,000,000 new ordinary shares of 10p each, being just less than one third of the issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at 12 June 2017 the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting.
In accordance with the Directors stated intention to seek annual renewal, the authority will expire at the conclusion ofthe annual general meeting of the Company in 2018.
Passing this resolution will give the Directors flexibility to act inthe best interests of shareholders, when opportunities arise, by issuing new shares.
As at 12 June 2017 the latest practicable date prior to the publication ofthe Notice of Meeting, the Company had 379,645,332 ordinary sharesof 10p each in issue of which 462,188 were held as treasury shares, which is equal toapproximately 0.12% of the issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at that date.
The Companies Act 2006 also requires that, if the Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings.
At the Annual General Meeting a special resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to issue a limited number of shares for cash and or sell treasury shares without offering them to shareholders first.
The authority is for an aggregate nominal amount of up to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued share capital of the Company as at 12 June 2017 the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting of 3,780,000.
The resolution will also modify statutory pre-emption rights to deal with legal, regulatory or practical problems that may arise on a rights issue or otherpre-emptive offer or issue.
The authority will expire at the same time as the resolution conferring authority on theDirectors to allot shares.
The Directors consider this authority necessary in order to give them flexibility to deal with opportunities as they arise, subject to the restrictions contained in the resolution.
There are no present plans to issue shares, other than the release of treasury shares under share plans previously approved in general meeting.
Purchase of the Companys own shares The Company was authorised at the 2016 annual general meeting to purchase up to 37,800,000 of its own 10p ordinary shares in the market.
This authority expires at the end of the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Directors stated intention to seek annual renewal, a special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew this authority until the end of next years annual general meeting, in respect of up to 37,900,000 ordinary shares, which is approximately 10% of the Companys issued share capital excluding treasury shares as at 12 June 2017 the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting.
The Directors consider it desirable that the possibility of making such purchases, under appropriate circumstances, isavailable.
The authority, if granted, will only be exercised if market conditions make it advantageous to do so.
The Directors will only make purchases under the authority where they believe that to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders, or where the purchased shares are used to satisfy awards made underemployee share plans, and such purchases are considered to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Their present intention is that the shares purchased under the authority will be held in treasury for future cancellation, sale for cash or transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employee share plan, although in the light of circumstances at the time it may be decided to cancel them immediately on repurchase.
The effect of any cancellationwould be to reduce the number of shares in issue.
For most purposes, while held in treasury, shares aretreated as if they have been cancelled for example, they carry no voting rights and do not rank for dividends.
Following approval of the Performance Share Plan PSP at the 2005 annual general meeting, the Directors made routine purchases of Halma shares in the market for holding in treasury until required for vesting under the PSP.
In the year to 1 April 2017, no shares were purchased in the market for treasury.
Under the Executive Share Plan approved atthe2015 annual general meeting, shares vesting may be satisfied with market purchased shares held in trust or intreasury or with new issue shares.
Otherwise, the Directors have no present intention of using this authority.
In reaching a decision to purchase shares, the Directors will take into account the Companys cash resources, capital requirements and the effect of any purchase on the Companys earnings per share.
It is anticipated that renewal of theauthority will be requested at subsequent annual general meetings.
