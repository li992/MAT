The Board has considered the independence of the Companys Non-Executive Directors and has concluded that: f William A. Franke, the Chairman, does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate Governance Code, given that he is the managing partner of Indigo a significant Shareholder.
However, given the benefits to the Company of his recognised experience in the airline industry, the Board believes that it is in the Companys best interest that Mr Franke should continue as Chairman of Wizz Air.
g Stephen L. Johnson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director given his past position with Indigo.
h John R. Wilson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director as he is a principal of Indigo.

Johnson, the Company regards all of its Non-Executive Directors, namely, Guido Demuynck, Simon Duffy, Thierry fide Preux, Susan Hooper, John McMahon and Wioletta Rosoowska, as independent Non-Executive Directors within the meaning of independent as defined in the Corporate Governance Code and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment.
Accordingly, as an absolute majority of the Directors are independent Non-Executive Directors, the Company complies with the requirement of the Corporate Governance Code that at least half of the board excluding the chairman of a company with a premium listing should comprise independent non-executive directors.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director The Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board should appoint one of its independent Non-Executive Directors as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director should be available to Shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer has failed to resolve or where such contact is inappropriate.
John McMahon has been appointed as the Companys Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
