13 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Investment Managers Report continued Portfolio Performance continued Overall portfolio availability was in line with budget.
Notable issues were: lower than budgeted availability at Little Cheyne Court due to various gearbox, converter and blade bolt failures: lower than budgeted availability at Corriegarth due to various post commissioning issues, which were exacerbated by restricted site access in November and December due to heavy snow revised access procedures have been put in place: lower than budgeted availability at Lindhurst due to the successful proactive replacement of several transformers, various scheduled grid outages and the associated downtime in returning turbines to service following those outages: and successful remediation by Siemens of Maerdy yaw gear issues at all but one turbine location with compensation having been agreed for that turbine, which will be curtailed at high wind speeds.
Clyde Extension was commissioned on 28 August 2017, adding 172.8MW of capacity and increasing the total capacity of the Clyde wind farm from 349.6MW to 522.4MW.
The contractual arrangements in relation to Clyde Extension are further described under Acquisitions below.
The Stroupster wind energy true-up was settled in the year, with BayWa making a payment of 2.6 million to the Group.
The true-up mechanism is designed to mitigate the risk associated with investing in a wind farm before sufficient operational data are available.
Wind energy true-ups in respect of Corriegarth and Clyde Extension remain outstanding as disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements.

GAV is the sum of: DCF valuations of the Groups investments: cash at Group and wind farm SPV level : and other relevant assets and liabilities of the Group.
The DCF valuation of the Groups investments represents the largest component of GAV and the key sensitivities are considered to be the discount rate used in the DCF valuation and long term assumptions in relation to energy yield, power prices and ination.
At the time of the 30 September 2017 NAV, the Group announced a reduction in the portfolio discount rate of 0.3 per cent.
the only such change since listing.
This reduction compares to a reduction in long term gilt yields over the same period of approximately 1 per cent..
The base case portfolio discount rate is now 7.7 per cent..
This is an unlevered discount rate.
The equivalent levered discount rate is approximately 10 per cent.. A variance of - 0.5 per cent.
is considered to be a reasonable range of alternative assumptions for discount rate.
Base case energy yield assumptions are P50 50 per cent.

probability of exceedance over a 10 year period sensitivities reect the future variability of wind and the uncertainty associated with the long term data source being representative of the long term mean.
Given their basis on long term operating data, it is not anticipated that base case energy yield assumptions will be adjusted other than any wind energy true-ups with compensating purchase price adjustments.
Long term power price forecasts are provided by a leading market consultant, updated quarterly and may be adjusted by the Investment Manager where more conservative assumptions are considered appropriate.
Base case real power prices increase from approximately 45 MWh 2018 to approximately 55 MWh 2043.
The sensitivity below assumes a 10 per cent.

Debt outstanding comprised a single term debt facility of 100 million together with associated interest rate swaps and 165 million drawn on the Groups revolving credit facility.
All borrowing is at the Company level no asset level debt.
Outlook The regulatory outlook for operational wind farms in the UK remains stable owing to the UK Governments policy of grandfathering for operational projects.
The Group invests in operational wind farms, backed by known and xed support mechanisms.
There is currently 12GW of operational onshore wind capacity plus 6GW offshore.
Installed capacity is set to grow to 13GW onshore plus 12GW offshore by 2020, as assets currently in construction come into operation.
In monetary terms, the secondary market for operational UK wind farms is approximately 45 billion, increasing to 70 billion by 2020.
The Group currently has a market share of approximately 3 per cent.. As an owner of operational wind farms, the key risk faced by the Group is power price.
Power prices in 2017 were in line with budget.
In general, independent forecasters expect UK wholesale power prices to rise in real terms from current levels, driven by higher gas and carbon prices.
The long term power price forecast is updated each quarter and reected in the reported NAV.
The Company does not expect any material change to its business as a result of the UK exiting the European Union.
Being solely UK focused and deliberately low-risk, all of the Groups assets and liabilities are inside the UK and sterling denominated.
In addition, the regulatory regime under which the assets operate is robust, longstanding and rooted in UK legislation.
In general, the outlook for the Group is very encouraging, with proven operational and financial performance from the existing portfolio combined with a healthy pipeline of attractive further investment opportunities.
By continuing to be selective, we look forward to further acquisitions in line with the Companys investment objective.
