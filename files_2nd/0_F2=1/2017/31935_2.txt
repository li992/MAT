Market Overview GROWING IMPACT OF ANIMAL GENETIC IMPROVEMENT LONG-TERM DRIVERS OF ANIMAL GENETIC IMPROVEMENT THE GLOBAL POPULATION IS GROWING AND MOVING TO CITIES.
URBAN POPULATIONS TEND TO BECOME WEALTHIER, LEADING TO GREATER APPETITE FOR ANIMAL PROTEIN.

CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT THERE ARE FEWER SOURCES OF ELITE BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND DATA.
THE ANIMAL GENETICS INDUSTRY GENETICS, AND HENCE IT IS IS PURSUING ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ANIMAL INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FOR DISEASE AND SUFFERING.
THESE INCLUDE USING DATA AND HEALTHGENETICS COMPANIES TO OWN FOCUSED BREEDING INDICES, AND EXPLORING BREAKTHROUGH AND CONTROL THEIR OWN GENETICS.
ADOPTION OF SEMEN SEXING TECHNOLOGY AND IVF IS GROWING FAST ACROSS DAIRY AND BEEF HERDS.
OUR POSITION IN THE ANIMAL GENETICS INDUSTRY THESE ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN AREAS OF STRONG MARKET GROWTH IN THE GENUS IS A WORLD LEADER IN ANIMAL GENETIC IMPROVEMENT.
