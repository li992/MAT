co. uk Directors Report continued Greenhouse Gas Emissions GHG The Group recognises and and strives to minimise its impact on the environment.
As a financial services provider, our main environmental focus is on our network of offices and employee travel.
Global GHG emissions for the period ended 30 September 2017 Emissions from: Tonnes of CO e 2016 17 Tonnes of CO e 2015 16 2 2 Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities 308 327 Electricity purchased for own use 1,751 2,030 Fugitive emissions refrigerant losses 12.7 Mobile combustion business travel from leased assets 19.9 20.0 Companys chosen intensity measurement: Emissions per full time employee 1.3 1.5 Methodology and additional information The table above reports the Groups annual GHG emissions from sources which fall within the consolidated financial statements.
Included are most of the emission sources that the Group has responsibility for but some emission sources have been omitted based on a lack of data and materiality.
Details of the emissions which have been omitted are given in the Emission sources not reported section below.
The Scope 2 emissions calculations for purchased electricity follow the location-based methodology of the GHG Protocol.
We have used SoFi software, from Think Step, to gather data on energy use natural gas and electricity, hydrofluorocarbons and upstream leased assets.
For the Groups international operations, Defra no longer includes the International Energy Agencys IEA factors for international electricity consumption in their own dataset.
Think Step negotiated an agreement with the IEA that allows them to continue to include IEA factors in the SoFi Impact libraries.
These factors are the most up-to-date IEA overseas emission factors currently available which date back to country-specific physical consumption of electricity in 2014.
Regarding fugitive emissions, emissions from refrigerant losses occurred due to replacements of our Direct Expansion systems.
As in the previous reporting year, emissions from mobile combustion related to business travel and were estimated to be an average of 30% of total mileage.
This is our own conservative assumption.
Emission sources not reported This section of the report details the emission sources that we have not reported on and provides the reasons behind our decisions.
Only a minority of the buildings we operate directly make use of gas and we have included this in our emissions from combustion of fuel.
We do not have distinct data on heat steam for our other buildings as this is most likely embedded in the office service charges that we pay.
As a result, we have not currently reported on purchased heat or steam.
In future we will devise a methodology to estimate the emissions associated with heating requirements that we are responsible for.
Data quality for electricity and gas consumption Our data for electricity as well as gas consumption comes from two main sources: consumption bills from suppliers reports from property agents etc.
exact data : and our approximations based on exact data estimated data.
We have used estimated data in some cases because we were unable to get complete data for all our buildings for the current reporting period.
The section below details the approach that we have taken to fill the gaps in consumption data.
We identified that there were some buildings that had incomplete electricity or gas consumption figures for certain months over the current reporting period.
In such situations, we chose a conservative approach to estimate the consumption data for the missing months.
We did this by identifying the month in the dataset with the highest electricity consumption, calculated the worst case daily consumption figure and applied this daily figure to the months that had missing data as a worst case scenario.
Brewin Dolphin 72 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information In some other cases, there were buildings that we had no electricity and or gas consumption data for.
In these situations, we used either: last years data as an approximation: or average consumption intensity per square metre across buildings with complete and exact data for each month in the current reporting period.
We then used these monthly average consumption per square metre intensities to estimate the monthly electricity gas consumption of the buildings with no electricity gas consumption data, based on individual floor areas.
Auditor Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that: so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditor is unaware: and the Director has taken all steps that he she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Approved for and on behalf of the Board.
