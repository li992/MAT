Performance in the period benefited from the timing of Easter and other public holidays across Europe, which is estimated to have accounted for around two percentage points of the volume and revenue underlying change.
Volumes were up nine per cent, with continued strong growth in international volumes.
Revenue increased by nine per cent, as pricing was impacted by lower average parcel weights.
Revenue in Sterling terms benefited from a 233 million impact from exchange rate movements which is excluded from underlying movements.
Revenue growth was achieved in almost all markets and from a broad customer base, with the largest customer accounting for around two per cent of total GLS revenue.
The three major markets, Germany, Italy and France, accounted for 63per cent of total GLS revenue down from 68per cent in 2015-16 reflecting the impact of the acquisitions in Spain and the US.
In 2017-18, the timing of public holidays across Europe is expected to have the effect of reducing underlying revenue and volume movements byaround two percentage points compared with 2016-17.

Distribution and conveyance costs were up ten per cent, driven by higher volumes.
Infrastructure costs were flat, with a one-off provision release of 3 million for IT related costs offsetting inflationary pressures.
Other operating costs increased by 11per cent, partly driven by costs associated with our geographic expansion activities.

Operating profit Operating profit was 196 million giving a reported margin of 7.8per cent.
This represents an underlying margin improvement of 50 basis points over the prior year.

Germany Germany remains the largest market for GLS by revenue.
Revenue in GLS Germany grew by five per cent, driven by international volumes and improved domestic pricing.
Profitability has been impacted by legislation which increased the minimum wage by four per cent from 1January2017.
This has increased costs in the period by 1 million with an estimated twelve month impact of 5 million.
24 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Italy GLS Italy continues to perform strongly.
Revenue growth of 13per cent was due to strong B2C volume growth, driven by Amazon and other customers.
Given the strong performance over the last two years, it will be challenging to maintain this rate of growth in the future.
France GLS France delivered an improved rate of revenue growth of eight per cent, largely from domestic volumes.
Reported operating losses reduced by 5 million to 8 million.
France remains a challenging market and while actions are underway which target a break-even result, higher costs of sale including those associated with a changing mix of parcel sizes means that it is unlikely we will achieve this in the short term.
Other developed European markets including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain Revenue growth was achieved in the majority of other developed European markets with strong growth in Denmark.
In June 2016, we announced the acquisition of ASM for a total consideration including debt taken on of 71 million.
ASM has exceeded performance expectations since acquisition.
Given the potential synergies, the transaction is expected to be economic profit accretive for GLS in 2018-19.
Other developing emerging European markets including Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia We saw revenue growth in all developing emerging European markets, with particularly strong growth in Romania.
This has been largely driven by the growing parcels markets in these countries.
USA On 4October 2016, we announced the acquisition of GSO, a regional next day parcel delivery company operating primarily in California, for atotal consideration of $90 million.
We expect GSO to perform in line with our expectations in the first full year of its ownership by the Group.
Thetransaction is expected to be economic profit accretive for GLS in 2019-20.
On 6April 2017, we announced the acquisition of Postal Express, a regional overnight parcel carrier operating in the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho for a total consideration of $13.3 million.
Postal Express offers overnight parcel delivery, mainly to B2B customers, across anumber of industries.

GSO and Postal Express will be operated as standalone businesses but will be incorporated into the results of GLS.
