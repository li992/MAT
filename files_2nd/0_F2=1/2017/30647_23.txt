Greenhouse gas emissions Our latest greenhouse gas GHG emissions report showed 2016 UK and European GHG emissions of 5,173.31 tonnes CO 2 equivalent tCO e a fall of 19% relative to 2015.
This decrease is primarily due to reduced emissions associated with refrigerant 2 losses Scope 1, electricity consumption Scope 2 and business travel by air Scope 3.
2016 GHG emissions for Beazleys three e principal North American offices are reported as 1,653.95 tCO.
This is 1% lower than 2015 reported emissions and is due 2 to small reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions offsetting a small increase in emissions from business travel by air.
Beazleys GHG emission intensity ratio emissions employee year fell from 8.8 tCO e employee in 2015 to 7.1 tCO e employee 2 2 in 2016.
com Annual report 2017 Beazley 73 Notes: i We have disclosed global GHG emissions that we are responsible for as set out by the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013. ii GHG emissions are calculated and presented in accordance with DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines, using the UK Governments GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2016. iii Reporting is based on operational control.
Beazley does not have operational control over the building infrastructure and plant at its offices due to the presence of facility management companies and shared tenancies: as a result, emissions primarily fall within Scope 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
iv Reported Scope 1 sources are: company cars, fuel use in back-up generators and fugitive refrigerant losses from AC systems.
Emissions associated with electricity used in Beazleys offices and data centres are reported as Scope 2 emissions.
Scope 3 sources include: business travel by air, rail and leased cars, and transmission and distribution of electricity.
v UK and European office reporting covers activity associated with our principal UK office, Plantation Place South, and our Dublin office.
These sites collectively account for 96% of Beazleys UK European permanent and contracted staff in 2016. vi US office reporting covers activity associated with three US offices, Farmington, New York and Chicago, which in 2016 collectively accounted for 63% of Beazleys US employees.
The scope of 2016 reporting is consistent with that for 2015.
We plan to expand the 2017 scope of reporting to include our Atlanta office: this will take US office coverage to 80% of employees based on 2016 occupancy.
