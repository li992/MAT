Primark, in particular, delivered stronger profit growth than expected when STIP targets were set.
Working capital was also well managed throughout the year.
This is reflected in the 2016 17 STIP outcome shown above.
Following a review of personal performance against specific objectives for the 2016 17 financial year, the committee determined that George Weston will receive 14.93% of salary in relation to performance that was good against set objectives, with our businesses performing well and a strong business response to the risks and opportunities that Brexit presents.
John Bason will receive 15% of base salary for the individual element of the annual bonus, reflecting strong progress against objectives and in shaping the finance function for the future.
Personal objectives set for each of the executive directors were closely aligned to the overall strategy of the group but additional details will not be disclosed because of commercial sensitivity.
Retrospective disclosure of STIP performance range We will disclose the target ranges that applied to 2016 17 STIP awards once the deferred awards are released in November 2019, two years from the end of the annual performance period.
We expect the directors to make the right decisions for the long-term performance of the business, even if this reduces their incentive pay-out under the STIP.
This timing is deemed appropriate as when we do disclose the performance target ranges that applied, we wish to be able to add any commentary that will help investors to understand the performance outcomes.
In most cases, this is not appropriate immediately following the end of the performance year as the information remains commercially sensitive at this time.
For these reasons, we believe that this delayed disclosure is appropriate and in shareholders interests.
