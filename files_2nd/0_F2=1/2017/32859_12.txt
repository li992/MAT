CLIENTS Results Revenue for the year decreased 19% to US$1,392 million 2016: US$1,725 million.
The decrease was predominantly due to the phasing of EPCm projects and lower new order intake, activity and utilisation in EPS West.
Business performance net profit for the year was US$90 million 2016:US$111million, reflecting the phasing of EPCm projects and lower activity, utilisation and order intake in EPS West.
