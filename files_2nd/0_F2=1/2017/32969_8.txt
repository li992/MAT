The property produced a total return of 8.9 per cent last year in addition to consecutive years of strong performance.
This lease is subject to annual RPI increases and the annual rent is now 1,809,382 per annum.
Outlook After another year of absolute high total returns for the UK commercial property market, we expect 2018 to produce more muted but stable returns broadly in line with the long-term average.
The yield compression experienced in the industrial markets that has driven recent performance is likely to abate and we believe most commercial sectors have reached a pricing apex.
Uncertainty from the Brexit negotiations will continue and this should soften rental growth in some markets.
Interest rates increased over the year from historic lows and following a period of strong inflation and economic growth we expect further increases over 2018.
The environment and outlook in retail has deteriorated recently with a number of Company Voluntary Arrangements CVAs and restructurings being announced.
This will not only put pressure on rental growth from this sector but also on maintaining current income.
In terms of property pricing, the margin above government bonds the adopted proxy for the risk-free rate of investment has been far above the long-term average for a sustained period.
Therefore, current pricing is reasonably well placed to absorb further increases in interest rates but any continued yield compression is unlikely.
We will seek new acquisitions on a selective basis and we will continue to favour quality industrial and logistics, town centre offices in targeted locations and the alternative sector.
We will continue to focus on asset management initiatives apparent in the portfolio and to reducing the exposure to voids.
Despite forecasting more modest performance in the short term, UK commercial property continues to offer investors attractive long-term income returns and the Companys portfolio is well positioned whilst we navigate this period of political uncertainty.
