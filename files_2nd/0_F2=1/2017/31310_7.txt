Despite representing approximately 28% of global pellet usage, the 124 million tonne pellet export market sets the price for pellets through negotiations between a limited supply of independent pellet producers and steel mills.
The supply of actively traded pellets increased by a net 5 million tonnes in 2017 2016: 119 million tonnes from producers in India, Russia and Brazil, while pellet premiums were trading at a nine-year high.

Definition: Business costs are the sum of realisation costs and site costs.
Realisation costs include the cost of getting the material to market, the marketing of the material and the financing cost of selling the material.
The power of business costs is that by adjusting all product qualities relative to the same benchmark 62% Fe fines product delivered to North China it allows all mines to be compared on a cost curve on a like-for-like basis.
This also means that by subtracting the benchmark price from the business costs for a mine you get an estimate of cashflow from that operation.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 Graph 3: Breakeven Pellet Cost Curve Delivery to China Table 3: Global Pellet Exporters shows that of the 124 million tonnes of pellet exported in 2017, approximately 30% went to DRI production while the remaining 70% was utilised in blast furnace steel operations.
DR pellets are typically higher grade and receive a US$5 to US$10 per tonne premium above the blast furnace pellet premium.
Graphs 2 and 3 detail the breakeven pellet cost curve for delivery to Europe and China respectively.
Market concentration in the pellet export market is high, with the two largest suppliers of pellets by volume coloured red and pink in Graphs 2 and 3 holding a market share of approximately 45%.
In terms of their breakeven cost, both these exporters sit in the first, second, third and fourth quartile of the cost curve while the higher y-axis: Business costs for pellet exports, 2017, CFR China, US$ t x-axis: Cumulative pellet exports, 2017, Mt cost pellet producers require a breakeven 62% Fe CFR fines price of around US$70 Definition: Business costs are the sum of realisation costs and site costs.

Chinas own Source: CRU statistical review January 2018 production of pellets peaked in 2010 at 140 million tonnes.
CRU estimates that since 2016 China has closed approximately 60 million tonnes of pelletising capacity which was considered to be obsolete.
Ferrexpo believes there is a large range of mining operations in China with a wide spectrum of cost structures: however, the marginal cost to produce concentrate in China is estimated to be approximately US$70 per tonne compared to the average 62% Fe fines price in 2017 of US$71 per tonne.
As China is a large consumer of pellet, the high local cost of marginal pellet supply should support demand for imports of pellet.
The consumption of iron ore in 2017 was approximately 2 billion tonnes seeTable 1: Iron Ore Consumption on page 14 : a 1% increase in the proportion of pellet in the blast furnace burden mix would lead to an additional 20 million tonnes of pellet demand.
