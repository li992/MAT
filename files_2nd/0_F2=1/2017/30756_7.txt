This is tracked Group-wide in our scheduling and order fulfilment system.
This is measured through our We maintained our employee engagement Employee engagement employee opinion survey which score of 75 in 2017, which was the same 2017 75 produces a composite sustainable as in 2016.
However we fell short of our 75 2016 75 engagement score.
The targets target of 77. are based on absolute scores for six key questions within the overall survey.
These non-financial performance indicators are linked to our remuneration structure.
Notes 1 W e measure our order book at our long-term planning exchange rate LTPR and list prices and include both firm and announced orders.
In Civil Aerospace, it is common for a customer to take options for future orders in addition to firm orders placed.
Such options are excluded from the order book.
In Defence Aerospace, long-term programmes are often ordered for only one year at a time.
In such circumstances, even though there may be no alternative engine choice available to the customer, only the contracted business is included in the order book.
We only include the first seven years revenue from long-term aftermarket contracts.
2 Any orders which were recorded in previous periods and which are subsequently cancelled, reducing the order book, are included as a reduction to intake.
We measure order intake at constant exchange rates and list prices and, consistent with the order book policy of recording the first seven years revenue from long-term aftermarket contracts, include the addition of the following year of revenue on long-term aftermarket contracts.
3 Un derlying revenue is used as it reflects the impact of our foreign exchange FX hedging policy by valuing foreign currency revenue at the actual exchange rates achieved as a result of settling FX contracts in the year.
This provides a clearer measure of the year-on-year performance.
4 We measure R&D as the self-funded expenditure before both amounts capitalised in the year and amortisation of previously capitalised balances.
We expect to spend approximately 5% of underlying revenue on R&D although this proportion will fluctuate depending on the stage of development of current programmes.
We expect this proportion will reduce modestly over the medium-term.
5 A ll proposed investments are subject to rigorous review to ensure that they are consistent with forecast activity and will provide value for money.
We measure annual capital expenditure as the cost of property, plant and equipment acquired during the period and, over the medium-term, expect a proportion of around 4%.
Capital expenditure excludes additions arising from TotalCare Flex arrangements.
6 In particular: a revenue and costs denominated in US dollars and euros are presented on the basis of the exchange rates achieved during the year based on our FX hedge book: b similar adjustments are made in respect of commodity derivatives: and c consequential adjustments are made to reflect the impact of exchange rates on trading assets and liabilities, and long-term contracts, on a consistent basis.
7 We measure free cash flow as the movement in net debt funds during the year, before movements arising from payments to shareholders, acquisitions and disposals, and FX.
8 Organic change is at constant translational currency, excluding M&A.
