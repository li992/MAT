Financial Statements Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance Measures When assessing, discussing and measuring the Groups financial performance, management refer to measures used for internal performance management.
These measures are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and as such are considered to be Alternative Performance Measures APMs.
By their nature, APMs are not uniformly applied by all preparers including other participants in the Groups industry.
Accordingly APMs used by the Group may not be comparable to other companies within the Groups industry.
Purpose APMs are used by management to aid comparison and assess historical performance against internal performance benchmarks and across reporting periods.
These measures provide an ongoing and consistent basis to assess performance by excluding items that are materially non-recurring, uncontrollable or exceptional.
These measures can be classified in terms of their key financial characteristics: Profit measures allow management to assess and benchmark underlying business performance during the year.
They are primarily used by operational management to measure operating profit contribution and are also used by the Board to assess performance against business plan.
Capital measures allow management to track and assess the progress of the Groups significant ongoing investment in capital assets and projects against their investment cases, including the expected timing of their operational deployment.
Debt measures allow management to record and monitor both operating cash generation and the Groups ongoing financing and liquidity position.
The following table explains the key APMs applied by the Group and referred to in these statements: Closest Equivalent Group APM Purpose IFRS measure Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements Adjusted Profit measure Operating profit Movement on operating and financing derivatives operating profit certain remeasurements Exceptional items Share of joint ventures and associates interest and tax Adjusted profit Profit measure Profit before tax Movement on operating and financing derivatives certain before tax remeasurements Exceptional items Interest on net pension assets liabilities IAS 19R Share of joint ventures and associates tax Adjusted net Profit measure Net finance costs Movement on financing derivatives finance costs Share of joint ventures and associates interest Interest on net pension assets liabilities IAS 19R Adjusted current Profit measure Tax charge Share of joint ventures and associates tax tax charge Deferred tax including share of joint ventures and associates Tax on exceptional items and certain re-measurement Adjusted earnings Profit measure Earnings per share Exceptional items per share Movements on derivatives certain re-measurements Interest on net pension assets liabilities IAS 19R Deferred tax including share of joint ventures and associates Adjusted net debt and Debt measure Unadjusted net debt Hybrid capital hybrid capital Outstanding liquid funds Finance leases Non-recourse Clyde debt Investment and Capital measure Capital additions to Other expenditure capital expenditure intangible assets and Customer funded additions IFRIC 18 Adjusted property, plant and Allowances and certificates equipment Disposed additions Joint ventures and associates additions Where the Group have referred to an Alternative Performance Measure in the financial statements the following sign is presented to denote this.
101 Financial Statements Alternative Performance Measures continued Rationale for adjustments A Adjustments to profit measure 1 Movement on operating and financing derivatives certain re-measurements This adjustment can be split between operating and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives are where the Group enters into forward contracts to buy or sell electricity, gas and other commodities to meet the future demand requirements of its Energy Supply business or to optimise the value of its Wholesale assets.
Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IAS 39 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IAS 39 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements.
The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.
The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 18 months.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group to manage its banking and liquidity requirements as well as risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures.
Changes in the fair value of those financing derivatives are reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements.
The re-measurements arising from operating and financing derivatives, and the tax effects thereof, are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
2 Exceptional items Exceptional charges or credits, and the tax effects thereof, are considered unusual by nature or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the underlying performance of the Group to be properly understood.
Further explanation of the rationale for deciding whether an item is exceptional is included in Note 2 of the Financial Statements.
3 Share of joint ventures and associates interest and tax This adjustment can be split between the share of interest and the share of tax.
The Group is required to report profit before interest and tax operating profit including its share of the profit after tax of its equityaccounted joint ventures and associates.
However, for internal performance management purposes and for consistency of treatment, SSE reports its Adjusted profit measures before its share of the interest and or tax on joint ventures and associates.
4 Interest on net pension assets liabilities IAS 19R The Groups interest charges relating to defined benefit pension schemes are derived from the net assets liabilities of the schemes as valued under IAS 19R.
This will mean that the charge recognised in any given year will be dependent on the impact of actuarial assumptions such as inflation and discount rates.
To avoid income statement volatility derived from this basis of measurement and reflecting the non-cash nature of these charges, the Group excludes these from its Adjusted profit measures.
5 Deferred tax In line with its long standing approach, SSE adjusts for deferred tax when arriving at Adjusted profit after tax and its Adjusted effective rate of tax.
SSE believes consistency of presentation is essential for investors and other users of its statements and does not therefore believe that changing these measures would result in improved clarity or transparency.
B Adjustments to debt measure 6 Hybrid capital The characteristics of hybrid capital securities mean they qualify for recognition as equity rather than debt under IFRSs.
Consequently, their coupon payments are presented within dividends rather than within finance costs.
As a result, the coupon payments are not included in SSEs Adjusted PBT measure.
In order to present total funding provided from sources other than ordinary shareholders, SSE presents its Adjusted net debt measure inclusive of hybrid capital to better reflect the Groups funding position.
7 Outstanding liquid funds Outstanding liquid funds are SSE cash balances held by counterparties as collateral at the year end.
SSE includes these as cash until they are utilised.
Loans with a maturity of less than three months are also included in this adjustment.
The Group includes this adjustment in order to better reflect the immediate cash resources it has access, which in turn better reflects the Groups funding position.
8 Finance leases SSEs Reported loans and borrowings include finance lease liabilities, most significantly in relation to its tolling contract with Marchwood Power Limited, which are not directly related to the external financing of the Group.
The Group excludes these liabilities from its Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure to better reflect the Groups underlying funding position with its primary sources of capital.
Financial Statements 9 Non-recourse Clyde debt At 31 March 2016, prior to the change in consolidation treatment for the venture, an adjustment was made to exclude non-recourse debt associated with Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited.
Further explanation of the rationale is included in Note 4.2 iii.
C Adjustments to capex measure 10 Other expenditure Other expenditure primarily represents subsequently derecognised development expenditure which is excluded to better reflect the Groups underlying capital position.
11 Customer funded additions Customer funded additions represents additions to electricity and other networks funded by customer contributions and accounted for under IFRIC 18.
Given this is directly funded by customers, this has been excluded to better reflect the Groups underlying investment position.
12 Allowances and certificates Allowances and certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates ROCs and are not included in the Groups capital expenditure and investment Alternative Performance Measure to better reflect the Groups investment in enduring operational assets.
13 Disposed additions Disposed additions represents capital additions related to smart meter installations which were subsequently disposed to the Meter Fit 2 Limited see Note 12.
This has been excluded to better reflect the Groups net capital investment.
14 Joint ventures and associates additions Joint ventures and associates additions represent funding provided to joint venture arrangements in relation to capital expenditure projects.
This has been included to better reflect the Groups use of directly funded equity-accounted vehicles to grow the Groups asset base.
Project finance raised by the Groups joint ventures and associates is not included in this adjustment.
