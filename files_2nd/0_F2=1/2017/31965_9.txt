STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 14 Redrow plc Annual Report 2017 15 A better way to add value GENERATING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH FOR SHAREHOLDERS As we announce our seventh consecutive year of growth, Redrow continues to set the benchmark for delivering sustainable returns for our Shareholders.
All of our key indicators are up, from revenue and legal completions to earnings per share and dividends and the value of our order book.
We are contributing more to the UK economy, delivering more homes to meet the national housing shortage and helping more homebuyers than ever before.
We ensure that we grow in a carefully planned and sustainable way and in 2017 over 60% of plots added to our current land bank were converted from our forward land bank.
By doing this we are securing the future for our business, our employees and our investors.
This considered and responsible growth strategy means we can continually improve the returns for our Shareholders, without compromising the quality of our product, our commitment to our customers or our focus on sustainability.
By delivering solid, sustainable growth, at Redrow we reward our Shareholders, adding lasting value to their investment.
Our success is attributable to a robust business model implemented by a talented team of people across a well-structured divisional organisation.
