STRATEGIC REVIEW | Investment Manager's Report Investment Manager s Report Market Environment The U. S. loan market, as measured by the S&P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index the Index, returned 4.21% for 2017 with the majority of gains generated by income in what was predominantly a stable year for the asset class with limited variations in returns each quarter.
In the U. S. demand for loans was robust, with $116.7bn of inflows from collateralised loan obligation CLO managers and a further $14.1bn from retail funds.
For comparison, 2016 saw $71.4bn of inflows from CLO managers, and $5.4bn of inflows from retail funds.
For the majority of the year, demand exceeded supply, which meant that, similar to the previous year, a lot of the issuance that came to market was opportunistic, i. e. the repricing of existing facilities and owners looking to take dividends or draw small add on facilities.
The par amount outstanding of the Index stood at $959bn, having ended 2016 at $887bn and, within that, the average bid was 98.05 with 65.6% of issues priced at par or above, versus 68.31 % at the end of 2016.
By principal amount the trailing 12 month U. S. default rate ended 2017 at 2.1%, 50 basis points higher than the closing figure for 2016, but still comfortably below the 3.1% historical annual average.
In Europe, the S&P European Leveraged Loan Index ELLI returned 4.06% for 2017 all numbers excluding currency and the average bid closed the year at 99.43, up from 98.62 at the end of 2016.
Demand for loans continued to be strong and CLO issuance totalled 22bn for the year, a new post crisis high for the European market.
The par amount outstanding of the ELLI ended the year at 139bn, an increase from 114bn one year ago.
By principal amount, the trailing 12 month default was 1.11% at the end of December, down from 2.40% at the end of 2016.
Portfolio Management During 2017, the portfolio remained significantly weighted towards US Dollar issuance, which accounted for 88.64% of the portfolio at the end of the year.
The bond allocation was well within the 20% of NAV permitted, at 8.4%, as we remained focused on keeping duration low and limiting potential areas of volatility.
We continued to allocate to better rated assets and our share of BBB BB credits ended the year at 49.8%.
38.27% TOTAL RETURM SINCE INCEPTION1 1 Source: Neuberger Berman.
Total return: Cumulative $ NAV based retu s including di idends gross of fees Outlook Our outlook for the loan market remains positive.
At the start of 2018 the U. S. and European economies, revenue, earnings and cash flow metrics have continued to demonstrate improvement across the board.
Furthermore, recent U. S. corporate tax reform should provide a modest benefit to most companies that we are focused on.
The market today is pricing in approximately a 1.61 % imputed default rate, which is in line with our 2018 expectations of 1.5 - 2.5%.
We continue to believe that loans will be attractive given the returns on offer, the expected low volatility compared to other risk asset classes and their senior secured nature.
