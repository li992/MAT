Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39 Summary of Group results Strong financial performance with improved profit and returns on both statutory and underlying bases The Groups statutory profit before tax was 5,275 million, 24 per cent higher than in 2016 driven by increased underlying profit and lower volatility and other items which more than offset the increased PPI charge.
Statutory profit after tax increased by 41 per cent to 3,547 million 2016: 2,514 million and the return on tangible equity was 8.9 per cent.
Underlying profit was 8,493 million, 8 per cent higher than 2016 with higher income and positive operating jaws.
The underlying return on tangible equity increased to 15.6 per cent.
Underlying profit in the fourth quarter was 1,926 million, 7 per cent higher than the same period in 2016 with a 5 per cent increase in net income.
The balance sheet remains strong and the Group generated 245 basis points of CET1 capital in the year.
The pro forma CET1 ratio at 31 December 2017 after accruing for ordinary dividends and allowing for the share buyback was 13.9 per cent compared to 13.0 per cent pro forma after dividends and adjusting for MBNA at 31 December 2016.
The pro forma leverage ratio increased to 5.4 per cent 31 December 2016: 5.3 per cent and tangible net assets per share were 53.3 pence.
Given the strong capital generation in the year, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 2.05 pence per share, making a total ordinary dividend of 3.05 pence per share, an increase of 20 per cent on 2016 and in line with our progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.
In addition, the Board intends to implement a share buyback of up to 1 billion, equivalent to up to 1.4 pence per share.

Net income of 17,472 million was 5 per cent higher than in 2016 with an 8 per cent increase in net interest income, which included 430 million from MBNA, and a 2 per cent increase in other income, while operating lease depreciation increased 18 per cent reflecting fleet growth in Lex Autolease.
Net interest income increased by 885 million to 12,320 million.
The net interest margin increased by 15 basis points to 2.86 per cent reflecting lower deposit and wholesale funding costs, which more than offset continued pressure on asset margins and also included a 7 basis points benefit from MBNA.
Average interest-earning assets were broadly unchanged with reductions in run-off, global corporates and the closed mortgage book offset by MBNA.
The Group expects the net interest margin for 2018 to be around 2.90 per cent, in line with the margin of 2.90 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017.
The Group manages the risk to its earnings and capital from movements in interest rates centrally by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates.
These liabilities include certain current account and savings balances, together with the Groups equity.
As at 31 December 2017 the Groups hedge had a nominal balance of 165 billion 31 December 2016: 111 billion, broadly in line with the underlying hedgeable balances.
The hedge had an average duration of around 3 years and a fixed earnings rate of approximately 1.1 per cent over LIBOR 2016: 1.6 per cent.
The benefit from the hedge in the year was 1.9 billion over LIBOR 2016: 1.7 billion.
Other income was 6,205 million, an increase of 2 per cent in the year.
The increase reflected continued growth in the Lex Autolease business, the 146million gain on sale of the Groups interest in Vocalink and 274 million 2016:112million of gains from the sale of 14 billion of gilts and other available-for-sale assets 2016:c. 5billion.
The increase was partly offset by lower income from the run-off portfolio and reduced income from bulk annuities reflecting the timing of transactions.
Operating costs 2017 2016 Change million million % Operating costs 8,184 8,093 1 Cost:income ratio 46.8% 48.7% 1.9 pp Operating jaws 4% Simplification savings annual run-rate 1,422 947 Operating costs at 8,184 million increased slightly during the year, but excluding MBNA costs of 135 million fell 1 per cent.
Savings from Simplification more than offset increased investment in the business and inflation.
In 2017 the Group continued to focus on tight cost control while investing significant amounts in developing its digital capability, improving the branch network and simplifying processes.
The Simplification programme has achieved the annual run-rate savings target of 1.4 billion since 2014, ahead of the original 1 billion target.
Our market leading cost:income ratio continues to provide competitive advantage and improved further to 46.8 per cent with positive operating jaws of 4per cent.
The Group expects operating costs of less than 8 billion in 2020: the Group also expects the cost:income ratio to improve every year and reach the low 40s exiting 2020, including future remediation costs.

The impairment charge increased to 795 million from 645 million in 2016, reflecting lower releases and write-backs and the consolidation of MBNA.
The asset quality ratio increased from 15 basis points to 18 basis points reflecting the expected lower provision write-backs and releases while the gross asset quality ratio was stable year-on-year at 28 basis points including the 2 basis points impact of MBNA in 2017.
The Group expects an asset quality ratio of around 35 basis points through the cycle and less than 30 basis points through the plan period and in 2018.
The Group continues to expect the asset quality to remain strong but with further reductions in releases and write-backs, however, following the implementation of IFRS 9, the Group anticipates some additional volatility in impairment.
Total impaired loans fell by 0.7 billion to 7.8 billion 31 December 2016: 8.5 billion and represent 1.6 per cent of closing advances to customers 31December 2016: 1.8 per cent.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increased to 45.6 per cent 31 December 2016: 43.4 per cent.
Overall credit performance in the UK Retail mortgage book remains stable.
The average indexed loan to value LTV improved to 43.6 per cent 31December 2016: 44.0 per cent and the value of lending with an indexed LTV of greater than 80 per cent fell to 30.7 billion 31 December 2016: 32.4billion.
Impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances were 1.3 per cent 31 December 2016: 1.4 per cent.
The UK Motor Finance book continues to benefit from conservative residual values and prudent provisioning and impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances were stable at 1.0 per cent.
The credit card book also continued to perform strongly with the MBNA portfolio performing in line with the Groups expectations.
Impaired credit card balances as a percentage of closing advances improved to 2.3 per cent 31 December 2016: 3.1 per cent.
The Commercial Banking portfolio continues to benefit from effective risk management, a resilient economic environment and continued low interest rates.
Impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances reduced to 1.9 per cent 31 December 2016: 2.1 per cent.

Statutory profit after tax increased by 41 per cent to 3,547 million 2016: 2,514 million.
The charge of 790 million for Enhanced Capital Notes in 2016 represented the write-off of the embedded derivative and premium paid on redemption of the remaining notes.
Market volatility and asset sales of 279 million included positive insurance volatility of 286 million.
The credit of 439 million in 2016 included the 484million gain on sale of the Groups interest in Visa Europe.
Amortisation of purchased intangibles was lower at 91 million 2016: 340 million as certain intangible assets are now fully amortised.
Restructuring costs were 621 million 2016: 622 million and included costs relating to the Simplification programme, the rationalisation of the non-branch property portfolio, implementation of the ring-fencing requirements and MBNA integration costs.
The PPI charge of 1,650 million included an additional 600 million in the fourth quarter reflecting an increase in expected weekly complaints from 9,000 to 11,000, which is the average level of complaints for the last nine months.
The outstanding balance sheet provision at 31 December 2017 was 2.4 billion.
The other conduct provisions of 865 million included an additional 325 million charged in the fourth quarter which covers a number of items including packaged bank accounts, arrears handling and smaller legacy issues.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41 Taxation The tax expense was 1,728 million 2016: 1,724 million representing an effective tax rate of 33 per cent 2016: 41 per cent.
The high effective tax rate largely reflects the restrictions on deductibility of conduct provisions and the banking surcharge.
The effective tax rate of 41 per cent in 2016 was higher as it also included the negative impact on the net deferred tax asset of both the change in corporation tax rate and the expected utilisation by the insurance business.
The Group expects the effective tax rate to reduce to around 25 per cent by 2020.
Return on tangible equity The underlying return on tangible equity increased to 15.6 per cent 2016: 14.1 per cent primarily reflecting increased underlying profit.
The return on tangible equity was 8.9 per cent up from 6.6 per cent in 2016, reflecting the increase in statutory profit after tax.
Going forward the Group remains confident in its future prospects and expects the return on tangible equity to trend towards the underlying level and expects to generate a statutory return on tangible equity of between 14.0 and 15.0 per cent in 2019, on a higher capital base.

3 Excludes balances relating to margins of 2.1 billion 31 December 2016: 3.2 billion and settlement accounts of 1.5 billion 31 December 2016: 1.8 billion.
Loans and advances to customers increased by 1 per cent to 456 billion compared with 450 billion at 31 December 2016 mainly due to the acquisition of the MBNA prime credit card portfolio 8 billion, growth in the open mortgage book, UK Motor Finance and SME, partly offset by reductions in run-off and the closed mortgage book.
The loan to deposit ratio was broadly stable at 110 per cent.
Wholesale funding reduced by 9 per cent to 101 billion compared with 111 billion at 31December 2016.
In addition, the Group made use of central bank funding schemes and by the end of 2017 the Group had fully utilised its 20 billion capacity from the Bank of Englands Term Funding Scheme.
The Groups liquidity surplus exceeds the regulatory minimum and internal risk appetite with a Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 127 per cent based on the EUDelegated Act at 31 December 2017.

42 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of Group results continued The Groups CET1 ratio has strengthened to 15.5 per cent on a pro forma basis before ordinary dividends and the share buyback.
After ordinary dividends and allowing for the share buyback, the CET1 ratio remains strong at 13.9 per cent.
The Group generated 245 basis points of CET1 capital pre ordinary dividends and share buyback in the year.
This included c. 250 basis points from underlying capital generation: the Group also had a benefit of c. 80 basis points from the reduction in risk-weighted assets and c. 40 basis points from market and other movements, which were offset by the c. 120 basis point impact of conduct provisions.
The Group remains highly capital generative and continues to expect ongoing capital generation of 170 to 200 basis points per annum.
As reported in the Q3 IMS, the Groups Pillar 2A CET1 requirement has increased by 0.5 per cent to 3 per cent.
In addition, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer on UK exposures will be introduced during 2018 and the Systemic Risk Buffer will come into effect in early 2019.
The Group is also pleased to announce that the PRA has now completed its annual review of the Groups PRA Buffer requirement.
As a consequence, the Boards view of the level of CET1 capital required is c. 13 per cent plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.
The Groups CET1 ratio as at 31 December 2017, including the Insurance dividend and after the ordinary dividend and allowing for the share buyback, was 13.9 per cent.
The Groups total capital ratio remains strong at 21.2 per cent which, when combined with eligible senior unsecured securities issued by Lloyds Banking Group plc, has left the Group well positioned to meet its Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities MREL from 2020.
The leverage ratio on a pro forma basis increased to 5.4 per cent 31 December 2016: 5.3 per cent, largely reflecting both the increase in fully loaded tier 1 capital and reductions in balance sheet assets.
Tangible net assets per share at 31 December 2016 was 54.8 pence, or 53.4 pence after adjusting for the acquisition of MBNA.
The movement from the adjusted 2016 tangible net assets per share to 53.3 pence at 31 December 2017 comprises an increase of 3.1 pence due to the strong financial performance offset by a reduction of 3.2 pence for dividends paid during the year.
Dividend The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 2.05 pence per share.
This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 1.0 pence per share that was announced at the 2017 half year results.
The total ordinary dividend per share for 2017 of 3.05 pence per share has increased by 20 per cent from 2.55 pence per share in 2016.
The Board continues to give due consideration at each year end to the return of any surplus capital and for 2017, the Board intends to implement a share buyback of up to 1 billion, equivalent to up to 1.4 pence per share.
This represents the return of capital over and above the Boards view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties.
The share buyback programme will commence in March 2018 and is expected to be completed during the next 12 months.
Given the total ordinary dividend of 3.05 pence per share and the intended share buyback, equivalent to up to 1.4 pence per ordinary share, the total capital return for 2017 will be up to 4.45 pence per share, an increase of up to 46 per cent on the prior year, equivalent to up to 3.2 billion.
In prior years, the Board has distributed surplus capital by means of a special dividend.
The Boards current preference is to return surplus capital by way of a buyback programme given the amount of surplus capital 1 billion in 2017 versus 350 million in 2016, the normalisation of ordinary dividends, our return to full private ownership and the flexibility that a buyback programme offers.
The Group intends to maintain a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.
The rate of growth of the ordinary dividend will be decided by the Board in light of circumstances at the time and, having grown very significantly in the last three years, going forward the ordinary dividend is likely to grow at a more normalised rate, whilst being supplemented by buybacks or special dividends.
Pensions The Group's defined benefit schemes have been significantly derisked over recent years including being materially hedged for both interest rates andinflation.
Terms have now been agreed in principle with the Trustee in respect of the valuations of the Groups three main defined benefit pension schemes.
The valuations showed an aggregate ongoing funding deficit of 7.3 billion as at 31 December 2016 5.2 billion deficit at 30 June 2014.
The increase in the ongoing deficit over the period was mainly driven by lower gilt yields, offset primarily by hedging and asset returns.
Under the previous recovery plans, deficit contributions were committed of 0.3 billion in 2018 and 2019 and c. 0.9 billion per annum thereafter.
Under the new recovery plans, deficit contributions of 0.4 billion are payable in 2018, 0.6 billion in 2019, 0.8 billion in 2020 and 1.3 billion per annum from 2021 to 2024.
The Group also continues to provide security to these pension schemes, with corporate guarantees and collateral pledged, while also making additional annual contributions for future service.
All of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes will be located within the ring-fenced bank and these revised contributions are included in the Groups latest capital guidance.
Ring-fencing The Group is making good progress with the implementation of its ring-fencing programme, including the establishment of the non ring-fenced bank, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc LBCM, and remains on track to meet the legal and regulatory requirements by 1 January 2019.
As a predominantly UK retail and commercial bank, the impact on the Group is relatively limited, with minimal impact for the majority of the Groups retail and commercial customers.
Over the course of 2018, in order to comply with the ring-fencing legislation, certain businesses will be transferred out of Lloyds Bank plc and its subsidiaries to other parts of the Group, by means of statutory or contractual transfers.
This will include the transfer of certain wholesale and international businesses to Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets and the transfer of Scottish Widows Group and other insurance subsidiaries to Lloyds Banking Group plc.
Due to the Groups UK retail and commercial focus, the vast majority of the Groups business will continue to be held by Lloyds Bank plc and its subsidiaries together the ring-fenced bank and as a result these transfers will not have a material impact on the financial strength of Lloyds Bank plc.
IFRS 9 The Group implemented IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 January 2018.
The adoption of the new Standard resulted in a reduction in shareholders equity of 1.2 billion largely reflecting an increase in impairment provisions of 1.3 billion.
The impact on the Groups CET1 capital ratio before transitional relief at 1 January 2018 was a reduction of c. 30 basis points after taking account of the offset against regulatory expected losses.
After transitional relief the impact was c. 1 basis point.
Other matters In 2014 the FCA removed the requirement to publish quarterly interim management statements, however the Group has continued to publish detailed statements.
Going forward, given the simple and more stable nature of the Groups business, we will review the length and content of the Q1 and Q3 interim management statements.
