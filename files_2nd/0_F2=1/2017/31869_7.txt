Looking at the largest holdings, there are three consumer staples companies among our top five: British American Tobacco, Diageo and Unilever.
These are global companies with strong positions in developed markets as well as emerging markets.
Their share prices have performed well over the years but we are confident that this should continue as they steadily grow their profits and dividends backed by strong brands.
The value in Unilever was highlighted by the takeover approach it received from Kraft Heinz of the US.
Oil companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP are among the ten largest investments in the portfolio.
Both companies are adapting toa lower oil price environment by signicantly reducing their costs.
