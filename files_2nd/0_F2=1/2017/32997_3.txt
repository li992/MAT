Outlook There are several themes in the outlook for TRIG.
The first is sustained competition to invest in renewables assets, primarily because of the ongoing shift in institutional allocations to the infrastructure sector, including renewables, one of its largest sub-sectors.
Whilst positive for valuations, the challenge is to seek value where possible whilst maintaining a disciplined approach to investment.
Helen Mahy CBE TRIG has invested successfully in the construction phase of Chairman renewables.
By investing at construction, we expect TRIG should be able leverage the expertise of its Managers to 19 February 2018 access further opportunities in a less crowded portion of the market offering an attractive risk-adjusted return.
The second theme is shaping TRIGs portfolio around the evolution of the energy market.
This may involve looking at newer energy segments and technologies where the risk-return parameters are in line with TRIGs Investment Policy and objectives.
The Company has made no new material solar investments during 2017 mainly as a result of signicantly reduced deal volumes in the UK and high pricing in France.
However, the scale and maturity of offshore wind in the UK and Northern Europe together with its reduced operational risk have made it an attractive new investment segment for TRIG.
Utility-scale power storage - a small-scale technology a few years ago - is emerging as its reduced costs and exibility mean that it provides value to the grid networks alongside intermittent renewables.

The opening valuation at 31 December 2016 was 818.7 million.
Allowing for investments of 229.9 million and cash receipts from investments of 73.0 million, the rebased valuation is 975.6 million.
Investments of 229.9 million in the year comprised the following: a 102.8 million investment in Garreg Lwyd wind farm: a 22.6 million investment in Neilston Community wind farm: a 1.1 million investment in the freehold land interest at the Marvel Farms solar park: a 2.4 million true-up payment payable in relation to the Meikle Carewe and Tallentire Wind Farms following increased post acquisition yields: a 20.4 million investment in the Broxburn battery energy storage project: a 79.5 million 14.7% investment in the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm: and a 1.0 million follow-on investment in the TRIG Akuo holding company to enable it to buy out minority investors in the Marie Galante solar park in Guadeloupe.

qxp Layout 1 2 19 18 9:43 PM Page 29 Each movement between the rebased valuation of 975.6 million and the 31 December 2017 valuation of 1081.2 million is considered in turn below: i Forecast power prices: Overall net reductions in power price forecasts during the year had the impact of reducing the valuation of the portfolio by a net 56.1 million.
The valuation uses updated power price forecasts for each of the markets in which TRIG invests, namely the GB market, the Irish Single Electricity Market, and the French market.
The main driver reducing the forecast power prices continues to be reduced gas prices, both in the near term as global gas prices remain subdued and in the longer term as forecasters adopt slightly lower projections of future gas prices.
In addition, the forecasters assume a lower carbon cost over the medium term resulting from faster than previously assumed renewables deployment.
The weighted-average power price used to determine the Directors valuation is shown below in real terms this is comprised of the blend of forecasts for each of the three power markets in which TRIG is invested after applying expected PPA power sales discounts and reecting cannibalisation.
The forecast assumes an increase in power prices in real terms over time.
The equivalent power price curve assumed at 31 December 2016 is also shown.
1 Illustrative blended power price curve real prices for TRIGs portfolio 70 60 50 40 30 20 Dec-16 10 Dec-17 0 18 23 28 33 38 Year 1 Power price forecasts used in the Directors valuation for each of GB, the Single Electricity Market of Ireland and France are based on analysis by the Investment Manager using data from leading power market advisers.
In the illustrative blended price curve, the power price forecasts are weighted by P50 estimates of production for each of the projects in the Companys 31 December 2017 Portfolio.
Forecasts are shown net of assumptions for PPA discounts and cannibalisation.
ii Reduction in valuation discount rates: During the year, there has continued to be strong demand for income-producing infrastructure assets, including renewable energy projects, as the market continues to mature with more investors seeking to gain exposure.
This has resulted in a continued reduction in the prevailing discount rates applied for renewables investments which partially offsets the impact of the net overall reductions in power price forecasts.
Overall the Investment Manager, based on its experience of bidding and transacting in the secondary market for renewable infrastructure assets, has applied an average reduction of 0.4% in discount rates in the year a 0.2% reduction was applied in the first half of the year and a further 0.2% reduction has been applied at the year-end.
This change in assumption has led to an increase in the valuation of the investments of 23.9 million.
The weighted average portfolio valuation discount rate at 31 December 2017 was 8.0% 31 December 2016: 8.4%.
The reduction reects the market discount rate compression described above.
The impact of acquisitions in the year has been neutral because their returns have, on a weighted average basis, been similar to the portfolio average discount rate.
The discount rate used for valuing each investment represents an assessment of the rate of return at which infrastructure investments with similar risk proles would trade on the open market.

qxp Layout 1 2 19 18 9:43 PM Page 30 SECTION 2 Strategic Report continued iii Changes in macroeconomic assumptions: Changes in tax rates in France: The valuation of the French investments, which comprised 12% of the portfolio at the year end, has increased by 10.9 million as a result of the phased reduction in the corporation tax rate from 33% to 28% over the period to 2020, a further planned phased reduction in the corporation tax rate from 28% to 25% between 2020 and 2022 as well as the repeal of the 3% dividend tax.
Ination assumptions: The level of ination that has been applied to expected UK ROC revenues has been increased from 2.75% to 3.4% in 2018 and 2.9% in 2019 reecting current higher than trend domestic ination before reverting to the longterm assumption of 2.75%.
The level of ination that has been applied to project income and costs in France and Ireland has been reduced 2.0% to 1.5% in 2018 and 1.75% in 2019 reecting current lower than trend EU ination before reverting to the long-term assumption of 2.0%.
The combined impact of the changes in ination assumptions adopted has been to increase the valuation by 9.8 million.
Foreign exchange: Weakening of sterling in the year versus the euro has led to a 5.3 million gain on foreign exchange in the period in relation to the euro-denominated investments located in France and the Republic of Ireland, which reduces to a 3.4 million gain after the impact of hedges as stated below.
At 31 December 2017, euro-denominated investments comprised 13% of the portfolio.
As sterling depreciated the currency hedge incurred a 1.9 million loss in the year to 31 December 2017 and serves to reduce the sensitivity to movements in the euro sterling exchange rate.
The euro-denominated assets saw a 5.3 million foreign exchange gain.
However, the overall positive impact on net assets of the foreign exchange movement was 3.4 million after netting off the 1.9 million impact of the foreign exchange hedge.
iv Balance of portfolio return: This refers to the balance of valuation movements in the year excluding i to iii above and represents an uplift of 111.8 million.
This represents an 11.5% increase over the rebased value of the portfolio.
The balance of portfolio return mostly reects the net present value of the cash ows brought forward by a year at the average prevailing portfolio discount rate around 8.2% as this reduced during the year and also some additional valuation adjustments.
These include reduced maintenance costs and improving PPA as these markets become more competitive.
The outperformance also recognises renance gains as some of the older project debt packages can be renanced with new long-term debt on more favourable terms such as the renancing of a portfolio of three UK solar projects during the year.
Valuation Sensitivities The Investment Manager has provided sensitivity analysis to show the impact of changes in key assumptions adopted to arrive at the valuation.
For each of the sensitivities, it is assumed that potential changes occur independently of each other with no effect on any other base case assumption, and that the number of investments in the portfolio remains static throughout the modelled life.
All of the NAV per share sensitivities assume 947.3 million ordinary shares as at 31 December 2017 which includes those in issue as well as approximately 0.9 million shares due to be issued in March 2018 as part-payment of the Managers fees.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in key assumptions as follows: Discount rate assumptions The weighted average valuation discount rate applied to calculate the portfolio valuation is 8.0% at 31 December 2017.
The sensitivity shows the impact on valuation of increasing or decreasing this rate by 0.5%.
Discount rate sensitivity -0.5% Base 8.0% 0.5% Change in Portfolio Valuation 38.9m 1,081.2m -37.8m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share 4.1p share -4.0p share Energy yield assumptions The table below shows the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in the energy yield applied to cash ows from project companies in the portfolio.
The terms P90, P50 and P10 are explained below.
Energy yield sensitivity P90 10-year Base P50 P10 10-year Change in Portfolio Valuation -108.3m 1,081.2m 104.7m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -11.4p share 11.1p share The base case assumes a P50 level of output.
The P50 output is the estimated annual amount of electricity generation in MWh that has a 50% probability of being exceeded both in any single year and over the long term and a 50% probability of being under achieved.
Hence the P50 is the expected level of generation over the long term.
30 TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 248194 Renewable R&A pp021-pp032.
qxp Layout 1 2 19 18 9:43 PM Page 31 The sensitivity illustrates the effect of assuming P90 10-year a downside case and P10 10-year an upside case energy production scenarios.
A P90 10-year downside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 90% probability of being exceeded over a 10-year period.
A P10 10-year upside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 10% probability of being exceeded over a 10-year period.
This means that the portfolio aggregate production outcome for any given 10-year period would be expected to fall somewhere between these P90 and P10 levels with an 80% confidence level, with a 10% probability of it falling below that range of outcomes and a 10% probability of it exceeding that range.
The sensitivity includes the portfolio effect which reduces the variability because of the diversication of the portfolio.
The sensitivity is applied throughout the life of each asset in the portfolio even where this exceeds 10 years.
Power price assumptions The sensitivity considers a at 10% movement in power prices for all years, i. e. the effect of adjusting the forecast electricity price assumptions in each of the jurisdictions applicable to the portfolio down by 10% and up by 10% from the base case assumptions for each year throughout the operating life of the portfolio.
Power price sensitivity -10% Base 10% Change in Portfolio Valuation -79.1m 1,081.2m 81.1m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -8.3p share 8.6p share Ination assumptions The projects income streams are principally a mix of subsidies, which are amended each year with ination, and power prices, which the sensitivity assumes will move with ination.
The projects management, maintenance and tax expenses typically move with ination, but debt payments are xed.
This results in the portfolio returns and valuation being positively correlated to ination.
The portfolio valuation assumes 2.75% p. a. ination for the UK and 2.0% p. a. for each of France and Ireland over the long term.
The sensitivity illustrates the effect of a 0.5% decrease and a 0.5% increase from the assumed annual ination rates in the financial model for each year throughout the operating life of the portfolio.
Ination rate sensitivity -0.5% Base 0.5% Change in Portfolio Valuation -43.5m 1,081.2m 50.8m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -4.6p share 5.4p share Operating costs at project company level The sensitivity shows the effect of a 10% decrease and a 10% increase to the base case for annual operating costs for the portfolio, in each case assuming that the change to the base case for operating costs occurs with effect from 1 January 2018 and that change to the base case remains reected consistently thereafter during the life of the projects.
Operating cost sensitivity -10% Base 10% Change in Portfolio Valuation 41.5m 1,081.2m -42.0m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share 4.4p share -4.4p share Euro sterling exchange rates The sensitivity shows the effect of a 10% decrease and a 10% increase in the value of the euro relative to sterling used for the 31 December 2017 valuation based on a 31 December 2017 exchange rate of 1.1252 to 1.
In each case it is assumed that the change in exchange rate occurs from 1 January 2018 and thereafter remains constant at the new level throughout the life of the projects.
At the year-end, 13% of the portfolio was located in France and Ireland comprising euro-denominated assets.
The Group has entered into forward hedging of the expected euro distributions for the next 18 months and in addition placed further hedges to reach a position where approximately 50% of the valuation of euro-denominated assets is hedged.
The hedge reduces the sensitivity of the portfolio value to foreign exchange movements and accordingly the impact is shown net of the benefit of the foreign exchange hedge in place.
Exchange rate sensitivity -10% Base 10% Change in Portfolio Valuation -6.2m 1,081.2m 6.2m Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -0.7p share 0.7p share The euro sterling exchange rate sensitivity does not attempt to illustrate the indirect inuences of currencies on UK power prices which are interrelated with other inuences on power prices.

The change is assumed with effect from 1 January 2018 and continues unchanged throughout the life of the assets.
The portfolio is relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates.
This is an advantage of TRIGs approach of favouring long-term structured project nancing over shorter-term corporate debt which is secured with the substantial majority of this debt having the benefit of long-term interest rate swaps which x the interest cost to the projects.

Being investment entities, The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Limited TRIG UK and The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Investments Limited TRIG UK I, the Companys subsidiaries, through which investments are purchased, are measured at fair value as opposed to being consolidated on a line-by-line basis, meaning their cash, debt and working capital balances are included as an aggregate number in the fair value of investments rather than the Groups current assets.
In order to provide shareholders with more transparency into the Groups capacity for investment, ability to make distributions, operating costs and gearing levels, adjusted results have been reported in the pro forma tables below.

Analysis of Expanded Basis Financial Results profit before tax for the year to 31 December 2017 was 90.2 million, generating earnings per share of 9.8p, which compares to 67.9 million and earnings per share of 8.8p for the year to 31 December 2016.
The EPS of 9.8p is after the impact of reductions in power prices in the year offset by reduced valuation discount rates, beneficial movements in macroeconomic assumptions and valuation enhancements driven predominantly from expected maintenance costs reductions, improving PPA terms and renance gains.
Portfolio value movements which make up operating income are more fully described in Section 2.8 of this Strategic Report.
Increases in both net operating income and fund expenses in the year to 31 December 2017 as compared to the year to 31 December 2016 reect the increase in the size of the portfolio.
Acquisition costs relate to three wind farm investments and one battery storage facility in the year, being Garreg Lwyd, Neilston, Sheringham Shoal and Broxburn.

The slight strengthening of the euro against sterling from 0.854 at the end of 2016 to 0.889 at the end of 2017 has increased the value of the euro-denominated assets in the TRIG investment portfolio, with foreign exchange gains recognised in the portfolio of 5.7 million 2016: 16.0 million gain.
This was partially offset by the foreign exchange losses on hedges held outside the portfolio of 1.8 million 2016: 7.1 million loss.

TRIGs approach to risk is one of systematic assessment, on an investment project basis on acquisition, and as part of the overall portfolio management over time as external dynamics shift.
