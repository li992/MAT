It is an investment trust run for private investors, who may often have committed to it a substantial proportion of their personal wealth.
Its investment policy is to protect and increase in that order the value of shareholders funds per share over the long term.
It differs from other investment trusts in that its activities are defined not by any particular portfolio specialisation or investment method but by a desire to satisfy the personal requirements of those who invest in it.
This is reflected in the Boards statement that our specialisation will be our shareholders.
For further details of the Investment Policy please see the Strategic Report on pages 4-6.
The Companys policy is to ensure that its shares always trade at close to net asset value through a combination of share buybacks at a small discount to net asset value and the issue of new or Treasury shares at a small premium to net asset value where demand exceeds supply.
This discount and premium control policy is enshrined in the Articles of Association of the Company.
