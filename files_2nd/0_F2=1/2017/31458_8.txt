ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING Additive manufacturing AM is an entirely new way of thinking about how to design and make products.
With total control over material properties and almost no design restrictions, AM is set to transform the world around us.
Also called 3D printing, AM allows engineers to GKN Aerospace deliver improvements in product performance, reliability, cost and weight by designing Aerospace is the largest market for additive components that are either built layer-by-layer manufacturing, with expected growth of with virtually no waste at all, or by adding 26% per year through 2025. precise shapes onto existing components to Today, GKN Aerospace has additive create new, unique and complex geometries.
components flying on seven aircraft platforms, GKNs expertise in AM manufacturing enables including the A350 XWB, the Saab Gripen transformative solutions, certified to the most fighter jet and the NH90 helicopter, and rigorous industry and customer standards, expertise in multiple AM processes.
and enables customers to overcome the We are at the forefront of freeform deposition, most complex design challenges.
a technique which builds metal structures by using a laser to melt metal wire or powder onto a substrate layer-by-layer to specific geometries specified by a CAD model.
GKN typically uses freeform deposition for large Laser-blown welding on a commercial engine and airframe structures.
technologies fuse fine metal powder together, allowing the manufacture of complex optimised small components.
GKN has been leading the additive manufacturing revolution for years, and is today partnering with other aerospace industry experts to progress innovations in this field.
