Cost of funds stood at 4.7% in 2017 flat y-o-y.
Despite the significant increase in cost of debt securities issued in 2017 following the issuance of GEL 500 million 11.0% Lari-denominated notes in 2Q17 up 60bps y-o-y in 2017, cost of funds remained largely flat as a result of a decrease in the cost of client deposits and notes down 30 bps y-o-y in 2017 Continued shift to the GEL-denominated loan book, which increased to 38.3% of the total book at 31 December 2017, compared to 28.7% a year ago.
The dollarisation of our loan book has decreased since last year as the demand for local currency denominated loans outpaced the demand for foreign currency denominated loans.
The trend was supported by the Georgian Governments fide-dollarisation initiatives: a a one-off programme, effective from 15 January 2017 to 25 March 2017, allowing qualified borrowers to convert eligible Dollar-denominated loans into GEL, at a discount compensated by the Government, at the clients election and b a new regulation, effective from 15 January 2017, restricting issuance of new loans in foreign currency with amounts less than GEL 100,000 equivalent Net loans to customer funds and DFI ratio.

As a result, our Net loans to customer funds and DFI ratio, which is closely monitored by management, remained strong at 92.4% 94.9% at 31 December 2016 despite the strong growth of the loan book Net fee and commission income.
Net fee and commission income performance is mainly driven by the strong performance in our settlement operations supported by the success of our Express Banking franchise.
This was partially offset by a decline in CIBs fees from guarantees and letters of credit reflecting the fide-concentration of our corporate risk Net banking foreign currency gain.
In line with the volatility of the GEL exchange rate, the net banking foreign currency gain was up 3.4% y-o-y in 2017.

Effective 31 December 2017, we switched to the cost model, whereby office buildings and service centres are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Prior to this change, we applied the revaluation model, where office buildings and service centres were carried at their fair value less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Valuations were performed once every three years.
We believe that cost model provides more reliable and more meaningful presentation to our investors as it 1 enhances comparability for the investors since the application of cost model is a market practice and global standard across the banking industry 2 more closely aligns the accounting with the business model around these asset categories.
The switch to cost model resulted in GEL 33.3 million decrease to Banking Business equity attributable to shareholders.
We have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected periods, while the change did not have any material impact on the income statement.
Banking Business ratios have been updated for the prior periods.
On 13 September 2017, Moodys upgraded JSC Bank of Georgias local-currency deposit rating to Ba2 from Ba3, and the Banks foreigncurrency deposit rating to Ba3 from B1.
The Banks senior unsecured foreign-currency rating was also upgraded to Ba2 from Ba3 with a stable outlook.
The Banks credit rating action followed Moodys upgrade of Georgias sovereign local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Ba2 from Ba3 on 11 September 2017.
Amendments to Capital Adequacy requirements.
To transition to Basel III, National Bank of Georgia NBG introduced new capital adequacy requirements in December 2017.
Bank of Georgia is required to maintain the following minimum capital requirements: Common Equity Tier 1 CET 1 ratio at 4.5% Tier 1 ratio at 6% Total Capital ratio at 8% The combined buffer requirement has also been introduced and Bank of Georgia is required to hold the following: Capital Conservation Buffer set at 2.5% Countercyclical Buffer set at 0% Systemic Capital Buffer of 0% for 2018, which will increase to 1% on 31 December 2018 and by an additional 0.5% annually until it reaches 2.5% on 31 December 2021 NBG also introduced Pillar 2 requirements.
The new regulation applicable to Bank of Georgia includes: Currency Induced Credit Risk CICR buffer, which substitutes current additional 75% weighting of FX denominated exposure.
A 56% of CICR buffer should be held on CET1 level, 75% on Tier 1 level and 100% on total capital Net GRAPE buffer expected to be set at 2.2% according to NBGs annual General Risk Assessment Program GRAPE.
The GRAPE buffer will be reviewed annually and phased-in on different levels of capital according to the below schedule: Feb-18 31-Dec-18 31-Dec-19 31-Dec-20 31-Dec-21 CET 1 0% 15% 30% 45% 56% Tier 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 75% Total Capital 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Credit Portfolio Concentration buffer, effective from 1 April 2018 and phased in over the four year period on different levels of capital according to the above schedule Net Stress Test buffer effective from 1 January 2020 In view of the above, the following overall capital requirements apply to Bank of Georgia at 31 December 2017: CET 1 ratio 8.1%, expected to increase to 9.5% on 31 December 2018 Tier 1 ratio 9.9%, expected to increase to 11.4% on 31 December 2018 Total Capital ratio 12.4%, expected to increase to 16.0% on 31 December 2018 Bank of Georgias capital ratios calculated as of 31 December 2017 were at 12.4% CET1 and Tier 1 and 17.9% Total Capital.
