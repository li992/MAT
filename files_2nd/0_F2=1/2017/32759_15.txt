Market overview Syncona seeks to invest in innovative areas of the life science sector.
Today, changing dynamics and new medical technologies are creating opportunities to revolutionise healthcare and vastly improve treatments and outcomes for patients.
On the verge of a healthcare revolution Changing dynamics in healthcare are driving growth in the life science industry and havethe potential to disrupt established business models.
A changing landscape From the post-war era until the early- 2000s, the pharmaceutical industry wentthrough a period of considerable expansion, fuelled by the discovery of numerous Small Molecule therapeutics, increasing internationalisation, and rapid population growth.
This period was dominated by Big Pharma, using industrial synthetic chemistry processes tocreate the blockbuster Small Molecule drugs drugs with sales of $1bn of the modern pharmaceutical industry.
By the mid-1990s, protein therapeutics entered the market as a new class ofdrugs.
These Large Molecules playawiderange of natural biological roles, andare often engineered specifically to treat diseases.
Today, the pharmaceutical industry is once again poised on the edge of a new wave of therapies developed from Advanced Biologics and Diagnostics, comprising technology such as cell therapy, gene Key periods of development therapy andDNA sequencing.
These approaches offer the potential toaddress areas of high unmet need, transform patient treatments and challenge the traditional operating models of the pharmaceutical sector.
Syncona describes First Wave Second Wave this as the Third Wave.
