Volatility arising in insurance businesses Volatility included in the Groups statutory results before tax comprises the following: 2017 2016 m m Insurance volatility 196 152 Policyholder interests volatility 190 241 Total volatility 386 89 Insurance hedging arrangements 100 180 Total 286 91 Insurance volatility The Groups insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments.
IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement.
The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments.
As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group.
Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the Insurance and Wealth divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition to results based on the actual return.
The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility.
