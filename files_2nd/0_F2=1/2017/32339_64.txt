The table on page 87 shows Openreachs service performance on a number of key measures known as Minimum Service Levels MSLs.
These are quality of service standards for installation and repair which are set by Ofcom and increase annually.
In May 2016, six Ethernet MSLs were added to the existing set of 60 copper MSLs.

This year we exceeded all 40 of Ofcoms copper MSLs that were due in the year, for the third year in a row.
And we remain ahead on the other 20 which are measured to March 2018.
We keep making progress with our Ethernet delivery, improving quality of service, providing more Ethernet circuits than ever before, and reducing the average age and number of jobs in our workstack.
Even so, were disappointed that weve missed one of the Ethernet MSLs due to the impact of our most complex Ethernet orders, where we experience delays that arent fully within our control such as road traffic management.
