Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs In its financial reporting, the Group uses certain measures that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP under which the Group produces its statutory financial information.
These APMs are not a substitute, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance.
They are used as Management considers them to be an important means of comparing performance year-on-year and are key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
The Group makes adjustments to results reported under IFRS to exclude specific items and the pension charge to cash difference adjustment see definitions below.
Management believes this is a more meaningful basis upon which to analyse the business performance in particular given the volatile nature of the IAS 19 charge and is consistent with the way financial performance is reported to the Board.
IFRS can have the impact of causing high levels of volatility in reported earnings which do not relate to changes in the operations of the Company.
Management has reviewed the long term differences between reported and adjusted profit after tax.
Cumulative reported profit after taxation for the five years ended March 2017 was 2,632 million.
Cumulative adjusted profit after tax was 1,820 million.
Annual reported profit after tax showed a range of 222 million to 1,280 million.
The principal cause of the difference and volatility is due to pension-related accounting.
APMs should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute to, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.
Where appropriate, reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure have been provided.
The APMs used may not be directly comparable with similarly titled APMs used by other companies.
Presentation of results Re-presentation of 2015-16 results As a result of the acquisition of the minority shareholding in Romec Limited 'Romec' on 31March 2016, the external revenues, costs and profits of Romec, previously reported in the Other segment, have been incorporated into UKPIL for 2016-17.
As a result, 5 million of Romec revenue in 2015-16 is now reported within letters and other revenue.
The 141 million facilities management charge previously included within infrastructure costs has been reallocated between people and non-people costs.
UKPIL operating profit in 2015-16 increased by 17 million as a result.
There is no impact on Group operating profit.
Both the Group and UKPIL operating costs for 2015-16 have been re-presented to reflect these changes as shown below: Adjusted 52 weeks ended Re-presented 52 weeks 27March 2016 Romec adjustment ended 27March 2016 m m m Group Revenue 9,251 9,251 Operating costs 8,509 8,509 People 5,199 5,199 Non-people 3,310 3,310 Distribution and conveyance costs 1,736 1,736 Infrastructure costs 995 141 854 Other operating costs 579 141 720 Operating profit before transformation costs 742 742 UKPIL Revenue 7,666 5 7,671 Operating cost 7,058 12 7,046 People 4,764 77 4,841 Non-people 2,294 89 2,205 Distribution and conveyance costs 776 776 Infrastructure costs 890 141 749 Other operating costs 628 52 680 Operating profit before transformation costs 608 17 625 Other Revenue 5 5 Operating cost 12 12 People 77 77 Non-people 89 89 Distribution and conveyance costs Infrastructure costs Other operating costs 89 89 Operating profit before transformation costs 17 17 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 | 33 Royal Mail plc | Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs Adjusted results The following table reconciles the reported results, prepared in accordance with IFRS, to the adjusted results.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA before transformation costs Adjusted EBITDA before transformation costs is reported EBITDA before transformation costs with the pension charge to cash difference added back.
EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of operating performance because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation, amortisation and the performance of associate companies.

The 2015-16 UKPIL results have been re-presented to reflect this change.

A reconciliation of this number to reported basic earnings per share is included in the adjusted results table on page34.
Operating specific items These are recurring or non-recurring items of income or expense of a particular size and or nature relating to the operations of the business that in Managements opinion require separate identification.
These include items that have resulted from events that are non-recurring in nature, even though related income expense can be recognised in subsequent periods.
Non-operating specific items These are recurring or non-recurring items of income or expense of a particular size and or nature which do not form part of the Groups trading activity and in Managements opinion require separate identification.
Further details of specific items can be found on page 27.
Pension charge to cash difference adjustment This adjustment represents the difference between the IFRS income statement pension charge rate of 28.8per cent and the actual cash payments into the RMPP at 17.1per cent.
This adjustment is made to eliminate the volatility of the IAS 19 accounting charge and to include only the true cash cost of the pension plans in the adjusted operating profit of the Group.
In-year trading cash flow In-year trading cash flow reflects the cash generated from the trading activities of the Group.
It is based on reported net cash inflow from operating activities, adjusted to exclude other working capital movements and the cash cost of operating specific items and to include the cash cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset acquisitions and net finance payments.
Other working capital movements include movements in GLS client cash held and in deferred revenue from stamps purchased in prior periods.
In-year trading cash flow is used primarily by Management as a measure of liquidity, showing cash being generated by operations less cash investment.
The following table reconciles in-year trading cash flow to the nearest IFRS measure net cash inflow from operating activities.

Net debt is a measure of the Groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess the combined impact of the Groups indebtedness and its cash position.
The use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
A reconciliation of net debt to reported balance sheet line items is shown below.

Inaddition, adjustments are made for non-recurring or distorting items, which by their nature may be unpredictable, such as acquisitions and changes in wage legislation such as National Insurance.
For volumes, underlying movements are adjusted for working days in UKPIL, the results of acquisitions and exclude political parties election mailings in letters volumes.
For 2017-18, the estimated revenue and profit impact of working days in UKPIL is a redcution of around 15 million 2017-18:305 days.
