We strive to maintain an increasing level of production through three strategic initiatives.
Firstly, we optimise capacity and recovery rates, for example, by investing in infrastructure to increase development rates and milling capacity.
Secondly, we seek opportunities to expand operations at our existing mines, through activities such as further exploring areas of influence.
Finally, we look for continuous improvements in productivity and cost controls and technology is just one area where our investments and expertise are creating significant performance improvements.
GROWTH Increase in silver production from 38.6 moz in 2008 to 58.7 moz in 2017.
Increase in gold production from 263.6 koz in 2008 to 911.1 koz in 2017.
RETURNS Close to US$2.5 billion paid in dividends since 2008.
Gold reserves up from 4.1 moz in 2008 to 11.7 moz in 2017.
