HOUSE MOVERS, EITHER IN THE RENTAL OR OWNER OCCUPIED SECTOR, CONTINUE TO BE A KEY SEGMENT OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.
Our Marketplace Demand for self storage comes from a number of different market segments House movers, either in the rental or owner occupied sector, continue to be a key segment of our customer base.
Demand also comes from people decluttering their space constrained homes, treating Big Yellow as a spare room.
Key life events which invariably create a need for storage are also an important driver of demand: maybe moving abroad for a job, inheriting possessions, getting married or separating, homeowners carrying out home improvements or students needing space during the holidays.
Our business customers range across a number of industry types, such as retailers, e-tailers, professional service companies, hospitality companies and importers exporters.
These businesses store stock, documents, equipment, or promotional materials, all requiring a convenient flexible solution to their storage, either to get started or to free up more expensive space.
There is a growing trend towards self-employment and smaller business start-ups in the UK, dynamics which are positive for self storage.
Additionally, businesses in the UK are increasingly seeking more flexible lease arrangements for their office and storage space.
The deindustrialisation of big cities also points to a structural growth in demand for storage for businesses.
