The policy was proposed to shareholders at the 2017 AGM and has applied since the close of that meeting.
Peter Dalzell stepped down from the Board with effect from 29 September 2017.
The table above, includes his remuneration for the period ended 30 September 2017.
Information in relation to other payments made to Peter Dalzell are included on page 60.
The long-term incentives fgure for the period ended 30 September 2017, for Peter Dalzell, relates to the grant of SAYE options.
Restated to refect the price at vesting for the 2013 14 LTIP as referred to on page 58.
The long-term incentives fgure for the period ended 1 October 2016 also includes 1,819 for Andrew Andrea in respect of SAYE options granted in that period, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for that period.
Individual elements of remuneration Fixed elements Base Salary Directors Remuneration Policy Base salary is a core element of fxed remuneration, refecting the size and scope of the role.
Base salary is usually reviewed annually by the Committee and fxed for the fnancial year.
Salary increases are reviewed in the context of salary increases across the wider Group.
For 2017 18, the basic salary increase for Executive Directors is 2% which is in line with the average salary increases across the Group.
The base salaries for the individual Executive Directors are as set out below: 2017 18 2016 17 base salary base salary Increase Andrew Andrea 370,260 363,000 2% Ralph Findlay 552,840 542,000 2% Benefts Directors Remuneration Policy Executive Directors receive benefts in line with market practice which are set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate against the market.
The single fgure table above shows the taxable value of benefts received by the Executive Directors in the period and comprises car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Retirement benefts Directors Remuneration Policy Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the defned contribution pension scheme and, if a member before closure of the scheme, the defned beneft scheme.
In appropriate circumstances, Executive Directors may take a salary supplement instead of contributions into a pension plan.
The pension fgures shown in the single fgure table above represents the cash value of pension contributions received by the Executive Directors.
This includes any salary supplement in lieu of a Company pension contribution.
56 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information Pension entitlements: Executive Directors excluding the Chief Executive Offcer may receive contributions of up to 20% of base salary under the defned contribution pension scheme, an equivalent taxable cash allowance or a combination of the two up to 20% of base salary.
No contributions were made into the Group Personal Pension Plan GPPP on behalf of Andrew Andrea during the year due to changes in the pension annual allowance.
For the period ended 30 September 2017, Andrew Andrea received a cash supplement of 20% in lieu of pension contributions.
Ralph Findlay was previously a member of the defined benefit scheme and has opted to no longer accrue future benefits.
For the period ended 30 September 2017, Ralph Findlay received a cash supplement of 25% as a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, Peter Dalzell received a cash supplement of 20%, in lieu of pension contributions.
Ralph Findlay accrued benefits in the defined benefit scheme which closed to future accrual in 2014.
Peter Dalzell left Marstons on 29 September 2017 and became a deferred member on this date.
Details are shown in the table below: Accrued Accrued pension at pension at Normal 30.09.17 30.09.16 retirement age Peter Dalzell 81,404 80,593 65 Ralph Findlay 111,030 109,862 60 Early retirement can be taken from age 55 provided the Group gives its consent.
The accrued pension will then be reduced to take account of its early payment.
On Ralph Findlays death, before retirement, a spouses pension is payable equal to 50% of his pension plus a lump sum equal to his contributions including those made via salary sacrifce.
On death after retirement the spouses pension payable is 60% of the members precommutation pension, for both Peter Dalzell and Ralph Findlay.
Variable elements Annual Bonus and Deferred Bonus Plan Directors Remuneration Policy The Annual Bonus plan rewards performance against annual targets which support the strategic direction of the Group.
Compulsory deferral into shares aligns Executive Directors with shareholder interests and provides a retention element.
The usual maximum annual bonus opportunity is 100% of base salary.
At least 50% of the award is based on fnancial performance measures.
The balance of the bonus opportunity is based on fnancial measures and or the delivery of strategic individual objectives.
Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of the maximum award is usually payable in shares in the Company which will be deferred for a period of three years.
With the exception of our pub managers, feld-based sales and operations teams, all bonus arrangements within the Group have the same structure and payout mechanism, though the maximum potential award, expressed as a percentage of salary, varies between different employee groups.
Payments are calculated based upon achieving or exceeding pre-set targets for both Group proft and return on capital.
Sales and operations teams have additional elements within their bonus schemes linked to segmental and individual performance.
Bonuses to Executive Directors and the senior management team are based on performance against pre-set targets for both Group proft two thirds and return on capital one third.
2016 17 Outturn Executive Directors could earn a bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary for on-target performance.
Above this, the award increases on a linear basis up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
If the target performance is not achieved then there is a linear reduction in the award using, in the case of the proft measure, the prior period performance as a base.
The Directors consider that the future Group proft and return on capital targets are commercially sensitive matters as they provide competitors with insight into our business plans and expectations and therefore they should remain confdential to the Group until the performance period has ended.
The targets and actual performance for 2016 17 are set out below: 2016 17 Threshold Target Maximum Actual % of salary Opportunity 1 Underlying Group proft before taxation 97.3m 103.8m 110.3m 100.1m 14.4% 67% 2 Return on capital 10.5% 10.9% 11.3% 10.7% 8.25% 33% Potential 22.65% 100% 3 Actual award 20.0% 1.
The threshold Underlying Group proft before taxation is 2015 16s actual outturn, which has been restated.
In the prior period the net interest on the net defned beneft asset liability was presented within underlying items.
This has now been represented within non-underlying items to better refect the nature of this item and to be consistent with the current period presentation.
The threshold for return on capital is the same as the CROCCE base used for the LTIP performance metric.
Bonuses of 20% of salary were awarded to Ralph Findlay and Andrew Andrea.
Details of the bonus awarded to Peter Dalzell are set out on page 60.
The bonuses earned are below the level at which deferral applies and, accordingly, no amounts earned have been deferred.
2017 18 opportunity No changes are proposed to the annual bonus scheme for 2017 18 and the Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus payout delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 57 Annual Report on Remuneration continued Long Term Incentive Plan Directors Remuneration Policy The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP incentivises Executive Directors to deliver against the Groups strategy over the longer term.
Long-term performance targets and share-based remuneration support the creation of sustainable shareholder value.
Awards vest dependent on the achievement of performance targets, normally over a three year performance period.
The normal maximum award size will be up to 150% of base salary in respect of any fnancial year.
Awards for 2017 18 will be granted at the level of 125% of salary and it is currently intended that awards will continue to be made at this level.
Vested awards granted in respect of 2016 17 and later years are normally subject to an additional holding period of two years before being released to participants.
Malus and clawback provisions apply.
At its discretion, the Committee may award dividend equivalents to refect dividends that would have been paid on vested awards under the LTIP from the end of the performance period until the date of release.
The value of long-term incentives included in the single fgure table on page 56 comprises the value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of the fnancial period and the value of SAYE options granted in the period.
Vesting in respect of performance during 2016 17 2014 15 LTIP Award LTIP awards granted in 2014 15 were subject to the achievement of the metrics in the following table.
Although the formal vesting date is not until June 2018, the performance measures have not been achieved and the awards will lapse.
On-target Maximum Weighting Base Threshold at25% 50%vesting 100% vesting Actual Vesting CROCCE 40% 10.5% Base 0.25% Base 0.5% Base 1.0% 10.7% 0% FCF 40% 300m Base 7.5% Base 15% Base 30% 303.9m 0% Relative TSR 20% Median Upper quintile Below median 0% CROCCE removes any potential distortions from subjective decision on depreciation policy and asset revaluation.
FCF is set as a three-year cumulative amount.
The operating cash flow of the business is more closely aligned to operating performance than a simple leverage ratio and reflects the cash which is available to reinvest to increase returns, to pay down debt or to pay dividends.
Relative TSR: the Remuneration Committee believe that a wider comparator group is a more robust and realistic way of measuring how shareholders value the Company.
The maximum award has been set at the upper quintile level recognising our commitment to ensuring there are demanding performance targets in place.
LTIP 2013 14 Award vesting The Committee deemed it appropriate to exercise its discretion as regards the relative TSR performance measure element, but to limit the vesting to the threshold level 25% vesting of the 20% of the awards based on relative TSR, resulting in 5% of the total award vesting in relation to the relative TSR measure.
In June 2017, the Committee confrmed the 21% estimated vesting for the 2013 14 LTIP award, as follows: On-target Maximum Weighting Base Threshold at25% 50%vesting 100% vesting Actual Estimated vesting 1 CROCCE 40% 10.5% Base 0.25% Base 0.5% Base 1.0% 10.9% 40% of CROCCE element 16% of total award FCF 40% 300m Base 7.5% Base 15% Base 30% 249.4m 0% of FCF element Relative TSR 20% - Median - Upper quintile See note 25% of TSR element 5% of total award 2 below 21% of total award 1.
The base fgur e for the CROCCE performance measure was originally set at 10.8%, as reported when the grant of the awards was discussed in the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report.
It was based on CROCCE for 2012 13 which was calculated on the basis of a 53 week period.
This was subsequently rebased to refect a 52 week period to enable comparisons to be made on a like-for-like basis, and the rebased fgure of10.5% was applied to the LTIP awards granted in 2013 2014 and subsequent awards.
In June 2017, when c onfrming the proposed outturn, the Committee considered the unexpected and signifcant impact of the Brexit vote on the Companys share price.
The Brexit vote signifcantly disrupted exchange rates which saw a positive beneft for those companies with signifcant overseas earnings and, conversely, a negative impact for those companies with predominantly domestic earnings.
The Committee deemed it appropriate to exercise its discretion as regards the relative TSR performance measure element, but to limit the vesting to the threshold level 25% of the 20% relating to relative TSR, resulting in 5% of the total award vesting in relation to the relative TSR measure.
In the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report, the value included in the single fgure of remuneration table assumed an estimate of 21% vesting and a share price equal to the average share price over the last quarter of the fnancial period ended 1 October 2016.
In the single fgure table on page 56 of this report, the estimate has been updated to refect a price of 1.239, being the price on 26 June 2017, the date of vesting.
58 | Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Additional Information Granted during 2016 17 LTIP awards granted during 2016 17 were as follows: % of award Percentage Number Face value vesting at 1 ofsalary ofshares atgrant threshold Performance period Holding period Andrew Andrea 125% 362,709 453,749 25% Financial periods Financial periods Peter Dalzell 125% 310,751 388,750 25% 2016 17 2018 19 2019 20 2020 21 Ralph Findlay 125% 541,566 677,499 25% 1.
Calculated using the mid-market share price at date of grant of 1.251.
The Committee reviewed the base numbers and performance conditions associated with each metric and agreed that they remain appropriate and challenging and that the base amounts are suffciently stretching without encouraging undue risk.
Therefore, the same performance conditions and targets apply as for previous awards and set out on page 58.
2017 18 awards It is intended to make awards under the LTIP in 2017 18 based on the same performance metrics as 2016 17.
Awards will be granted at the level of 125% of salary.
To better align performance periods, vesting and release dates, it is proposed that these awards will be granted in December 2017, and that awards in future years will similarly be granted following the announcement of the full year results.
In view of the new lease accounting standard that will be effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and the, as yet, uncertain impact of that standard on the Group, the Remuneration Committee will monitor and review the performance metrics over the 2017 18 LTIP award performance period to ensure they remain appropriate and fair.
SAYE For the period ended 1 October 2016 for Andrew Andrea, the long-term incentive value, shown in the single fgure table, includes the value ofSAYE options granted based on the fair value of the options at grant.
For the period ended 30 September 2017 for Peter Dalzell, the long-term incentive value, shown in the single fgure table, includes the value ofSAYE options granted based on the fair value of the options at grant.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Directors Remuneration Policy Non-executive Directors fees are usually reviewed every two years and are set at a level that refects market conditions and is suffcient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.

The Committee believes this provides a more appropriate comparison as the majority of pub-based staff have their remuneration rate set by statute rather than the market.
Salary Benefts Annual bonus CEO 2% 21% 50% Wider workforce 2% 21% 9% Performance graph This graph shows the value, at 30 September 2017, of 100 invested in the Company on 6 October 2008 compared to the value of 100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index.

To achieve these holdings Directors are required to retain any vested shares from the LTIP, net of tax, until the guidelines are satisfed.
Shares subject to vested LTIP awards which are in a holding period count towards this guideline on a net of assumed tax basis.
Directors share interests As at 30 September 2017, Andrew Andrea held in excess of 100% of base salary, Peter Dalzell held 77% and Ralph Findlay held in excess of 200% of base salary in shares based on the closing mid-market price of an ordinary share on the last business day of the fnancial period.
His interests in share options are shown as at that date.
The 2014 SAYE option has matured but had not been exercised as at the date of the report.
