26 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Specific items and pension charge to cash difference adjustment 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 26March 2017 27March 2016 m Pension charge to cash difference adjustment within People costs 222 257 Operating specific items Employee Free Shares charge 105 158 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 11 Legacy other costs credit 18 2 Potential industrial diseases claims 6 3 Personal injury provision discount rate decrease 4 Other 8 1 Total operating specific items and pensions adjustment 356 413 Non-operating specific items Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 14 29 Loss on disposal of business 2 Net pension interest 120 113 Profit on disposal of discontinued operations 31 132 173 Total non-operating specific items Total specific items and pensions adjustment before tax 224 240 Total tax credit on specific items and pensions adjustment 59 68 The pension charge to cash difference adjustment was 222 million 2015-16: 257 million.
The difference between the pension charge and cash cost largely comprises the difference between the IAS19 income statement pension charge rate of 28.8per cent and the actual cash payments agreed with the RMPP Trustee of 17.1per cent.
The IAS 19 pension service charge rate for 2017-18 is projected to significantly increase to 41.1per cent as a result of the reduction in corporate bond yields which means that the pension charge to cash difference adjustment for 2017-18 is expected to increase to around 440 million.
Operating specific items in the year related mainly to the Employee Free Shares charge of 105 million 2015-16: 158 million.
The Employee Free Shares charge has decreased as a result of SIP 2013 maturing in October 2016.
This has been partially offset by the charge in relation to the Free Shares awarded in October 2015 SIP 2015 and October 2016 SIP 2016.
The charge for Employee Free Shares will reduce over time reflecting the phasing of the charge over the vesting period.
For 2017-18, the Employee Free Shares charge is expected to be around 40 million.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles of 11 million reflects the amortisation of goodwill relating largely to ASM and GSO.
The increase in the provision for legacy costs is driven by a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the industrial diseases provision and the legislative decrease in discount rate used to determine personal injury claims announced in February 2017.
Other specific items mainly relate to the integration of Romec into the Group.
Non-operating specific items include a profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 14 million 2015-16: 29 million.
This mainly arises from the sale of a GLS property in Munich and the Maidstone Delivery Office.
The loss on disposal of business relates to the sale of NDC 2000 Limited NDC and reflects the transfer of cash and other assets to the purchasers.
The net pension interest credit was 120 million 2015-16: 113 million, higher than the prior year due to the increase in the accounting surplus at 27March 2016.
The net pension interest is expected to be 91 million in 2017-18, due to the lower discount rate more than offsetting the impact of the increased surplus.
Net finance costs Reported net finance costs were 16 million compared with 13 million in the prior year.
Interest on the 500 million bond was 11 million, 2million higher than the prior year as a result of weaker Sterling.

The UK adjusted effective tax rate of 19per cent is broadly in line with the UK statutory tax rate.
GLS effective tax rate of 28per cent has reduced due to lower French losses for which no deferred tax is recognised and increased notional interest deductions in Italy.
In the UK, the reported effective tax rate is lower than the adjusted effective tax rate as the impact of the one-off deferred tax credit due to a reduction in future corporation tax rate is treated as a specific item and excluded from the adjusted tax result.
Additionally, tax associated with property disposal profits within the reported result is offset by reinvestment relief contributing to the lower reported effective tax rate.
Earnings per share EPS Adjusted basic EPS for continuing operations was 44.1 pence compared with 41.3 pence in the prior year, largely reflecting the decrease in transformation costs.

Adjusted EBITDA before transformation costs was broadly flat, as higher EBITDA was offset by the lower pension charge to cash difference adjustment.
Trading working capital outflow was 3 million, an improvement of 23 million compared with the prior year due to a change in international sales mix.
Income tax paid was 60 million, 20 million higher than the prior year mainly due to a repayment received in the prior year and tax paid this year on the sale of DPD SL.
On a cash tax basis, in the UK, we continue to be able to offset the majority of taxable profits with capital allowances and brought forward losses.
UK cash tax paid is now expected to stay at similar levels until 2019-20 due to research and development credits and patent box tax reliefs, and normalise thereafter.

Total gross investment was skewed towards growth capital expenditure of which parcels automation, parcel systems, PDA initiatives and investment in GLS represented the majority of spend in the year.
Replacement capital expenditure reduced by 29 million, due to the timing of ongoing property maintenance and lower spending on certain property and technology projects.
Both growth and replacement capital expenditure have reduced in 2016-17.
We are past the peak of investment and are targeting net cash investment of around 450million in 2017-18 and less than 500 million per annum going forward.
Net debt Net debt was 338 million at 26March 2017, 114 million higher than at 27March 2016.

The amount held at 26March 2017 was 22 million.
The cash cost of operating specific items largely related to the French Competition Authority fine of 55 million that was paid in April 2016.
Property disposal proceeds of 37 million largely relate to the sale of a GLS property in Munich and the Maidstone Delivery Office.

The acquisition of non-controlling interests represents the purchase of the remaining 49percent of Romec.
Debt transferred on acquisitions includes 3 million of finance leases and 7 million of interest bearing loans and borrowings on GLS acquisitions.
Cash outflows relating to the London property portfolio of 34 million largely relate to remediation work, reprovisioning costs and planning and marketing costs in relation to the Nine Elms and Mount Pleasant sites.
These sites, in particular Mount Pleasant, will require further investment once sales proceeds are received.
Both sites continue to be marketed.
Approach to capital management The Group has established four key objectives for capital management.
Objectives Enablers 2016-17 Update Meet the Groups obligations as they fall due By maintaining sufficient cash reserves and committed At 26March 2017, the Group had available resources of facilities to 1,317 million 2015-16: 1,418 million : made up of cash and cash equivalents of 299 million 2015-16: 368 million and meet all obligations, including pensions: and undrawn committed revolving credit facilities of 1,018 million manage future risks, including those set out in the Principal 2015-16: 1,050 million Risks section on pages 37 to 41 The Group met the loan covenants and other obligations for its revolving credit facility and 500 million bond, see Note 20 As set out in the Viability Statement, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to meet its obligations as they fall due Support a progressive dividend policy Generate sufficient in-year trading cash flow to cover the Generated 420 million of in-year trading cash flow 2015-16: ordinary dividend and maintain sufficient distributable 254 million to cover the full year dividend of 23.0 pence reserves to sustain the Groups dividend policy pershare 2015-16: 22.1 pence per share equivalent to 230million Capital managed by the Group excluding the net assets of the 2 pension scheme is 1,806 million 2015-16: 1,602 million The Group had retained earnings of 4,940 million at 26 March 2017 2015-16: 4,451 million.
The Group considers it has a maximum level of distributable reserves of around 2 billion which excludes the impact of the pension surplus on retained earnings, more than sufficient to cover the dividend Reduce the cost of capital for the Group Target investment grade standard credit metrics i. e. no lower During the year, the Group maintained a credit rating of BBB than BBBunder Standard & Poors rating methodology with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Retain sufficient flexibility to invest in the Funded by retained cash flows and manageable levels of debt During the year, the Group made total gross investments of future of the business consistent with our target credit rating 529million 2015-16: 694 million and acquisition of business interests of 144 million 2015-16: 18 million while retaining sufficient capital headroom Pensions The Companys overall IAS 19 pension position at 26March 2017 was a surplus of 3,839 million, compared with a surplus of 3,430million at 27March 2016.
The IAS 19 accounting position and key assumptions for the valuation are provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
2 At 26March 2017 consists of net assets comprising of investment balances, working capital, provisions and net debt of 4,998 million 2015-16: 4,467 million, less pension assets of 3,839 million 2015-16: 3,430 million, with the associated deferred tax liability on pension assets of 647 million credited back 2015-16: 565 million.
30 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information The accounting liabilities have increased over the year due to the fall in corporate bond yields.
This has been offset by the increase in the RMPP assets, largely due to the hedging strategy adopted by the RMPP.
Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP The triennial valuation of RMPP at 31March 2015 was agreed on 8May 2017.
Based on this set of assumptions, the RMPP actuarial surplusat 31March 2017 was estimated to be 1,074 million, comprising of assets of 9,603 million and liabilities of 8,529 million 2015-16:1,765million.
Using these assumptions, the projected cost of benefits being accrued each year, based on market conditions at the end of March 2017, would currently be around 1,260 million.
This is significantly greater than projected 2017-18 contributions of 320 million by the Company and 110million by employees.
Accordingly, we expect that the actuarial funding surplus would be exhausted during 2018 if the RMPP had remained open in its current form.
Following the Companys decision the RMPP will close to future accrual on 31March 2018.
In accordance with the new Schedule of Contributions, the service contribution rate for 2017-18 will remain at 17.1per cent.
The March 2015 valuation continues to show the scheme in surplus and therefore no deficit correction payments are expected to be made.
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP The RMSEPP triennial valuation at 31March 2015 has been completed, based on the assumptions agreed as part of the Funding Agreement made between the Company and the Trustees in 2013.
On this basis, the actuarial surplus was 16 million at 31March 2015 comprising assets of410 million and liabilities of 394 million.
The RMSEPP closed in December 2012 to future accrual.
Therefore the Company makes no regular future service contributions.
As agreed in the February 2013 Funding Agreement with the Trustees, the Company makes deficit correction payments of 10 million per annum until at least the date on which the March 2018 valuation is completed no later than 30September 2018.
Dividends The final dividend of 15.1 pence per ordinary share in respect of the 2015-16 financial year was paid on 29July 2016, following shareholder approval.
The interim dividend of 7.4 pence per ordinary share in respect of the 2016-17 financial year was paid on 11January 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 9December 2016.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 15.6 pence per ordinary share, payable on 28July 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 30June 2017, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 20July 2017.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 23.0pence.
As previously stated, given the seasonality of the Groups business, the Board would expect to pay an interim dividend each year equal to approximately one-third of the prior years total dividend and to set the final dividend for each year in light of the full year performance of the Group.
Financial risks and related hedging The Group is exposed to commodity and currency price risk.
The Group operates hedging policies which are described in the Notes to the Annual Report and Financial Statements in 2016-17.
The forecast diesel and jet commodity exposures in UKPIL are set out below together with the sensitivity of 2017-18 operating profit to changes in commodity prices and fuel duty.

Without hedging, the cost reduction would have been 12 million based upon closing fuel prices at 26March 2017.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 | 31 Royal Mail plc | Group results The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to interest payments on the 500 million bond, certain obligations under Euro denominated finance leases, trading with overseas postal administrations and various purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency.
GLS functional currency is the Euro which results in translational exposure to the Groups operating profit.
The average exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro was 1 1.19, representing a 13per cent weakening in Sterling compared with 1 1.37 in 2015-16, which resulted in an 18million increase in GLS reported operating profit before tax in 2016-17.
This weakness of Sterling resulted in lower UKPIL operating profit of 9 million in the international business.
The net impact on Group operating profit before tax was therefore 9 million.
The Group manages its interest rate risk through a combination of fixed rate loans and leasing, floating rate loans facilities and floating rate financial investments.
At 26March 2017, all of the gross debt of 657 million was at fixed rates to maturity.
Counterparty risk is managed by limiting aggregate exposure to any individual counterparty based on their financial strength.
Events after the reporting year Acquisition of Postal Express On 6April 2017, we announced the acquisition of Postal Express for $13.3 million.
Operating in the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho Postal Express offers overnight parcel delivery services, mainly to B2B customers, across a number of industries.
Closure of Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP On 8May 2017, the Company and the RMPP Trustee agreed the March 2015 actuarial valuation and revised Schedule of Contributions following the decision to close the RMPP to future accrual from 31March 2018.
