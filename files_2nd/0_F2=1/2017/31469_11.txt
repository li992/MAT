At the end of January markets 2018, we had an installed base of over 19,500 cash automation solutions at retail and banking customers, around a 30% increase compared with 14,600 in 2016.
The strong growth in Adjusted PBITA in our developed markets reflects the benefits of our systematic restructuring and productivity programmes which have been implemented over the past three years, partially offset by investment in sales and business development.
The robust growth in developed markets was partially offset by the effect of weak trading in our Middle East & India region, where our businesses have been adjusting to the challenging trading environment and where we expect trading to begin to stabilise during 2018.
CORPORATE COSTS Corporate costs comprise the costs of the G4S plc board and the central costs of running the Group including executive, governance and central support functions, and were slightly lower compared with the prior year.
