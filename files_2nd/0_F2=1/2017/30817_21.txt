Strategic Report Ontic 2017 Performance Revenue Ontic 2017 2017 2016 Inc dec $m $m % North America 122.7 108.9 12.7% Performance Europe & ROW 86.1 55.6 54.9% Total 208.8 164.5 26.9% Ontic, our legacy support business, continues to perform well, with revenue up 26.9% to $208.8 million 2016: $164.5 million.
On an organic basis, revenue was up 4.5%.
The 2017 performance includes a significant contribution from the portfolio of legacy avionics products acquired from GE Aviation in December 2016.
This business has been substantially transitioned into Ontics existing UK facility in Cheltenham over the course of 2017.
The cash payment of $60.7 million for this acquisition was made in January 2017.
Furthermore, it was a strong year for cyclical military demand B52 actuation and C130 Radar units shipped in significant quantities during 2017 which we do not expect to repeat in 2018.
We expect the non-repeat element of the cyclical military orders to counter growth from new licences acquired at the end of 2017.
Ontic has further extended its licensed product portfolio during the year with the addition of important new licences: Ontic has recently signed a second product licence with Ultra Electronics for the OE manufacturing and aftermarket support for various military cockpit controls, switches and indicators.
We also have a new licence agreement with UTC Aerospace Systems for its wound motor product lines, part of the electric power systems business segment.
This adds significant military content to our portfolio.
In December 2017, we acquired Curtiss-Wrights product line for the Ethernet Switch Unit, which grows not only our military platform content but also our product portfolio with Curtiss-Wright.
Furthermore, Ontic has received certification by the US Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration for its Singapore facility which serves as both a repair station and storefront for a variety of OEM-licenced and acquired products, including fuel measurement systems on the Boeing B737 Classic and B777, Fokker 50, 70 and 100 as well as the Airbus A300, A318, A319 and A320.
In 2018 we have also signed a first product licence with Racal Acoustics, part of Esterline Corporation, for various military and civil avionics products including cockpit communication control systems.
The products will transition to our Cheltenham facility during 2018.
These acquisitions support Ontics strategy to deliver continued profitable growth in mature avionics and electronics products with high intellectual property content.
Ontic continues to assess a strong pipeline of opportunities in relation to new products and licence adoptions.
