The values included in the 2016 single figure table reflect Helen Gordons and Vanessa Simms salaries paid for part of the financial year that they were employed.
Nick Joplings base salary during the year under review was 356,842 with effect from 1January 2016.
2 Taxable benefits include a car allowance and private medical insurance.
3 In light of Nick Joplings role being made redundant, the Remuneration Committee determined he would be a good leaver for incentive plan purposes.
Since he was in active employment for the full 2017 financial year, his bonus was not subject to any time pro-rating for 2017 and, in line with the 2017 Remuneration Policy, 25% of the bonus is deferred into shares for three years.
4 In line with the requirements of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, the 2017 LTIP vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due to vest on16 December 2017 50% of the award is based on EPRA NNNAV performance measured over the three years to 30 September 2017, and 50% of the award is based onabsolute TSR measured over the three-year period to 16 December 2017.
The growth in Graingers EPRA NAV over the three-year period to 30 September 2017 was 1.6 times the increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices over the same period i. e. 25.2% growth versus 15.9% growth.
Absolute TSR performance based on an assessment of performance measured to 30 September 2017 is forecast to be 14% per annum based on absolute TSR growth over the three-year performance period to date of 44.3% with the performance period due to end on 16 December 2017.
The share price for valuing the award is the share price at 29 September 2017 268.2p for the EPRA NNNAV element, and the three-month average share price to 29 September 2017 259.0p for the TSR element.
This value will be trued up in next years report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the vesting date.
In addition, the total LTIP value of awards vesting in December 2017 in respect of Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood are 189,000 and 78,000 respectively, both being former Directors of Grainger.
The 2016 LTIP value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in December 2016.
Nick Jopling stepped down from the Board on 29 September 2017 and will cease employment on 31 December 2017 due to his role being made redundant.
As previously reported, Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood retired and stepped down from the Board on 4 January 2016 and 22 December 2015 respectively.
Retirement is a standard good leaver circumstance under the 2007 LTIP, and so they retained their outstanding LTIP awards, which remain eligible to vest on their original vesting dates subject to performance targets being applied and a pro-rata reduction for the reduced period of employment relative to the three-year vesting period.
5 The pension benefits are based on 15% of base salary.
6 Please see Note 6 on page 73 in relation to the vesting of the Tranche 2 buy-out award made to Helen Gordon.
7 With regard to the single total figure of remuneration for each Director in relation to the year under review, the Committee was comfortable with the amounts payable given the performance achieved.
In forming this view the Committee noted the achievement of a ROSE of 7.3% and adjusted earnings of 74.4m in a challenging market context.
In addition, substantial strategic progress was also made, with a refined strategy being developed and embedded in the organisation.
From a longer-term perspective, three-year forecast annualised TSR of 44.3% was achieved at the same time as an increasing EPRA NNNAV relative to the increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices of 9.4%.
8 The salaries for Non-Executive Directors reflect payments in relation to any chairmanship roles as applicable during the year under review or the preceding year and in some cases pro-rata adjustments are made to reflect the changes in respect of such roles being taken part way through the relevant year.
9 On 8 February 2017 Margaret Ford retired from the Board.
Mark Clare was appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Chairman and Justin Read was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 13 February 2017.

Accordingly, there is an element of double counting in her single figure of total remuneration for 2016.
2 Andrew Cunningham was acting Chief Executive for most of 2009 due to the absence through illness of Rupert Dickinson.
Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive and employees The percentage change in remuneration between 2016 and 2017, excluding LTIP and pension contributions, for the Chief Executive and for all other employees in the Group was as follows: Percentage change 201617 Annual Base salary Benefits bonus 1 Chief Executive 0% 0% 5% Employee population 2% 4% 22% 1 The base salary and benefits for the Chief Executive have not increased since 3 November 2015.
The bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive has also remained unchanged in 2017.
The Chief Executive was only employed for part of the prior year.
The variation calculated above has therefore been pro-rated to avoid distortions in the metric.
Relative importance of spend on pay The difference in actual expenditure between 2016 and 2017 on remuneration for all employees, in comparison to profit before tax continuing operations anddistributions to shareholders by way of dividend, is set out in the charts below.
Profit before tax is considered to be an appropriate financial metric as it is not impacted by changes in tax rates which are outside of the direct control ofthe Company.
Total employee pay has reduced following the restructuring activity undertaken in 2016.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018 Base salary In line with the typical increase given to the wider employee population, the Remuneration Committee determined that the base salaries for the two Executive Directors should be increased by 2.2%.
Annual bonus As detailed in the Annual Statement and Summary Remuneration Policy, the structure and metrics to operate for the 2018 annual bonus are as follows: Chief Executive: 140% of salary Chief Financial Officer: 120% of salary With regard to the level of bonus earned, 25% will be deferred into Grainger shares for three years.
The range of targets to apply to the 2018 annual bonus have been set after taking into account the current stage of our transition toa PRS-focused business model.
This has resulted in the same approach being applied to target setting for the adjusted earnings element i. e. the same performance range around budget is being retained but with a revised range of targets being introduced for ROSE.
The table below sets out the performance targets and their respective weightings for 2018: Metric Weighting Rationale and description Adjusted earnings 40% Incentivises operational success in achieving rental growth, income from sales and reduction in operational and finance costs relative to a challenging budget.
Performance level Budget Payout Threshold 90% 0% Target 100% 60% Maximum 120% 100% Straight line between performance points.
ROSE 40% Incentivises the delivery of targeted levels of return from our property portfolio which is aligned with a strong balance sheet in respect of the EPRA NNNAV performance and dividend level.
Performance level Payout 4.5% 0% 4.75% 10% 7% 60% 12% 100% A graduated vesting scale operates between performance points.
Strategic personal 20% Each of the headline metrics are underpinned by defined measurable milestones or a range of targets objectives set with reference to budgeted objectives.
These are consistent with the strategy and targeted objectives for the year agreed by the Board.
Due to matters of commercial sensitivity itwould not be in the interests of the Company to disclose the precise personal targets for the annual bonus at the date of production of this report.
Details of the objectives and the performanceachieved will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2018 Annual Report.
In respect of the revised range of ROSE targets, these have been recalibrated to take account of our current investment in new PRS accommodation.
The investment programme will result in lower but more stable returns over time as income increasingly replaces capital growth from property sales as a proportion of total income.
The current strategic focus on developing PRS accommodation also increases the time period associated with recognising the full return from investments.
The revised range of ROSE targets take due account of the above, along with wider changes in the wider macro-economic environment, which also includes lower forecast HPI.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 76 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Overall, the Committee considers the 2018 annual bonus targets to be equally challenging as the targets set in 2017 for annual bonus purposes and considers the range to provide a keen balance between being achievable at the lower end but very demanding atthe top end of the range, particularly in the context of a challenging budget agreed by the Board.
With regard to the above targets, full retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration subject to considering any perceived areas of price sensitivity.
LTIP It is expected that the LTIP awards to be made to the Executive Directors in the year ending 30 September 2018 will be at the levels detailed below and subject to a two-year holding period: Chief Executive: 175% of salary Chief Financial Officer: 130% of salary The performance measures to apply for 2018 will be as follows: Metric Targets Rationale for metric Ranking Budget TSR versus FTSE 350 Incentivises Executives to achieve above median Below median 0% Real Estate Supersector sector TSR, which is a targeted outcome of an constituents effective execution of our strategy.

As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, strict recovery and withholding provisions apply to both LTIP and annual bonus awards, whichwill enable the Committee to reclaim or adjust future variable pay awards if there is a misstatement of the Companys results, any errors in calculation of actual performance against a target set, or in the event of misconduct.
Furthermore, the Committee will retain the right to reduce overall pay outcomes if it considers the variable pay result does not reflect broader Company performance over the relevant performance periods.
