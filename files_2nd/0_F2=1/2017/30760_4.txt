Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Key performance indicators Key performance indicators We use a range of financial and non-financial metrics to measure our performance, financial strength, customer advocacy, employee engagement and impact on society.
These include Alternative Performance Measures APMs which are non-GAAP measures that are not bound by the requirements of IFRS.
These metrics are reviewed annually and updated as appropriate to ensure they remain an effective measure of delivery against our objectives.
For 2017, the review of these metrics resulted in the following changes: Digital convenience for our customers has been amended to Active registrations instead of Registrations.
This change ensures we measure users who are actively engaging with MyAviva and other digital platforms every year.
Following the introduction of Solvency II, the new prudential regulatory framework that came into force on 1 January 2016, we calculate Value of New Business VNB on an adjusted Solvency II basis rather than on an MCEV basis.
As a result of feedback from the Financial Reporting Councils regular review and assessment of the quality of corporate reporting in the UK, we have relabelled Operating Profit to Group Adjusted Operating Profit.
We have included profit before tax attributable to shareholders profit PBT.
While not a metric that is used to measure the Groups ongoing financial performance, it is important to assess it alongside Group adjusted operating profit when evaluating our overall result.
The estimated shareholder cover ratio is now shown inclusive of pro forma adjustments required to reflect the effect of planned acquisitions and disposals consistent with the metric used internally.
Further guidance in respect of the APMs used by the Group to measure our performance and financial strength is included within the Other Information section of the Annual report and accounts.
This guidance includes definitions and, where possible, reconciliations to relevant line items or sub-totals in the financial statements.
The financial commentary included in this Strategic report should be read in conjunction with this guidance.
