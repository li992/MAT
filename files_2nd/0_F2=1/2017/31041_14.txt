Case study: Providing patients with access to high-quality affordable medicines Around 40 per cent of the products we sell in the MENA region are innovative products that we in-license from global partners.
These products enhance our portfolio in key therapeutic areas and increase patients access to high-quality, affordable medicines.
Celltrion is one of our long-standing partners in MENA and in 2017, we signed a licensing agreement for the first biosimilar monoclonal Antibody mAb in oncology to be granted European marketing authorisation, Truxima rituximab.
We now have exclusive agreements with Celltrion for three biosimilar products Truxima rituximab, Remsima infliximab and Herzuma trastuzumab in all our MENA markets.
This strengthens our product portfolio in the strategic therapeutic areas of oncology, autoimmune diseases, rheumatology and dermatology and reinforces our position as a partner of choice in the MENA region.
It also means we are meeting important patient needs.
