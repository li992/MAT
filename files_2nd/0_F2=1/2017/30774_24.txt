Annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance: Zero payout Prior to the start of the year, the Remuneration Committee set stretching 2017 bonus targets performance targets for the Executive Directors in 2017.
As set out in last The chart below illustrates the performance ranges set by the Committee years report, these were based on Net Revenue growth and Adjusted prior to the start of the year.
Net Income growth, both measured in GBP at a constant exchange rate.
Threshold Maximum 1 In line with the Remuneration Policy, the CEO and CFO had target bonus Performance measure zero bonus 3.57x target Achieved opportunities of 120% of salary and 90% of salary respectively.
Actual Below Net Revenue growth 0% 6% payments can range from zero to 3.57x target depending on threshold performance against the stretching performance ranges as follows: Below Adjusted Net Income growth 2% 10% threshold For each performance measure a range is set.
Performance range A performance multiplier is calculated for each measure, calculated by the extent to which the performance for that measure is achieved.
At constant fx rates These multipliers can be up to 1.89 for outperformance of the stretching range set by the Committee.
2017 bonus outcome The two individual multipliers are then multiplied together to provide As set out elsewhere in the report, 2017 was a challenging year for RB.
The 2017 performance outcome saw flat like-for-like Net Revenue growth and Net Income Growth that was below the threshold, excluding the Adjusted Net MJN contribution.
Net Revenue Threshold 0x Income Performance multiplier x Target 1.0x multiplier multiplier up to 1.89x Max 3.57x Decision up to 1.89x Due to actual results being below the stretching performance targets set, no bonus will be paid to the Executive Directors for 2017.
The performance multiplier can range from zero for performance at threshold or below, to 3.57 for truly exceptional performance on both metrics i. e. 1.89 x 1.89.
This total performance multiplier is then applied to the target bonus opportunity to calculate the overall bonus outcome.
Performance Final bonus x Target bonus multiplier outcome The effect of the multiplicative approach means that a high performance multiplier can only be achieved for outperformance on both top-line andbottom-line growth.
Similarly, underperformance in one of the performance metrics will reduce the overall bonus payout, despite outperformance of the other.
For example, if we grow Net Revenue above the stretching requirement for maximum performance but fail to convert it into profit growth, the bonus payout will be zero i. e. 1.89 x 0.

LTIP Audited The Remuneration Policy approved by Shareholders at the AGM in May 2016 sets out the operation of the LTIP.
Whilst the structure for the awards made to Executive Directors remained in line with the approved Policy, the Committee made a significant reduction in the size of the awards granted to the CEO for 2018.
The number of shares and share options are a third lower than those awarded for 2017.
The table below sets out the 2018 LTIP awards made to Executive Directors on 30 November 2017.

3 For performance shares based on the market price at the date of award and assumes the stretching performance criteria are met in order to achieve full vesting.
For share options, the face value at award was zero as the exercise price is higher than the market price at time of award.
The face value of shares under option is 12.97 million for Rakesh Kapoor and 4.96 million for Adrian Hennah if calculated as the number of shares multiplied by the market price at date of award.
In line with RBs Directors Remuneration Policy, vesting of the LTIP awards is dependent on the achievement of stretching targets relating to growth in EPS over a three-year period, which requires outperformance of peer benchmarks.
EPS is measured on an adjusted diluted basis, as shown in the Groups Financial Statements, as this provides an independently verifiable measure of performance.
However, the Remuneration Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments to the measure if this is considered to be appropriate.
Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Awards granted in November 2017 will vest on the following schedule, which requires significant compound annual growth in EPS in order for the awards to vest, as follows: EPS CAGR 6% 6% Between 6% and 10% 10% Equivalent to three-year EPS growth of 19.1% 19.1% 33.1% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 20% Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100% 100% Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 90 Other required disclosures Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all UK employees who form part of the management team Top400.
