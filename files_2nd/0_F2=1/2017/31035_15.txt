The area, known as a centre for the agree space for our future media, advertising and design businesses, has improved rapidly over the past decade due to its close proximity to Crossrail and the home at 80 Charlotte Street.
The development, for which we obtained planning permission in 2011, is on an island site and will comprise 332,000 Derwent and their design sq ft of offices, 3,000 sq ft of retail and 45,000 sq ft of residential team have masterminded 55 units.
This is an increase in floorspace of 62% from the tired 1960s building that previously stood on the site.
atruly spectacular scheme When we committed to the scheme at the beginning of 2016 we inthis quiet and rapidly faced the challenges of delivery and finding an occupier, but with improving corner of the intention of mitigating these risks as the project proceeded.
To ensure this happens, the Group encourages collaboration Fitzrovia, close to the buzz from its many specialist teams and consultants from the start even though each team has separate responsibilities in the ofcentral London.
be the perfect setting for our Lowering construction risk: Derwent London has an experienced people to connect, develop team of in-house project managers, cost monitors and development managers responsible for the projects overall and drive impact through design and construction with Multiplex acting as main contractor.
At the outset we believed that a fixed price contract would not our work.
be the most cost-effective option.
During 2017 the outstanding Andy Veitch cost was almost entirely fixed, a process made easier through our Partner and Managing Director relationship with the main contractor as well as engaging directly of The Boston Consulting Group with the subcontractor supply chain.
The main construction risk now resides with delivery with the building due for completion at the end of 2019.
Lowering letting risk: The building boasts good flexibility in terms of offering large, flexible floorplates as well as good multi-let capability, providing varied options in respect of communal and dedicated entrances.
On-site amenity has been a common theme throughout our recent developments: 80 Charlotte Streets offer is significant, with generous terraces both private and a large communal facility, an in-house caf, as well as two restaurant opportunities on the two Right: CGI of 80 Charlotte Street W1 eastern corners of the site.
Our leasing and marketing team has been involved from the beginning helping define the products identity.
The attractions of the building and its location were demonstrated in 2017 with the early pre-let of 86% of the office space with a further 13% under option to Arup and The Boston Consulting Group BCG.
The transaction with Arup cemented an existing longstanding relationship, whilst that with BCG brings a new and significant tenant to the portfolio.
The main letting risk now lies with the leasing or disposal of the residential elements of the scheme.
As a result of our teams actions, we made meaningful progress in reducing some of the major development risks associated with the property during 2017.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2017 Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2017 54 55 Asset management Case study: Asset management continued Our relationships with occupiers are based on mutual trust, teamwork and frequent dialogue maintained over the long term.
We believe this proactive approach distinguishes Derwent London from many other landlords and explains why we are more comfortable than some other property investors in offering a wide range of lease terms to our occupiers and in owning multi-let buildings.
Our occupier meetings provide good market intelligence In recent years, the area as well as keeping us abreast of any changing needs of a particular tenant.
Changing needs create new opportunities as we look, around Tottenham Court where we can, to accommodate them.
Examples of this are set Road has gone through out below: amarked transformation.
Tea and Biscuit Building Mother London In 2003 Mother London made a long-term commitment to the Onceconsidered the scruffy Biscuit Building in Shoreditch.
Throughout the term of their 15-year lease a healthy working relationship was fostered and, end of Oxford Street, with as the adjoining Tea Building was increasingly fitted with enhanced noreal identity, the area has Green Tea air conditioning, Mother identified the modernisation of their office as a key driver to their future within the existing becomea thriving crossroads premises.
The strength of the relationship enabled us to come to an agreement where we were able to retrofit a new air conditioning between Londons creative system and install double glazed windows while the tenant and technology industries.
Following these improvements Mother has made a fresh long-term commitment to 49,700 sq ft in the building.
Ian Pidgeon Partner at Knight Frank Retail at the eastern end of Oxford Street W1 The depth of knowledge of our occupiers business requirements facilitates transactions which enable us to unlock opportunities from time to time.
The relocation of Pret a Manger from Holden House, Oxford Street, to another of our buildings on Rathbone Place enabled the transformation of the immediate area.
Furthermore additional exit strategies were agreed with other tenants including William Hill, Evans and a newsagents which Right: Tottenham Court Walk W1 created an opportunity for new retailers.
These now include Russell and Bromley, Scribbler and PJ Tailors, all of whom had longstanding ambitions to be in the area.
On Tottenham Court Road we worked closely with an existing occupier to market their lease.
We were able to expedite an assignment to Yo!, on a longer term, whose subsequent investment in the unit adds to the vibrancy of the area and enhances the food offer to our existing office occupiers.
1 & 2 Stephen Street W1 FremantleMedia Longstanding substantial occupier, FremantleMedia Group Limited, leases 83,400 sq ft in 1 & 2 Stephen Street which was due to expire in 2019.
We worked closely with them on a number of scenarios involving the existing premises and possible relocation to other Derwent London properties.
The outcome has been a new agreement with FremantleMedia committing to Stephen Street for up to a further five years with a mutual break in 2021.
Our ongoing relationship was integral to the successful conclusion of a transaction which enhanced the asset and at the same time matched the mutual aspirations and business strategies of both the occupier and ourselves.
