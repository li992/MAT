The caps have the effect of reducing the Long term sustainable The long term incentives which now extend to 2023 have been designed to lock in the Executive team for a far longer annual remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive by approximately 50% with effect from 1 May 2017, based on the share performance period than is typical in most publicly listed companies.

How is our approach to incentives linked to the Company strategy?
It is a core facet of Berkeleys remuneration policy that the Executive Directors acquire and hold material shareholdings in the Company, Overview of strategy in order to align their interests with those of the Companys shareholders.
The following chart sets out all subsisting interests in the In December 2015, Berkeley enhanced its 10 year Shareholder Returns Programme from 13.00 per share to 16.34 per share, with the equity of the Company held by the Executive Directors at 30 April 2017.
The number of shares of the Company in which current remaining 12.00 per share to be delivered through dividend payments of 2.00 per share each year through to 2021.
This equated to Executive Directors had a beneficial interest as at 30 April 2017 are set out in detail on page 97.
As of the year end a further 9.00 per share remains to be delivered, representing 1.25 billion of the 2.2 billion total 10 year return.
The charts illustrates the minimum shareholding requirements for the Executive Directors, the value of the shares they currently own and the value of share incentives held.
All the Executive Directors exceed their minimum shareholding requirements.
Having delivered pre-tax profits of 0.5 billion last year, Berkeley is on target to deliver the 2.0 billion three year cumulative profit before tax target announced 18 months ago for the period ending 30 April 2018.

Consequently, the Board has introduced exibility which enables shareholder returns to be delivered through 13,537% 2,740% a combination of both dividend payments and share buy-backs, as opposed to solely dividends.

R J Stearn % of salary In bringing these changes into effect, the Board determined that the payments should be re-characterised from being a value per Key: share, to be an absolute value per annum.

In particular, the 2011 LTIP locks in the Executive team for at least 10 years, which is far longer than is typical in most shares will be cancelled unless retained to be reissued from Treasury in lieu of an obligation to issue shares.
It should be noted that publicly listed companies and ensures that they are focused on the long term performance of the company.
share buy-backs do not reduce the exercise price of the options.
This change avoids a potential misalignment of management interests The following chart shows Berkeleys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the FTSE 250, FTSE 100 and FTSE All Share with shareholders by removing the potential disincentive to undertake share buy-backs.
The rationale for not including buy-backs in the reduction of the exercise price is that this would result in a potential enhancement of value from that agreed with shareholders on approval of the amended 2011 LTIP at the 2016 EGM, as the exercise price would be 400 reduced whilst the value of these options would increase as they represent an increased percentage of the fully diluted share capital.
