2016 KPIs not included The Group is no longer using total PV investment and Return on Invested Capital ROIC as KPIs.
This is because the Group is not focusing on absolute PV investment as a measure, preferring PV as an input with focus on its organic revenue and underlying operating margin performance.
The 2017 KPIs are focused on achieving operational improvement, whereas the Groups ROIC measure is significantly reflective of previous M&A, most notably the 2014 acquisition of Aeroflex.
