American p02-22 22 03 2018 09:59 Page 5 C H A I R S S T A T E M E N T I am very pleased to present my first annual statement as Chair of the Company.
The year to 31st December 2017 was another positive one for investors in US equities, as the S&P 500 Index on a total return basis rose a further 21.5% for US investors, or 11.0% for UK investors once the effect of sterlings appreciation against the US dollar is taken into account.
The Company has outperformed its benchmark in the 12 months to 31st December 2017 on a net asset value cum-income, with debt at fair value NAV per share basis, returning 13.1%.
The discount of the share price to NAV calculated using the cum-income net asset value, with debt at par widened marginally, from 3.1% to 4.5%, resulting in a total return to shareholders for the year of 11.2%.
Dr Kevin Carter Chair Performance The Companys objective is to achieve capital growth from North American investments through outperformance of the Companys benchmark, which is the S&P 500 Index with both NAV and benchmark measured in sterling total return terms.
This years NAV growth represents a return to relative outperformance for the mandate, following two Over the years of relative underperformance.
As can be seen from the attribution report detailed in the Investment 15 years of his Managers Report on page 12, the Companys large cap portfolio detracted slightly from performance management, returns, whilst the small cap allocation significantly outperformed.
Gearing was accretive to returns.
It is Garrett has disappointing that the large cap strategy has underperformed for a third year in a row, but the Board is encouraged that recently implemented changes to the investment process, to include reducing the number delivered of holdings in the large cap portfolio and reducing the size of the portfolio tail, will bear fruit over the material longer term.
It is notable that during 2017 the market rise was significantly concentrated within a relatively outperformance narrow range of stocks and sectors.
For more details of the Boards review of the investment process and its findings please refer to my predecessors Chair statement within the Companys 2016 Annual Report.
Garrett Fish became lead manager for the Companys portfolio during 2002.
Over the 15 years of his management, Garrett has delivered material outperformance.
During the 15 years to 31st December 2017, the Companys share price has risen 437.5% an annualised return of 11.9%, while the Companys benchmark returned 367.3% an annualised return of 10.8%.
This outstanding result demonstrates the long term benefits of deploying a sound investment process with the structural advantages afforded by the closed end nature of an investment trust.
Smaller Companies Portfolio the allocation to Shareholders will be aware that the Companys mandate permits the Investment Manager to invest in smaller a diversified portfolio of quoted companies including, when appropriate, exposure to smaller capitalisation stocks.
The Manager obtains this exposure by replicating the portfolio of the JPMorgan US Small Cap companies Growth Fund.
This fund, which is managed by Eytan Shapiro and his team, invests in US small cap stocks greatly assisted and can only be accessed by US investors.
Throughout 2017, the Companys weighting in the smaller the Companys companies portfolio ranged between 4.8% and 6.2%.
Given that in 2017 US small cap stocks outperformed performance their larger counterparts for the first time since 2013 and Eytan and his team significantly outperformed the US small cap index, as represented by the Russell 2000, the allocation to smaller companies greatly this year assisted the Companys performance this year.
The ability of the Investment Manager to allocate a proportion of the portfolio to small cap stocks was reviewed in detail by the Board and Manager over the year.
Having examined data from 2003 to 2017, it was clear that the allocation to smaller companies stocks, given their growth characteristics, had, in aggregate, been accretive to the Companys performance returns over this timeframe.
It was also clear that when small cap stocks are cheap on valuation criteria, they tend to outperform their large cap brethren, and vice versa.
Accordingly, shareholders should continue to expect the Company to hold a varying allocation to small cap stocks over time, now with a higher average of around 6.5% of the assets, with an upper bound of 9.5%.
Reassuringly, when reviewing the analysis from this exercise, the Board was also satisfied with the source of the Companys small cap exposure: Eytan and his team have demonstrated skill in this area of investment.
S T R A T E G I C R E P O R T | 5 American p02-22 22 03 2018 09:59 Page 6 C H A I R S S T A T E M E N T Gearing Over the year gearing remained within the Boards strategic level of 10%, plus or minus 2%.
Our Investment Manager has the ability to hold cash of up to 5% of net assets if it is felt that there is a real risk of long term capital loss.
The ability to gear remains one of the differentiating features of the investment trust structure and, accordingly, the Board is cognisant that gearing should be employed, but in a controlled and risk aware manner.
Attribution informs us that the gearing employed by the Company was accretive to performance this year.
The Companys gearing is implemented through the use of bank borrowing facilities and a debenture.
The debenture was issued in 2000 and carries a fixed interest rate of 6.875%.
In the latter half of its life the debenture has proved to be a drag on performance and its maturity in June this year will allow the Company to refinance at a significantly lower rate.
Its forthcoming maturity has also provided the Board with an opportunity to conduct a detailed review of the Companys gearing strategy and the structure and sources of borrowing going forward.
Shareholders will be informed of the results of this exercise once completed.
Board Review of the Manager As in prior years, the Board has visited the Managers offices in New York where it held meetings with The Board also Garrett Fish and the manager of the smaller companies portfolio, Eytan Shapiro.
The Board further met with JPMorgans senior management, members of the behavioural finance team of which Garrett is a travelled to member, the corporate engagement and the dealing teams.
The Board also travelled to Washington D. C. Washington D. C. and met with economic and political commentators, including the British Ambassador, senior Embassy staff and met with and experts at the Brookings Institution, all of which helped put the Investment Managers views into the British context, and provide a perspective on Mr Trumps first year as U. S. President.
Ambassador In addition to managing the portfolio, the Manager provides other services to the Company, including and experts at accounting, company secretarial and marketing services.
These have been formally assessed through the annual manager evaluation process.
The Board concluded that it was generally satisfied with JPMorgans the Brookings performance.
Thus, taking all factors into account, the Board concluded that the ongoing appointment of Institution the Manager is in the continuing interests of shareholders.
Management Fees and Other Company Expenses As reported in my Half Year Statement, and announced in June 2017, the Board confirmed a significant reduction in the Companys fee structure.
With effect from 1st October 2017, the annual management fee, which was 0.50% of total assets less current liabilities, with no tiering, is charged at an annual rate as detailed below: 0.35% on the first 500 million of net assets: 0.30% on net assets above 500 million and up to 1 billion: and 0.25% on any net assets above 1 billion.
As reported previously the Board and JPMorgan believe that this new fee structure allows the Company to retain its competitive position against both Exchange Traded Funds ETFs and other quant and smart beta products, while continuing to pursue a core active management strategy with an improved investment process.
The Board continues to focus on costs incurred by the Company across all of its functions, with a view to enhancing shareholder value.
Over the year, fee reductions have also been negotiated with each of the Companys Depositary, Registrar and Broker.
Furthermore, following the implementation of regulatory changes detailed below, JPMorgan has undertaken to pay for all broker research commissions from 1st January 2018.
Although only a proportion of the fee reductions achieved are reflected in the Companys Ongoing Charge for 2017, at 0.55%, this figure represents a significant reduction from 2016 at 0.62%.
The fee reductions should further reduce the Ongoing Charges in 2018, ensuring that the Company remains on a competitive footing.

A N N U A L R E P O R T & F I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S 2 0 1 7 S American p02-22 22 03 2018 09:59 Page 7 C H A I R S S T A T E M E N T The table set out below illustrates the returns generated on the Companys investments, the extent to which the capital base of the Company has grown or shrunk through share issuance and buy-backs, and the full costs of the Companys operations.
The Companys biggest cost remains the management fees at 4.6 million 2016: 4.5 million.
As this fee is calculated as a percentage of assets it varies with the size of the Company and therefore rose, although since only one quarter of the year reflects the changes in management fee structure, this figure is likely to reduce next year.
No performance fee was payable.
However, the Companys NAV total return outperformed the total return of the S&P 500 Index resulting in a performance fee calculation of 1,736,492 for 2017.
This amount, when added to the negative 3,339,696 performance fee offset brought forward, leaves a total remaining negative offset of 1,603,204.
This entire amount will be carried forward and offset against future outperformance.
Full details of the mechanics of the performance fee payments are detailed on page 25.

The Company has continued with its buy back policy, repurchasing 27,487,592 shares into Treasury, at a cost of 104.9 million, representing 10.6% of the Companys issued share capital at the beginning of 2017.
These shares were purchased at an average discount to NAV of 4.4%, producing a modest accretion to the NAV for continuing shareholders.
Such action reaffirms the Boards commitment to its shareholders to buy shares back when they stand at anything more than a small discount to NAV.
The Company will again be asking shareholders to approve the repurchase of up to 14.99% of the Companys shares at the Annual General Meeting.
We will also be seeking shareholder permission to issue shares, where Directors are confident of sustainable market demand.
The authority, if approved, will allow S T R A T E G I C R E P O R T | 7 American p02-22 22 03 2018 09:59 Page 8 C H A I R S S T A T E M E N T the Company to issue up to 10% of its issued share capital from Treasury.
The Company will only issue shares at a price in excess of the estimated NAV including income with the value of the debt deducted at market price.
Discount Premium level month end data calculated with debt at fair value and including income.
Dividends The Company paid an interim dividend in respect of the 2017 financial year of 2.25p on 5th October 2017.
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, a final dividend of 3.25p will be paid on 15th May 2018 to shareholders on the register on 13th April 2018, making a total of 5.5p per share, compared with last years total of 5.0p per share, representing an increase of 10%.
After the payment of the proposed final dividend, we will have a balance in the revenue reserves of 17.8 million equivalent to 7.7p per share 2016: 6.2p or 1.4 times 2016: 1.2 times the current dividend.
It is our intention that such reserves be used to support dividend payments when corporate pay outs are less healthy in the short term, or if there are other fluctuations in the revenue account which we assess to be temporary.
Regulation As shareholders may be aware, from January this year the Company has become subject to considerable new regulation with additional regulatory changes awaited later in 2018, to include new regulation from the EU to bring data protection legislation in line across Europe.
The first new requirements relate to the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products PRIIPS and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II MiFID II regulations, which came into force on 1st January and 3rd January 2018, respectively.
PRIIPS require Managers, who are deemed to be the manufacturer of investment products which includes investment trusts, to prepare a Key Information Document KID in respect of the Company.
The Company is not responsible for the information contained in the KID and investors should note that the procedures for calculating the risks, costs and potential returns are tightly prescribed by regulation.
The figures in the KID may not reflect future returns for the Company and anticipated performance returns cannot be guaranteed.
The KID is available on the Companys website.
It is recommended that the KID is not considered in isolation but is read in conjunction with other documents published by the Company and its Manager.

MiFID II supplements the existing regulation covering trading and reporting requirements.
It is worth highlighting that MiFID II has improved the transparency around research costs that had been paid by clients, which in future will now be absorbed by JPMAM.
Considerable work was undertaken by JPMAM to ensure compliance by the Company on the date of implementation.
The Board The Board has procedures in place to ensure that the Company complies fully with the AIC Code on Corporate Governance and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In accordance with corporate governance best practice, an externally facilitated board evaluation was completed in respect of 2017 and the results confirmed that all Directors possessed the experience and attributes to support a recommendation to shareholders that they retire and seek re-appointment at the Companys forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Board continues to manage succession so that it has an appropriate balance of skills and diverse approaches to its tasks.
Having served as a Director since 2005, Sarah Bates retired from the Board in July last year.
Robert Talbut joined the Board with effect from 11th May 2017.
These changes were described more fully in my Half Year Statement of 3rd August 2017.
The Board will continue to manage succession and refresh its own composition over time.
Directors fees have not been increased since 1st January 2015.
To ensure that the Company can continue to attract good quality candidates and to reflect the increasing workload and responsibilities involved, an increase of 1,000 per Director will be payable from 1st January 2018.
Annual General Meeting and Shareholder Contact This years Annual General Meeting is the Companys 102nd and it will be held on Wednesday, 2nd May 2018 at 2.30 p. m. at 60 Victoria Embankment, London EC4Y 0JP.
As in previous years, in addition to the formal part of the meeting, there will be a presentation from Garrett Fish, who will answer questions on the portfolio and performance.
There will also be an opportunity to meet the Board, Garrett, and representatives of JPMF after the meeting.
I look forward to welcoming as many shareholders as possible to this meeting.
Throughout the year and in addition to the opportunity to hear from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, I very much encourage shareholders to get in touch to share their views.
I can be contacted through our Company Secretary, whose details are set out on page 81.
Outlook Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, unorthodox monetary policies have been followed by the worlds Prudent to leading Central Banks.
These policies have succeeded in avoiding a global recession and recapitalising the tenuous balance sheets of the banking sector.
But along the way, they have also created asset price expect inflation.
Over this period, the Companys NAV has comfortably more than tripled as the US stockmarket occasional has appreciated in value.
We may now be at a point of change.
The Federal Reserve, along with other bouts of market Central Banks, has begun to tighten monetary policy.
It remains to be seen how bond and equity markets volatility fare when faced with a headwind of rising short interest rates, but it would seem prudent to expect occasional bouts of market volatility.
The Board takes reassurance from the fact that the Manager constructs the Companys portfolio to have favourable valuation, quality and momentum attributes when compared to the overall market benchmark.
While these cannot provide immunity from market declines, over time they are the features which should favour outperformance.
