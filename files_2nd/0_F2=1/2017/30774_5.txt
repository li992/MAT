Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 12 CASE STUDY Hackathon A live 28-hour hackathon in June brought together RBsR&D and marketing experts with creative and entrepreneurial minds from other leading organisations around the world.
Their mission: to pioneer blockbuster innovations that could protect childrens health from the devastating effects of air pollution exposure in China, where levels are among the highest in the world.
The teams presented their ideas to a judging panel made up of esteemed healthcare experts and a packed audience at the Cannes Lions festival.
The product solutions proposed were: Dream Cocoon, a dome made of specially engineered charcoal bamboo fabric, which filters air while babies sleep peacefully in a cot: GrowAir, a protective, customisable face shield designed using soft, transparent plastic to clean the air children breathe in as they play outside: and the winning solution, StrollAir, a small, portable and convenient connected air filtering device that repels polluted air and provides babies in prams with a clean air bubble.
This product idea is now being investigated by RBs global R&D team.
