STRATEGIC REPORT PROPERTY PORTFOLIO REVIEW PROPERTY PORTFOLIO REVIEW Stable investment markets Investment markets Investment markets for the Groups property sectors have remained broadly stable during the year, with yields largely unchanged.
For UK shopping centres, transaction volumes totalled 1.6 billion in 2017, approximately 40% lower than 2016.
The key transactions were a 7.5% stake in Bluewater, Kent and a 50% stake in intu Chapelfield, Norwich.
Whilst the year was less active, there was still demand for high-quality centres from sovereign wealth funds, REITs and institutional investors and yields were unchanged for this type of asset during 2017.
Demand for more secondary centres has been subdued and these properties have suffered outward yield movements of 25-75 basis points.
Investment transactions for the UK retail parks market totalled 2.7 billion in 2017, approximately 10% higher than in 2016.
Investors have remained selective, favouring lot sizes of less than 50 million where yields have remained stable, with some inward yield shift for the best parks.
UK funds have been the most active buyers in the market, although few large schemes have transacted during the year and a number of these have suffered outward yield shift of 25-50 basis points.
In France, as with 2016, there were relatively few shopping centre transactions with total volumes of 1.0 billion 2016: 0.8 billion.
This was largely due to a lack of sellers in the market and demand for high-quality centres remained strong with yields at record low levels of 3.5%-4.5%.
In Ireland, investment markets remained active and although volumes were approximately 50% lower than in 2016, they remained higher than recent average levels.
Foreign investors accounted for approximately 35% of acquisitions and yields for high-quality Dublin shopping centres remained unchanged in 2017 at approximately 4.0%-5.0%.
The European outlets sector has again witnessed strong investor demand, with volumes of 1.1 billion in 2017 2016: 1.6 billion.
As with the Groups other property sectors, investment yields have remained stable, with those for the best European outlet centres ranging from 4.5%-5.5%.
Portfolio valuation The Groups total portfolio, including premium outlets, was valued at 10,560 million at 31 December 2017, an increase of 589 million or 5.9% during 2017.

This was the final conversion to property ownership of the Irish loan portfolio acquired in October 2015 and required an additional cash payment of 56 million 2 in 2017 see page 154 of the Financial Statements for further details.
The 45,400m centre generates passing rent of 7 million 50% share and is anchored by Dunnes Stores with more than 90 stores and restaurants, an 11-screen cinema and 2,000 car parking spaces.
in October we acquired Cergy 3 shopping centre which is adjacent to our existing Les 3 Fontaines centre in Cergy Pontoise in north west Paris 2 for a cost of 81 million 72 million.
The 11,000m centre is anchored by Fnac and has 46 units.
A major extension project has recently started on the existing scheme see page 36 and we are able to manage the leasing and customer services across both centres to enhance the overall customer experience.
three premium outlet centres acquired by VIA Outlets: Zweibrcken Fashion Outlet on the Germany France border in February: Vila do Conde, Porto in March and Norwegian Outlet, Oslo in September.
The Groups share of the acquisition costs was 238 million, which required a cash payment of 130 million with the remainder being funded from secured bank finance.
The former two centres were part of a portfolio of four properties acquired from the IRUS fund, where the acquisition of the other two centres completed in December 2016.
Norwegian Outlet in Oslo is a 2 fully-let 13,300m centre with 77 units occupied by international brands including Diesel, Gant, Guess, Hugo Boss and Superdry.
Since acquisition, work has been undertaken to improve the marketing strategy, tenant mix and the centres aesthetics to enhance the customer experience.
COM 49 Property portfolio review continued Capital expenditure In 2017, capital expenditure totalled 191 million.
Table 28 shows the expenditure on a sector basis and also analyses the spend between the creation of additional area and the creation of value through the enhancement of existing space.

46 million was incurred on UK retail parks, with the main projects creating area being the second phase of development at Elliotts Field, Rugby and an extension project at Kirkcaldy see page 31.
Expenditure classified as not creating additional area principally related to the redevelopment of Parc Tawe, Swansea and further details are provided on page 36.
In France, the most significant projects included the creation of the theatre at Italie Deux, Paris see page 35 and reconfiguration works at Place des Halles, Strasbourg which were completed prior to the disposal of the centre in December.
Capital expenditure on Developments and the UK other portfolios totalled 42 million of which 41 million was on the Groups development properties.
In the table above, expenditure on the Orchard Centre, Didcot is classified as creating area and costs incurred working up the future major development projects at Brent Cross and Croydon are classified as creating no additional area until works start on-site.
Further details of these projects are included in the Business Review on pages 36 and 37.
For Premium outlets, capital expenditure totalled 41 million, of which 20 million was incurred by Value Retail and 21 million by VIA Outlets.
The schemes classified as creating area were the extensions at Bicester Village, Freeport Lisbon Fashion Outlet and Batavia Stad Amsterdam Fashion Outlet.
Other capital expenditure includes tenant incentives of 5 million with the remaining expenditure incurred across both outlet portfolios to enhance the existing and recently acquired properties.
Disposals Disposals totalled 508 million during 2017, or 416 million after deducting the 35.5% non-controlling interest in Place des Halles, Strasbourg.
We therefore achieved our disposal target of 400 million announced at the beginning of 2017 and the three principal disposals during the year were: in July, we sold Westwood and Westwood Gateway Retail Parks in Thanet for total proceeds of 80 million reflecting a net initial yield of 6.5%.
The Group acquired the Westwood Retail Park in 2002 and repositioned the asset through extensions and tenant engineering.
In 2005, the 2 adjacent Westwood Gateway was constructed and since the original acquisition, we created a total of 15,000m of lettable space and increased rental income by over 200%.
in November, we announced the disposal of Place des Halles, Strasbourg for total proceeds of 291 million 258 million, of which the Groups 2 64.5% share was 188 million 166 million.
The disposal of the 41,600m centre completed in late December.
also in December, we announced the sale of Saint Sbastien, Nancy for 162 million 143 million of which 129 million of the disposal was 2 completed and funds were received by the year end.
The Group acquired the 24,000m shopping centre in 2014 for 130 million 109 million and repositioned the centre through a renovation project and an enhanced tenant mix.
These latter two disposals are consistent with our strategy of focusing our French portfolio on our three wholly-owned major shopping centres being Les 3 Fontaines and Italie Deux, both in Paris, and Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille.
To support the recently announced intu acquisition we will continue with our capital recycling strategy and are targeting disposals of 500million in 2018.
We have already sold two UK retail parks: Battery Retail Park in Birmingham for 57 million and Wrekin Retail Park in Telford for 35 million.
These disposals were in line with December 2017 valuations.
50 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT PROPERTY PORTFOLIO REVIEW Valuation change Table 29 below analyses the sources of the valuation change for the Groups property portfolio, including premium outlets, during 2017.

In the UK, shopping centres produced a gain of 24 million with increases at Bullring, Westquay and Union Square.
UK retail parks incurred a deficit of 27 million, principally due to outward yield shift at a number of parks.
The underlying value of the French portfolio decreased by 11 million, principally due to the recognition of additional purchasers costs at LesTerrasses du Port.
The Irish assets recorded a valuation deficit of 2 million.
This reflected a 46 million adverse movement associated with an increase in Irish stamp duty, announced in October, from 2% to 6%.
This adverse valuation change was largely offset by the impact of income growth from leasing activity at Dundrum Town Centre and Ilac shopping centre totalling 36 million.
Developments and UK other properties produced a surplus of 37 million, of which 24 million was from the Development portfolio and was 2 principally associated with the progress made on the 33,000m Les 3 Fontaines extension.
UK other properties generated a surplus of 13 million with the most significant change at our Bristol High Street properties following a re-gear of the head lease.
Premium outlets performed strongly, achieving a surplus of 225 million, including significant income growth of 198 million.
The Value Retail Villages produced a surplus of 198 million, predominately from Bicester Village.
VIA Outlets generated a revaluation surplus of 27million with the largest increases at Batavia Stad Amsterdam Fashion Outlet and Fashion Arena Prague Outlet.
The surplus was suppressed due to the recognition of acquisition related costs on the three acquisitions completed in the year.
Further valuation, returns and yield analysis is included in Tables 99 and 100 in the Additional Disclosures on page 181.

Like-for-like ERV at the Groups investment properties grew by 0.9% in 2017 compared to no growth in 2016.
ERV growth at UK shopping centres was 0.9%, lower than the 1.6% growth achieved in 2016.
The strongest performing centres were Bullring, The Oracle and Westquay where ERVs grew by more than 2%.
ERVs at Silverburn fell by 3% associated with a number of lease expiries at the centre.
ERV at UK retail parks reduced by 0.1%.
The recognition of growth continues to be hindered by the high occupancy levels across the portfolio which act to minimise the opportunity to prove new rental levels to the valuers.
ERVs in France increased by 0.9%, with Les Terrasses du Port achieving growth of 3.1% associated with the strong leasing performance and enhanced tenant mix at the centre in 2017.
Ireland produced the highest level of growth at 2.7%, having generated 9.0% in 2016 following the initial loan conversions in the second half of 2016.
All three shopping centres achieved like-for-like ERV increases with Dundrum Town Centre generating growth of 2.9%.

The Groups property portfolio generated a total return of 6.8% in 2017, reflecting a capital return of 2.2% and an income return of 4.5%.
The best performing sector was Premium outlets which generated a total return of 16.8%, principally due to the revaluation surplus of 225 million across the two outlet portfolios.
We compare the individual portfolio returns against their respective IPD benchmarks and compare the Groups portfolio against a weighted 60:40 UK All Retail Universe:Bespoke Europe excluding UK All Retail Universe index.
These indices include returns from all types of retailproperty.
As neither annual IPD benchmarks are available until after this Annual Report has been published, it is not yet possible to accurately estimate the Groups comparative performance.
The UK IPD Quarterly All Retail Universe to December 2017 is available and reported a total return of 6.9%, 200 basis points higher than the Groups UK portfolio return of 4.9%.
The Quarterly IPD index included a total return of 2.9% for Shopping centres, 8.4% for Standard shops and 7.5% for Retail warehouses.
Compared to the quarterly index, the Groups shopping centres outperformed their comparative IPD index by 230 basis points, whilst UK retail parks underperformed due to a number of the Groups larger parks suffering outward yield shift as investors favoured smaller lot size parks in 2017.
In 2017, the Reported Group portfolio see Financial Review on page 53 for explanation produced a total return of 4.2%, whilst properties held by our joint ventures and associates generated a total return of 8.8%.
The performance of the latter portfolio was boosted by the strong return from Premium outlets.
An analysis of the capital and total returns by business segment is included in Table 99 on page 181.

11.7 For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Groups return on shareholders equity was 8.3%, which compares to the Groups estimated cost of equity of 8.2%.
The income element of the return on equity tends to be relatively low given the high-quality nature of the Groups property portfolio.
The capital element of the return was driven by the portfolios valuation performance during the year.
Hammersons total shareholder return for 2017 was -0.4%, which represents an underperformance of the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index by 13.1 percentage points as the wider index has risen relative to the Companys subdued share price performance during 2017.
Over the last five years, the Groups average annual total shareholder return has been 6.2%, compared to 11.7% for the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index.
