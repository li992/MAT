The 2017 awards for Executive Directors were granted at the lower level approved by share owners in the latest compensation policy.

2 The ROE measure for EPSP awards issued in 2013 and 2014 was a 10% to 14% average return.
As in previous years, WPPs TSR performance is compared to companies representing our most relevant, listed global competitors, weighted by market capitalisation.
For 2017 EPSP awards, the comparator group comprised Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis.
GfK and Havas, two of the comparator companies, have been taken over since the start of the performance period by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vivendi, respectively.
In line with the guidelines previously established by the Committee, the two companies will be removed from the comparator group as neither will be listed for more than 40% of the eventual performance period.
TSR performance is calculated on a market  basis in both common and local currency weighted equally.
Using a dual basis ensures that the interests of both local and international investors are reflected in the performance measures.
EPSP measures and targets for 20182022 The Committee is reviewing both the measures and the targets as part of its regular annual review.
If the Committee determines that changes are required, major share owners will be consulted prior to awards being made later in 2018.
