Remuneration Policy The Companys current Remuneration Policy was approved by the Companys members at the AGM in March 2017, in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 Regulations.
As noted above, the Committee intends to submit a revised Remuneration Policy for the approval of shareholders at the forthcoming AGM in March 2018.

and equity vesting from any other programmes It is expected that executives will retain, as a minimum, at least 50% of any vesting LTI awards each year until a time at which these ownership guidelines are achieved Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 3.
Illustration of the remuneration packages for each Executive Director under different performance scenarios The Company currently has an interim Chief Executive Edward Bramson who does not receive any remuneration for undertaking this role.
For that reason, we have set out the potential remuneration only for the Chief Financial Officer in this years report.
The chart below illustrates the remuneration package, and shows potential pay-outs at different levels of performance.
The value of each element, and the percentage of total remuneration that each represents, has been included.
Remuneration packages 000 1500 1,380 1,500 1,200 43% 900 705 600 21% 33% 32% 330 300 47% 100% 24% 0 0 Below target Target Maximum Fixed pay Short-term incentives Long-term incentives Short-term Long-term Level of performance Fixed pay incentives incentives Total pay Below target 100% 330,000 Target 47% 32% 21% 705,000 Maximum 24% 33% 43% 1,380,000 Notes: Short-term incentive includes deferred shares.

Target performance assumes pay-out at 25% the payment for median performance.
No payment for dividends or share price growth is assumed 4.
Other relevant policies relating to Executive Directors remuneration Administrative Powers Under Incentive Plans and the Application of Discretion It is important for the Committee to be able to exercise appropriate discretion to ensure that pay outcomes are fair and represent underlying performance.
The Committee is therefore able to amend performance outcomes either in an upward or downward manner where it believes it is appropriate to do so.
The detailed rationale behind any application of discretion will be explained as transparently as possible in the subsequent annual Directors Remuneration Report.
In addition to the operational features described, the Committee retains standard administrative powers and has absolute discretion to decide but is not limited to the following: To whom awards are allocated Determination of the result of any disputes relating to the interpretation of the rules The level of the awards under the incentive plans and the timing, within the parameters set in the rules and Alteration of the terms of the performance targets if it feels that they are no longer reflective of the Companys performance as long as the revised targets are no less challenging than those being replaced The Committee also retains the discretion to forfeit or clawback deferred awards under the annual bonus plan if it determines that prior performance which resulted in the annual bonus being awarded was discovered to be a misstatement of results or a product of inappropriate management behaviour.
94 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Approach to Recruitment Remuneration The Committee is responsible for setting the package for any new Executive Director.
On appointment of a new Executive Director, the Committee would seek to offer a remuneration package which can secure an individual of the calibre and skillset required to fulfil the role successfully to help drive long-term value for our shareholders.
In determining the appropriate remuneration package for a new Executive Director, the Committee will consider the calibre of the candidate, the level of their existing remuneration, the jurisdiction from which the candidate is recruited from and their skills and experience.
Additionally, decisions will be informed by consideration of market data for companies of a similar size and complexity and contextual information regarding remuneration paid to employees elsewhere in the organisation.
Any remuneration package would be in line with the parameters set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy.
In the event of recruitment of a new Executive Director, the rationale behind the package offered will be explained in the subsequent Annual Report on Remuneration.
Where an individual forfeits outstanding incentive awards with a previous employer as a result of accepting the appointment within the Company, the Committee may offer compensatory awards to facilitate recruitment in the form of a buy-out award.
These awards would be in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into account all relevant factors including the form, expected value, performance conditions, anticipated vesting and timing of the forfeited awards.
The expected value of any compensatory awards would be no higher than the value forfeited, and, where possible, the Committee would aim to reflect the nature, timing, and value of awards forgone in any replacement, compensatory awards.
While cash may be included to reflect the forfeiture of cash-based incentive awards, the Committee does not envisage that golden hello cash payments would be offered.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share and incentive plans.
If necessary, awards may be granted outside of these plans as currently permitted under the Listing Rules, but in accordance with the principles set out in this section.
For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Executive Director Service Contracts It is the Companys policy to enter into contracts of employment with Executive Directors which may be terminated at any time by either the Company or the Executive Director upon 6 months notice.
A summary of the way in which each element of remuneration is treated on loss of office is included in the table on page 96.
Loss of Office Policy In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the employment contract as well as the rules of any relevant incentive plans.
The Committee carefully considers compensation commitments in the event of an executives termination.
The aim is to avoid rewarding poor performance and to reduce compensation to reflect the departing executives obligations and to mitigate losses.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 95 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review The main elements of remuneration would typically be treated in the following ways: Element Good leaver All other leavers Fixed pay during the Save for summary dismissal, executives will receive base pay and other benefits over their notice notice period period including any period where they are not required to work.
Alternatively, the Committee may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice.
Typically amounts will be paid in monthly instalments and reduce, or cease, in the event that remuneration from new employment is received Bonus for final year of The Committee may award an executive an annual bonus payment No bonus payment will service in respect of their final year of service while they are under notice be made if the Director is under notice This payment will usually be pro-rated to reflect the portion of the financial year for which they were in active employment.
Pay-outs will be calculated with reference to individual and financial performance measures in the usual way The Committee may determine that a portion of such a bonus must be deferred.
Outstanding deferred Deferred bonus awards are retained by executives leaving the Awards will lapse bonus awards Company and will vest on the original timetable Outstanding Executives will retain their outstanding long-term incentive awards.
Awards will lapse long-term incentive These awards will ordinarily be pro-rated based on time employed, will awards vest on the original timescale and will remain subject to the original performance conditions assessed over the entire performance period as well as the holding period The Committee may determine that a Director is a good leaver if they leave the Company as a result of either death, retirement with the agreement of the Committee, ill health, redundancy, or for any other reason as determined by the Committee.
Where an executive passes away in service the Committee may elect to bring-forward the vesting of awards.
Other payments may be made to compensate executives for the loss of employment rights on termination.
Payments may include amounts for agreeing to non-solicitation and confidentiality clauses, reimbursement of legal fees and or for settlement of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors employment.
In the event of a change of control, deferred bonus awards would continue in accordance with their terms, subject to the Committees discretion to determine otherwise.
The vesting of outstanding long-term incentive awards would normally be accelerated, the percentage of each award which will vest would be determined by the Committee taking into account the performance conditions and the proportion of the Vesting Period which has elapsed at the date control was obtained.
Pay and Employment Conditions Across the Group When determining the Remuneration Policy, structures, and practices for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the pay and employment conditions applied across the organisation to ensure that pay structures are suitably aligned and that absolute remuneration levels remain appropriate.
The Committee reviews the pay ratios between the Executive Directors and the broader workforce, and also takes into account the general basic salary increases for employees across the organisation when determining Executive Director salary increases.
Employees are not directly consulted on the design, structure, or levels of Executive Directors.
Open Dialogue with Shareholders The views of our shareholders on remuneration are extremely important to the Committee.
As such, it is intended that an ongoing and open dialogue with shareholders is maintained.
It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders and investor representative bodies prior to proposing any material changes to either this policy or any related remuneration arrangements at an AGM.
External Appointments of Executives It is the Companys policy to allow each executive to accept and fulfil one Non-Executive Directorship of another company, although the Board retains the discretion to adjust this policy on a needs-basis.
The individual executive is permitted to retain any fees received in respect of any such external appointment, the details of which will be set out in the Directors Remuneration Report each year.
96 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5.
Remuneration Policy for the Chairman of the Board and Non-Executive Directors Electras policy on Non-Executive Board remuneration is to set both the structure and level of fees to reflect the need to attract high-calibre Board members, and the scope of the responsibilities, time commitment, and market practice.
Terms of Appointment The appointment of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are subject to letters of appointment.
Service contracts are not used for Non-Executive Board members.
The letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM.
In line with the requirements of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code for FTSE 350 companies, all Non-Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

It will be subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM in March 2018.
While we have attempted to comply with the disclosure requirements, during the financial year the Company had just 11 remunerated employees and an interim unpaid Chief Executive Officer.
It has therefore not been possible to comply with all elements in full for example the comparison of percentage increase in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer with that of all the employees of the Company as a whole.
Where possible we have followed both the spirit and requirements of the Regulations and provided as much information as possible to help shareholders understand the Companys pay arrangements.
The Law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
Remuneration and Nominations Committees The Board established separate Remuneration and Nominations Committees with effect from 2nd December 2016, in place of the joint Remuneration and Nominations Committee which had existed prior to that date.
The Remuneration Committee members are David Lis Chairman, John McAdam from 1st January 2017 and Linda Wilding.
Roger Perkin, the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, attends once a year to discuss the possible clawback of bonuses.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year to determine the Companys Remuneration Policy and to set up the LTIP.
It also met on 1st December 2017 to approve Gavin Mansons bonus for 2016 17 and adjustments to the LTIP award as a result of the Special Dividend paid on 1st December 2017.
The Remuneration Committee appointed Aon Hewitt to advise it during the year on the implementation of the Companys Remuneration Policy and the establishment of the LTIP.
Aon Hewitt did not provide the Company with any other services during the year and has no other connection with the Company, on which basis the Committee considered that their advice would be objective and independent.
Aon Hewitt received a fee of 140,612 for the provision of their advice.

Pension related benefits include pension contributions and cash in lieu of retirement benefits.
Gavin Manson is entitled to have pension contributions of 10% of salary 30,000 paid into the Company pension scheme but due to HMRC limits on the amount of contributions that he can make each year, the actual amount paid into the scheme is 12,000 and the balance is paid to him in cash.

Implementation of policy during 2017 18 Chief Financial Officer Mr Mansons salary for 2017 18 will be addressed as part of the Committees review of the Remuneration Policy, which will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
Performance Measures for Annual Bonus Plan As reported last year, 2016 17 was a transitional year, and the Committee therefore looked to select annual bonus plan measures which would capture performance against our key objectives over this year while ensuring alignment with shareholders.
Since it was not possible to set traditional performance targets such as profit or portfolio-oriented measures the Committee determined that the 2016 17 bonus would be based on: 50% TSR 40% strategic objectives and 10% cost control The Committee believed that this would ensure a focus on shareholder value while incentivising the executives to deliver the changes needed in the year to position the Group for future growth.
These targets will be reviewed for 2017 18 in light of the emerging strategy.
102 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Performance Measures for 2017 18 Long-term Incentive The LTIP granted in 2017 18 will be based on TSR relative to the other constituents of the FTSE 250 over the financial years 2016 17, 2017 18 and 2018 19.
Median performance will result in 25% of the shares vesting increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
All shares net of tax will be subject to a 2 year holding period after they vest.
Further detail is provided in Note 21 of the Financial Statements.
Recruitment of a New Chief Executive Edward Bramson is currently the interim Chief Executive of Electra Private Equity PLC.
He does not receive any remuneration for undertaking this role.
Should Electra appoint a new Chief Executive during 2017 18, their remuneration would be in line with the Remuneration Policy and will be set out in the 2018 19 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Non-Executive Director Fees Following shareholder approval of a resolution to increase the permitted upper limit on Non-Executive Directors fees from 450,000 per annum to 750,000 per annum at the AGM held on 23rd March 2017, the base fee was increased, with effect from 1st January 2017, to 50,000.
Additional fees for chairing the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee and Valuations Committee were increased to 10,000 but with no additional fees for chairing the Nominations Committee.
The Senior Independent Director fee also increased to 10,000.
There are no plans to increase the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors during 2017 18.
