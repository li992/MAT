The prior year results were impacted by the reduction in the personal injury discount rate the Ogden rate which is used to settle large personal injury claims.
This was reduced from 2.5% to minus 0.75%, with effect from 20 March 2017, which resulted in a reduction in adjusted operating profit of 20.0m and a decrease in profit after tax of 18.0m.
On 7 September 2017, however, the UK Government announced their intention to introduce legislation that would result in the discount rate being calculated with reference to the yields on a portfolio of low risk investments.
This would likely result in an increase to the discount rate but the legislation has not yet been enacted.
