Strategic Report Our financial and business performance Financial overview SSE is committed to creating and sustaining long-term Key questions to Gregor Alexander, value.
Its first financial objective is to deliver annual dividend SSE Finance Director increases that at least keep pace with inflation, whilst ensuring that the dividend is covered by Adjusted EPS at a level that Given the challenges in the operating environment, how committed are you is sustainable over time.
A 2.1% increase in the dividend per to future dividend increases, in line share to 91.3p demonstrates that despite an increasingly with RPI?
competitive and changing operating environment SSE Were fully committed to meeting our longstanding financial objective of annual dividend is focused on responsibly delivering what it says it will increases, at least in line with RPI.
The business for shareholders and this year was no exception.
Our strategic framework, options for growth, relentless focus on efficiency and index-linked revenues in Wholesale and Networks position us well to deliver our financial objective in 2017 18 and beyond.
What is the outlook for capital and investment expenditure?
Disciplined investment in building, owning and operating assets is core to our strategy and since 2010 weve invested almost 11bn.
We are now into a programme to invest around 6bn in the years 2016 to 2020.
All investments are intended to complement our asset base and provide balance to the Group.
Thats why  networks and government mandated renewables, whose revenues are generally index-linked, make up around two-thirds of this investment programme.
Going forward our investments will only proceed if they create long-term value with returns greater than the cost of capital, meaningfully contribute to earnings and provide balance to SSE.
Financial discipline has always been important for SSE, how confident are you that this will be maintained?
Financial discipline, securing a diversity of funding sources and maintaining a strong balance sheet are fundamental to how we run our business.
Our credit rating illustrates this, and we are committed to maintaining robust ratios for both retained cash flow and funds from operation to debt.
This, alongside a strong balance sheet, gives SSE the capacity to invest to create long-term value.
Financial discipline, therefore, will always be part of our plans.
How consistent is SSEs financial focus with its agenda on sustainability?
In addition to being committed to the transparency demanded in tax by the Fair Tax Mark, we are also involved in Accounting for Sustainability.
It is aiming to make sure that financial and accounting systems better reflect wider environmental and social factors and help support better business decision-making.
As a long-term business in a key sector, this is highly relevant for SSE.
