This growth was driven by increased usage by a number of key customers during the year, with around 900 active aircraft currently using the service.
Over the medium term, we expect to transition a portion of these customers onto GX for Aviation IFC services.
A substantial number of airlines signed up for the provision of GX for Aviation IFC services during 2017, including Qatar Airways, Avianca, AirAsia, Philippine Airlines and Air Astana, and we now have over 1,300 aircraft expected under signed contracts for IFC services, 2016: 950 aircraft, with around 3,000 aircraft in our new business pipeline.
During the year, several customers made progress with their GX terminal installation programmes, including Deutsche Lufthansa Group, and we continue to support them in preparation for active service.
