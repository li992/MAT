Recent transactions in the PBSA market demonstrate the strong demand for our assets and the external valuers have reflected that in their appraisal of our valuations.

The acquisition, which was supported by Aston University, demonstrates the depth of our relationship with the University and the strength of the Unite Students brand amongst Universities.
The refurbishment works to common areas and shared kitchens are complete and, along with the lettings performance and cost efficiencies, are supporting financial performance ahead of plan.
Unite has recently secured two further University partnership schemes.
Firstly, during the year, we acquired the former Cowley Barracks in Oxford.
Working with Oxford Brookes University, we have secured planning permission to build 887 beds and agreed terms for a 25-year nominations agreement with the University, taking our partnership with them to over 1,250 beds.
The agreement provides the University with much-needed accommodation in a location where new development is difficult and Unite with income and rental growth certainty over the long term.
Secondly, following the year end, Unite secured a new development site, our first in London since 2013, in Middlesex Street, E1.
Working with Kings College London, we will submit a planning application to build around 1,000 beds of cluster-flat accommodation in the second half of the year.
We expect to enter into a long-term nominations agreement over this property, providing much needed, capacity in a location where there is a severe shortage of high quality affordable student accommodation.

Following the tragic events caused by the fire at Grenfell Tower, we completed Richard Simpson a full review of fire safety across our Group Property Director estate.
Working with the Department 21 February 2018 of Communities and Local Government DCLG, we undertook testing of cladding materials from an estate of 132 buildings.
Samples from six buildings did not meet the standards as set out in the initial test.
Following the initial test, samples from three of the buildings have been submitted for retesting to ensure that the full cladding system rather than a sample is subject to test.
We expect results in the next few weeks.
Following the receipt of the initial test results, experts from local fire and rescue authorities undertook a detailed inspection of the overall design of all six properties and the safety measures and procedures in place.
We took the decision to close one of the buildings, Sky Plaza in Leeds, for the 2017 8 academic year.
We worked closely with the two Universities and our customers in Leeds and were able to find alternative accommodation for all affected customers across our estate in Leeds.
We thank them for their understanding and support during this challenging period.
The local fire and rescue authorities concluded that the remaining five properties remain safe for occupation, subject to some minor improvements that have all been implemented.
