Sports Direct International plc Annual Report 2017 VIABILITY STATEMENT In this years Annual Report, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Board to express its view of the longer term viability of the Company and to explain how the Directors have assessed the Companys prospects, taking into account the Companys current position and principal risks, over an appropriate period determined by the Board.
In line with FRCs Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting, the Board has carried out a robust assessment of those risks that would threaten the Groups business model, future performance, solvency, liquidity and its resilience to the threats to its viability posed by material risks.
The Board chose to review these over a three-year period as this best reflects the budgeting and planning process of the Company and the expected timescales for strategy implementation.
Key areas included reflect our key risks and uncertainties: macro-economic factors, including prevailing market conditions in key geographic areas, key currency requirements and the uncertainty relating to Brexit for both investment confidence and customer confidence: internal factors including planned store openings, sales modelling profiles and expected capital expenditure requirements, brand profiles and supplier relationships: and operational risks.
When assessing the viability of the Group, the Board has reviewed the Group modelling of the impact of each risk and stress testing of the risk mitigation proposals, with regard to both income and profitability, and net debt impact.
The Board has particularly noted the proposals for future capital expenditure, and the ongoing impact of currency movements and exposure under forward contract and written currency option arrangements.
The Group has a 788m banking facility in place until September 2018, and is currently negotiating appropriate arrangements with a range of potential lenders for a replacement facility postSeptember 2018.
Based on the Boards assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue operating and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period assessed, assuming no major changes in its relationship with key suppliers.
The key risks and uncertainties can be found on pages 66 to 70 together with the steps the Company has taken to mitigate them.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 19 July 2017, and signed on its behalf by: Mike Ashley Chief Executive 71
