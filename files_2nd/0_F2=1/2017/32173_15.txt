The Wholesale business aims to secure maximum value through the flexible provision, storage and delivery of energy for customers in wholesale markets in Great Britain and Ireland.
We manage risks, notably volatile commodity prices, by ensuring a balance and diversity in our business.
Its this diversity that positions us well.
We are focussed on efficiently and safely operating our assets in an increasingly complex market as well as exploiting new opportunities by maintaining our investment momentum.
