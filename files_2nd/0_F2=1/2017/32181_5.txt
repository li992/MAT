Our solutions continue to evolve, in step with the demands of our changing times.
We remain committed to tackling new challenges to build a cleaner and healthier future for the generations to come.
Charging Forward Electric vehicles are on their way and were developing advanced new materials for battery cells in hybrid and full electric cars.
We're engaged in the cutting edge science needed to understand how different cathode materials can reduce the time a battery takes to charge and extend the distance a fully charged electric vehicle can travel.
Our materials are already helping to reduce CO emissions from cars.
Its a long journey 2 to pollution-free roads, but were getting there.
Weve been in business for over 200 years, starting out specialising in precious metals.
But now we devote our science to rather more valuable assets Our planet and its people.
Johnson Matthey Inspiring science, enhancing life Breaking the Silence Cochlear implants can change deaf peoples lives in the most profound way, by providing them with a sense of sound.
The implant consists of vital platinum components: these are made of high grade platinum, which is biocompatible, has high electrical conductivity and strength.
Johnson Matthey produces the components by melting grains of platinum into an ingot or rod, which is then drawn or rolled into wire or strip form.
Last year alone, thousands of men, women and children were able to hear for the first time by using cochlear implants containing our platinum strips and wire.
