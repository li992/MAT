14 Johnson Matthey Annual Report & Accounts 2017 1.
Building a Sustainable Business Growing Responsibly We launched our ten-year Sustainability 2017 programme in 2007 to support growth by running our business in a more sustainable way.
The most important outcome of Sustainability 2017 has been the successful integration of sustainability across Johnson Matthey.
Weve achieved this through engaging employees and making sustainability the way we do business.
Our ethos of sustainability, which focuses on both the way we run our operations and the positive impact of our products and services on the world around us, really struck a chord with our employees and it is their commitment and enthusiasm that has driven our success.
Over the last decade this has transformed the efficiency of our operations, reduced their environmental impact, delivered improved solutions for our customers and created significant value for our shareholders.
Today, more than 93% of our sales come from products and services that are contributing to a cleaner, healthier world.
Measuring the Impact of Sustainability 2017 Sustainability 2017 included six challenging targets to help us build a sustainable business.
Our performance against these is set out in the table below.

We have a target of 0.2 for our LTIIR and our aspiration is one of continual improvement towards zero LTIIR.

Through Sustainability 2017 we have more than doubled our underlying earnings per share while halving our carbon intensity and almost halving our use of key resources, namely electricity, natural gas and water, relative to sales.
Our health and safety performance has improved and we have made health and safety a priority in order to drive further progress.
Occupational illness cases have reduced to just one case for every 1,000 employees.
Sustainability 2017 has delivered cost benefits too.
In 2016 17, we saved approximately 25 million as a result of our sustainability, manufacturing excellence and continuous improvement programmes, bringing the total value generated since 2007 to 142 million.
15 Supporting Global Goals Tackling the most pressing issues of our time requires collective action.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs were introduced in September 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
There are 17 goals for 2030, each providing guidelines and targets for countries and companies to adopt in line with their own priorities.
We have evaluated and aligned our priorities against the SDGs to understand where our products, services, technologies and the way we run our business have the potential to make the greatest contribution.
There are six goals shown below where we believe we can make the biggest positive impact.
We have considered our ability to contribute to these in the context of our areas of material importance, risks, strategic themes and key performance indicators.
In this report we present our non-financial disclosures in accordance with the Global Reporting Standard GRI guidelines see pages 188 and 189.
