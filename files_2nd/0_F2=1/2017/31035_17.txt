Our activities ranged from Fitzrovia is currently one sourcing an interesting opportunity off-market, through a head lease restructure, to obtaining a planning consent for an appealing ofthe most dynamic areas new high quality office and retail building and securing a major pre-let of the offices.
This enabled a forward sale ahead ofLondons West End.
of completion thereby crystallising attractive returns.
Martin Schellein 25-27 and 29-33 Berners Street were acquired from Head of Investment Management The Performing Rights Society PRS in 2012 for 36.5m.
Europe at Union Investment Comprising two post-war office buildings totalling 79,500 sq ft, we acquired 68 year leasehold interests, either side of a smaller building owned by our freeholder, the Berners Allsopp Estate.
The vendor took a short leaseback of the buildings, providing us with income during the planning process.
In conjunction with our freeholder and, after considering refurbishment, we won a valuable planning consent to redevelop all three buildings, having regeared the headlease into a new 127-year leasehold interest.
The completed 108,000 sq ft office and retail building was designed by award-winning architects, Piercy & Company and construction began in early 2015 after rebranding it as Right: The Copyright Building W1 The Copyright Building.
In early 2016 we secured a major pre-let on the entire office element to Capita plc, on a 20-year lease without breaks, for their new London headquarters at a rent of 90 per sq ft on the best space.
As the development was nearing completion, and in our view seeing limited further opportunities to add value, we agreed a forward sale of our leasehold interest in the building to Union Investment for 148.2m net, reflecting a net initial yield of 4.2%, and a capital value of 1,370 per sq ft. Our profit on cost was 23%.
