STRATEGIC REPORT CU STOMER AT OUR HEART Customer at our Heart is the cornerstone of our strategy for profitable growth.
Our desire to create agenuinely customer-centric organisation shapes the way in which we think about the culture of the business and the values by which we work.
It continues to act as a powerful catalyst for change and we believe it is where we have the biggest opportunity to differentiate ourselves from the competition.
We know that happy customers are more likely to comeback to Thomas Cook and to recommend us to theirfriends.
As customer loyalty increases, our cost of sale goes down as customers choose ThomasCook because of our reputation rather than our marketing.
We also know that on average customers that return to Thomas Cook spend more with us than new customers, reflecting their increased trust in our holiday offering.
Operationally, we focus our Customer at our Heart strategy in two areas: the care and reassurance we provide to our customers, set out in our three CustomerPromises of Quality, Service and Reliability: andthe contact we maintain with customers, ensuringthat we are accessible however they choose tointeract with us and forming long-lasting  the year.
