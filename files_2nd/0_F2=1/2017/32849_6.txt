Average GE grade in ore mined was 2.7 g t an leach ore average grade to 1.4 up 48% compared with 2016.
In 2017, a comprehensive technical Processing and production re-equipping of the mine and the renewal of mining fleet were Mines Mines In 2017, Varvara produced a record 130 GE Koz, up 54% year-oncarried out with already visible results in the increased underground 1 3 1 Varvara Kapan year.
Growth was driven by increased processing volumes and mining productivity.
The projects for the reconstruction of the mine substantially improved grades at both flotation and leaching circuits ventilation system and construction of an underground water 2 2 Komar Lichkvaz as more high-grade ore was delivered by rail from Komar, an pumping station have been started.

Processing and production of the project assumes transportaion of ore During 2017, we undertook measures to debottleneck the In 2018, Polymetal aims to transport more than 2 Mt of Komar ore to mined by rail to Varnara processing plant and improve recovery levels.
This included the and further processing Varvara by rail, a key element in plans to further increase production construction of an ore blending warehouse, the overhaul of the to dor.
The additional Komar ore will displace the copper circuit crusher, vacuum filter and thickener, and the lower-grade material from the Varvara deposit and, consequently, installation of a vibrating griddle at the central crushing section.
increase production and result in lower costs at the Varvara processing hub.
