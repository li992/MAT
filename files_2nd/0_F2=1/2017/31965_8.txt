STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 12 Redrow plc Annual Report 2017 13 A better way to build BUILDING RESPONSIBLY As a responsible business, sustainability is at the heart of our operations.
We are proud to have received a Gold award from the NextGeneration benchmark for our management approach and sustainable procurement, alongside achieving ISO14001 certification, in recognition of our focus on reducing our environmental impact across the business.
We were the first housebuilder to be awarded the Three Trees accolade on the WWF Timber Scorecard, which we have retained for a second year, with 99.94% of our timber responsibly sourced.
We have invested in a reporting tool that monitors in excess of 200 sustainability KPIs, which enables us to analyse our operations in great detail, ensuring that as our business grows, we can demonstrate the wider positive environmental, social and economic effects we have on the communities in which we develop.
As we grow, we are working hard to minimise waste, reduce energy consumption and cut carbon emissions, while maximising the amount of land available in each development for open spaces, woodlands and wildlife habitats.
We know that we are not just building homes for today, but building a sustainable future for generations to come.
Redrow were benchmark leaders in environmental site management and sustainable procurement.
We expect that Redrow will continue to rise in our rankings using their newly integrated strategy.
