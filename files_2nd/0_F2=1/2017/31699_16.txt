Environmental, social and governance risks The Board has identified and assessed the significant environmental, social and governance risks to the Companys short and long-term value, as well as the opportunities to enhance value that may arise from improving its environmental performance.
The Sustainability report on pages 23 to 25 reports on environmental matters, including the impact of the Groups businesses on the environment, the Groups annual quantity of greenhouse emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide, the Groups employees, and on social and community issues.
Treasury and risk management The Groups financial risk management objectives and policies, including its hedging policy, and the main risks arising from the Groups financial assets and liabilities are summarised in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 93 to97.
Going concern The financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis, in support of which, the Board has reviewed the Groups trading forecasts for the next 12 months.
These forecasts, which include detailed cash flow projections, comprise assumptions as to sales and profit performance by segment and by month and take account of the normal seasonality profile of the business.
As a result, the Directors are confident that the assumptions underlying their forecasts are reasonable and that the Group will be able to operate within its banking covenants and available liquidity headroom.
Notwithstanding the above, there remains a risk that a downturn in the global economy could result in passenger numbers and consumer spending in the travel market which are worse than the Board is currently envisaging.
As a result, the Directors have also reviewed forecasts which include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk.
Should such a scenario arise, the Directors are confident they have adequate liquidity and covenant headroom to ensure that the Group can meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare this financial information on a going concern basis.
In addition, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Group over a longer period than the 12 months required by the Going Concern provision on page 22 of the Strategic report.
Auditor The auditor, KPMG LLP, has indicated its willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that it will be re-appointed will be proposed at the 2018 AGM.
55 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Statement of disclosure of information to auditors In so far as each Director in office on the date of this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys external auditor is unaware, and the Directors have taken all the steps which they ought to have taken as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys external auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Act.
Forward-looking statements These reports and financial statements contain certain forward-looking statements which are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties: actual future results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied in such statements.
Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the Companys ability to control or estimate precisely.
The forward-looking statements reflect the knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this annual report, and will not be updated during the year.
These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts.
They appear in a number of places throughout this annual report and include statements regarding the current intentions, beliefs or expectations of the Directors, the Company or the Group concerning, among other things, the results of operations, financial condition, prospects, growth, strategies, and dividend policy of the Company and the industry in which it operates.
In particular, the statements regarding the Groups strategy and other future events or prospects are forward-looking statements.
Nothing in this annual report should be construed as a profit forecast.
