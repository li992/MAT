SEGMENTAL REVIEW Introduction HUNTING TITAN Hunting Titans business focuses predominantly on the US and Canadian onshore markets.
The business operates five manufacturing sites, with four in the US and one in Mexico and sells through a network of distribution centres in the US and Canada, with over 95% of external sales derived from North America.
Whilst the business makes some external international sales it also sells perforating systems to other Hunting segments including Europe and the Middle East.
Market Overview The business performance during 2017 has been underpinned by strengthening US and Canadian onshore rig counts.
During the year, the average US onshore rig count increased 75% from 490 units in 2016 to 856 units.
The commensurate increase in onshore spend in the US shows investment rising from $54.4bn in 2016 to $106.5bn or a 96% increase year-on-year.
The US growth was focused in specific low cost basins, in particular the Permian.
In Canada the average total rig count increased from 129 to 212 units, with spend in the year increasing from $8.4bn AN ENERGETICS CHARGE LOCKED INTO THE CHARGE CARRIER.

New product innovation has been an important contributor to Hunting Titans return to strong growth, underpinned by the success of the H-1 Perforating System.
By the end of 2017 H-1 System sales represented 8% of Perforating Systems revenues.
In addition to the benefits for customers see our case study on pages 18 and 19 the packaged system means we sell the perforating gun, the energetics and the instrumentation rather than particular elements as is often the case with conventional sales.
Revenue from H-1 systems are shown across the perforating systems product lines.
In 2017, Titan began the development of a second generation H-1 System, which incorporates enhanced charge technology.
In regard to this development, 13 patents have been filed and are currently being evaluated by patent regulators.
Huntings self-locating autonomous tool project has continued in collaboration with ExxonMobil in the year.
The test bed at the Milford facility is being used to develop the new tool.
In Q2 2017 the phase one project milestones were completed.
In addition, new variants of Huntings jet cutters were introduced to customers early in the year to broaden the Groups offering to global plug and abandonment programmes.
Other new products under development during the year include Ballistic Release and Addressable Release Tools as well as a Magnetic Orientating Tool.
HUNTING PLC 21 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS SEGMENTAL REVIEW CONTINUED Introduction US Huntings US operations are the most diverse in the Group, generating revenues from the OCTG and Premium Connections, Advanced Manufacturing, Subsea, Drilling Tools and Intervention Tools product lines.
In addition, the segment includes the Trenchless business, which mainly services the utilities sector.
The main focus area for most businesses in the segment is domestic US, which covers approximately 90% of external revenues, with Subsea and Advanced Manufacturing more internationally oriented.
In addition, the US manufactures perforating guns and switches for sale to Hunting Titan.
Market Overview Activity and performance of the Groups US operations is driven mainly by a combination of rig count and industry spend.
Historically, the Groups US activity levels have been broadly balanced between onshore and offshore drilling, with profitability from offshore activity contributing strongly to Huntings total revenues and profits.
