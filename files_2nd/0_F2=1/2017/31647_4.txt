HOW WE CREATE VALUE OUR STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL STRATEGY Our strategy articulates how we create value for shareholders and is focused on driving performance in four key areas.
We are strengthening our portfolio and developing our footprint by deploying our Market Repeatable Model, a structured go to market framework for generating quality growth.
Cost optimisation is about being more efficient and effective, and in focusing on cash generation and working capital management, we continue to embed capital discipline in the business.
Aligning resource behind these strategic pillars enables us to make the most of growth opportunities in tobacco and consumer adjacencies, while ensuring we remain in a strong position to continue delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.

These capabilities were codified into our Market Repeatable Model MRM to create a simple, effective and consistent operating framework, building on the Sales Growth Drivers we had been using in the business for many years.
