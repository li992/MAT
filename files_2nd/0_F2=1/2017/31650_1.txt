THE BLACKFRIAR LONDON The Blackfriar, part of our Nicholsons collection of historic city centre pubs, is an historic art nouveau grade II masterpiece of a pub built in 1875 on the site of a Dominican friary.
The building was designed by architect H. Fuller-Clark and artist Henry Poole, both committed to the free-thinking of the arts and crafts movement.
Jolly friars appear everywhere in the pub in sculptures, mosaics and reliefs.
It is fortunate that the More customer feedback pub is still here as it was saved from demolition in the 1960s by a campaign led by Sir John Betjeman, the former poet laureate.
