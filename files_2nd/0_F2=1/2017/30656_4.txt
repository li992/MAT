See pages 22 to 23 on non-GAAP measures for more details.
Underlying sales growth, underlying volume growth, underlying operating margin and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.
In order to provide a clear picture of our performance against the objectives set out in our strategic review we report underlying operating margin, which excludes restructuring costs, in place of the previously reported core operating margin.
For further information about these measures, and the reasons why we believe they are important for an understanding of the performance of the business, please refer to our commentary on non-GAAP measures on page 22.
