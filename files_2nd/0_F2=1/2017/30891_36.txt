Non-executive director interests The figures below indicate and include all the beneficial and non-beneficial interests of each non-executive director of the company in shares of BP or calculated equivalents that have been disclosed to the company under the DTRs as at the applicable dates.
Past directors Sir Ian Prosser who retired as a non-executive director of BP in April 2010 was appointed as a director and non-executive chairman of BP Pension Trustees Limited on 1 October 2010.
During 2017, he received 100,000 for this role.
a Since 2010, vesting of the deferred shares has been subject to a safety and environmental sustainability hurdle, and this will continue.
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all.
In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the SEEAC.
There is no identified minimum vesting threshold level.
b Bob Dudley received awards in the form of ADSs.
The above numbers reflect calculated equivalents in ordinary shares.
One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
c Represents vestings of shares made at the end of the relevant performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested.
The market price of each share used to determine the total value at vesting on the vesting dates of 24 February 2017 and 20 February 2018 were 4.47 and 4.75 respectively and for ADSs on 24 February 2017 was $33.50.
These totals include the additional accrual of dividends which vested on 19 May 2017 and 2 August 2017. d Bob Dudley has voluntarily agreed to defer vesting of these awards until after retirement, therefore the performance period is expected to exceed the minimum term of three years.
The market price of ordinary shares used to determine the total value at vesting on 11 February 2015 was 4.46. e Brian Gilvary has voluntarily agreed to defer vesting of these awards for five years with a further one year retention period.
f The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 4 March 2016 of 3.68. g The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 19 May 2017 was 4.72 and for ADSs was $36.94.
The sterling value has been used to calculate the face value.
h Brian Gilvary has voluntarily agreed to defer vesting of these awards until the later of three years post award or one year post retirement, therefore the performance period is expected to exceed the minimum term of three years.
i All matching shares have been pro-rated to reflect actual service during the performance period and these figures have been used to calculate the face value.
There is no identified overall minimum vesting threshold level but to comply with UK regulations a value of 44.4%, which is conditional on the TSR, operating cash flow, each of the strategic imperatives and strategic progress reaching the minimum threshold, has been calculated.
For awards under the 2017-2019 plan, performance conditions are measured 50% on TSR relative to ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron over three years: 30% on ROACE based on performance in 2019 and 20% on strategic progress assessed over the performance period.
Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.
The market price of each share at the vesting date of 19 May 2017 was 4.72 and for ADSs was $36.94.
For the assumed vestings dated May 2018 a price of 5.01 per ordinary share and $39.85 per ADS has been used.
These are the average prices from the fourth quarter of 2017.
These totals include the additional accrual of dividends which vested on 2 August 2017. d The 2014-2016 award vested on 19 May 2017, which resulted in an increase in value at vesting of 24,644 for Iain Conn.
Details for Bob Dudley and Brian Gilvary can be found in the single figure table on page 95. e Bob Dudley has requested that the EDIP performance shares vestings in respect of the performance periods 2015-2017 and 2016-2018 are based on the 500% maximum annual award level which applies under the 2017 directors remuneration policy, rather than the 550% maximum annual award level which applies under the 2014 directors remuneration policy.
f The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 4 March 2016 was 3.68 and for ADSs was $31.15 and on 19 May 2017 was 4.72 and for ADSs was $36.94.
