These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key observations communicated to the Risk Our response to the risk Audit Committee Our approach focused on the following procedures: Recoverability of the carrying value of the Groups As a result of the audit procedures performed, mining assets Obtained an understanding of managements process and we have concluded Refer to the Audit Committee Report page 61 : Accounting key controls over impairment of mining assets, and walked that managements policies page 99 : and note 16 page 120, 17 and 18 of the through the process in order to assess their design impairment indicator Consolidated Financial Statements page 122 effectiveness in supporting the prevention, detection or analysis and impairment correction of material errors in the financial statements At 31 December 2017 the carrying value of the Groups mining assessment for the Obtained managements assessment of whether any indicators of assets were: Groups CGUs has been impairment or reversal of impairment were present during 2017, carried out appropriately Property, plant and equipment: US$895.7m 2016: US$975.5 : following the requirements of IAS 36 and IFRS 6 and in accordance with Evaluation and exploration assets: US$147.4 US$139.0 : and We corroborated the validity and completeness of the the requirements of IFRS.

Mine rehabilitation provisions Our approach consisted of the following procedures: As a result of the procedures performed Refer to the Audit Committee Report page 61 : Accounting Obtained an understanding of managements process to policies page 99 : and note 26 of the Consolidated Financial we concluded that the estimate the future restoration costs Statements page 128 provisions for mine Obtained a detailed understanding of the mine closure reports rehabilitation activities At 31 December 2017 management has recorded a mine issued by the external specialists engaged by the Group to have been recognised update the mine closure plans, and held discussions directly rehabilitation provision of US$100.1m 2016: US$102.4m.

therefore we consider it as a key audit matter.
Assessed the appropriateness of the accounting for the changes to these provisions, and ensured that these changes and the provisions were appropriately reflected and disclosed in the Group financial statements We performed audit procedures on two full scope components, covering 99% of this risk amount.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 90 Hochschild Mining plc Independent auditors report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc continued The key audit matters included in our auditors report are consistent with those included in prior year.
As part of our audit, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The above is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
An overview of the scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determines our audit scope for each entity within the Group.
Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the Consolidated financial statements.
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal Audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 18 reporting components of the Group, we selected three components covering entities within the UK, Peru and Argentina, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information for three components 'full scope components' which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
In addition to this, for two components 'specific scope components' we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within those components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 97% 2016: 97% of the Groups Adjusted EBITDA on an absolute basis, 100% 2016: 100% of the Groups Revenue and 96% 2016: 96% of the Groups Total assets.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 97% 2016: 97% of the Groups Adjusted EBITDA, 100% 2016: 100% of the Groups Revenue and 89% 2016: 90% of the Groups Total assets.
The specific scope components contributed 7% 2016: 6% of the Groups Total assets.
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.
Of the remaining 13 components that together represent 3% of the Groups Adjusted EBITDA, none are individually greater than 2% of the Groups Adjusted EBITDA.
For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical reviews, testing of consolidation journals and enquiry of management about unusual transactions in these components, to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures represented: Adjusted EBITDA Revenue Total assets 97% Full scope components 100% Full scope components 89% Full scope components 3% Other procedures 7% Specic scope components 4% Other procedures Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
Of the three full scope components, audit procedures were performed on one of these directly by the primary audit team.
For the two specific scope components, the primary audit team performed the audit procedures.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits each of the primary operating locations where the Group audit scope was focused.
During the current years audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary audit team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, to the component team in Peru and by the Senior Statutory Auditor to the component team in Argentina.
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work and meetings with local management.
In addition, the primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process, attended closing meetings either in person or by call and reviewed key audit working papers on risk and other areas.
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Hochschild Mining plc 91 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$6.0 million 2016: US$6.3 million, which is approximately 2% 2016: 2% of the Groups Adjusted EBITDA.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us with an earnings-based measure that is significant to users of the financial statements on which we could set our materiality.
This was deemed to be a critical measure for users of the financial statements, given the focus on this metric by the Groups shareholders, investors and external lenders, specifically as an Adjusted EBITDA measure is used to assess the Groups compliance with key restrictive covenants on the Groups borrowings.
We determined materiality for the parent company to be US$21.1 million 2016: US$16.4 million, which is 1% 2016: 1% of Equity.
The parent company materiality is higher than the Group materiality as it is based on Equity, which we considered to be an appropriate basis for materiality for a holding company, as the users of the financial statements focus on a capital-based measured.
Profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, net of finance cost, foreign exchange loss and income tax Starting basis Add: Depreciation and amortisation in cost of sales and in administrative expenses Add: Exploration expenses other than personnel and other exploration related fixed expenses Add: Other non-cash expenses Adjustments Adjusted EBITDA US$300.8m Materiality: 2% of Adjusted EBITDA US$6.0m Materiality Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 2016: 75% of our planning materiality, namely US$4.5 million 2016: US$4.7 million.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our understanding of the Groups control environment and that there have been no significant events that would alter our expectation that there is a low likelihood of misstatements that would be material individually or in aggregate to the financial statements.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was US$2.2 million to US$3.8 million 2016: US$3.0 million to US$3.8 million.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$300k 2016: US$315k, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 92 Hochschild Mining plc Independent auditors report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc continued Other information The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 86, including the Strategic Report and Governance sections including Directors Report, Corporate Governance Report, Supplementary Information, Directors Remuneration Report and Statement of Directors Responsibilities, other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions: Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 54 the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit: or Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 59 to 62 the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee: or Directors statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 55 the parts of the Directors statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Companys compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the Auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.
10R 2 do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements: and the Strategic Report and the Directors Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in: the Strategic Report or the Directors Report: or the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns: or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made: or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit: or a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.
Responsibilities of Directors As explained more fully in the Directors Responsibilities Statement set out on page 86, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Hochschild Mining plc 93 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud: to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses: and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.
Our approach was as follows: We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those related to the report framework IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code and the relevant tax compliance regulations in UK, Peru and Argentina.
We understood how Hochschild Mining plc is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary.
We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.
We assessed the susceptibility of the Groups financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud.
We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings.
We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud: and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls.
Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.
These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error.
Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above.
Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business: enquiries of legal counsel, Group management, internal audit and all full and specific scope management: and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above.
In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and regulations relating to health and safety and environmental matters.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at https: www.
This description forms part of our Auditors report.
Other matters we are required to address We were appointed by the Company on 16 October 2006 to audit the financial statements of the Company for the period ending 31 December 2006 and subsequent financial periods.
Following a competitive tender process, we were reappointed as Auditor of the Company for the period ending 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 12 years, covering periods from our initial appointment in 2006 through to the year ended 31 December 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit.
The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.
