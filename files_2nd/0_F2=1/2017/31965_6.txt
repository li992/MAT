STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 08 Redrow plc Annual Report 2017 09 A better way to live CREATING THRIVING COMMUNITIES At Redrow, we build more than just homes: we create thriving communities.
We are growing in both reputation and popularity by providing what modern homebuyers want, from their homes, from their neighbourhood and from their local environment.
Redrow creates a better place to live by putting customer expectations at the heart of our home designs.
Our creative and determined approach combines the best of town and country to create healthy, vibrant communities.
Inside our homes we have enhanced our specification by making our ceilings higher, our doors and windows taller and increasing the floor space.
Outside, we have created public open spaces, sports facilities, footpaths and cycleways and contributed 163m to local communities in the last year alone.
Whats more, we are growing the scale of these ideas: leading the way in the garden village movement so that even our largest developments offer the same superb quality of life.
Our developments encourage a better way to live, connecting people to community and nature, enabling happier, healthier lifestyles.
We create networks of footpaths and cycleways to encourage families out into their community to enjoy precious time together in beautiful landscapes.
