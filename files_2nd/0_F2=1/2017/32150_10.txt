The Group expected cash flow to show very strong growth in the year, yet the Directors were particularly encouraged that unlevered free cash flow almost trebled to $133.4 million.
The table below presents the Groups financial highlights on a reported basis: FY17 FY16 Growth $m $m % Billings 632.1 534.9 18.2 Revenue 529.7 478.2 10.8 Cash EBITDA 150.1 120.9 24.2 Adjusted operating profit 38.3 53.4 28.3 Operating loss 44.3 32.7 35.5 Unlevered free cash flow 133.4 46.4 187.5 Net cash flow from operating activities 118.5 21.3 456.3 Definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in note 6 of the financial statements and the glossary Reported billings grew by 18.2 percent to $632.1 million, while billings in constant currency grew at 19.9 percent to $648.7 million, revenue grew 12.3 percent on the same basis to $542.1 million, within which subscription revenue grew 14.4 percent to $420.4 million.
Adjusted operating profit and operating loss were both impacted by the fact that the majority of billings are subscription contracts where the revenue is deferred to future periods: however, the level of spending is driven by billings growth and is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Accordingly, a strong billings performance is very positive for the long-term health of the business and cash generation yet the full benefit to the profit and loss account is in future periods.
Deferred revenues increased by $82.3 million in the period further underpinning the confidence in future revenue growth.
The Group finished the year with $581.0 million FY16: $498.7 million of deferred revenue, $330.6 million FY16: $286.5 million of which is due for release in the year ahead.
