Conduct, compliance and risk management in remuneration Schroders core values are excellence, innovation, teamwork, passion and integrity.
We expand on these in our guiding principles, to more clearly articulate the behaviours that we expect from our employees.
Pages 28 and 29 provide more information on these and other key elements of our people strategy.
Performance management and remuneration are important tools to reinforce expected standards of behaviour.
During the annual performance appraisal, line managers assess each employees behaviours, to identify those whose behaviour exemplifies our values as well as any employees whose behaviour falls short of the standards that we expect.
To drive positive change and reinforce those behavioural expectations, we also operate a global employee recognition scheme, which provides an opportunity to recognise employees who champion our values.
The Groups control functions independently review potential conduct or cultural issues, to identify any instances where performance or behaviours have fallen short of our expectations.
Any issues identified in this way are fed into the performance appraisal and compensation review processes, providing a further opportunity to ensure that attitudes to risk and compliance and behaviours in line with our values are reflected in the determination or allocation of the bonus pool and in individual employee performance ratings and remuneration outcomes.
We identify employees whose professional activities can have a particular risk impact on the Group, or on certain regulated subsidiaries.
Our approach to identifying these MRTs takes account of the different regulatory requirements and guidance that apply across the Group.
Our MRTs are subject to enhanced scrutiny and oversight, including enhanced control function oversight of their activities and direct oversight of their remuneration by the Committee.
Some MRTs, specifically those identified under the UCITS Directive or AIFMD, are subject to higher levels of bonus deferral and a higher proportion of remuneration in fund awards, creating greater alignment with clients and shareholders see page 62.
To ensure the Committee is adequately informed of risks facing the Group and the management of those risks, the Chairman of the Committee serves on the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Committee also receives reports from the heads of Risk, Legal and Compliance as part of its consideration of remuneration proposals.
The Committee reviewed the Groups regulatory disclosures, in the context of the applicable FCA and PRA requirements.
The remuneration disclosures required under the Capital Requirements Directive are incorporated into the Groups Pillar 3 disclosures and are available at schroders.
Other regulatory remuneration disclosures can be found at schroders.
