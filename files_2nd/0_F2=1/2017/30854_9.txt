Large jet delivery These mission and safety critical components and sub-systems must forecast by 2021 perform to exacting requirements for many years in highly demanding operating conditions.
Suppliers must be capable of meeting rigorous certification.
The environments in which many of our products operate result in high levels of wear and tear and demand for spares and repairs.
