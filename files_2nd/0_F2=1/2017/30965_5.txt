Our capital expenditures in 2017 totalled US$604.8 million, while we invested US$141.1 million in exploration activities and paid dividends of US$236.6 million.
HIGH QUALITY ASSETS LONG-TERM VISIBILITY, LONG LIFE RETURNS We are one of Mexicos largest concession holders, with approximately 1.8 million hectares of surface land.
Our district consolidation strategy enables us to leverage local knowledge and shared infrastructure.
Our portfolio of low cost gold and silver mines, high potential development projects and advanced exploration prospects contain over 2,320 moz of attributable silver resources and 38.5 moz of gold resources.
LOW COST AND FLEXIBLE OPERATIONS HEALTHY MARGINS, ADAPTABILITY ACROSS PRICE CYCLES The quality of our assets means that we are able to extract mineral profitably across metal price cycles.
We maximise the potential of each operation by customising mine plans, leveraging technology and sharing personnel, expertise and plant capacity across our districts.
We continue to seek and implement new ways to improve efficiency, optimise our consumption of materials and energy, and maintain our position as a low cost producer.
DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT LONG-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH Before we embark on a development project, we apply stringent viability criteria covering areas such as rates of return and high environmental and social impact standards.
We set delivery timelines and budgets to meet production targets in the context of market conditions, and maintain control by carrying out engineering and construction activities.
Having successfully implemented the second phase of the San Julin mine in 2017, we are on track to deliver the new Pyrites plant at Saucito and the second line of the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura, both in 2018.
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL LICENCE TO OPERATE, ETHICAL CULTURE Our ability to create value for all our stakeholders and ensure operational continuity is built on a series of commitments to sustainability: to understand and respect the needs of local communities: to prioritise local goods, services and employees: to ensure the health and safety of our people: and to minimise our impact on the environment.
During 2017, we invested over US$30.9 million in our HSECR initiatives, up 41% compared with the previous year.

While others react to market pressures by pulling back on their efforts, we maintain a strategic commitment to continuous exploration across all precious metals price cycles.
A steady pipeline of reserves and resources that fuels our ability to deliver growth and returns not just this year or next year, but in the decades ahead.
GROWTH Around US$1.5 billion invested in exploration since 2008.
Number of full-time geologists almost doubled, from 55 in 2009 to 100 in 2017.
Close to 900 kilometres drilled at our operations and projects by the exploration teams in 2017.
RETURNS Around 300 local community personnel employed as assistants to our geologists.
Increase in silver resources from 1.1 bnoz in 2008 to 2.3 bnoz in 2017.
Increase in gold resources from 12 moz in 2008 to 38.5 moz in 2017.

WE DRILLED THE FIRST TEST HOLE IN 2006 AND, SINCE 2008, HAVE INVESTED APPROXIMATELY US$81.5 M IN EXPLORATION.
THIS ACTIVITY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AT SAN JULIN AND WE BELIEVE THERE IS STILL FURTHER POTENTIAL IN THE DISTRICT.
IN 2017, FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUED OUR INTENSIVE EXPLORATION PROGRAMME, DRILLING 73,995 METRES, PRIMARILY ON THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DISTRICT WHERE NUMEROUS TARGETS ARE YET TO BE TESTED.
