Accounting policies are contained within relevant notes and are boxed, with the basis of preparation and general policies collected in Section 5.
An explanation of the use of alternative performance measures APMs is provided on page 31.
REVENUE The Groups primary source of revenue is management fees.
Management fees are based on an agreed percentage of the assets under management AUM.
Initial charges and commissions include fees based on a set percentage of certain flows to our funds and profits earned on dealing within the unit trust managers box, known as box profits.
Performance fees are earned from some funds when agreed performance conditions are met.
Net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of investment management services.
Revenue is shown net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts.
Our primary revenue components are accounted for as follows: ll management fees are recognised in the period in which the service is performed and are calculated as a percentage of net fund assets managed in accordance with individual management agreements: ll initial charges and commissions on sales of unit trusts are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period of the provision of investment management services.
Box profits, which will no longer be earned by the Group from January 2018, are calculated as the difference between the cost of purchasing redeemed units at cancellation prices and reselling them at creation prices.
Such box profits are recognised when the related transaction occurs: and ll performance fees are calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a defined hurdle and are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is virtually certain that the fee will be received.
Such fees are normally recognised at the end of the relevant reporting period of the fund.
Fee and commission expenses These are paid to third parties for ongoing services under distribution agreements and are charged to the income statement over the period in which the service is expected to be provided.
The services provided include the provision of access to a basket of fund products, information on financial products, promotional materials, ongoing services to clients and transaction processing.

SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group offers a range of products and services through different distribution channels.
All financial, business and strategic decisions are made centrally by the Board of Directors the Board, which determines the key performance indicators of the Group.
Information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Board, on a single segment basis.
While the Group has the ability to analyse its underlying information in different ways, for example by product type, this information is only used to allocate resources and assess performance for the Group as a whole.
On this basis, the Group considers itself to be a singlesegment investment management business.
Management monitors operating earnings, a nonGAAP measure see page 31, for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

STAFF COSTS Staff costs include wages and salaries, sharebased payments, pension costs and redundancy costs, along with associated social security costs, and are recognised on an accruals basis as services are provided to the Group.
Pension costs The Group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Contributions in respect of the UK employees at the rate of 15% of gross salary are made into the Jupiter Pension Scheme whose financial statements are available from the trustees at the registered office of the Company.
No liability is included in the balance sheet as no obligations were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Contributions made by the Group are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
2017 2016 m m Wages and salaries 85.0 79.8 Sharebased payments Note 1.5 27.0 18.1 Social security costs 19.2 12.4 Pension costs 4.8 4.4 Redundancy costs 1.0 0.2 137.0 114.9 Fund units As described in Note 1.5 ii, deferred bonuses can be deferred into either options over the Companys shares or a cash equivalent to units in the Groups funds.
The expense included within wages and salaries in the income statement in relation to fund units for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 5.2m 2016: 3.0m.
Where bonuses are deferred into fund units, the fair value of the award is spread over the vesting period and included within staff costs.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date to the expected settlement amount, being the current market value of the underlying fund unit.
Any increase or decrease in value is recognised in the income statement within staff costs.
The liability is included in the balance sheet as part of accrued expenses within trade and other payables see Note 3.9.
The Group hedges its exposure to price fluctuations in the underlying fund units by purchasing the fund units at the date of grant.
These are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL on the balance sheet.
Any change in the fair value of the units is recognised in the income statement within other gains.
Average number of employees The monthly average number of persons employed by the Group during the year, including Executive Directors, by activity is: 2017 2016 Fund management 72 66 Distribution and marketing 121 119 Infrastructure and operations 311 278 504 463 Information regarding Directors aggregate emoluments of 6.4m 2016: 6.2m is given in the Remuneration report.
101 Financial statements SECTION 1: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCOME STATEMENT 1.5.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group engages in sharebased payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees by granting the right to either shares or options over shares, subject to certain vesting conditions and exercise prices.
These have been accounted for as equitysettled sharebased payments.
The fair value of the awards granted in the form of shares or share options is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model, the principal inputs being the market value on the date of award, discounted for any dividends foregone over the holding period of the award, and an adjustment for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the Group and the number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions.
These estimates are reviewed regularly and the charge to the income statement is adjusted appropriately at the end of the relevant scheme as a minimum.
Shares and options vest on the occurrence of a specified event under the rules of the relevant plan.
A summary of the charge taken to the income statement excluding social security for each sharebased payment arrangement is shown below: 2017 2016 m m Interests in options under preListing Share Plan 0.1 Deferred Bonus Plan DBP 14.3 6.3 Longterm Incentive Plan LTIP 12.0 11.0 Sharesave Plan SAYE 0.4 0.4 Share Incentive Plan SIP 0.3 0.3 Total Note 1.4 27.0 18.1 The fair value of the services provided by employees has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Fair value amounts for the options granted under the DBP, LTIP and SAYE schemes were determined using a Black Scholes optionpricing method and the following assumptions: 2017 2016 DBP 2016 LTIP 2017 SAYE 2017 DBP 2015 LTIP 2016 SAYE 2016 Weighted average share price 4.21 4.22 5.37 4.10 4.11 4.54 Exercise price 0.02 4.29 0.02 3.43 Weighted average expected volatility % 28.5 28.1 27.5 27.7 28.0 30.4 Weighted average option life years 3.1 4.2 3.5 3.1 3.2 3.7 Weighted average dividend yield % 3.5 3.5 3.2 3.6 3.6 3.3 Weighted average riskfree interest rate % 0.2 0.2 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.2 Expected volatility for options granted in 2017 and 2016 has been calculated using the historical volatility of the Group.
The numbers above in relation to the LTIP include Joiner Plans as both schemes have a similar structure.
i Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan These options were granted to certain employees prior to listing in June 2010 and allowed them to acquire shares at nominal value, subject to satisfying certain vesting and performance conditions.
The terms of the options allowed individuals to make a payment to the Company entitling them to take up rights to shares between one and five years after the grant date, depending on the individual award.
Some awards were modified in 2015, extending the vesting date by between one and three years.
The interests in options under preListing Share Plan were granted at the nominal price of 0.02, which gives them the characteristics of nil cost options and therefore the fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the award.

OPERATING EARNINGS Operating earnings are defined as net revenue less administrative expenses and do not include investment income and returns, other gains and amortisation of intangible assets.
These are items which the Group considers are not indicative of the ongoing income and costs of its operations.
The Group believes that operating earnings, while not a GAAP measure, gives relevant information on the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations see page 31.
Operating earnings may not be comparable with similarlytitled measures used by other companies.

105 Financial statements SECTION 1: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCOME STATEMENT 1.10.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Groups headquarters are based in the UK.
The Group pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current tax, but there is also a charge relating to tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes deferred tax.
Tax is charged to equity when the tax benefit exceeds the cumulative income statement expense on share plans.
The Group provides for current tax according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns in respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is considered recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax that has arisen in respect of equity items such as sharebased payments is recognised directly in equity and not in the income statement.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year less the weighted average number of own shares held.
Own shares are shares held in an Employee Benefit Trust EBT for the benefit of employees under the vesting, lockin and other incentive arrangements in place.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year for the purpose of basic EPS plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purposes of calculating EPS, the share capital of the parent is calculated as the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue over the years reported.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of EPS is as follows: 2017 2016 Number Number Weighted average number of shares m m Issued share capital 457.7 457.7 Less own shares held 8.9 8.4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 448.8 449.3 Add back weighted average number of dilutive potential shares 10.9 10.5 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 459.7 459.8 2017 2016 Earnings per share p p Basic 34.5 30.3 Diluted 33.7 29.6 107
