HVPE makes commitments to HarbourVest funds, whichin turn build portfolios of private companies via primary funds, secondary investments, and direct coinvestments.
Once funded during the Investment Phase, the capital becomes part of the Investment Portfolio.
During the financial year ended 31 January 2017, HVPE committed $425.0 million to newly-formed HarbourVest funds.
These commitments are complementary to HVPEs existing portfolio of HarbourVest funds and highlight the Companys consistent and ongoing commitments to compelling investment opportunities.
The HarbourVest funds in HVPEs portfolio, in turn, commit capital to managers over a period of typically fouryears and call down capital from HVPE over a period of seven to nine years.
This extended duration of capital calls requires that HVPE maintains an Investment Pipeline of unfunded commitments to help ensure that the Companys assets remain fully invested.
The Company isable to maintain a higher level of unfunded commitments than some other listed companies based on the timing, duration, and predictability of its cash flows.
