Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 41 c Underlying profit before tax As mentioned on page 38, the Groups Infrastructure Investments segment is assessed on an underlying profit before tax PBT measure.
This is calculated as follows: 2017 2016 m m Underlying profit from operations section b and Note 5 116 89 Add: Subordinated debt interest receivable 26 29 Interest receivable on PPP financial assets 11 21 Less: Non-recourse borrowings finance cost 13 24 Underlying profit before tax 140 115 Non-underlying items section b and Note 5 6 6 Statutory profit before tax 134 109 Refer to Note 8 and Note 9. d Underlying earnings per share In line with the Groups measurement of underlying performance, the Group also presents its earnings per share on an underlying continuing basis.
The table below reconciles this to the statutory earnings per share.

e Revenue including share of joint ventures and associates JVAs The Group uses a revenue measure which is inclusive of its share of revenue generated from its JVAs.
As the Group uses revenue as a measure of the level of activity performed by the Group during the year, the Board believes that including revenue that is earned from its JVAs better reects the size of the business and the volume of work carried out and more appropriately compares to PFO.
This differs from the statutory measure of revenue which presents Group revenue from its subsidiaries.
A reconciliation of the statutory measure of revenue to the Groups performance measure is shown in the tables in section b.
A comparison of the growth rates in statutory and performance revenue can be found in section i. f Recourse net cash borrowings The Group also measures its performance based on its net cash borrowings position at the period end.
This is analysed using only elements that are recourse to the Group and excludes the liability component of the Companys preference shares, which is debt in nature according to statutory measures, as this is excluded from the denition of net debt in the covenants set out in the Groups facilities.
Non-recourse elements are cash and debt that are ringfenced within certain infrastructure concession project companies.

The Group calculates its average net cash borrowings based on the average opening and closing gures for each month through the period.
The average net cash borrowings measure excludes non-recourse cash and debt and the liability component of the Companys preference shares, and this performance measure shows average net cash of 42 million for 2017 2016: 46 million net borrowings.
Using a statutory measure inclusive of non-recourse elements and the liability component of the Companys preference shares gives average net borrowings of 117 million for 2017 2016: 230 million.
com AR2017 42 Measuring our performance Providing clarity on the Groups alternative performance measures continued h Directors valuation of the Investments portfolio The Group uses a different methodology to assess the value of its Investments portfolio.
As described on pages 26 to 28, the Directors valuation has been undertaken using forecast cash ows for each project based on progress to date and market expectations of future performance.
These cash ows have been discounted using different discount rates depending on project risk and maturity, reecting secondary market transaction experience.
As such, the Board believes that this measure better reects the potential returns to the Group from this portfolio.
The Directors have valued the Investments portfolio at 1.24 billion at year end 2016: 1.22 billion.
The Directors valuation will differ from the statutory carrying value of these investments, which are accounted for using the relevant standards in accordance with IFRS rather than a discounted cash ow approach.
Reconciliation of the net assets of the Infrastructure Investments segment to the comparable statutory measure of the Investments portfolio included in the Directors valuation 2017 2016 m m Net assets of the Infrastructure Investments segment refer to Note 5.1 629 631 Less: Recourse loans presented within Corporate activities relating to Infrastructure Investments projects 13 12 Less: Net assets not included within the Directors valuation: Housing division 24 21 Infrastructure asset see Note 5.2 6 Comparable statutory measure of the Investments portfolio under IFRS 592 592 Infrastructure asset represents the Groups carrying value of Blackpool Airport.
Blackpool Airport was not included in the Directors valuation and has been disposed in 2017.
Comparison of the statutory measure of the Investments portfolio to its performance measure 2017 2016 m m Statutory measure of the Investments portfolio as above 592 592 Difference arising from the Directors valuation being measured on a discounted cash ow basis compared to the statutory measure primarily derived using a combination of the following IFRS bases: historical cost amortised cost fair value 652 628 Directors valuation performance measure 1,244 1,220 2017 valuation includes 62 million relating to the 7.5% second partial disposal of the Connect Plus M25 asset, as the disposal proceeds had not been received at year end.
The proceeds were subsequently received on 23 February 2018.
The difference between the statutory measure and the Directors valuation performance measure of the Groups Investments portfolio is not equal to the gain on disposal that would result if the portfolio was fully disposed at the Directors valuation.
This is because the gain loss on disposal would be affected by the recycling of items which were previously recognised directly within reserves, which are material and can alter the resulting gain loss on disposal.
The statutory measure and the Directors valuation are fundamentally different due to the different methodologies used to derive the valuation of these assets within the Investments portfolio.
As referred to in the Strategic Report on page 26, the Directors valuation is calculated using discounted cash ows.
In deriving these cash ows, assumptions have been made and different discount rates used which are updated at each valuation date.
Unlike the Directors valuation, the assets measured under statutory measures using the appropriate IFRS accounting standards are valued using a combination of the following methods: h istorical cost amortised cost fair value for certain assets and liabilities within the PPP portfolio, for which some assumptions are set at inception and some are updated at each reporting period.
There is also an element of the Directors valuation that is not represented by an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
This relates to the management services contracts within the Investments business that are valued in the Directors valuation based on the future income stream expected from these contracts.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 43 i Constant exchange rates CER The Group operates across a variety of geographic locations and in its statutory results, the results of its overseas entities are translated into the Groups presentational currency at average rates of exchange for the period.
The Groups key exchange rates applied in deriving itsstatutory results are shown in Note 3.
To measure changes in the Groups performance compared with the previous period without the effects of foreign currency uctuations, the Group provides growth rates on a CER basis.
These measures remove the effects of currency movements by retranslating the prior periods gures at the current periods exchange rates, using average rates for revenue and closing rates for order book.
