This represents a 39% reduction on the previous year.
Outlook and expectations Outlook and expectations Outlook and expectations We expect gold production in 2018 to reduce We expect all-in sustaining costs in 2017 We are targeting a reduction in our TRIFR of to between 435,000 to 475,000 ounces to rise to between US$935 to US$985 per at least 10% in 2018, with the goal of making driven by reduced operations at Bulyanhulu ounce sold.
The increase is primarily driven by sure everyone goes home safely and healthy and a move to stockpile processing a US$50 per ounce sold release of non-cash every day.
