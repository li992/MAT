These two men do therefore effectively provide the senior executive management of Finsbury Growth & Income Trust PLC the Company : they are an essential part of our successful operations.
When we first started working Anthony Townsend with them, the Board therefore felt it was of great importance Chairman that we took a meaningful participation in each of their businesses, not just to align our commercial interests with 14 December 2017 theirs but to bind them in to the future prosperity of the Company.
At the time we approached Lindsell Train in 2000 to discuss with them taking on the investment mandate for the Company, they were in the process of establishing Lindsell Train Investment Trust plc LTIT which was to take a 25% interest in Lindsell Train: the balance is held by the founding directors Michael Lindsell and Nick Train together with some of their key colleagues.
The option of taking a stake directly in Lindsell Train was therefore not open to us, but taking a significant shareholding in their new investment trust was and so we invested 1,000,000 in January 2001 at 100 per share into LTIT.
At 30 September 2017, that holding was worth 8,300,000, due in no small part to LTITs very valuable holding in Lindsell Train.
When Alastair Smith established Frostrow in 2007, we were able to negotiate with him that the Company took a 10% direct participation in Frostrow at a cost of 150,000, of which 75,000 has been repaid.
It is of course an unlisted investment, but using well established industry norms, we have valued that holding at 1,680,000 at 30 September 2017, including the AIFM investment, which is valued at 480,000 see note 1 a on page 52 for further details.
We have also received very tax-efficient profit distributions totalling 1,781,000 from Frostrow since inception.
