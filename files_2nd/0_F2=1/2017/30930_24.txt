RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is on page 126 and IFRS profit after tax for the financial year increased to 145.8 million from 111.7 million in the prior year, principally due to increased funds under management, which are a long-term driver of profit.
The profit before tax decreased from 486.3 million to 342.1 million in the current year, principally due to the decrease in charges deducted from Life Investment business in respect of policyholder tax, which is subsequently due to HMRC as explained on page 32.
This movement was mainly driven by relative investment performance in the year, reflecting the fact that the investment return was less positive in 2017 than the prior year.
The profit before tax was also impacted negatively by the 59.0 million movement in DAC, DIR and PVIF balances, as explained on page 34.
An interim dividend of 15.41 pence per share, which equates to 81.2 million, was paid on 29 September 2017 2016: 12.33 pence per share 64.8 million.
The Directors recommend that shareholders approve a final dividend of 27.45 pence per share, which equates to 145.2 million 2016: final dividend of 20.67 pence per share 108.8 million to be paid on 1 June 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 6 April 2018.

SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE OF CONTROL The Company has a number of contractual arrangements which it considers essential to the business of the Company.
Specifically, these are committed loan facilities from a number of banks and arrangements with third party providers of administrative services.
A change of control of the Company may cause some agreements to which the Company is a party to alter or terminate.
These include bank facility agreements and employee share plans.
The Group had committed facilities totalling 460.5 million as at 21 February 2018 which contain clauses which require lender consent for any change of control.
In addition, the Group guarantees the obligations of loans made to Partners in connection with facilities agreed with various lenders totalling 170.3 million in aggregate.
Should consent not be given, a change of control would trigger mandatory repayment of the saidfacilities.
