Express serves as a platform for bringing the currently under-banked population into banking and its main focus is to enable its client base to transact in a fast and easy way.
In 2017, we installed 113 new Express Pay terminals, resulting in 2,842 total Express Pay terminals at the end of the year.
We are leaders in Georgia in the payment systems market.
In 2017, we won a tender, organised by Tbilisi City Hall, for the modernisation of the public transportation payment system in Tbilisi.
As a result, the Bank will continue to be the sole provider of payment support services to the public transport network, and operate Express branches in Tbilisi metro i. e. subway stations for the next ten years.
As part of the tender mandate and the Banks own digitilisation strategy, Bank of Georgia will implement a modern digital payment system across public transport network in Tbilisi, including payment processing using Visa and MasterCard cards, and create a digital platform for ticket reservations and purchases through mobile applications.
The Banks branch network presence in public transport services contributes c. 2.1 million transactions per month.
We issued 388,567 Express cards in 2017 and had 1,258,940 Express cards outstanding at the end of the year.
In 2017, the number of clients served and number of total transactions through Express cards increased by 48.3% and 15.2% y-o-y, respectively.
We sell only a limited number of banking products to our Express Banking clients.
Currently, 106 out of a total of 156 Express branches are located in Tbilisi.
Nowadays, Express is the major growth driver in our fee and commission income from the Retail Banking segment and a strong franchise attracting the unbanked population to the Bank, eventually growing them into mass retail customers.
BANK OF GEORGIA UNPARALLELED MASS RETAIL BANKING FRANCHISE Under the Bank of Georgia brand, we serve mass retail clients, for whom we have successfully optimised and redesigned the operating model of our mass retail branches around a client-centric approach.
Mass retail is the largest segment of Retail Banking, where we aim to increase the product to client ratio from the current 1.8 to 3.0 in the medium term.
In 2017, we accelerated proactive interactions with our clients by advising and offering them the financial products and solutions that best serve their individual needs.
We continue to see strong growth in sales volumes and the number of products sold to our clients in transformed branches, contributing to 29.3% y-o-y growth in the retail loan book.
The number of products sold to mass retail customers has increased by 163.0%, compared to the sales before transformation of the retail segment.
In order to unlock the full potential of current customers and boost a product to client ratio, we launched a new loyalty programme called Plus in 2017.
The programme is part of the mass retail customer-centric approach and offers the customers different status levels and reward points.
They accumulate based on their business with the Bank and can redeem points with partner companies products and or services.
At 31 December 2017, the number of upgraded members reached 159,781 and active Plus cards outstanding were 250,307, while the total number of members grew to 586,870.
SOLO A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PREMIUM BANKING The Solo brand is used to serve the emerging mass affluent segment.
Our new Solo model was introduced in 2015.
It is a fundamentally different approach to premium banking.
As part of the new strategy, the Banks Solo clients are given access to exclusive products and the finest concierge-style environment at our specially designed Solo lounges, and are provided with new lifestyle opportunities, such as exclusive events and handpicked lifestyle products.
To qualify for Solo services one needs to have an income of GEL 3,000 per month.
At Solo lounges, clients are attended by personal bankers and, in addition to the banking products, are offered luxury goods at cost and other lifestyle offers including a travel magazine and entertainment.
In 2017, Solo organised concerts with world famous artists.
Such events are limited to Solo clients and create additional interest in the Solo franchise.
Profit per Solo client reached GEL 1,704 in 2017, over 24 times what we have in the mass retail segment under the Bank of Georgia brand.
Solos gross loan book and deposit portfolio demonstrated impressive growth of 44.7% and 37.4% y-o-y.
We are well on track to achieve our target of 40,000 Solo customers by the end of 2018, from the current 32,104.
The share of new customers acquired in 2017 accounted for 43.8% of the total of Solo clients at the end of the year, which clearly demonstrates the growing popularity of the franchise in our domestic market.
In 2017, we launched Solo Club, a membership group within Solo, which offers exclusive access to Solos products and offers ahead of other Solo clients at a higher fee.
This includes American Express Platinum cards, which were also launched in 2017 and are available to Solo Club members only.
