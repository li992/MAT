The performance targets for the LTBPP are not disclosed for the year ahead, given the commercially sensitive nature of a number of the targets which are derived from the Groups business plan.
Shortly after the end of each year, the Committee assesses the key targets and the extent to which management has been able to meet these targets for that year and reports on this assessment excluding any that are still commercially sensitive.
The targets are only adjusted during the year if material events occur that necessitate a change to the business plan.
