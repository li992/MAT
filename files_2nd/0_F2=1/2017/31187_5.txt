Key Performance Indicators We measure our progress against our strategic objectives using the following key performance indicators: How measured: Gross profit growth represents revenue less cost of sales expressed as the Gross profit growth % percentage change over the prior year.
It consists principally of placement fees for permanent candidates and margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates.
2017 9.8 Why its important: This metric indicates the degree of gross profit growth in the business.
2016 3.0 It can be impacted significantly by foreign exchange movements in our international markets.
2015 4.4 Consequently, we look at both reported and constant currency metrics.
How we performed in 2017: Gross profit increased 14.6% in reported rates, 9.8% in 2014 3.7 constant currencies, as favourable currency movements benefited the full year figures.
2013 -2.5 Relevant strategic objective: Organic growth.
Increase in gross profit in constant currency over the prior year Gross profit How measured: Total gross profit from a geographic regions outside the UK: and b disciplines outside of Accounting and Financial Services, each expressed as a percentage of diversification % total gross profit.
Why its important: These percentages give an indication of how the business has 80.2% 63.3% diversified its revenue streams away from its historic concentrations in the UK and from the Accounting and Financial Services discipline.
ExHow we performed in 2017: Geographies: the percentage increased to 80.2% from 76.4% Accounting Ex-UK and Financial in 2016, demonstrating a high degree of diversification.
This also reflected strong trading Services conditions in the majority of our overseas businesses, along with the weakness of Sterling.
Disciplines: The percentage increased to 63.3% 2016: 61.6%, as our professional disciplines of HR, IT, Executive Search and Secretarial performed strongly, combined with 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 good growth in our technical disciplines, comprising Property & Construction, Procurement & Ex-UK 75.9 74.0 72.7 76.4 80.2 Supply Chain and Engineering.

How measured: Gross profit from each type of placement expressed as a percentage of Ratio of permanent vs total gross profit.
temporary placements Why its important: This ratio reflects both the current stage of the economic cycle and our geographic spread, as a number of countries culturally have minimal temporary placements.
Gross profit 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 It gives a guide as to the operational gearing potential in the business, which is significantly greater for permanent recruitment.

Indirect GHG emissions 4,689 4,948 How we performed in 2017: Direct GHG emissions relating to the combustion of fuel decreased by 11.2% to 1,627 tonnes CO e, while Indirect GHG emissions, through the 2 purchase of energy such as electricity, increased by 5.5% to 4,948 tonnes.
How measured: Intensity values for GHG emissions are based on property and vehicle energyIntensity values of derived emissions per 1,000 headcount.
Headcount is viewed as being the most representative GHG emissions metric for PageGroups activity levels and is unaffected by issues such as business mix or foreign exchange variations.

It helps to identify where progress has been made on emission reduction.
How we performed in 2017: Energy-derived emissions were reduced by 9.6% compared with 2016, largely due to relocations to more energy efficient offices, changes in fuel sources, and an increase in headcount without a corresponding increase in the number of offices.
2016 Direct and Indirect GHG emissions were originally reported as 1,662 and 4,703 respectively.
These have been restated to reflect the latest DEFRA fuel conversion rates in 2017.
The 2016 Intensity value of energy-derived emissions has been restated from 1,052 to 1,078 on the same basis.
The source of data and calculation methods year-on-year are on a consistent basis.
The movements in KPIs are in line with expectations.
Emissions have been calculated in line with Greenhouse Gas Emissions GHG the 2017 DEFRA reporting standards, and In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report calculated using 2017 DEFRA conversion Regulations, PageGroup reports on all direct greenhouse gas GHG emissions relating to the factors for fuels, gases and UK electricity, and combustion of fuel and the operation of any facility, together with any fugitive emissions : and indirect International Energy Agency conversion factors GHG emissions through the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling.

Since 2014, we have gathered energy data from our major offices.
This is in conjunction with our The intensity values are based on emissions environmental policy that focuses on implementing efficiency measures in our offices to reduce energy derived from property energy and vehicle fuel consumption and carbon emissions.

The emissions for vehicles in other countries were calculated by first extrapolating emissions and energy consumption due to print the Germanys fuel consumption per vehicle and then calculating the resulting emissions.
Emissions activities being reduced by nearly 80% over that derived from property energy consumption amounted to just under 80% of total emissions.
