Serco presents alternative measures to include the Revenue and Trading Profit of these discontinued operations in prior periods for consistency with previous disclosures.
Reflecting statutory reporting requirements, Sercos share of revenue from its joint ventures and associates is not included in revenue, while Sercos share of joint ventures and associates profit after interest and tax is included in Underlying Trading Profit.
As previously disclosed and for consistency with guidance, Sercos Underlying Trading Profit measure excludes Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments principally OCP releases or charges, and the benefit in 2016 from not depreciating and amortising assets held for sale, and other one-time items such as those in 2016 related to the early exit from the Thurrock contract.

Amongst smaller contract awards were new wins to provide facilities management in Abu Dhabi and defence training support in Qatar.
Serco was unsuccessful however in pursuing the very large tenders for light rail and tram operations in the region.
Extensions to existing work included facilities management for Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, and air navigation services and training in Bahrain and Iraq: there were no other large rebid or extension decisions due in the year.
Of existing work where an extension or rebid will be required at some point before the end of 2020, there are 13 contracts with annual revenue of over 5m within the Middle East division: in aggregate, these represent well over half of the current level of annual revenue for the division.
There is a high proportion of work to secure in 2019, when the Dubai Metro, MELABS and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi contracts each require extending or rebidding: by 2020, our Dubai Air Navigation Services will also become due for further extension or rebid.
Our pipeline of major new bid opportunities in the region has reduced very significantly following the outcome of the light rail and tram bids.
There are some other smaller opportunities in transport and defence support services, and effort is ongoing to rebuild a stronger pipeline.
