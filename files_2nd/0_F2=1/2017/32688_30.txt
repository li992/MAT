Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Redefine International P. L. C. Annual Report 2017 93 Purchase of own shares and shares in Treasury At the 2017 AGM, shareholders granted the Directors authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares in the Company in certain circumstances and to hold those shares in Treasury.
Shares were purchased by the Company in 2011, but Directors have no present intention of exercising this power.
The authority to purchase shares would only be exercised after careful consideration by the Directors and as and when conditions were favourable, with a view to enhancing earnings per share and or net asset value per share, which would be of benefit shareholders.
Legislation in the Isle of Man was enacted in 2014 which allows companies who buy their own shares to hold them in Treasury rather than cancel them, up to a maximum of 10 per cent.
If the Company purchased its own shares it would therefore hold such shares as treasury shares which the Company could sell for cash.
All rights attaching to shares purchased under this authority, including voting rights and rights to dividends, would be suspended whilst they were held in treasury.
During the financial year and up until the date of this document, no shares were purchased and no shares were held in Treasury.
