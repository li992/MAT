Realisation costs include the cost of getting the material to market, the marketing of the material and the financing cost of selling the material.
The power of business costs is that by adjusting all product qualities relative to the same benchmark 62% Fe fines product delivered to North China it allows all mines to be compared on a cost curve on a like-for-like basis.
This also means that by subtracting the benchmark price from the business costs for a mine you get an estimate of cash flow from that operation.
