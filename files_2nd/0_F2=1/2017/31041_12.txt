Case study: Tailoring our products to meet patients needs We are focused on providing patients with the products that they need.
For our Injectable portfolio, hospital clinicians determine what and how medicines are administered to patients within the clinical setting.
In 2017, we held focus groups with hospital pharmacists to increase our understanding of how clinicians currently administer injectable products and to identify their unmet needs.
This increased understanding will enable us to develop products that improve workflow efficiencies and ultimately support hospitals in their quest to provide better and safer patient care.
