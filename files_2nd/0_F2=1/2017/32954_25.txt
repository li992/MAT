As noted on page 90, the salary for Mor Weizer was increased from 600,000 to 1,000,000 with effect from 1 June 2017 and the salary for Andrew Smith was increased from 325,000 to 350,000 with effect from 1 June 2017.
2 The figure for bonuses in 2017 above represents a payment as determined by the Remuneration Committee for the Executive Directors given the strong performance during the period and by reference to their actual salary earned during the year to 31 December 2017.
The bonuses were determined in Pounds Sterling and then converted into euros at the exchange applicable as at 31 December 2017.
Details of a how the annual performance bonus for the Executive Directors was determined: and b the timing of bonus payments, is set out below.
3 Benefits include private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, car and life assurance.
DETERMINATION OF 2017 BONUS In accordance with the Companys Remuneration Policy, the CEO and CFO had the opportunity to earn a normal bonus in respect of 2017 of 200% and 150% of salary respectively.
The 2017 performance was assessed against a mixture of financial and non-financial targets.
The financial targets representing 70% of bonus opportunity used a target of Adjusted EBITDA of 347 million as a reference point, payable on a sliding scale of 0% for threshold to 100% for maximum performance.
Adjusted EBITDA was selected as an appropriate measure as it is the key financial performance metric of the Company, most closely representing the underlying trading performance of the business and is calculated after adding back certain non-cash charges, cash expenses relating to professional costs on acquisitions, gains on sale of investments and certain one-off charges as set out in the financial statements on page 127.
The non-financial performance targets were selected to underpin key strategic objectives of the Group, in particular recognising the challenges of expanding the business into regulated and soon-to-be regulated markets and strengthening the Groups regulatory functions in light of increased regulation in the UK and elsewhere.
When reviewing the performance during 2017 the Committee noted that the Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 was 322.1 million.
Although this level of Adjusted EBITDA was below the reference point of 347 million, it was above the threshold target and also represented a 7% increase on the prior year.
The Committee also took account of currency factors, ongoing provisions and research and development costs as well as the overall achievements of management during a challenging period in some of the markets in which the Company operates.
The operational highlights set out in the Strategic Report on page 4 demonstrate that a number of the key strategic objectives set for executives have already been successfully implemented, particularly in regards to securing business in regulated and soon-to-be regulated markets.
The Committee also took account of the exceptional work and effort undertaken as part of the continuing integration of Tradetech, the acquisitions of Eyecon Group and ACM Group and the new agreement with OPAP.
The Committee considered that, overall, performance in 2017 was very strong in the context of challenging markets.
The Committee felt it was fair and reasonable to recognise this strong Group and individual performance of the Executive Directors.
89 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 GOVERNANCE Accordingly, the Committee determined that the bonus payable for 2017 was 1,746,034 for the CEO 186% of salary earned in 2017 and a bonus of 533,949 for the CFO 139% of salary earned in 2017.
25% of these amounts will be deferred in shares for two years.
The Committee is satisfied that the annual bonus payments to Executive Directors are a fair reflection of corporate and individual performance during the year and that overall remuneration is not excessive given the size and complexity of the Groups business and the industry in which it operates.
LTIP AWARDS AUDITED On 28 June 2017, the following awards were made to Executive Directors under the LTIP: % of award vesting for Total number Aggregate threshold Performance Type of award of awards market value performance period Mor Weizer Nil-cost option 207,792 2,252,945 25% 1.1.
17 31.12.19 1 Awards represent 200% of salary for Mor Weizer and 150% of salary for Andrew Smith based on a share price on grant of 962.5 pence.
In the normal course of events these awards will vest on 1 March 2020, subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions.
Awards granted in 2017 are subject to the achievement of a mixture of performance conditions: 70% of the award is subject to a performance condition that the Companys simple annual EPS growth must match a threshold determined by the Committee for 25% of this portion of the award to vest, increasing to full vesting for achieving a maximum performance level.
EPS will be measured over three financial years commencing with the financial year in which the award is granted.
The remaining 30% of the award is subject to a performance condition comparing the Companys total shareholder return TSR against the FTSE 250 on a ranked basis.
The TSR tranche shall vest 25% for median performance increasing straight line to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The EPS tranche shall vest over a number of shares determined as follows: Companys simple annual EPS growth % of EPS tranche that vests 15% or more per annum 100% Between 6% and 15% per annum On a straight line basis between 25% and 100% 6% per annum 25% Less than 6% per annum 0% When setting the EPS performance range, the Committee considered both internal financial targets and external market consensus.
The target range is considered to be challenging given the current view of the business and wider macroeconomic factors, but is achievable without incentivising any undue risk behaviour.
The LTIP awards granted in December 2015 vested subject to performance measured over the three-year period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017.
The outcome was as follows: Measure Weighting Performance condition How fulfilled % of this award vesting EPS 70% Simple growth in EPS between 4% for 25% vesting and 21% 100% 10% for 100% vesting 1 Relative TSR 30% TSR performance between median for 25% vesting Below median 0% and upper quartile for 100% vesting 1 Measured against a comparator group of other international gambling companies.
Based on the outcome above, 70% of the total award vested.

DETERMINATION OF 2017 BONUS CONTINUED TERMINATION PAYMENTS AUDITED No termination payments to Directors were made in 2017.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AUDITED There were no payments made to past Directors in 2017.
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY FOR 2018 SALARY PAY REVIEW The Remuneration Committee takes into account individual performance and experience, the size and nature of the role, the relative performance of the Company, pay policy within the Company including the general pay and employment terms of all employees in the Group and salaries in comparable companies.
Mr Weizers salary was set at 1,000,000 with effect from 1 June 2017.
The Committee recognises that this represents a significant increase over his previous salary of 600,000.
However, the Committee is of the view that the increase was fully justified in light of the significant growth of the Company in recent years and Mr Weizers exceptional leadership during this period.
The Committee was also cognisant of the competitive landscape in the gaming industry and Mr Weizers proven ability to grow the business in a challenging market environment.
For a number of years during the Companys growth period, Mr Weizers salary was unchanged.
The Committee feels that his salary should fairly reflect his achievements and leadership of a large UK-listed company in a fast-moving, competitive sector.
Mr Smith was appointed as an Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer on 10 January 2017.
His salary was set at 325,000 with effect from appointment.
Following the normal annual salary review in June 2017, his salary was increased to 350,000 with effect from 1 June 2017.
This increase reflected his growth in the role since his appointment in January and brought his salary closer to the mid-market level when compared against remuneration paid at companies of a similar size to Playtech.
The Executive Directors salaries will be reviewed, but not necessarily increased, as part of the annual review in 2018, which is expected to commence in June.
The current basic salary levels of the Executive Directors are: M. Weizer: 1,000,000 equivalent to 1,126,474 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts which was effective from 1 June 2017: and A. Smith 350,000 equivalent to 394,266 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts which was effective from 10 January 2017.
Fees currently payable to Non-executive Directors are: Chairman: 384,000 equivalent to 432,566 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts : and Non-executive Director base fee: 105,000 equivalent to 118,280 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts.
These fees were increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 January 2017 and by 2.5% with effect from 1 June 2018.
The Non-executive Director fees recognise core responsibilities and additional duties as Chair of a Board Committee.
BENEFITS AND PENSION Benefit and pension provision will continue to be set in line with the approved policy.
ANNUAL BONUS For 2018, bonuses for the Executive Directors will be based on the following: Performance target Weighting Adjusted EBITDA Commercially confidential 70% Non-financial and strategic objectives Commercially confidential 30% When setting the Adjusted EBITDA target, the Committee will be mindful of a number of factors and the targets will be very challenging.
The level of bonus payable by reference to the financial performance of the Company will be determined on a sliding scale based on the Companys budget for the forthcoming financial year.
There will be retrospective disclosure of the target and performance in next years report.
The annual bonus will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in relation to material misstatement, gross misconduct, material error in calculation and for a serious reputational event.
These provisions will apply for a period of three years after payment.
91 PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 GOVERNANCE LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Awards made to Executive Directors will vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to i participants remaining in employment other than in certain good leaver circumstances and ii achievement of challenging performance targets.
Awards granted in 2018 will continue to be subject to a combination of EPS growth 70% of awards and relative TSR 30% of awards.
Threshold performance will result in 25% of each element vesting.
As with the awards granted in 2017, the relative TSR measure will be measured against the FTSE 250 on a ranked basis over three financial years and require at least median performance for 25% of this portion of the award to vest, increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
EPS will be measured over three financial years.
At the time of preparing this report EPS targets for 2018 have not been determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The EPS targets will be stretching and demanding and will be set out in Stock Exchange announcements when made.
LTIP awards granted from 2017 will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in relation to material misstatement, gross misconduct, material error in calculation and for a serious reputational event.
These provisions will apply for a period of three years post vesting.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, market purchase shares or may be cashed-out, subject to the tax treatment in the hands of the recipient.
DILUTION LIMITS All of the Companys equity based incentive plans other than the Option Plan which was established before the Companys admission to AIM in 2006 incorporate the current Investment Association Guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital or reissue of treasury shares, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period for executive plans.
The Committee monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of options or share awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits.
Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from such calculations.
No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 December 2017. REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE The following graph shows the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the past five years: the Companys TSR is compared with a broad equity market index.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER In the financial year ended 31 December 2017, Mr Weizers salary was increased by 67% effective 1 June 2017 and was awarded an bonus of 186% of salary compared with 200% of salary in the year ended 31 December 2016.
On the basis of salary received for the year, the increase was 35%, which also in part reflected movements in exchange rates.
The average percentage changes for all UK-based full-time employees were a 5.9% increase and a 41% decrease in salary and benefits respectively mainly due to significant fluctuations in exchange rates in the period, and 44.9% increase in bonus payments.
The UK workforce was chosen as a comparator group as the Remuneration Committee looks to benchmark the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer with reference mainly to the UK market albeit that he has a global role and responsibilities, and remuneration packages across the Group vary widely depending on local market practices and conditions.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The following table sets out the amounts paid in share buybacks, dividends, and total remuneration paid to all employees as follows: 2017 2016 Change Pay-outs m m m % 1 Dividends 113.2 102.8 10% Share buy backs 49.9 N A 2 Total employee remuneration 279.6 241.4 16% 1 The total dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 is calculated on the basis that the shareholders approve the proposed final dividends of 23.9 cents per share.
2 Total employee remuneration for continuing and discontinued operations, includes wages and salaries, social security costs, share-based payments and pension costs for all employees, including the Directors.

ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDER VOTING The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring open dialogue with shareholders in relation to remuneration and would normally consult with major shareholders regarding any significant future changes to the Remuneration Policy.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders ahead of presenting the new Policy to a formal shareholder vote in 2017.
