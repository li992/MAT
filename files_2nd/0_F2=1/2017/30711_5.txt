Compared to 2014, the decline in the offshore rig count now stands at 44%, or a reduction of 160 units in Jan 17 Mar 17 Jul 17 Sep 17 Nov 17 Jan 18 May 17 operation, since the highs of three years ago.
Source: Bloomberg The Henry Hub natural gas price has averaged $3.04 per mmBtu in 2017, and traded within the range of $2.56 to $3.50 throughout the year.
In the US, gas storage draw-down has approximately matched gas production, which has meant that gas drilling has remained relatively stable in the year.
Market commentators note that with this return to more normal activity levels, prices and drilling activity are forecast to remain steady in the year ahead.
