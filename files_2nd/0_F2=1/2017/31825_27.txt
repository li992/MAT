Impairment tests for goodwill At 31 July 2017, goodwill has been allocated to nine individual CGUs, of which seven are within the Banking division, one is the Securities division and the remaining one is the Asset Management division.
Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out annually by assessing the recoverable amount of the groups CGUs, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The recoverable amounts for all CGUs were measured based on value in use.
A value in use calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent board approved budgets and three year plans to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The key assumptions underlying managements three year plans, which are based on past experience and forecast market conditions, are expected market-making conditions in the Securities CGU, expected total client asset growth rate and revenue margin in the Asset Management CGU and expected loan book growth rates and net return on loan book in the Banking CGUs.
Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2017 124 The Notes continued 14.
Intangible assets continued For cash flows beyond the groups three year planning horizon, a terminal value was calculated using a prudent annual growth rate of 0% 2016: 0%.
The cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market rates appropriate to the CGU as set out in the table below.
At 31 July 2017, the results of the review indicate there is no goodwill impairment.
The inputs used in the value in use calculations are sensitive, primarily to the impact of changes in the assumptions for future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
Having performed stress tested value in use calculations, the group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Details of the CGUs in which the goodwill carrying amount is significant in comparison with total goodwill, together with the pre-tax discount rate used in determining value in use, are disclosed separately in the table below: 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 Pre-tax Pre-tax Goodwill discount rate Goodwill discount rate Cash generating unit million % million % Winterflood Securities 23.3 13.7 23.3 15.3 Close Brothers Asset Management 38.5 9.5 33.7 11.0 Novitas 12.1 11.1 Other 28.9 11.1-12.3 28.9 11.7-13.0 102.8 85.9 15.

As noted in the directors report on page 51, at the forthcoming AGM, the board intends to ask shareholders to approve a special resolution to cancel the companys share premium account.
If it becomes effective, the cancellation will increase the companys distributable reserves by 307.8 million.
Capital The groups policy is to be well capitalised and its approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
The Prudential Regulation Authority PRA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition, a number of subsidiaries are regulated for prudential purposes by either the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
The groups Pillar 1 information is presented below.
Under Pillar 2, the group completes an annual self assessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP is reviewed by the PRA which culminates in the PRA setting Individual Capital Guidance ICG on the level of capital the group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold, which is currently set at a total capital add-on of 1.9%, of which 1.1% needs to be met with common equity tier 1 CET1 capital.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that groups capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website www.
The group maintains a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to ensure the group meets the Pillar 1 capital requirements, ICG and additional Capital Requirements Directive buffers at all times.
As a result, the group maintains capital adequacy ratios above minimum regulatory requirements, which are currently set at a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 6.8% and a minimum total capital ratio of 11.2%, both inclusive of ICG and the capital conservation buffer currently 1.25% for both CET1 capital and total capital.
No countercyclical buffer is applicable at present, though in the UK this will increase to 0.5% for both CET1 capital and total capital with effect from 27 June 2018.
The groups individual regulated entities complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2017 and 2016.
A full analysis of the composition of regulatory capital and Pillar 1 risk weighted assets RWAs, a reconciliation between equity and CET1 capital after deductions and a table showing the movement in CET1 capital during the year are shown on the following pages.
CET1 capital increased to 990.6 million 31 July 2016: 901.4 million primarily due to growth in profit attributable to shareholders.
The increase in share capital in connection with the acquisition of Novitas has been broadly offset by a deduction for goodwill recognised as part of the transaction.
RWAs, calculated using the standardised approaches, increased to 7,859.0 million 31 July 2016: 6,682.5 million as a result of growth in credit and counterparty risk associated with the loan book and due to European Banking Authority guidance which mandates 150% risk weighting for property development loans.
Notional RWAs for operational risk also increased reflecting increased performance over recent years.
During the year, the group issued 175 million of tier 2 capital.
This changed the composition of capital with 82.8% 31 July 2016: 97.4% of the total capital consisting of CET1 capital.

Contingent liabilities, guarantees and commitments Contingent liabilities Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS A principal subsidiary of the group, CBL, by virtue of being a regulated deposit-taker, contributes to the FSCS which provides compensation to customers of financial institutions in the event that an institution is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of the FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
The facilities are expected to be repaid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit-takers.
In the event of a shortfall, the FSCS will recover the shortfall by raising levies on the industry.
The amount of future levies payable by the group depends on a number of factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS, the groups participation in the deposit-taking market at 31 December, the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members.

The valuation of the schemes liabilities is sensitive to the key assumptions used in the valuation.
The effect of a change in those assumptions in 2017 and 2016 is set out below.
The analysis reflects the variation of the individual assumptions.
The variation in price inflation includes all inflation-linked pension increases in deferment and in payment.

The most significant risks are: Market factors movements in equity and bond markets : The schemes assets are invested 50% in global equities and 49% in bonds with the remaining 1% held in cash and the schemes liabilities are measured with reference to corporate bond yields.
The performance of these asset classes can be volatile.
Underperformance of either of these markets would have an adverse impact on the carrying value of the scheme.
Inflation: Deferred pensions and pensions in payment increase at specified periods in line with inflation, subject to certain caps and floors in place.
Changes in inflation may impact scheme liabilities.
Life expectancy: Change in the life expectancy of the schemes members may impact scheme liabilities.
The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the scheme liabilities is 20 years.

The main differences are as follows: 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 Fair Carrying Fair Carrying value value value value million million million million Subordinated loan capital 242.0 220.7 52.4 46.4 Debt securities in issue 1,522.8 1,489.6 1,432.2 1,422.8 Valuation hierarchy The group holds financial instruments that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities where prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency to provide ongoing pricing information: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in less active markets for identical assets or liabilities or those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Investments classified as Level 1 predominantly comprise sovereign and central bank debt and liquid listed equity shares.
Investments classified as Level 2 predominantly comprise less liquid listed equity shares, investment grade corporate bonds and over-the-counter derivatives.
Financial Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2017 139 At 31 July 2017, investments classified as Level 3 predominantly comprise a legacy investment property fund and contingent consideration payable and receivable in relation to the acquisitions and the disposal of a subsidiary.
The valuation of the legacy investment is determined using its net asset value which is updated quarterly.
The valuation of contingent consideration is determined on a discounted expected cash flow basis.
The group believes that there is no reasonably possible change to the inputs used in the valuation of these positions which would have a material effect on the groups consolidated income statement.
In 2017 and 2016 a number of listed equity shares have been classified as Level 2 classified as Level 1 in 2015 following an assessment of the frequency of transactions in these shares.
Aside from this there were no significant transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 in 2017 and 2016.
The tables below show the classification of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy.

Financial Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2017 141 c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a reduction in earnings and or value, as a result of the failure of a counterparty or associated party with whom the group has contracted to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Credit risk across the group mainly arises through the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
The Banking division applies consistent and prudent lending criteria to mitigate credit risk.
Its lending activities are predominantly secured across a diverse range of asset classes and are generally short-term in nature with low average loan size.
This ensures concentration risk is controlled in both the loan book and associated collateral.
The group has established limits for all counterparties with whom it places deposits, enters into derivative contracts or whose debt securities are held and the credit quality of the counterparties is monitored.
While these amounts may be material, the counterparties are all regulated institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and fall within the large exposure limits set by regulatory requirements.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as Winterflood trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any counterparty risk is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Maximum exposure to credit risk The table below presents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking account of any collateral and credit risk mitigation, arising from its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments.
For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk represents the contractual nominal amounts.
31 July 31 July 2017 2016 million million On balance sheet Cash and balances at central banks 805.1 847.4 Settlement balances 546.7 478.1 Loans and advances to banks 99.8 121.5 Loans and advances to customers 6,884.7 6,431.6 Debt securities 240.1 221.3 Loans to money brokers against stock advanced 48.6 52.4 Derivative financial instruments 27.0 44.7 Other financial assets 69.0 42.3 8,721.0 8,239.3 Off balance sheet Undrawn commitments 1,191.6 962.7 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 9,912.6 9,202.0 Assets pledged and received as collateral The group pledges assets for repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements which are generally conducted under terms that are customary to standard borrowing contracts.
At 31 July 2017, asset finance loan receivables of 525.1 million 31 July 2016: 737.4 million and 10.0 million 31 July 2016: nil UK Treasury Bills, part of the 157.3 million 31 July 2016: 168.1 million asset-backed securities in issue retained for liquidity purposes were positioned with the Bank of England.
These loan receivables, asset-backed securities and UK Treasury Bills were used as collateral within the Bank of Englands Funding for Lending Scheme and Term Funding Scheme, against which 197.5 million of UK Treasury Bills 31 July 2016: 451.0 million and 224.4 million cash 31 July 2016: nil had been drawn at the reporting date.
The term of these transactions is four years from the date of each drawdown but the group may choose to repay earlier at its discretion.
The group also pledged 90.0 million 31 July 2016: 451.0 million UK Treasury Bills in the form of a repurchase agreement from a total of 197.5 million drawn 31 July 2016: 451.0 million.
This was exchanged for cash and included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
The Treasury Bills are not recorded on the groups consolidated balance sheet as ownership remains with the Bank of England.
The risk and rewards of the loans and advances to customers remain with the group and continue to be recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The group has securitised without recourse and restrictions 1,486.3 million 31 July 2016: 1,443.9 million of its insurance premium and motor loan receivables in return for cash and asset-backed securities in issue of 1,046.9 million 31 July 2016: 1,015.9 million.
This includes 157.3 million 31 July 2016: 168.1 million asset-backed securities in issue retained for liquidity purposes.
As the group has retained exposure to substantially all the credit risk and rewards of the residual benefit of the underlying assets it continues to recognise these assets in loans and advances to customers in its consolidated balance sheet.
Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2017 142 The Notes continued 27.
Financial risk management continued Loans to money brokers against stock advanced of 48.6 million 31 July 2016: 52.4 million is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by Winterflood.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short-term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
The majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 27 of the Strategic Report.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria are applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
Financial assets: Loans and advances to customers Credit risk management and monitoring The overall credit risk appetite is set by the group board.
The monitoring of credit policy is the responsibility of the Banking divisions risk and compliance committees.
All large loans are subject to approval by the Banking divisions credit committees.
Retail, Commercial and Property Finance each use credit underwriting and monitoring measures appropriate to the diverse and specialised nature of their lending.
The Banking division has a dual approach to mitigating credit risk by: lending on a secured basis with emphasis on both the customers ability to repay and the quality of the underlying security to minimise any loss should the customer not be able to repay: and where the security collateralising a loan is less tangible, or in cases of higher loan to valuation LTV, greater scrutiny is applied both analytically and in terms of escalation of sanctioning authority.
The Banking divisions collections and recoveries processes are designed to provide a fair, consistent and effective operation for arrears management.
The Banking division seeks to engage in early communication with borrowers experiencing difficulty in meeting their repayments, to obtain their commitment to maintaining or re-establishing a regular payment plan.
Forbearance Forbearance occurs when a customer is experiencing difficulty in meeting their financial commitments and the Banking division grants a concession, by changing the terms of the financial arrangement, which it would not otherwise consider.
This arrangement can be temporary or permanent depending on the customers circumstances.
The Banking division maintains a forbearance policy to ensure the necessary processes are in place to enable consistently fair treatment of each customer and that they are managed based on their individual circumstances.
The arrangements agreed with customers will aim to create a sustainable and affordable financial position.
The Banking division periodically reviews its forbearance policy and approach to ensure it is still effective.
The Banking division offers a range of assistance to support customers which vary depending on the product and the customers status.
Such concessions could involve changing the terms and conditions of a loan, for example by extending its term, amending the type of loan, deferring interest or by capitalising arrears.
The Banking division seeks to ensure that any forbearance results in a fair outcome for the customer and will not repossess an asset unless all other reasonable attempts to resolve the position have failed.
Loans are classified as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession.
Where forbearance has been granted, the customer will remain treated and recorded as forborne until the following exit conditions are met: 1.
W hen all due payments, as per the amended contractual terms, have been made in a timely manner over a continuous repayment period loan is considered as performing : 2.
A minimum two year probation period has passed from the date the forborne exposure was considered as performing: and 3.
N one of the customers exposures with the Banking division are more than 30 days past due at the end of the probation period.
The loan loss provision takes account of the credit risk that arises from forbearance.
At 31 July 2017, the gross carrying amount of exposures with forbearance measures was 120.4 million 31 July 2016: 123.5 million.
Analysis of forborne accounts is shown in the table below.

Credit issues are identified early via largely automated tracking processes.
Remedial actions are implemented promptly to restore customers to a performing status or recovery methods are applied to minimise potential loss.
Commercial Finance is a combination of several niche lending businesses with a diverse mix of loans in terms of assets financed, and average loan size and LTV percentage.
Credit quality is predominately assessed on an individual loan by loan basis.
Recovery activity is executed promptly by experts in the specialised assets.
This approach allows remedial action to be implemented at the appropriate time to minimise potential loss.
Property Finance is a portfolio of higher value, low volume lending with credit quality assessed on an individual loan by loan basis.
Loans are continually monitored to determine whether they are performing satisfactorily.
In Property and Commercial Finance performing loans with elevated levels of credit risk may be placed on watch lists depending on the perceived severity of the credit risk.
Much of the Banking divisions lending is short-term and the average loan size is small with the result that individual loans have little capacity to materially impact the groups earnings.
Credit risk reporting Loans and advances to customers, as disclosed in note 10, are analysed between the following categories for credit risk reporting: i Neither past due nor impaired These loans and advances to customers reflect the application of consistent and conservative lending criteria on inception and the quality and level of security held.
The contractual repayments are monitored to ensure that classification as neither past due nor impaired remains appropriate and also demonstrates the short-term nature of the lending, with 3.8 billion 2016: 3.5 billion having a contractual maturity of less than 12 months.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are neither past due nor impaired.

This includes loans which are individually assessed for impairment but where the value of security is sufficient to meet the required repayments.
This also includes loans to customers which are past due for technical reasons such as delays in payment processing or rescheduling of payment terms.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are past due but for which no impairment provision has been raised.

Financial risk management continued iii Impaired The factors considered in determining whether assets are impaired are outlined in the accounting policies in note 1 i.
Impaired loans and advances to customers are analysed according to whether the impairment provisions are individually or collectively assessed.
Individually assessed provisions are determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the financial condition of the customer and an estimate of potential recovery from the realisation of security.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Property Finance business and by the invoice finance business within Commercial Finance.
Collectively assessed provisions are considered on a portfolio basis, to reflect the homogeneous nature of the assets.
A percentage of the portfolio is impaired by evaluating the ageing of missed payments combined with the historical recovery rates for that particular portfolio.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Retail Finance businesses and the asset finance business within Commercial Finance.
The gross impaired loans are quoted without taking account of any collateral or security held, which could reduce the potential loss.
The application of conservative LTV ratios on inception and the emphasis on the quality of the security provided are reflected in the low provision to gross impaired balance ratio coverage ratio of 39% 2016: 38%.
The following table shows gross impaired loans and advances to customers and the provision thereon split by assessment method.

The group holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of residential and commercial property and charges over business assets such as equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.
Analysis by LTV ratio is provided below based on the groups lending facilities to customers where the exposure at origination exceeded 1.0 million, excluding Property Finance facilities written pre 2009.
Lending below this threshold has greater homogeneity predominately in the motor and premium finance businesses with typical LTV ratio between 80% and 90%.
The value of collateral used in determining the LTV ratio is based upon data captured at loan origination, or where available, a more recent updated valuation.

The credit risk is therefore limited to the change in market price of a security between trade date and settlement date and not the absolute value of the trade.
Winterflood is a market-maker and trades on a principal-only basis with regulated counterparties including stockbrokers, wealth managers, institutions and hedge funds who are either authorised and regulated by the PRA and or FCA or equivalent regulator in the respective country.
Credit risk reporting Settlement balances are classified as neither past due nor impaired when the respective trades have not yet reached their settlement date.
Settlement balances are classified as past due but not impaired when trades fail to be settled on their contractual settlement date.
The credit risk presented by settlement balances which are past due is mitigated by the delivery versus payment mechanism, as well as by Winterflood trading only with regulated counterparties.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place as part of an overall risk management framework and settlement balances past due are actively managed.
The following table shows the ageing of settlement balances: 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 Neither past Past due Neither past Past due due nor but not due nor but not impaired impaired Total impaired impaired Total million million million million million million Within one month 523.7 20.0 543.7 449.9 25.8 475.7 Between one and three months 1.8 1.8 1.0 1.0 Between three months and one year 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 Over one year 0.6 0.6 0.8 0.8 523.7 23.0 546.7 449.9 28.2 478.1 d Market risk Market risk is the risk that a change in the value of an underlying market variable, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, will give rise to an adverse movement in the value of the groups assets and arises primarily in the Securities division.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate risk arises in the Banking division and the remainder of this section relates to the Banking division accordingly.
Interest rate risk in the groups other divisions is considered to be immaterial.
The group has a simple and transparent balance sheet and a low appetite for interest rate risk which is limited to that required to operate efficiently.
The groups policy is to match repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities naturally where possible or by using interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 13.
The Asset and Liability Committee ALCO monitors the interest rate risk exposure across the balance sheet.
There are three main sources of interest rate risk recognised, which could adversely impact future income or the value of the balance sheet: repricing risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times: embedded optionality risk occurs as a result of special conditions attached to contract terms embedded in some loans: and basis risk occurs where there is a mismatch in the interest rate reference rate for assets and liabilities.
We have amended our methodology for the sensitivity analysis calculations to interest rate risk exposure in line with industry practice and standards.
This corresponds with the way the ALCO monitors this exposure.
The results below therefore differ to those reported in 2016.

These balances are predominantly in euros.
Foreign exchange differences which arise from the translation of these operations are recognised directly in equity.
A change in the euro exchange rate would decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2017 2016 million million 20% strengthening of sterling against the euro 3.4 2.6 The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of treasury operations in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, using exchange rate derivative contracts where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 13.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.
Market price risks Trading financial instruments: Equity shares and debt securities The groups trading activities relate to Winterflood.
The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk.

The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 1.6 million decrease 2016: 1.3 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 0.5 million decrease 2016: 1.5 million decrease on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly marketmaking where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly, the sensitivity referred to above is purely hypothetical.
Non-trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments are disclosed in notes 11 and 12. e Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that liabilities cannot be met when they fall due or can only be met at an uneconomic price and arises mainly in the Banking division.
The group has a prudent liquidity position with total available funding at 31 July 2017 of 8.8 billion 31 July 2016: 8.2 billion.
This funding is significantly in excess of its loans and advances to customers at 31 July 2017 of 6.9 billion 31 July 2016: 6.4 billion.
The group has a large portfolio of high quality liquid assets principally including cash placed on deposit with the Bank of England.

Interest in unconsolidated structured entities Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from the management of assets on behalf of its clients as part of its Asset Management division.
These structured entities consist of unitised vehicles such as Authorised Unit Trusts AUTs and Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicles net asset value.
The structured entities are financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors.
The group does not hold direct investments in its structured entities.
As fund manager, the group does not guarantee returns on its funds or commit to financially support its funds.
The business activity of all structured entities is the management of assets in order to maximise investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and or investment income.
The group earns a management fee from its structured entities, based on a percentage of the entitys net asset value.
The main risk the group faces from its interest in assets under management on behalf of external investors is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal of funds by clients.
Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment, asset performance and investor considerations.
The assets under management of unconsolidated structured entities managed by the group were 3,830 million as at 31 July 2017 31 July 2016: 3,273 million.
Included in revenue on the consolidated income statement is management fee income of 22.8 million 2016: 20.8 million from unconsolidated structured entities managed by the group.
