0% vesting Methodology UBMs Events business has a number of biennial shows, with odd-year biennials significantly larger and more profitable than even-year biennials.
The profit contribution from the odd-year biennials leads to an annual distortion in the reported growth rate and profitability of the Events business and an increase in EPS in odd years To give a fairer reflection of underlying performance, a two-year average of Group adjusted diluted EPS of odd and even years will be applied, with the two-year average prior to the performance period used as the base year, and the two-year average at the end of the performance period used to determine growth For PSP awards made in 2017 with a three-year performance period of 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019 the two-year average for the base year is based on EPS for 2015 and 2016 and the two-year average at the end will be based on EPS for 2018 and 2019 Return on average capital employed Performance metrics The target is the weighted average of the following: 1.
Existing capital Returns on existing capital i. e. ROACE at the start of the performance period must maintain or exceed current levels by the end of the three-year period.
Target is to maintain ROACE at 13.1% with a stretch to 13.9%, with straight-line vesting in between.
As outlined on page 80 the targets include the stretch hurdle of ROACE threshold plus 0.8% maximum 2.

For achievement of 95% of the TGR in the three year plan threshold, 100% of the plan target and 102% of the plan maximum, then 25%, 80% and 100% of the award will vest with straight-line vesting in between When assessing the level of vesting under the PSP, the Committee will consider the underlying financial performance of the Company and the value generated for shareholders and may adjust the level of vesting if it considers that the outcome based on the assessment of performance against targets does not reflect this.
In particular, when assessing performance for the revenue portion of the award the Committee will consider the quality of revenue growth delivered, adjusted for acquisitions and disposals, including margin achieved and the impact on profitability to ensure any revenue growth rewarded via the PSP represents value improvement for shareholders.
