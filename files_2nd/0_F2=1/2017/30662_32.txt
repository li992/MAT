In the case of the liquidation portfolio, the effect and timing of the disposal strategy is included in the estimate of future cash ows.
The reduction in individual impairment provisions is predominantly due to write offs from the liquidation portfolio.
The portfolio impairment provisions reduced primarily due to an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality and receipt of expected repayments in certain stress portfolios.
Amounts written off are signi cantly lower although this is due to 2016 seeing elevated levels in the liquidation portfolio and ongoing business, mainly in India.
