14 SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Alternative performance measures The Directors use alternative measures for performance analysis as these measures provide additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.
These measures are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies performance measures.
They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures.
Revenue growth As the Group operates in over 30 countries, it is exposed to translation risk on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which impact the Groups reported revenue and operating profit.
The Group presents its financial results on a constant currency basis to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange rates and to evaluate the underlying performance.
The table below reconciles reported revenue to constant currency sales growth, like-for-like sales growth and net contract gains losses.
