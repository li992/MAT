Revenues in the division were impacted by the slowdown in UK spending, with delays to a number of crypto programmes, and by the increase in a number of contracts in the development phase at Herley in the US.
Forensic Technology, based in Canada, increased revenues as a result of bullet identication product sales to customers in South East Asia: and TCS, Ultras Montreal-based military radio business, continued to grow in 2017.
The Communications & Security division currently has a greater proportion of contracts in the early development phase.
Consequently, underlying operating margins reduced to 11.6% compared to 15.3% in 2016.
These include the US Navy Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Programme and an Electronic Warfare contract for the F-15 aircraft platform, which together required investment in excess of 6m in 2017, some of which was unexpected due to the additional SEWIP module wins.
The customer-requested pause in a UK Crypto contract also reduced profits in 2017.
2018 margins are expected to be higher than achieved this year.
The divisions order book continued to increase, ending the year at 258.7m.
Features of activities in the period that will underpin the divisions future performance include: The securing of a 16.6m programme to support the provision of advanced surveillance capability until 2019 A $16.2m contract awarded by the US Department of the Navy to design, develop, integrate and install a variety of cyber-secure systems for critical infrastructure control and monitoring The award of an $18m multi-layered surveillance and security system for the oil and gas industry.
