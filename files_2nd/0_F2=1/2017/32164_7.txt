Key performance indicators Focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses First Student and First Transit contract retention We measure contract retention as a percentage by revenues of all the contracts subject to bid in the % year rather than as a percentage of the contract portfolio as a whole.
In First Student and First Transit we typically expect retention of around 90%.
In First Student, our contract retention rate during the summer 2016 bid season was 80%, in line with our budget this year given our ongoing focus on improving contract returns, which yielded an average price increase of 7.3%.
In First Transit, our contract retention rate was 82% during the year: whilst somewhat lower than our 80% 82% normal target range, this included the loss of two relatively large existing contracts which had become loss-making and on which we had bid significant price increases.
Driving growth through attractive commercial propositions  Like-for-like revenue adjusts for changes in the Greyhound, First Bus and First Rail change in likeforlikerevenue composition of the divisional portfolio, holiday % change year-on-year timing, severe weather and other factors that distort the year-on-year trends in our passenger 10.0 revenue businesses.
Greyhound 7.5 First Bus Greyhound like-for-like revenue decreased by 1.7% First Rail reflecting a decrease of 3.9% in the first half and an 5.0 increase of 0.8% in the second.
Passenger demand 2.5 throughout the intercity coach industry is adversely affected by the increased competitiveness of both 0.0 passenger cars and low-cost airlines when fuel -2.5 prices reduce year-on-year, as experienced in the first half of our 2017 financial year.
Market conditions for the industry remain challenged by muted high street footfall, worsening congestion in several localities, and some evidence of lower fuel prices encouraging car use, as well as general macroeconomic uncertainty in the UK.
First Rail like-for-like passenger revenue increased by 1.3%, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown and exacerbated by the magnitude of the infrastructure upgrades on the Great Western network.
Group revenue has declined in recent years Group revenue principally due to our contract pricing strategy m in First Student and the loss of rail franchises.
In the year, Group revenue increased by 8.3% due 2017 5,653.3 to translation of our US dollar-based businesses 2016 5,218.1 into sterling at higher rates than the prior year.
2015 6,050.7 In constant currency, Group revenue decreased by 0.5% with growth in First Transit offset by 2014 6,717.4 reduced subsidy receipts and the remapping of 2013 6,900.9 certain routes out of the scope of First Rails new TPE franchise, together with lower revenues in Greyhound and First Bus, while First Student revenue was flat.

The ability we now have to analyse performance data down to the route and driver has resulted in a significant 2017 81 2017 91.1 improvement in on-time performance as measured 2016 91.4 regularly within the year.
2015 91.8 Our First Bus punctuality measure percentage 2014 93.0 of services no more than one minute early or five 2013 92.2 minutes late continues to be affected by roadworks and the resulting congestion in a number of the areas 1 Implemented GPS tracking in 2017: earlier data not comparable due to this change in methodology.
We continue to work with local authorities to resolve or mitigate these issues.
Our First Rail PPM scores of punctuality and reliability First Rail Public Performance Measure PPM saw the benefit of a more robust timetable at TPE, % moving annual average while GWRs score was principally affected by the substantial infrastructure upgrades being undertaken 95 on the network during the year.
Both scores ended Great Western Railway the year above the industry average although we TransPennine Express continue to focus on improving this further.

These were offset by reductions in First Transit, per 1,000 employees per year per million miles Greyhound and First Bus.
This remains an area of ongoing focus for our teams as we seek to identify and eliminate unsafe behaviours.
2017 8.35 2017 4.09 2016 8.16 2016 4.18 Passenger injuries per million miles have reduced by 2% compared to last year and this reduction is 2015 8.31 2015 4.29 mirrored in the majority of the divisions, excluding 2014 8.28 2014 4.09 First Student and First Rail.
There are proactive 2013 8.94 2013 3.90 ongoing initiatives within each of the divisions, implementing preventative measures to reduce injuries on or around our vehicles, trains and stations.
This safety focus remains at the forefront of all our businesses operational strategies.

Both First Student and First Transit scored the highest ratings for five years.
This improved significantly in 2017, correlating strongly with our improving on-time performance.
We would expect NPS to improve again in 2018, albeit by a lesser amount, as further customer service improvements take effect.
2017 22% 2017 84 In First Bus, overall satisfaction in the independent 2016 84 Transport Focus National Bus Passenger Survey 2015 86 remains high with many local businesses recording 2014 86 improved results.
However congestion in some 2013 81 areas such as the West of England and West Yorkshire continues to impact on punctuality, holding back progress on our customer satisfaction 1 Moved to NPS methodology in late 2016: earlier data not comparable due to this change.
We anticipate our roll out of additional customer benefits such as contactless payments, new vehicles and continued focus on more punctual and reliable services will have an impact on these First Rail metrics in the future.
