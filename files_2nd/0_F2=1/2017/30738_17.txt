88 IMI plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Finance Directors Introduction Introduction from Daniel Shook Dear Shareholder Welcome to the financial statements section of our Annual Report.
My financial review commentary is set out in this section alongside the primary statements.
These financial statements are presented with the primary statements first, followed by five sections: Basis of preparation, Results for the year, Operating assets and liabilities, Capital structure and financing costs and Other notes.
IMI continues to improve its overall control environment and risk management procedures.
The Company has further mitigated the risks associated with the defined benefit pension schemes during the year and has proactively managed working capital as the Group has grown during 2017.
Although market conditions remain mixed, IMI continues to invest in the foundations of the business which will deliver long-term benefits.
