Our impact is largely due to energy used at offices and data centres, and from employee travel.
We measure energy use through carbon dioxide emissions, which were committed to steadily reducing.
We have a 2018 target to reduce our CO e emissions per US$1,000 of revenue by 5% when compared with 2016.
This year 2 we reduced our total carbon footprint by 1% to 54,200 tonnes of CO e, which was predominantly due to energy savings initiatives in data 2 centres and consolidation of offices.
