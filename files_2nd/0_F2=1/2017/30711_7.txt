GROUP REVIEW Introduction NORTH AMERICAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS Huntings performance in 2017 has been defined by the strong recovery in US onshore drilling and completion activity, which FORECAST TO CONTINUE GROWING, WITH has benefited a number of our business units, leading to higher THE FOCUS REMAINING ON ONSHORE revenues compared to 2016 and enabling the Group to return ACTIVITY.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT HAS BEEN to underlying profitability in the year.
FORECAST FOR THE REGION TO INCREASE Market Summary BY C. 20% IN THE YEAR AHEAD.
The average price of WTI crude oil in the year was $50.9 per barrel, indicating that for the majority of 2017, the oil and gas industry has been underpinned by a relatively low price for crude oil from which operators have made investment decisions.
The result of this pricing environment has been that offshore projects have continued to be placed on hold, while the US onshore market, where drilling economics have improved during the downturn, has shown more resilience and, in the second half of the year, returned to strong growth.
This macro picture is supported by global industry investment trends, which show total capital expenditures increasing 27% in the year to $197.7bn of which onshore drilling expenditures increased by 60% to $146.5bn.
Offshore drilling expenditures declined by 20% to $51.2bn.
The US onshore market comprised 73% of the total onshore expenditure at $106.5bn, which has underpinned Huntings financial performance in the year.
Operational Initiatives A key strategic goal during the recent market downturn has been to retain the Groups core global manufacturing capability to enable Hunting to be well positioned for the next phase of growth in the global energy industry.
Management has achieved this goal, with the Group reporting a relatively unchanged manufacturing footprint, the retention of key personnel and a highly skilled workforce that is focused on leading product quality assurance, strong health and safety policies and the training of staff.
Hunting started the year with 40 manufacturing facilities and 25 distribution centres with a total facilities footprint of 3.1m square feet.
PETER ROSE JIM JOHNSON FINANCE DIRECTOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE In 2017 a review of this capacity was undertaken, in light of forecast activity levels and future market growth opportunities.
In view of market conditions in Africa, in December 2017 the decision was made to close our manufacturing facility in Cape Town, South Africa, due to the medium-term outlook of the region.
The Group has decided to retain a presence in the country by opening a sales office to continue to attract business from operators in sub-Sahara Africa.
