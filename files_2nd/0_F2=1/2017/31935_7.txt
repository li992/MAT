| Genus plc Annual Report 2017 21 Strategy in Action continued SHARING IN THE VALUE DELIVERED CASE STUDY During this financial year, IVBs new laboratory in Torren, Mexico, began serving large dairy enterprise customers.
Torren is home to Mexicos largest dairy farms, and the area with the biggest concentration of dairy cows in Latin America.
On-farm IVF services and ready-toimplant embryos are typically priced at a significant premium to semen.
This is because an embryo allows for the selection of superior female as well as male parent donors to create genetically superior offspring with desirable characteristics for farmers.
With the commercial launch of the IVB lab in Mexico, the IVB and ABS teams visited numerous farms and dairies, and were able to demonstrate the genetic improvement benefits, and ultimately, the economic returns, of investing in IVF technology.
As a result, IVB secured over 15 new accounts by the end of the financial year, including two large accounts.
In light of this success, IVB Mexico has taken on new staff to meet the growing demand for its services.
