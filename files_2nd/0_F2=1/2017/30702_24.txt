Based on the nature of our emissions and the consistency month on month, we believe this is an appropriate representation of the annual emissions.
In order to compile the reportable emissions data from our offices, electricity and gas meter readings have been obtained from our energy suppliers.
For some of our smaller offices we are not charged for energy usage separately as these costs are incorporated into the service fees for our premises.
These emissions have not been included in the reported total above, due to the data being unavailable, and relate to offices for the use of 23 employees 2016: 16 employees.
