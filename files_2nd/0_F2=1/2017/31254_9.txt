The Group splits its core opportunity evaluation, investment and business building team into two specialist divisions, Life Sciences and Technology.
This is a departure from previous years when the management of the portfolio was split between Healthcare, Biotech, Technology and Cleantech and the change has been made as part of the acquisition of Touchstone Innovations plc.
The sectors formerly known as Healthcare and Biotech now constitute the Life Sciences sector while those formerly known as Technology and Cleantech now constitute the Technology sector.
Where the Group invests in businesses that cannot be classified within these divisions, primarily those portfolio companies which also invest in other opportunities, they are recorded in a separate sector as shown below.
Together these three sectors make up the Groups university partnership business segment.
