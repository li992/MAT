CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143 Risk report Credit risk Mitigation and management of credit risk Credit quality of loans and advances For SME lending, the Group has an internally developed credit rating system, as defined under the Groups credit risk management policy, which uses data drawn from a number of sources to assess the potential risk in lending to the Groups customers.
This system assigns an indication of the PD for each customer and can be broadly mapped to external agencies rating scales.
Impaired assets consist of SME lending and secured Retail lending where current circumstances indicate that losses of loan principal and or interest may be incurred.

The credit quality of the portfolio of loans and advances that were neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to the Groups standard credit rating system.
The credit rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics, combined with processed market information to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Groups ratings policy.
The table below represents the credit quality of SME loans and advances that are neither past due nor impaired: 2017 2016 Audited m m Senior investment grade 946 1,077 Investment grade 1,807 1,557 Sub-investment grade 3,873 3,533 6,626 6,167 Credit quality of loans held at fair value through profit and loss that are neither past due nor impaired: 2017 2016 Audited m m Senior investment grade 3 6 Investment grade 231 259 Sub-investment grade 237 466 471 731 For Retail lending, the Group has developed specific credit rating systems for both origination of new lending and for ongoing customer and account management purposes.
These systems assign risk estimates to all Retail lending and enable active management of customer exposures and portfolios.
144 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Collateral Collateral held as security and other credit enhancements The Group evaluates each customers creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Group upon extension of credit, is based on managements credit evaluation of the counterparty.
Collateral held can vary, but may include: specific charges over defined assets of the counterparty: a floating charge over all assets and undertakings of an entity, including uncalled capital and called but unpaid capital: specific or interlocking guarantees: and loan agreements which include affirmative and negative covenants and in some instances guarantees of counterparty obligations.
Generally, the Group does not take possession of collateral it holds as security or call on other credit enhancements that would result in recognition of an asset on its balance sheet.
It is the Groups policy to dispose of repossessed properties with the proceeds used to reduce or repay the outstanding balance.
In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed properties for its own business use.
The LTV ratio of Retail mortgage lending, coupled with the relationship of the debt to customers income, is key to the credit quality of these loans.
The table below sets out the indexed LTV analysis of the Groups Retail mortgage stock.
2017 2016 1 LTV audited % % Less than 50% 33 34 50% to 75% 49 50 76% to 80% 7 6 81% to 85% 4 4 86% to 90% 4 2 91% to 95% 1 1 96% to 100% Greater than 100% Unknown 2 3 100 100 1 LTV of the mortgage portfolio is defined as mortgage portfolio weighted by balance and indexed using the MIAC Acadametrics indices at a given date.

Prior period comparatives have been restated on the new basis of indexation, previous basis adopted the Halifax House Price Index.
Residential mortgages Residential property is the Groups main source of collateral and means of mitigating loss in the event of the default credit risk inherent in its residential mortgage portfolios.
All lending activities are supported by an appropriate form of valuation using either professional or indexed subject to policy rules and confidence levels valuations.
Commercial property Commercial property is the Groups main source of collateral on SME lending and means of mitigating loss in the event of default.
Collateral for the majority of commercial loans comprises first legal charges over freehold or long leasehold property including formal Companies House registration where appropriate.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 145 Risk report Credit risk Non-property related collateral In addition to residential and commercial property based security, the Group also takes other forms of collateral when lending.
This can involve obtaining security against the underlying loan through the use of cash collateral and or netting agreements, both of which reduce the original exposure by the amount of collateral held, subject to volatility and maturity adjustments where applicable.
The Group also operates a policy of obtaining security against the underlying loan via the use of guarantees, which can be either limited or unlimited, making the guarantor liable for only a portion or all of the debt.
The following table shows the total non-property collateral held by sector at 30 September in terms of cash, guarantees these guarantors are predominantly other financial institutions who are considered to be of a high credit quality and netting.
The exposure amount shown below is the total gross exposure before any credit risk mitigation and credit conversion factors have been applied where applicable for arrangements which have some form of associated collateral held against it and is not the total exposure for each asset class, as disclosed elsewhere in this section.

The increase in cash collateral held and corresponding exposure in financial institutions is due to an increase in the reimbursement receivable from NAB in relation to the conduct indemnity deed described further in note 3.14.
Corporates is the largest sector utilising other risk mitigation techniques, with all three methods utilised dependent on credit quality.
The extent to which these will be used is dependent on the specific circumstances of the customer.
146 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Forbearance Forbearance is considered to take place when the Group grants concessions to assist customers who are experiencing, or who are about to experience, difficulties in meeting their financial commitments to the Group.
The Groups forbearance policies and definitions comply with the guidance established by the European Banking Authority for financial reporting.
Forbearance concessions include the granting of more favourable terms and conditions than those provided either at drawdown of the facility or which would not ordinarily be available to other customers with a similar risk profile.
Forbearance parameters are regularly reviewed and refined as necessary to ensure they are consistent with the latest industry guidance and prevailing practice, as well as ensuring that they adequately capture and reflect the most recent customer behaviours and market conditions.
The Group makes every effort to treat customers fairly and aligns its forbearance practices to that principle.
While forbearance alone is not necessarily an indicator of impaired status, it is a trigger for the review of the customers credit profile and forbearance is only granted when there is a realistic prospect of the customer repaying all facilities in full.
If there is any concern over future cash flows and the Group incurring a loss, then forborne loans will also be classified as impaired in accordance with the Groups impairment policy.
Exposures classified as forborne and performing at the date forbearance measures are granted, continue to be reported as subject to forbearance for a minimum period of two years from that date the probation period.
Exposures classified as forborne and which are non-performing when customers were granted forbearance cannot exit non-performing status for a minimum of 12 months from the date forbearance was granted, and cannot exit forbearance status for a further two years from the date of returning to performing status three years in total.
The Group has identified a number of situations that in isolation are not considered to be forbearance: facilities that have been temporarily extended pending review and where no concession has been granted for reasons relating to the actual or apparent financial stress of a customer: a reduction in asset quality to a level where actual, or apparent, financial stress is not evident: where changes are made to the terms of a borrowers interest structure or repayment arrangement on a commercial basis: and late provision of financial information, in the absence of other indicators of financial difficulty, is not in all cases considered a noncommercial breach of non-financial covenants.
For both Retail and SME, where the Group has made a demand for repayment, the customers facilities have been withdrawn or where a debt repayment process has been initiated, the exposure is classified as forborne if the debt is subject to any of the mentioned forbearance concessions.
Retail forbearance The Group utilises various forbearance measures for retail customers, specific to the individual customer and their circumstances.
Customers may potentially be subject to more than one forbearance strategy at any one time where this is considered to be the most appropriate course of action.
Debt management for mortgage customers in financial difficulty To support customers who are encountering financial difficulties, cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being affordable and sustainable for the customer.
Operationally, the provision and review of such assistance is controlled by various methods.
These include the application of an appropriate policy framework, controls around the execution of policy, regular review of the different treatments to confirm that they remain appropriate, monitoring of customers performance including the level of payments received, and management visibility of the nature and extent of assistance provided and the associated risk.
Help is provided through the Financial Care Team where tailored repayment programmes can be agreed.
Customers are actively supported and referred to free money advice agencies when they have multiple credit facilities, including those at other lenders, that require restructuring.
One component of the Groups approach is to contact customers showing signs of financial difficulty to discuss their circumstances and offer solutions to prevent their accounts falling into arrears.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 147 Risk report Credit risk The tables below summarise the level of forbearance in respect of the Groups mortgage portfolio at 30 September: Impairment allowance on Retail loans and advances Total Retail loans and advances subject to subject to forbearance forbearance measures measures Number of Gross carrying % of total Impairment Coverage As at 30 September 2017 audited loans amount m portfolio allowance m % Formal arrangements 1,614 164 0.69 3.9 2.43 Temporary arrangements 1,418 174 0.74 3.0 1.72 Interest-only conversion 202 30 0.13 0.2 0.56 Term extension 149 12 0.05 0.1 0.51 Other 29 2 0.01 0.61 Legal 167 16 0.07 0.9 5.66 3,579 398 1.69 8.1 2.04 Impairment allowance on Retail Total Retail loans and advances subject to loans and advances subject to forbearance measures forbearance measures Number of Gross carrying % of total Impairment Coverage As at 30 September 2016 audited loans amount m portfolio allowance m % Formal arrangements 1,843 169 0.78 5.5 3.27 Temporary arrangements 1,460 160 0.73 2.7 1.68 Interest-only conversion 154 22 0.10 0.1 0.26 Term extension 123 11 0.05 0.1 0.61 Other 22 2 0.01 0.84 Legal 195 20 0.09 1.1 5.60 3,797 384 1.76 9.5 2.48 The Group also has a number of customers with interest-only mortgages past maturity, not subject to forbearance.
The Group has formal processes embedded to proactively track and facilitate prematurity customer engagement to bring the cases to a formal conclusion, which is generally aimed to be achieved within six months after the loan has reached maturity.
Complex cases can take longer than this to reach conclusion.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had 97 2016: 102 customers with interest-only mortgages not subject to forbearance and which were post six-month maturity with a total value of 14m 2016: 12m.
A further forbearance reserve of 4m 2016: 4m is presently held within the overall collective provision.
The effect of this on the above tables would be to increase the impairment allowance noted above to 12.1m 2016: 13.5m and to increase overall coverage to 3.05% 2016: 3.52%.
When all other avenues of resolution including forbearance have been explored, the Group will take steps to repossess and sell underlying collateral.
In the year to 30 September 2017, there were 50 repossessions of which 13 were voluntary 2016: 78 including 27 voluntary.
Retail forbearance unsecured consumer credit The Group currently exercises limited forbearance strategies in relation to other types of consumer credit, including current accounts, unsecured loans and credit cards.
The Group has assessed the total loan balances subject to forbearance on other types of consumer credit to be 11m at 30 September 2017 2016: 14m, representing 1.02% of the unsecured Retail portfolio 2016: 1.33%.
Impairment provisions on forborne balances totalled 3.1m at 30 September 2017 2016: 4.2m, providing overall coverage of 27.18% 2016: 29.02%.
148 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information SME forbearance Forbearance is considered to exist for SME customers where one or more concessions are granted on a non-commercial basis.
The Group reports SME forbearance at a customer level and at a value which incorporates all facilities and the related impairment allowance, irrespective of whether each individual facility is subject to forbearance.
Authority to grant forbearance measures for SME customers is held by the Groups Strategic Business Services unit and is exercised, where appropriate, on the basis of detailed consideration of the customers financial position and prospects.
Where a customer is part of a larger group, forbearance is exercised and reported across the Group at the individual entity level.
Where modification of the terms and conditions of an exposure meeting the criteria for classification as forbearance results in derecognition of loans and advances from the balance sheet and the recognition of a new exposure, the new exposure shall be treated as forborne.
The tables below summarise the total number of arrangements in place and the loan balances and impairment provisions associated with those arrangements.

Credit risk categorisation Description Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are not in arrears and where there is no objective evidence of impairment.
Past due but not impaired Loans that are in arrears but have not been individually assessed as impaired.
Impaired Loans which have been individually assessed for impairment as there is objective evidence of impairment, including changes in customer circumstances.
Loans and advances which were past due but not impaired Loans and advances that are past due but not impaired are classified as such for secured lending, where the net current market value of supporting security is sufficient to cover all principal, interest and other amounts including legal, enforcement, realisation costs etc.
Unsecured retail lending and credit cards are written off when they reach 180 DPD and are not designated as impaired, in compliance with the EU Payment Accounts Directive.

Other credit risks The Group is exposed to credit risk on its other banking activities, which are subject to mitigation and monitoring.
No provisions are currently held for these exposures.
The table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet excluding loans and advances to customers and other financial assets at fair value.
The maximum exposure is shown gross, before the effect of mitigation through use of master netting and collateral agreements.
The table also shows the maximum amount of commitments from its banking operations.

Available for sale financial assets and the credit rating of counterparties are discussed in note 3.2.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The Group does not have any financial assets or financial liabilities that are offset with the net amount presented on the balance sheet.
This is because IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation states that there should be both an enforceable right to set off and the intention either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Neither of these conditions are met by the Group.
The table below illustrates the amounts for financial instruments that are covered by enforceable netting arrangements i. e. offsetting agreements and any related financial collateral.
The table excludes financial instruments not subject to offset and that are only subject to collateral arrangements e. g. loans and advances.
152 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information The net amounts presented in the table are not intended to represent the Groups exposure to credit risk, as the Group will use a wide range of strategies to mitigate credit risk in addition to netting and collateral.

2 Derivative financial instruments comprise both trading and hedging derivative assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instrument contracts are typically subject to ISDA master netting agreements, as well as CSAs, where relevant, around collateral arrangements attached to those ISDA agreements, or derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements if contracts are settled via an exchange or clearing house.
The amounts included in the Financial instruments column refer to amounts that are subject to relevant close out netting arrangements under a relevant ISDA agreement.
