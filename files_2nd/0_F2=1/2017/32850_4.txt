JLIF aims to reduce shareholder risk by offering the opportunity to invest in a well-diversied portfolio, with regard to the number of investments, the mix of public-sector counterparties both by jurisdiction and sector and currency exposure, and to provide a degree of ination protection via ination-linked returns.
In doing so, JLIFs aim is to be the preferred private-sector partner of choice for public-sector clients of predominantly operational infrastructure PPP projects within the markets in which it operates, making available for use high-quality infrastructure assets that meet or exceed the expectations of its clients.
To this end, JLIF aims to develop strong working relationships with its public-sector partners, based on a spirit of collaboration.

up to 30% of the Portfolio in assets still in their construction phase: up to 15% of the Portfolio in projects that are classied as having a demand-based payment mechanism: and up to 10% of the Portfolio in projects that are not strictly PPP projects, but exhibit a substantially similar risk prole and characteristics: Further details of the Investment Policy are found on pages 24 to 25 of this Annual Report.
JLIF also aims to manage its investments such that they deliver at least the returns expected at the time of acquisition, and to be at the forefront of disclosure and transparency amongst its peer group such that its shareholders remain updated and can understand the performance of the business, the risks facing it and its prospects going forward.
