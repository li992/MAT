Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2017 Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2017 58 59 Development andrefurbishment continued Case study: Brunel Building, Paddington, W2 Derwent London acquired a 95-year leasehold interest in an old warehouse block on Paddington Basin for c. 325 per sq ft in 2001.
We retained income from the building prior to redevelopment while we worked on a new design with architects Fletcher Priest, and looked to extend our ownership.
Planning was received for a mixed-use development in 2008, and in 2013 we secured an option to regear the leasehold interest thereby unlocking the site for a landmark 243,000 sq ft office building on a 999-year lease.
The construction contract price is fixed and the project is on target to complete in H1 2019 with 70m of capital expenditure outstanding.

Brunel Building is an eye-catching new addition in Paddington: The Times its striking design, waterfront location and generous floor-toceiling heights mean we are expecting to achieve prime rents for the area, especially for the upper floors which benefit from two terraces and impressive views across central London.
Paddington has witnessed a change in tenant types in recent years and the area has been undergoing a transformation in its public amenities.
Brunel Building will play its part in opening up the canalside to the public for the first time for at least 45 years.
Although Paddington is already well-connected, the arrival of the Elizabeth line later this year will make central London even more Right: Brunel Building W2 accessible with journey times to Tottenham Court Road of just four minutes.
All this activity, together with its relative value, means that Paddington has become attractive to a much broader mix of businesses.
Brunel Building will be the next Grade A development to be released in the area.
There has been good interest in the building from a number of occupiers with a range of space requirements, which supports our aim of achieving a number of lettings prior to completion.
In December 2017 the average ERV on the office space was 62.50 per sq ft. Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2017 Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2017
