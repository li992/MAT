Conditions in EROs market remain challenging and, while organic revenue was down for the year, we have improved our market share on the majority of programmes.
EROs operating performance in the first half was stable against the second half of 2016 but much improved on the first half of 2016.
Operating performance in the second half delivered significant improvement in line with expectations resulting from market share gains PT6, TFE, PW300 and Tay and cost efficiencies from the footprint rationalisation programme.
Volumes in legacy mid-cabin and rotorcraft engine overhauls remained depressed throughout the year, with reduced workscopes and competitive market pricing.
In the first half of the year ERO saw improvements in demand for overhauls in certain Pratt & Whitney and Tay markets, as well as market share gains for certain Pratt & Whitney engines.
However, while our market share has improved on the majority of programmes, we continue to see lower engine inputs, primarily on JT15D, PW500 and PW100.
Time between engine overhauls continues to extend and the increase of power by the hour contracts either through the OEMs or third parties increases the competitive tension.
EROs footprint rationalisation programme is nearly complete and it will undergo its final facility consolidation in 2018.
The new overhaul facility at Dallas Fort Worth Centre DFW is successfully delivering the overhaul operations formerly undertaken at the Neosho and Forest Park facilities.
The sale of the Forest Park site for $17.4m completed at the end of 2017.
Looking forward the combination of an efficient, lower cost, flexible engine overhaul and test facility in DFW and a renewed focus on customer service will drive further improvement in financial performance and allow us to execute our strategy for value creation from our ERO business.
We have recently made the decision to close our engine overhaul operations in Abu Dhabi given insufficient market demand to support our facility on current engine authorisations.
We expect the facility to complete its final engine overhaul in April.
As part of BBA Aviations focus on driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, we are currently conducting a strategic review of our ERO business, although there is no certainty that this will result in a transaction being agreed.
