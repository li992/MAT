Revenue in our Broadband Global Area Network BGAN product declined by 8.0% to $27.8m in the year.
Satellite phone terminal sales and airtime revenues were also down, falling 10.0% to $30.8m.
Whilst both product lines benefited from the short term impact of hurricane-related activity during Q3, they continue to be negatively impacted by an increasingly competitive market environment, particularly from land-based Ka-band and Ku-band and cellular alternatives.
Fixed-to-mobile revenues decreased by 29.1%, $16.6m, during the year, reflecting a continued decline of satellite-based voice products, partly driven by an ongoing migration to Voice over IP.
M2M revenue increased by 9.5% to $18.3m during the year, with the number of connected M2M terminals increasing to over 358,000 by the end of the year, highlighting continued strong Disaster relief communications demand for M2M in commercial applications.
When natural disasters strike, the frequent loss of terrestrial networks hampers Direct costs increased by $4.6m, 24.5%, attempts to get help to victims fast.
Establishing reliable communications is essential in 2017, as a result of a change in revenue mix, to coordinating relief efforts and keeping emergency responders safe in dangerous, whilst indirect costs reduced by $2.6m, sometimes hostile environments.
As a result of the increase Team Rubicon unites the skills and experience of military veterans with first responders, in direct costs, EBITDA was down by $14.0m, rapidly deploying teams to communities across the globe affected by disasters.
Consequently, EBITDA margin has transformed the organisations ability to channel their resources and maximise their declined to 69.3% in 2017. impact by providing a whole raft of satcom services IsatPhone 2 satellite phones and IsatData Pro to keep in touch with and track teams on the ground: BGAN and Global Xpress to transmit situational reports and video.
When the 2017 hurricane season opened with three catastrophic storms in quick succession, and Mexico City suffered a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, Team Rubicon ran up to 15 simultaneous operations without a single lost connection.
