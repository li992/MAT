Directors interests in shares of the Company Share ownership guidelines The Taylor Wimpey share ownership guidelines are designed to encourage shareholding in Taylor Wimpey plc by executives at various levels within the Company for the purpose of alignment with the Companys shareholders which the Committee strongly believes is very important.
The guidelines cover the Executive Directors and those executives who participate in long term incentive plans with all participating executives required to build up shareholdings through the retention of shares vesting under the Companys share plans.
The level of required shareholding for Executive Directors to attain is two times base salary.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve a holding equivalent to one times base salary within five years of their appointment and although there will be no set time limit for achieving a two times salary holding, each Executive Director is required to agree a personal plan with the Chairman on the target to be achieved within an agreed time frame.
Executive Directors are also required to retain at least 50% of their net of taxes gain arising from any shares vesting or acquired pursuant to the Companys Long Term Incentive Plans, until such time as the guidelines have been met.
Only beneficially owned shares count toward the guidelines, including the portion of the annual bonus EIS deferred into shares.
The Committee will keep the guidelines under regular review.
As mentioned earlier in this Report, any shares that vest under the 2015 and later PSP awards must, as a standard requirement, be retained by executives for at least 24 months.
The Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company in order to align their interests with those of shareholders.
