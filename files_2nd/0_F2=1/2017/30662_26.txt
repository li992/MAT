His annual fee is 1,250,000, and he receives bene ts including access to a car and driver, private healthcare and life assurance.
In 2016 he received assistance in relocating to the UK in order to take up his appointment.
The Chairman and iNEDs were paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year.
UK-based iNEDs have the opportunity to use up to 100 per cent of their monthly post-tax base fees to acquire shares in the Group Monthly Share Purchase Scheme.
The table below shows the fees and bene ts received by the Chairman and iNEDs in 2017 and 2016.

All of the directors, other than Dr Kurt Campbell, have met this requirement.
Shareholders approved a resolution to disapply the shareholding quali cation in relation to Dr Kurt Campbell at the Companys AGM in May 2014.
This was in connection with the terms of the then proposed appointment of Dr Kurt Campbells wife to the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve System 7 The bene cial interests of directors and connected persons in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out above.
The directors do not have any non-bene cial interests in the Companys shares.

All gures are as at 31 December 2017 or on the retirement of a director unless otherwise stated Additional information to explain the single total gure table for the Chairman and iNEDs Bene ts primarily consist of travel and subsistence costs in relation to Board and Committee meetings and other Board-related events which are taxable in the UK.
Partners may also accompany the directors to meetings.
These costs and any associated tax costs are paid by the Group.
The iNEDs 2017 bene ts gures shown are in respect of the 2016 17 tax year.
This provides consistency with the reporting of similar bene ts in previous years and with those received by executive directors.
The bene ts gure for the Chairman includes relocation bene ts and the reimbursement of costs in order to take up his appointment.
These were similar to those offered to employees who join from another country.
The bene ts gure includes the value of the tax borne by the Group on the provision of relocation bene ts.
Some of the iNEDs 2016 bene ts in respect of the 2015 16 tax year have been restated to re ect actual bene ts received.
For the Chairman this gure has been restated to re ect the realisation of an estimate of the tax due.
This has reduced the gure by 3,000.
For Om Bhatt and Dr Han, the gure reported in 2016 has been restated to include the cost of their partners ights during the 2015 16 tax year, and the value of tax on these bene ts, which were not included in the 2016 gures reported.
