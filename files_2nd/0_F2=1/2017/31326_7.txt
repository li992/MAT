Our strategy Strategic priorities We are an entrepreneurial investor who looks for opportunistic investments that will create a high-yielding property portfolio.
1 Acquire selectively Our locally based, in-house asset management teams have the skills to meet the most complex occupier requirements and improve occupancy.
2 Manage intensively After purchase we aim to maximise rental incomeand occupancy through active assetmanagement initiatives leading to increased values.
3 Increase values We focus on realised returns through rental income and profit on sales generated from astrong and diversied tenant base.
This allowsHansteen to pay a well-covered and progressive dividend.
