Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Our focus on attracting this type of Member has been reflected in an increasing proportion of new Members switching all their services to us landline, broadband, mobile, electricity and or gas over the last two years as can be seen from the following figures: PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEMBERS TAKING DOUBLE GOLD BUNDLE Individual energy supply point churn remained at around 1.1% per month, driven by collective switching initiatives and a record gap during the first half of the year between the introductory fixed price deals available from other suppliers and the range of tariffs we offer.
In the context of higher levels of switching activity throughout the industry, it is pleasing that the proportion of energy customers leaving us remains on average significantly below other suppliers: ENERGY SUPPLY POINT CHURN Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 15 Q1 FY16 35.1% FY11 16.3% Q2 FY16 35.3% FY12 13.3% Q3 FY16 46.3% FY13 11.2% Q4 FY16 47.7% FY14 10.4% Q1 FY17 51.5% FY15 11.2% Q2 FY17 44.7% FY16 13.1% Q3 FY17 46.6% FY17 13.2% Q4 FY17 55.1% CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Average revenue per Member has once again fallen slightly, as the combined impact of falling average energy consumption and lower retail energy tariffs outweighed the benefit from the higher penetration of communications services particularly mobile that we are now seeing: AVERAGE REVENUE PER MEMBER These revenue figures relate solely to our Customer Management operating segment, the figures for 2008 to 2014 inclusive are restated as detailed in the 2015 Annual Report 16 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 190 286 316 329 459 482 505 634 801 819 1,064 1,149 1,137 1,186 1,359 1,304 1,279 1,226 1,191 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Services The full range of services we offer includes landline telephony calls and line rental, broadband, mobile, gas, electricity, and our CashBack card.
At the year end, we supplied a total of 2,288,918 services to Club Members 2016: 2,181,704, an increase of 4.9% during the year.

This increase means that penetration of mobile within our residential Club has now reached 35%, and is starting to catch up with our other services: this is due to a strategic decision to place mobile at the heart of our retail proposition, and to improve its competitive position.
We made 4G available to our Members last Autumn, and have just increased the data allowance for Double Gold members on our ValueMax tariff to 10GB at no extra cost.
CashBack Our exclusive CashBack card has proven an important Member acquisition and retention tool.
It gives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly bill from us.
Since launching the programme, the total value of CashBack funded by participating retailers and credited to Members now exceeds 33m 2016: 28m.
We saw a 5% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 188,753 2016: 179,639, with the c. 50% of new residential Club Members gathered directly by our Partners applying for a card being partially offset by those with inactive cards choosing not to renew when their card expired.
We believe this continuing strong demand demonstrates the attractiveness of this unique membership benefit, and would be even higher were it not for the difficulties faced by some new Members in funding the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in advance with our prepayment card.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 17 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Many Members continue to use our online shopping portal to reduce their bills, receiving in aggregate around 0.5m of CashBack over the course of last year: this is in addition to any savings from using their CashBack cards.
The CashBack that we pay to our Members each month is funded entirely by the retailers in the programme, and many Members achieve a reduction of 20% to 30% on the amount they pay for their utilities simply by using their CashBack card instead of an alternative payment card for most of their regular household shopping, and or our online shopping portal.
Member Service and Support We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single support centre based in the UK.
We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members: we readily invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects of our Members interactions with us to improve the overall quality of their experience.
We have been delighted at the consistently high ratings, awards and recognition we receive from Moneywise and in Which?
magazine for the quality of the service and support provided to our Members, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.
We were particularly proud to win Best Telecommunications Services Provider at the 2017 Which?
Awards Ceremony a few weeks ago, alongside being voted UK National Public Champion in the European Business Awards.
These are clear independent third party endorsements of our commitment to looking after our customers, and treating them as we would wish to be treated ourselves.
Partners Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business.
In contrast to the routes to market adopted by other suppliers of similar household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenuesharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy higher-spending Members who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be least likely to churn: by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income.
This ensures that cases of misselling are both inadvertent and extremely rare.
We provide a variety of training and personal development courses, both online and classroom-based, designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners effectively and successfully: all of these courses are free to attend.
In addition, we offer a hire purchase scheme which gives Partners access to a Tablet so they can present the benefits of our unique Discount Club more effectively.
18 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements We introduced a new Quick Income Plan on 1st January 2017, giving Partners the opportunity to accelerate some of their residual income.
This has been well received, and enables any Partner who wants to develop their Utility Warehouse business on a full-time basis, to earn a full-time income whilst they do so.
As such, it has the potential to transform the way potential new recruits look at this opportunity.
Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini or in some cases a BMW X5, remains extremely popular with around 900 vehicles now delivered 2016: c. 800.
Owners inform us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new Members and Partners.
Smart Meter roll-out We have installed around 100,000 smart meters to date notwithstanding operational challenges with one of our MOPs which meant we were unable to achieve the number of installations that we had forecast last year.
Having addressed these issues, our rollout this year is currently running ahead of forecast.
The industry anticipates the transition from first generation SMETS1 smart meters to second generation SMETS2 smart meters will occur this autumn, and we look forward to further accelerating our rollout programme thereafter.
In addition to much-debated efficiency benefits, smart meters have the potential to materially improve the relationship between customers and energy suppliers.
We are therefore broadly supportive of the nationwide smart meter programme, albeit we remain concerned over the significant additional costs that are being incurred as a result of an ill-conceived and sub-optimum rollout strategy a cost that will ultimately be met by consumers.
IT Systems The journey we embarked on last year to start reviewing the systems and processes which have evolved over the course of the last 20 years, and to prepare for the introduction of new services, is gathering steam.
And while this is creating significant additional costs in the short term, with benefits that may take many years to arrive, I am confident that making this investment is the right decision for the business.
In the meantime, our operating costs remain lower than those of any of our peers on a like-for-like basis, and we look forward to the operating efficiencies and performance improvements which our new systems are expected to deliver in due course.
