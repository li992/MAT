REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Set out here is the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2017.
This report includes our current Remuneration Policy which was approved in 2016, and also says how this policy has been implemented during the year.
As a result of the reduction in the Directors valuation of Alliance Trust Savings, the Committee exercised its discretion under the rules of the Long-Term Incentive Plan to reduce the vesting percentage of the shares awarded for the three-year performance period which ended on 31 December 2017.
We have made no changes to Directors fees for the year.
