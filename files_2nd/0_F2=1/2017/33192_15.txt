COM DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY No changes are proposed to the Remuneration Policy adopted by the Company on 9 May 2016 at its 2016 Annual General Meeting such policy being effective with respect to payments made after 9 May 2016 and detailed in the 2015 Annual Report.
However, the Remuneration Policy table is reproduced below for convenience.
Remuneration Policy table Base salary To recruit, motivate and retain high-calibre Executive Directors by offering salaries Purpose and link to strategy at market competitive levels.
Reflects individual experience and role.
Operation Reviewed annually with any changes normally effective from 1 January.
Positioning and annual increases are influenced by: our sector, where the market for executive talent is intense the experience and performance of the individual: changes in responsibility or position: changes in broader workforce salary: and the performance of 888 as a whole.
Benchmarking is carried out on a total remuneration basis and takes into account pay levels for comparable roles at a range of organisations of similar size and sector including pay practices in other UK listed companies and in the international gaming industry.
Opportunity Any increase to Directors salaries will generally be no higher than the average increase for other employees.
However, a higher increase may be proposed in the event of a role change or promotion, or in other exceptional circumstances.
Benefits Purpose and link to strategy Market competitive structure to support recruitment and retention.
Medical cover aims to ensure minimal business interruption as a result of illness.
Executive Directors may receive various benefits in kind as part of their employment Operation terms.
These may include an accommodation allowance where 888 has required the executive to relocate, use of a company car or car allowance, health insurance or a contribution towards a health insurance scheme, study fund a common savings benefit in Israel, disability and life assurance, relocation expenses, directors indemnities and directors and officers insurances to the extent permitted by law and other ad hoc benefits at the discretion of the Committee.
Opportunity The value of benefits is based on the cost to 888 and there is no pre-determined maximum limit.
The range and value of the benefits offered is reviewed periodically.
Pension Purpose and link to strategy Contribution towards the funding of post-retirement life.
Operation 888 offers a defined contribution pension scheme via outsourced pension providers or cash in lieu of pension.
Opportunity Up to 15% of base salary.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 63 GOVERNANCE & DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration Policy table continued Annual bonus Purpose and link to strategy Rewards the achievement of annual financial and, if appropriate, non-financial strategic targets.
Operation Bonus targets percentage of salary are based on objective and disclosable calculations for financial and non-financial performance where possible.
The precise weightings between metrics may differ each year, although there will be always be a greater focus on financial as opposed to non-financial performance.
Any bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary is deferred into shares which vest in equal tranches after one, two and three years.
A dividend equivalent provision operates enabling dividends to be accrued in cash or shares on unvested deferred bonus shares or up to the point of exercise in the case of nil cost options.
The bonus is subject to a recovery and withholding provision if the financial statements of 888 were materially misstated or an error occurred in assessing the performance conditions on bonus and or if the Executive ceased to be a Director or employee due to gross misconduct.
Opportunity The maximum opportunity is 150% of base salary.
The level of pay-out for the achievement of target performance, as set by the Committee is 50% of the maximum amount.
Presently the target is based on like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth in addition to exceeding budgeted Adjusted EBITDA for the year as approved by the Board.
The threshold level of payment may be up to 25% of the maximum.
Performance metrics Financial performance The financial component is based on 888s key financial measures of performance.
This will normally be based on like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth but may include other financial KPIs.
A sliding scale of targets applies for financial performance targets which are measured annually.
The degree of stretch in targets may vary each year depending on the business aims and the broader economic or industry environment at the start of the relevant year.
Non-financial performance There is no intention initially to use non-financial performance conditions, but the Committee wishes to retain flexibility to do so, for a minority of the bonus opportunity.

COM Remuneration Policy table continued Long Term Incentives Plan LTIP Purpose and Link to Strategy Rewards Executive Directors for achieving superior returns for shareholders over a longer-term timeframe.
Enables Executive Directors to build a meaningful shareholding over time and align goals with shareholders.
Operation 888 sought shareholder approval for the 2015 LTIP at the EGM held on 30 September 2015.
This replaced the previous share plans which expired in August 2015.
LTIP awards are made annually in the form of nil cost options or conditional awards with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions over at least three financial years, commencing with the year of grant.
Awards are subject to a recovery and withholding provision if there is a material misstatement in 888s financial statements, an error in the calculation of any performance conditions or if the Executive Director ceases to be a Director or employee due to gross misconduct.
A dividend equivalent provision operates enabling dividends to be accrued in cash or shares on LTIP awards to the extent they vest.
Opportunity Award levels are determined primarily by seniority.
A maximum individual grant limit of 200% of salary applies, based on the face value of shares at the date of grant.
The current award level is 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
Performance metrics Awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on performance measures reflecting the outputs of the long-term strategy of the business at the time of grant.
Awards are currently based 50% on adjusted EPS and 50% on relative total shareholder return TSR, but the choice and weightings of metrics may differ for future award cycles.
Where possible TSR will be compared to a basket of 888s peers, but recognising the level of consolidation in the sector the selection criteria may be broadened to the leisure sector or listed companies more generally.
The Committee will review the weightings between measures and the target ranges prior to each LTIP grant to ensure that the overall balance and level of stretch remains appropriate.
A sliding scale of targets applies for financial metrics with no more than 25% of the award vesting at threshold performance.
For TSR, none of this part of the award will vest below median ranking and awards will vest on a sliding scale for performance between the threshold and stretch targets.
Share ownership guidelines Under the guidelines, Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain an interest equivalent in value to no less than two times salary.
Beneficially owned shares and fully vested unexercised nil-cost options valued on a net of tax basis will be included when determining the extent to which the guideline holding is achieved.
Until such time as the guideline threshold is achieved Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of the net of tax value of awards that vest under the LTIP or deferred annual bonus.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 65 GOVERNANCE & DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration Policy table continued Chairman and Non-Executive Directors NEDs fees Purpose and link to strategy To recruit, motivate and retain a Chairman and Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre by offering a market competitive fee level and which takes account of the specific circumstances of 888.
The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the fees paid to the NonOperation Executive Directors.
The Chairmans fees are determined by the Remuneration Committee with reference to prevailing fee rates amongst other gaming companies.
Fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors are set by reference to an assessment of the time commitment and responsibility associated with each role, and the Chairman and Executive Directors have reference in this respect to prevailing fee rates amongst other gaming companies.
Levels take account of additional demands placed upon individual Non-Executive Directors by virtue of their holding particular offices, such as Committee Chairman and or Senior Independent Director, and travel time to Board meetings which are held outside the UK.
Additional fees may be paid as appropriate to reflect increased time commitments of the role.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any bonus plan, pension plan, share plan, or long-term incentive plan of 888.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for any reasonable travel and accommodation expenses incurred in the performance of their duties including any tax incurred thereon.
Approach to recruitment remuneration The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as is required to attract the most appropriate candidate.
The annual bonus and LTIP potential would be in line with the Policy.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would ensure that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, or adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
The Committee may agree that 888 will meet relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts and loss of office payment policy for Executive Directors Executive Directors have service contracts with up to 12-month notice periods.
In the event of termination, the Executive Directors contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of base salary plus the value of any benefits including pension, and in the case of the Chief Financial Officer, annual bonus for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
888 seeks to apply the principle of mitigation in the payment of compensation on the termination of the service contract of any Executive Director.
There are no special provisions in the service contracts for payments to Executive Directors on a change of control of 888.
In the event of an exit of an Executive Director, the overriding principle will be to honour contractual remuneration entitlements and determine on an equitable basis the appropriate treatment of deferred and performance linked elements of the package, taking account of the circumstances.
Failure will not be rewarded.
If an Executive Director resigns or is summarily dismissed, salary, pension and benefits will cease on the last day of employment and there will be no further payments.
There are no other obligations to pay remuneration, or which could impact remuneration, contained in any service contract other than the terms of the Executive Directors service agreements described herein.
Directors service agreements are available for inspection at 888s registered office and at each AGM.
888 HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 66 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE & DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE.
COM Leaver on arranged terms or good leaver If an Executive Director leaves on agreed terms, including compassionate circumstances, there may be payments after cessation of employment.
Salary, pension and benefits will be paid up to the length of the agreed notice period or agreed period of gardening leave.
Subject to performance, a bonus may be payable at the discretion of the Committee pro-rata for the portion of the financial year worked.
Unvested deferred bonus shares will ordinarily vest in full at the end of the normal vesting period.
All such vested awards must be exercised within 12 months of the vesting date.
The Committee has discretion to permit such unvested awards to vest early rather than continue on the normal vesting timetable.
Unvested LTIP awards under the 888 AllEmployee Plan will generally automatically lapse, unless the Committee in its discretion determines otherwise.
Unvested awards under the 2015 LTIP would normally vest on the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines that such awards shall instead vest at the time of cessation.
Unvested awards will only vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied over the full or curtailed period as relevant.
A pro-rata reduction in the size of awards would normally apply, based upon the period of time after the grant date and ending on the date of cessation of employment relative to the normal vesting period.
Depending upon circumstances, the Committee may consider other payments in respect of an unfair dismissal award, outplacement support and assistance with legal fees.
Terms of appointment for Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors serve subject to letters of appointment and are appointed subject to re-election at the AGM.
The Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve for three years, although the Board may invite a Non-Executive Director to serve for an additional period.
Their letters of appointment are available for inspection at 888s registered office and at each AGM.
In accordance with best practice under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board proposes to submit the Directors individually for re-election by the shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account 888 engages with significant investors regarding remuneration issues and intends to continue doing so.
Views of shareholders and their representative bodies expressed at the AGM and feedback received at other times will be considered by the Committee.
How the views of employees are taken into account Whilst 888 does not formally consult employees on remuneration, in determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes account of the policy for employees across the workforce.
In particular, when setting base salaries for executives, the Committee takes into account the salary increases being offered to the workforce as a whole.
The overall structure of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is broadly consistent with that for other senior employees, but reflects the additional risks and responsibilities borne by the Executive Directors.
Executive remuneration and remuneration of senior employees is weighted towards performance-related pay.
888s Senior Vice Presidents all participate in the same annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements as the Executive Directors at varying levels of quantum and 888s Business Leadership Forum also participate in a long-term equity plan.
Annual Report on Remuneration This Annual Report on Remuneration together with the Chairmans annual statement, as detailed on page 62 will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.

Bonus will be based on a sliding scale range of like-for-like EBITDA targets, which will be disclosed retrospectively in next years annual report on remuneration.
No bonus will become payable unless budgeted Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 is achieved.
Any bonus above 100% of salary will be deferred into equity awards of the Company in the form of nil cost options or share awards, in accordance with the Companys DSBP.
Awards under the DSBP are generally granted within 42 days of the Companys results announcement, subject to any applicable dealing restrictions.
All such equity awards vest in equal tranches over three years from the date of grant, without the application of performance conditions but subject to leaver and clawback provisions.
In order to grant awards under the DSBP, the Group purchases shares on the open market, all of which are initially recognised as treasury shares of the Company.
Long-term incentive plan Award levels The CEO and CFO will be granted awards worth 200% of base salary and 150% of salary respectively.
Performance conditions 2018 LTIP awards will be subject to EPS and relative TSR performance conditions, each with a 50% weighting.
These metrics were chosen as EPS provides a focus on 888s underlying financial performance, and relative TSR provides an objective reward for delivering value to shareholders compared to 888s peers.

Annual bonus payments in respect of 2017 performance As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, each Executive Director participates in the annual bonus plan, under which performance is measured over a single financial year.
The annual bonus opportunity was 150% of base salary and the bonus was determined by reference to challenging like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA performance conditions.
EBITDA performance The extent to which the EBITDA performance conditions in respect of 2017 performance were achieved is as follows: Threshold Target Max Actual Performance Measures 25% pay-out 50% pay-out 100% pay-out performance Bonus awarded Like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth per annum 5% 12.5% 20% 21.1% 150% of salary Itai Frieberger ILS 4,770,000, of which ILS 3,180,000 is paid in cash and an amount equal to ILS 1,590,000 is deferred into shares under the DSBP.
Aviad Kobrine GBP 655,500, of which GBP 437,000 is paid in cash and an amount equal to GBP 218,500 is deferred into shares under the DSBP.
Insofar as Adjusted EBITDA for the year is not above the level specified in the budget, no bonus would have been payable: however, this hurdle was achieved in 2017.
To enable a like-for-like comparison with the prior year and to be comparable with the basis on which the growth targets were original set, EBITDA growth is adjusted to take into account of: the Groups withdrawal from any markets during the year, to provide an assessment of the underlying performance of the core business: any new gaming taxes introduced during the year that were not in force or anticipated at the start of the year when the targets were set: and movements in foreign exchange rates from budgeted rates like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth is calculated on constant currency basis.

COM EBITDA performance continued Taking into account the underlying financial and operational performance of the business during the year, including the significant resources devoted by the senior management team in assessing and delivering improvements to 888s responsible gaming tools, processes and technology, the Committee considered that the overall bonus out-turn was reflective of the strong performance of the Company and the management team over the year and that the pay-out levels were appropriate.
As noted on pages 68 to 69, the proportion of bonus awarded in excess of 100% of salary, will be deferred in shares under the Deferred Share Bonus plan.
The deferred shares vest in equal tranches after one, two and three years.
No further performance conditions apply to the release of the deferred shares.
