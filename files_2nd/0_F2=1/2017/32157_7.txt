18 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 In 1993 we held our first Charity Day.
We had no agenda atthat time apart from let us give a days work totally to charitable causes but it proved to be a defining moment forour character and ethos.
We have continued each year since and in all our offices around the world to dedicate one day in early December exclusively to giving our entire revenue, whether it bedollar, euro, pound or yen, to local charities.
I am extremely proud of what we have achieved together.
Over those nearly 25 years, many staff have said to me this is the best day in the year: Ishare that sentiment.
