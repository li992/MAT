The strategic report This has been a challenging year for BT.
Weve faced headwinds in the UK public sector and international corporate markets and must learn from what we found in our Italian business.
Openreach also received a fine from Ofcom after an investigation into historical Deemed Consent practices revealed it fell short of the high standards we expect.
We take these issues extremely seriously and are putting in place new measures, controls and people to prevent them happening again.
Learning from the challenges of this year will make BT a stronger company for the future.
However, weve also made good progress in a number of areas.
Our integration of EE is going well, our UK consumer, SME and corporate businesses are performing strongly, and weve made significant progress in improving customer experience across the group.
Our agreement with Ofcom on Openreach governance brings to an end a period of uncertainty.
And securing exclusive rights to top-flight European football until 2021 puts our consumer businesses in a strong position.
BT is well positioned for the future, and well continue to seek business cases to invest more in the UKs digital infrastructure.
