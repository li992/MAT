The proportion of secured loans and advances classified as low risk has increased over the period from 90.9% to 99.2%.
Model development work undertaken during the year, to better align the Groups internal rating systems with portfolio performance, has led to improvements in credit quality measurements across the portfolio.
In addition, third party process improvements in relation to data matching have improved the accuracy of certain customers risk classifications, increasing the proportion of loans classified as low risk.
Additionally, new lending during the period, although having a diluting effect, showed strong arrears performance.

These assets represented 0.6% of secured loans at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: 0.6%.
All unsecured assets which are past due are treated as impaired.
All loans and advances which are past due and not impaired are classified as higher risk.
The tables below show loans and advances which are past due and not impaired by overdue term.
The Groups definition of impaired assets includes accounts that are in arrears and accounts that may not be in arrears but are showing non-delinquency impairment indicators such as expired contractual terms or fraud.
Balances with these indicators are categorised as impaired irrespective of arrears status or expected recoverable amount.
1 1 As at 31 December 2017, the balance of impaired assets in arrears was 89.0 million 2016: 74.6 million.
The remainder of the impaired assets balance relates to: interest only expired term loans which have an average LTV of 25.8% and do not attract significant impairment provisions: and fraud balances, which have an average LTV of 57.2%.
These balances account for less than 0.1% of the portfolio, are managed at account level, and provisioning reflects the estimated credit loss associated with the individual account.
The balances not in arrears but showing non-delinquency impairment indicators, by their nature, typically give rise to lower levels of loss and, as a result, attract lower levels of impairment provision.
Unsecured impaired assets increased by 31.5% to 42.6 million, representing 1.4% of total unsecured loans.
This is driven both by an increase in arrears balances, consistent with book growth, and by the expected seasoning of older assets on the portfolio.
The performance of more recent cohorts is in line with or better than vintage cohorts at a similar stage of maturity.
Arrears emergence on all cohorts remains in line with performance expectations.

All impaired loans and advances are classified as higher risk.
Secured impairment coverage has fallen from 11.4% at 31 December 2016, to 9.0% as at 31 December 2017 due to the impact of expired term and fraud loan balances.
Unsecured impairment provisions increased by 7.8 million during the period and have reduced as a percentage of gross balances from 1.59% at 31 December 2016 to 1.54% at 31 December 2017.
Impairment provisions as a proportion of impaired balances decreased, from 121.9% to 111.0% during the year.
The reduction in impairment provision coverage is a result of improved debt recovery rates, which reduces the estimated credit loss attributable to these assets.

Repossessions The Group works with customers who have difficulty paying their mortgages, and will repossess a property only when all other possibilities have been exhausted.
Where properties have been repossessed, the Group will obtain the best price, taking into account factors such as property and market conditions.
The Group uses external asset management specialists to realise the value as soon as practicable to settle indebtedness.
Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
The Group held ten repossessed properties as at 31 December 2017 compared to six as at 31 December 2016.
The total number of properties taken into possession during the year reduced to 12, from 36 in 2016.

161.2 million 31 December 2016: 128.6 million of retail secured loans and advances were subject to forbearance, representing 0.48% of total secured loans and advances 2016: 0.43%.
This increase in forbearance is consistent with portfolio growth and reflects the Groups focus on proactive debt management due to the low level of arrears emergence.
During 2017, the Group amended its secured forbearance capture to exclude routine term extensions processed as part of the mortgage review process, where there is no forbearance.
Such cases had been captured prudently as forborne in prior reporting periods.

Risk Management Report Strategic Report Financial Results Governance Financial Statements Other Information Virgin Money Group Annual Report 2017 155 I Derivative financial instruments The Group reduces exposure to credit risk through central clearing for eligible derivatives and daily posting of cash collateral on such transactions, as detailed in notes 13 and 33 to the financial statements.
For derivatives not eligible for central clearing, exposure is reduced by the use of master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the Groups maximum credit risk relating to derivative assets of 78.8 million 2016: 104.2 million, collateral of 84.4 million 2016: 86.4 million was held.
The Group measures exposure in derivatives using the gross positive fair value of contracts outstanding with a counterparty, increased by potential future rises in fair value and reduced by gross negative fair value of contracts and collateral received.
While exposures are managed on a net basis, they are represented on the balance sheet on a gross basis unless the IAS 32 offsetting rules are met.
Derivative contracts which do not meet the IAS 32 offsetting rules, and have positive fair values, are disclosed as assets in the balance sheet.
Those with negative fair values are disclosed as liabilities.
Cash collateral received is classified as deposits from banks, and cash collateral posted is classified as loans and advances to banks.
The notes to the financial statements provide further information on collateral.
The table below details derivative exposures, excluding those that are centrally cleared.

In respect of repurchase transactions, only the difference between the asset pledged and deposit received is classed as an exposure given the balance sheet maintains the exposure to the underlying obligor.

These improvements are due to the Groups savings pricing strategy and changes in customer terms and conditions, which has benefited interest rate mismatch risk.
Additionally, the further utilisation of basis swapped positions has reduced the level of basis risk arising in these rate shock scenarios.
The table below shows that, due to reductions in the structural mismatches of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet across the year, the Groups net interest income at 31 December 2017 is significantly less likely to suffer from a large, sudden shock to interest rates than it was at 31 December 2016.

Loans and advances to customers are classified as Available for collateral only if they are already in such a form that they can be used immediately to raise funding.
4 Other unencumbered assets are assets which are not subject to any restrictions but are not readily available for use.
5 These amounts represent Treasury Bills received by the Group through FLS, which are not recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group is permitted to re-pledge these securities to generate on-balance sheet financial assets, such as cash, or to fund lending.
These items are classified as encumbered where the Group has used them in repurchase transactions or unencumbered where it has not.
The Groups total level of asset encumbrance increased by 3.8 billion to 32.4% at 31 December 2017.
This was primarily due to using the TFS to support increased lending, which took total drawings to date to 4.2 billion.
The Group manages the volume of available unencumbered collateral to meet requirements arising from current and future secured funding transactions.

The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
These differ from balance sheet values due to the effects of discounting on certain balance sheet items and due to the inclusion of contractual future interest flows.
