Our vision is for a world thats cleaner and healthier: today and for future generations.
We use science to create innovative products Cleaner Air One in every three new cars carries an emission control catalyst from Johnson Matthey.
Toxic carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons go into the catalyst, cleaner air comes out.
With our deep understanding, at the atomic scale, of the distribution of platinum, palladium and rhodium in our catalysts, were also able to minimise the amounts of precious metal required to do the job.
Our catalysts stop around 20 million tonnes of pollutants in their tracks every year a breath of fresh air for people all over the world.
Researching and developing solutions to make a positive contribution to our society and the environment, and a real difference to everyones lives.
Finding the Remedy Active pharmaceutical ingredients APIs are the constituents of pills and other medications that do all the work, whether its attacking cancer cells, regulating a heartbeat or combating severe pain.
Making them effectively always starts in the lab, with super clever chemistry.
Johnson Matthey develops API processes for many important, life changing drugs.
We employ highly complex chemistry to prepare molecules to very specific standards, then design advanced manufacturing methods to produce them at the scale that our pharmaceutical customers need.
In this way, our chemistry helps relieve symptoms in millions of people each year.
