com Financial review continued Capital structure Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators PRA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Solvency II regime SII.
We comply with all relevant SII requirements.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company, Inc and Beazley Insurance dac.
We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an ongoing basis in light of the current regulatory framework, opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However, there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
On issuance of the new tier 2 subordinated debt in 2016, Beazley Insurance dac was assigned an Insurer Financial Strength IFS rating of A by Fitch.
In 2017, Beazley acquired 3.0m of its own shares into the employee benefit trust.
These were acquired at an average price of 437p and the cost to the group was 13.1m.
The following table sets out the groups sources of funds: 2017 2016 $m $m Shareholders funds 1,498.9 1,483.7 Tier 2 subordinated debt 2026 248.5 248.3 Retail bond 2019 99.5 94.7 Long term subordinated debt 2034 18.0 18.0 1,864.9 1,844.7 Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity alongside $248.5m of tier 2 subordinated debt, $18.0m of subordinated long term debt, a $99.5m retail bond and an undrawn banking facility of $225.0m.
We signalled at the interim results that we expected the Lloyds economic capital requirement ECR to increase, reflecting our plans for growth.
The final figure at year end 2017 is lower than our projection reflecting the improved profitability of the natural catastrophe underwriting expected in 2018.
Our guidance, that we expect underwriting capital to grow in the mid to high single digits, remains.
The following table sets out the groups capital requirement: 2017 2016 $m $m Lloyds economic capital requirement ECR 1,517.2 1,489.2 1 Capital for US insurance company 96.5 107.7 1,613.7 1,596.9 1 The A. M. Best rating of our US insurance company Beazley Insurance Company Inc. BICI is now maintained via a group support mechanism rather than on a stand alone basis.
As a result the capital requirement for BICI is now taken as a minimum realistic risk based capital RBC level as opposed to the capital level required to achieve a stand alone A. M. Best rating.
At 31 December 2017, we have surplus capital of 39% of ECR on a Solvency II basis.
Following payment of the second interim dividend of 7.4p, this surplus reduces to 35% compared to our current target range of 15% to 25% of ECR.
Solvency II The Solvency II regime came into force on 1 January 2016.
Beazley continue to provide quarterly Solvency II pillar 3 reporting to both Lloyds for the Beazley managed syndicates and the Central Bank of Ireland for Beazley Insurance dac and Beazley plc.
In 2017 the first annual solvency financial condition report SFCR of Beazley plc was published.
Under Solvency II requirements, the group is required to produce a Solvency Capital Requirement SCR which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews the syndicates SCRs to ensure that SCRs are consistent across the market.
On 10 December 2015 Beazley received internal model approval from the Central Bank of Ireland the group supervisor under Solvency II.
com Annual report 2017 Beazley 51 The current SCR has been established using our Solvency II approved internal model which has been run within the regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to perform the capital assessment, we have made significant investments in both models and process: we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and the internal model process is embedded so that teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
