Production Copper production for the full year 2017 was 228,300 tonnes, 3.3% lower than in 2016 primarily as a result of lower recoveries and lower grades at Centinela Concentrates.
This was partly offset by higher grades in the oxides line and the start of production at Encuentro Oxides.
Copper in concentrate production for the full year was 163,900 tonnes, 9.1% lower than 2016, mainly reflecting slightly lower grades and the consequential drop in recoveries.
Gold production was 157,000 ounces, 26.3% lower than in 2016.
This was mainly due to lower grades and recoveries.
Copper cathode production for the year was 64,500 tonnes, 15.6% higher than the previous year, as grades increased and Encuentro Oxides came into production in the last quarter of the year.
Cash costs Cash costs before by-product credits for the year were $1.81 lb, 3.4% higher than in 2016, mainly as a result of lower copper production, higher input prices and the payment of a one-off signing bonus following the successful conclusion of labour negotiations with three unions at the operation.
The essential terms of each of the labour agreements were standardised, allowing for the completion of the operational integration of Esperanza and El Tesoro, which began in 2014 when they were merged as Centinela.
This completion of the integration will bring further improvements in operating practices at Centinela and will enable improvements in productivity.
Net cash costs for 2017 were $1.36 lb compared with $1.19 lb in 2016.
This increase is due to the increase in cash costs before by-product credits and lower gold production.
Capital expenditure was $578 million, including $192 million on Encuentro Oxides and the molybdenum plant and $264 million on mine development.
Total project expenditure on the Encuentro Oxides project was $605 million, some $30 million under budget.
Total capital expenditure in 2018 is expected to be $516 million, included approximately $280 million on mine development.
OUTLOOK Production Production for 2018 is forecast at 230245,000 tonnes of payable copper, 130140,000 ounces of gold and 1,500 tonnes of molybdenum, following the commissioning of the molybdenum plant early in 2018.
While the grade at Centinela Concentrates will be lower than in 2017, Encuentro Oxides will reach full capacity during the year, contributing approximately 50,000 tonnes of payable copper.

It achieves this through careful project management and constant monitoring of the efficiency of its mines, plants and transport infrastructure.

and generate higher returns than greenfield projects.
The feasibility study for this $2.7 billion project is due for completion by the end of 2018, when a decision will be made on whether The Group continues to review its options for maximising returns and to proceed with either this project or the expansion of the existing reducing the capital cost of projects and is enhancing the capabilities plant.
If approval is given in 2018 first production is expected in 2022. of the project team to improve project execution strategy, management and control.
However, if the expansion of the existing concentrator is approved it is likely that the second concentrator will proceed at a later date.
At Centinela the expansion of the existing concentrator and using its infrastructure power lines, pipelines, port and other facilities There is also scope to increase the plant capacity further is being considered as an alternative to building a new concentrator.
once the second concentrator is completed, which could bring throughput capacity to approximately 150,000 tonnes per day and The Group is also evaluating the disposal of under-utilised assets increase the plants production to approximately 250,000 tonnes and unlocking value through the sale and lease-back of certain of copper equivalent.
CENTINELA SECOND CONCENTRATOR One alternative under consideration for the expansion of Centinela is the construction of a second concentrator some 7 km from 180,000 tonnes Centinelas current concentrator.
It is expected to have an ore copper equivalent production per year throughput capacity of approximately 90,000 tonnes per day, with annual production of approximately 180,000 tonnes of copper equivalent, which includes gold and molybdenum as by-products.
Ore will be sourced initially from the Esperanza Sur deposit and, once mining is completed at Encuentro Oxides, additionally from Encuentro Sulphides.
44 Antofagasta plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT EVALUATION ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT OPTION As an alternative to the construction of a second concentrator, the Group is evaluating the expansion of the existing concentrator and tailings storage facilities as a less capital-intensive alternative.
Technical viability, capital cost and financial returns will be assessed before the completion of the feasibility study for the second concentrator.
The expansion of the existing concentrator would not preclude the later construction of the second concentrator.
More work will be conducted on both expansion options during 2018 with the intention of the Company being able to select its preferred alternative by the end of the year.
If it is decided to proceed with the expansion of the existing concentrator in prefrence to building a second concentrator, a full feasibility study will be required before it is taken to the Board for approval.
This work would delay the date for final project approval by approximately 18 months.

As part of this development the Group will submit a new EIA to increase the capacity of the mines Mauro tailings storage facility and mine waste dumps.
Work on the environmental baseline study for the new EIA started in 2017 and the results will be reviewed in late 2018.
Capital expenditure for this phase was estimated in the pre-feasibility study at approximately $500 million, the majority being on mining equipment, additional crushing and grinding capacity and flotation cells.
The conveyors from the primary crusher to the concentrator plant will also have to be repowered to support the additional throughput.
Critical studies on tailings and waste storage capacity are underway and should be completed in 2018.
However, the project will only proceed following a decision on Phase 1 and will require the submission of extensive permit applications, including the new EIA.
