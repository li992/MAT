South East Asia 17 | Strategic Report CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Fee Earner Headcount Number South East Asia South East Asia is one of the Groups Large, High Potential Markets, with exceptional performance since 1996 when we opened our first office in Singapore.
With a 10 year CAGR of 9.8%, its gross profit has increased from 4.6m in 2007 to 19.7m in 2017.
During the same 10 year period, we invested in fee earners with a CAGR of 20% to bring our fee earner headcount to nearly 200.
This has been achieved in line with our strategy of diversification where we have expanded throughout South East Asia, opening Malaysia in 2011, Indonesia in 2014, Thailand in 2016 and we will be opening in Vietnam in 2018.
Our success in this market enables us to operate out of all 4 brands across 14 disciplines.
Growth for South East Asia for the year was 12% despite the challenging conditions experienced in Singapore, where gross profit declined by 5%.
Although the economy in Singapore had experienced a slow down, it returned to growth by the end of the year, driven by our Finance & Accounting and Technology disciplines.
Singapore offers 11 disciplines across our Michael Page, Page Personnel and Page Executive brands.
Our Malaysia office has grown strongly, with a CAGR of 27% over the last five years and now has 65 fee earners.
Our office in Thailand opened at the end of 2016 is performing well and is profitable.
Indonesias growth rate for 2017 was 48%, where we now offer 7 disciplines with stand out performances from Sales and Finance & Accounting over the last year.
Following our expansion into Thailand and Indonesia and the addition of 105 fee earners, our 5 year CAGR in South East Asia excluding Singapore was 43%.
We believe this market presents great opportunities for the future, where we can expand both the breadth of our disciplines and brands across the countries we already operate in, but also with opportunity of opening offices in other countries across South East Asia.
