The Precision Control Systems business saw increased revenues through development work on equipment for the Mitsubishi Regional Jet and a ramp up in production activity on certain armoured vehicle programmes, offset by lower license sales compared to 2016, and lower demand for industrial products elsewhere in the division.
The divisions underlying operating margins improved to 16.0% 2016: 15.8%.
This was helped by the increased revenues from higher margin sales in the period and an improved operational performance at Ultras aerospace business, which benefitted from slightly lower R&D expenditure as a number of large programmes approached production.
Underlying operating margins also benefitted from S3 related business consolidations and cost reduction initiatives.
The divisions order book increased by 5.8% to 283.2m 2016: 267.8m owing in part to the orders noted below.
