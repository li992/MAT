The powers of the directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on page 42.
Under the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of 11,023,234.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and employee share plans.
None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole, and the directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.
Directors The current directors and their biographical details are listed on page 36 to 37 and all served throughout the year.

Going forward all directors will retire at the AGM and will stand for re-election by the shareholders, if they wish to continue to serve as directors of the Company.
Accordingly, those directors retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the 2018 AGM are S. C. Harris, I.

46 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695 19 March 2018 3:29 PM Proof 7 Potential conflicts of interest During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not only had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose, but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or potential.
Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation a Situational Conflict which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one company.
In order to ensure that each director was complying with the duties, each director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational Conflicts affected him or her.
The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict up until September 2019 and permitted each affected director to attend and vote at Bodycote directors meetings, on the basis that each such director continued to keep Bodycotes information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the interests of shareholders.
Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chairman or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation.
No such revocations have been made.
Employment The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees.
The commitment of employees to excel is key to the Groups continued success.
Through their attendance at or participation in strategy, production, safety and health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution to the Group made by their site, and are advised of safety and health issues.
Under the Groups Open Door Line employees concerns can be voiced over the phone on an anonymous basis in the local language.
Approximately 3,600 Bodycote employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, which improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology exchange and co-ordination.
It is the Groups policy to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed by the Group, including disabled persons.
