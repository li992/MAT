We deliver essential services on behalf of national and local governments, who represent over 90% of our business, and for commercial customers.
In doing so, we are helping them meet profound challenges.
Public finances are under significant pressure around the world but citizens still expect continual improvements in service quality.
At the same time, our customers need to address crucial issues such as economic development, congestion, security and demographic and climate change.
The companies we work for face similar financial and operational pressures.
Increasingly, our customers are using our broad skills and capabilities to address this significant agenda, and to improve productivity and efficiency.
We start by leading people more effectively, and instilling our values and our ethos of delivering high-quality services, which inform everything we do.
At the same time, we improve efficiency by introducing new processes and technology and making the best use of assets.
This approach enables us to take on new and complex tasks and transform the quality, reliability and efficiency of essential services ranging from air traffic control to running scientific establishments.
Our vision is to be the leading service company in our chosen markets.
This means we want to be the best partner to work with, the company people aspire to work for and the company that delivers superior returns to shareholders.
Our chosen markets are those that promise strong revenue growth, attractive margins and the ability to offer good working conditions for our people.
