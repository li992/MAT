com Powder Metallurgy Powder Metallurgy comprises: GKN Sinter Metals and Hoeganaes 09 GKN Sinter Metals is the worlds largest manufacturer of sintered components.
It uses powdered metals to manufacture precision automotive components for engines, transmissions, and body and chassis applications.
It also produces a range of components for industrial and consumer applications, including power tools, bearings, white goods and garden equipment.
Hoeganaes produces metal powders, largely ferrous based, used in the manufacture of sintered components.
It is the largest powder metal producer in North America.
