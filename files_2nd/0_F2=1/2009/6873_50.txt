Directors Remuneration Report continued General Policy on Directors Remuneration The Committees policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate individuals with appropriate skills and experience with the incentive to add sustainable longterm growth and value that will best serve the interests of the Company, its shareholders, employees and customers.
Basic salaries and total packages are set to reflect the market.
They are regularly benchmarked by external consultants against the median level payments made to executives in similar roles in companies of comparative size, sector and complexity which exercise was last conducted by Monks Partnership in 2009.
The Committee seeks to structure bonus arrangements that will align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
The Committee considers corporate performance on risk, governance, environmental and social issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors.
