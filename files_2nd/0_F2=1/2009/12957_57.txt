These are summarised below: Bakan Corridor The Bakan Corridor groups together a number of anomalous gold in soil targets Bakan, Tizia, Khosa, Tiwana and Tina along a 10 kilometre segment of the northeast trending Kossanto structural corridor which is sub-parallel to the MTZ.
The geology of the corridor comprises a northeast sequence of ultramafic units, felsic and intermediate volcanics andesites, dacites and rhyodacites, cherts and igneous rocks ranging from diorite to monzonite.
Extensive lithosampling carried out across the corridor has revealed mineralisation to be associated with deformed and altered felsic intrusives.
Follow up trenching has confirmed bedrock mineralisation at Bakan: BKTR002 - 38.00 metres at 2.00g t: BKTR005 - 4.00 metres at 2.38g t and 4 metres at 1.80g t: and BKTR006 - 69.70 metres at 1.89g t: and at Tina: TNTR002 - 24.00 metres at 1.50g t: and TNTR003 - 20.80 metres at 1.76g t. At Tiwana, seven lines of RAB holes, testing a 3.5 kilometre by 200 metre plus 20ppb gold in soil anomaly, returned encouraging results, defining a 125 metre wide anomalous zone plus 0.3g t including: TWRAB03 - 18 metres at 1.40g t: TWRAB06 - 36 metres at 0.63g t including 6 metres at 2.60g t: TWRAB020 - 18 metres at 1.27g t: and TWRAB064 - 9 metres at 2.54g t. Delaya Delaya is defined by a 6 kilometre by 100 metre plus 20ppb gold in soil anomaly.
Bedrock mineralisation was previously delineated over a 700 metre strike extent by trenching results including: DLT003 - 11.15 metres at 9.60g t: DLT004 - 4 metres at 1.60g t: DLT005 - 4.5 metres at 7.54g t: DLT006 - 7.45 metres at 1.98g t and 6.2 metres at 7.59g t: DLT008 - 18 metres at 0.68g t: and DLT009 - 2 metres at 5.69g t. This was confirmed by an initial five hole, 1 000 metre diamond drill core programme which returned the following results: DLD001 - 9.83 metres at 1.80g t from 77 metres : DLD002 - 12.44 metres at 5.07g t from 177 metres including 7.00 metres at 8.19g t: DLD003 - 3.00 metres at 1.80g t: and DLD004 - 3.8 metres at 4.80g t. Mineralisation is hosted within a package of schists, strongly sheared and altered by silica-sericite-iron and disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite.
RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 69 Composite 54-79 Exploration R 3 25 10 8:40 AM Page 17 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K Additional RAB drilling returned positive results: Firstly on a line 200 metres north of diamond drill hole DLD002, DLRB005 returned 6 metres at 2.49g t, DLRB006 - 6 metres at 1.98g t and DLRB010.3 metres at 3.00g t. The second line was drilled approximately two kilometres to the south of the known mineralisation testing a plus 250ppb gold in soil anomaly.
RAB hole DLRB030 returned 21 metres at 4.87g t. The target will be remodelled and a drill motivation prepared to further test Delaya.
Sofia Sofia is part of a 7 kilometre anomalous north-south structural corridor which also hosts the Mikona, Majiva and Matiba targets within ground held by Randgold.
This system continues to the north for an additional 10 kilometres and hosts the Niakafiri deposit owned by Oromin and the Sabodala deposit MDL.
So far 3.4 kilometres of strike have been tested by drilling.
Results have returned both broad low grade 44 metres at 2g t mineralisation and narrow high grade 6 metres at 9.5g t intercepts.
At present the inter-hole spacing is 400 to 600 metres which will be infilled during the next round of drilling.
Bambaraya At Bambaraya, trenching and early stage drilling has defined two sub-parallel zones of mineralisation at surface, over a strike length of one kilometre.
The best trench intersections returned are: BBTR001 - 13.2 metres at 3.59g t: BBTR002 - 18 metres at 2.93g t: BBTR003 - 8 metres at 4.5g t: BBTR004 - 12 metres at 4.06g t and 4 metres at 5.48g t: BBTR006 - 14 metres at 2.01g t and 9.5 metres at 1.13g t: BBTR010 - 16 metres at 1.70g t: and BBTR007 - 18 metres at 2.26g t. To date only three diamond drill holes have tested this zone, with BBDDH002 returning the best intersection of 12 metres at 3.17g t. Mineralisation is hosted within northeast trending pillow basalts and is associated with  carbonate-pyrite alteration.
Exploration work has been completed to the northeast of the known mineralisation where a felsic intrusive has intruded the structure.
Rock chip samples returned 38.6g t from the intrusives and 105.0g t, 2.12g t, 1.86g t, 1.29g t, 1.15g t and 0.6g t from quartz veins within the intrusive.
This target will be reviewed in light of its location relative to Massawa.
CTE DIVOIRE Randgold has proved time and again that successful exploration is based on the foundations of a good geological framework.
However, this needs constant review and updating as new data is acquired.
For example, the geological interpretation of the Loulo district has been revised five times in the last 10 years, most recently following the completion of the airborne electromagnetic survey which led to the discovery of the Gounkoto deposit.
Similarly in Senegal a revision of the geology and target reprioritisation led to the discovery of Massawa.
Consequently, in the Cte dIvoire, a complete review of all layers of data Landsat, Aster, airborne geophysics, geology, regolith, geochemistry and drilling was integrated to formulate a new geological interpretation of the Nielle permit together with a prospectivity analysis and reprioritisation of targets.
Nielle In broad terms, the Nielle permit is underlain by a north-northeast trending Birimian volcanisedimentary belt, known as the Senoufo Belt.
The margins of this belt are variably tectonised granitoid bodies referred to as granitoid gneisses.
The western contact between the granitoid gneiss basement and the volcano-sedimentary belt is marked by a large scale arcuate terrane boundary.
Several gabbros have intruded along this boundary, annealing the contact.
The eastern contact is represented by a very strong mylonitic shear, termed the Oleo Shear, which can be traced for several hundred kilometres.
The belt is cored, in the central area, by buttresses of competent, structurally dissected and rheologically diverse lithologies which collectively form the Competent Core.
Lithologically this comprises a fold and thrust package of basalt and tuff, RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 70 Composite
