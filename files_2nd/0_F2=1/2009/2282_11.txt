These materials frequently operate at temperatures approaching their melting point heat treatment, HIP and the use of surface technology allows these blades to operate reliably at these high temperatures for extended periods of time.

fettled to remove casting material This superalloy gives superior strength at high working temperatures The blades are precipitation hardened to increase their strength at high temperatures The blade castings are HIPed to remove porosity and increase their creep and fatigue resistant properties Honeycomb for abradable seals is vacuum brazed onto the vanes main sections A thermally sprayed coating is applied to improve temperature resistance Finally, the blades are machined prior to their assembly as part of an engine BODYCOTE COMPONENT JOURNEYS This is just one example of how Bodycote brings together the huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group to provide the vital engineering services you need...
