Oil derivative 1,813 1,813 Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 900 900 Forward currency contracts undesignated 4,170 4,170 Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available-for-sale financial assets and forward currency contracts.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and collars have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings are equivalent to their amortised costs determined as the present value of discounted future cash flows using the effective interest rate.
The Company considers that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, other current and non-current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table.
Fair value hierarchy The following financial instruments are measured at fair value using the hierarchy below for determination and disclosure of their respective fair values: Tier 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities Tier 2: Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on all observation data directly or indirectly Tier 3: Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on unobservable market data Financial statements 128 129 Notes to the consolidated Petrofac Annual report Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2009 and accounts 2009 financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2009 Proportion of nominal 33 Subsidiaries and joint ventures value of issued shares At 31 December 2009, the group had investments in the following subsidiaries and incorporated joint ventures: controlled by the group Proportion of nominal value of issued shares Name of company Country of incorporation 2009 2008 controlled by the group Trading subsidiaries continued Name of company Country of incorporation 2009 2008 SPD Group Limited British Virgin Islands 51 51 Trading subsidiaries SPD UK Limited Scotland 51 51 Petrofac Inc.
