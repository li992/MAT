The reduction in CVA held against exposures to other counterparties was primarily driven by a reduction in counterparty risk due to the tightening of credit spreads.

The trades with monoline insurers are predominantly denominated in US dollars, and the strengthening of sterling against the US dollar during 2009 has further reduced the exposure.
The overall level of CVA has decreased, in line with the reduction in exposure to these counterparties.
However, relative to the exposure to monoline counterparties, the CVA has increased from 52% to 62% due to a combination of wider credit spreads and lower recovery rates.
These moves have been driven by deterioration in the credit quality of the monoline insurers as evidenced by rating downgrades as shown in the table on the following page, together with the Groups exposure to monoline insurers by asset category.
RWAs Counterparty and credit RWAs relating to risk structures incorporating gross monoline exposures increased from 7.3 billion to 13.7 billion over the year.
The increase was driven by revised credit risk assessments of these counterparties in the first nine months of the year, partially off-set by reductions in the last quarter due to restructuring.

Key points Realised losses arising from restructuring certain exposures, together with the impact of the US dollar weakening against sterling, are the primary components of the 3.3 billion above.
The net loss arising from the reclassification of debt securities is due to the difference between impairment losses on these available-for-sale securities and the gains that would have been reported in the income statement if these assets had continued to be accounted for as held-fortrading.
The Group also has indirect exposures to monoline insurers through credit enhancement.
Any deterioration in the credit rating of the monoline wrapped securities and other assets with credit enhancement provided is reflected in the fair value of these assets.

The trades with CDPCs are predominantly US and Canadian dollar denominated, and the strengthening of sterling against the US dollar has further reduced the exposure, partially off-set by the weakening of sterling against the Canadian dollar.
The overall level of CVA decreased, in line with the reduction in exposure to these counterparties, however on a relative basis the CVA increased from 27% to 39%.
This reflects the perceived deterioration of the credit quality of the CDPCs as reflected by ratings down-grades.
Further analysis of the Groups exposure to CDPCs by counterparty credit rating is shown in the following table.

As the exposure to these CDPCs has reduced, losses have been incurred on the additional hedges.
These losses, together with losses arising on trades hedging CVA, are the primary components of the 1.8 billion above.

These losses, together with realised losses from counterparty defaults, are the primary cause of the loss arising on foreign exchange, hedges, realisations and other movements.
The net income statement effect was driven by updates to the CVA methodology, hedges and realised defaults off-setting CVA movements.
The primary update applied to the CVA methodology reflected a market wide shift in the approach to pricing and managing counterparty risk.
The methodology change related to the calculation of the probability of default.
The basis for this calculation moved from a blended market implied and historic measure to the market implied methodology set out above.
Other updates to the methodology were made to reflect the correlation between exposure and counterparty risk.
Prior to the update to the CVA methodology, CVA moves driven by changes to the historic element of the blended measure were not hedged, resulting in losses during the year arising from related CVA increases.
The CVA is calculated on a portfolio basis and reflects an estimate of the losses that will arise across the portfolio due to counterparty defaults.
It is not possible to perfectly hedge the risks driving the CVA and this leads to differences between CVA and hedge movements.
Differences also arise between realised default losses and the proportion of CVA held in relation to individual counterparties.

Furthermore, secondary prices of leveraged loans traded fell due to selling pressure and margins increasing, as well as reduced activity in the primary market.
During 2009 the Groups sterling exposure has declined, largely as a result of the weakening of the US dollar and euro against sterling during the period.
There have also been a number of credit impairments and write-offs during 2009, including some names which the Group previously held as part of its syndicate portfolio.
Early repayments as a result of re-financings have further reduced the exposure.

The majority of these funding sources, managing specific risk concentrations, and achieving vehicles are not consolidated by the Group, as it is not exposed to the capital efficiency.
