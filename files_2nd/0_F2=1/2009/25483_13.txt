Risk and governance Risk management Equity and investment risk in the banking book Equity and investment risk description Equity and investment risk in the banking book arises primarily from the following activities conducted within the group: Investment Banking Principal Investments Private Equity and Direct Investments : Investments are selected based on the track record of management, the attractiveness of the industry and the ability to build value for the existing business by implementing an agreed strategy.
In addition, as a result of our local market knowledge and investment banking expertise, we are well positioned to take direct positions in listed shares where we believe that the market is mispricing the value of the underlying portfolio of assets.
These investment positions are carefully researched with the intent to stimulate corporate activity.
In South Africa, we also continue to pursue opportunities to help create and grow black owned and controlled companies.
Lending transactions within the Private Banking and Capital Markets divisions : The manner in which we structure certain transactions results in equity, warrant and pro t shares being held, predominantly within unlisted companies.
Property Activities: We source development, investment and trading opportunities to create value and trade for pro t within agreed risk parameters.
Central Funding: In South Africa the Central Funding division is the custodian of certain equity and property investments, which have largely arisen from corporate acquisitions made, notably in the early 2000s.
Management of equity and investment risk As equity and investment risk arise from a variety of activities conducted by us, the monitoring and measurement thereof varies across transactions and or type of activity.

This would not cause the group to report a loss but could have a signi cantly negative impact on earnings for that period.
The probability of all these asset classes in all geographies in which we operate being negatively impacted at the same time is very low, although the probability of listed equities being negatively impacted at the same time is very high.
Capital requirements In terms of Basel II capital requirements, unlisted and listed equities within the banking book are represented under the category of Equity Risk and investment properties, pro t shares and embedded derivatives are considered in the calculation of capital required for credit risk.
