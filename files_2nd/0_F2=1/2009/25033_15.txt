IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 24 Group Operating and Financial Review Key performance indicators The Chief Executives Report provides an overall assessment of the Groups progress during the year and prospects for the future.
The directors have assessed that the following key performance indicators, together with revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share, are the most effective measures of progress towards achieving the Groups strategies and as such towards fulfilling the Groups business objectives.
Increase 2009 2008 decrease % Financial Number of clients dealing 88,336 56,291 56.9% Average revenue per client 2,495 3,064 18.6% Number of accounts opened 61,538 42,693 44.1% Number of accounts dealing for the first time 44,291 29,211 51.6% Sport Number of clients dealing 19,246 15,860 21.3% Number of accounts opened 13,309 10,401 28.0% Number of accounts dealing for the first time 10,661 8,102 31.6% Volatility of daily revenue Coefficient of variability at 31 May 0.37 0.53 30.1% Average for the year 0.51 0.55 7.3% Highest in year 0.70 0.69 1.4% Lowest in year 0.36 0.45 20.0% FXOnline has been excluded to aid the year on year comparison.
Including FXOnline: the number of clients dealing was 112,282: the average revenue per client was 2,212: the number of accounts opened was 74,331: the number of accounts dealing for the first time was 50,364.
Number of clients dealing Revenue is determined to a significant extent by the number of clients dealing.
The number of financial clients dealing increased by 57% compared with the previous year.
This reflects the underlying growth of the business driven by increased penetration of new and existing markets.
In addition, increased levels of market volatility seen during the year will have encouraged clients to trade.
For example, the Vix Volatility Index rose from 19.8 on 1 June 2008 to 89.5 in October 2008, a record month for both revenue and number of clients trading.
The number of sports clients dealing directly with IG increased by 21% compared with the previous year.
Average revenue per financial client Average revenue per financial client total revenue divided by the number of clients dealing varies significantly for different products and geographies.
The 19% reduction in the overall average reflects changes in the business mix during the year and the impact of market volatility.
The extraordinary levels of market volatility, in particular during the three months ended November 2008, led to record levels of client recruitment and a spike in the number of clients dealing.
The newly recruited clients trading during this period have tended to churn at a higher rate than normally experienced, having a detrimental impact on the simple average.
Number of accounts opened and dealing for the first time Over the long term, the growth of IGs client base is a key driver of revenue growth.
The number of accounts opened and the number of accounts dealing for the first time in the financials business increased by 44% and 52% respectively compared with the previous year and are leading indicators of future prospects.
The increases seen in the financials business reflect international diversification and the favourable impact of sustained high levels of market volatility which drives account opening and encourages clients to trade.
Volatility of daily revenue The coefficient of variability of daily revenue is a statistical measure of the volatility of the Groups revenue from day to day.
The Group calculates this as the 60-day standard deviation of daily revenues divided by the 60-day mean.
Over recent years the coefficient of variability has been consistently low reflecting the Groups policy of maintaining low volatility of its revenues and thus maintaining high quality of earnings.
The Group has a formal risk policy which includes limits, or a methodology for setting limits for every single financial market which the Group trades.
Despite greatly increased volatility in financial markets during the year, coefficient of volatility has continued the past trend and fallen year on year.
IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Group Operating and Financial Review 25 Key performance indicators continued EBITDA and EBITDA margin EBITDA represents earnings before exceptional administrative costs, depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets, amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation, amounts written off property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, taxation, interest payable on debt and interest receivable on corporate cash balances and includes interest receivable on clients balances less interest payable to clients.
The net interest receivable on client balances is considered to be part of the normal activities of the Group and is therefore included in EBITDA.
EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
The Groups capital structure changed significantly in September 2003 when the Company raised significant debt and preference shares in order to finance the purchase of IG Group plc by IG Group Holdings plc.
This acquisition gave rise to significant goodwill.
The Groups capital structure changed again in May 2005 when this debt and preference shares were repaid at the time of the Companys initial public offering IPO.
To facilitate comparison of business performance over time the Group uses EBITDA as a primary profit measure.
The Group seeks to achieve rapid growth in EBITDA, and bonuses for most staff other than directors of the Company are linked to EBITDA.
2009 2008 000 000 Operating profit 102,450 83,350 Net interest on client balances 7,600 10,221 Depreciation 5,402 4,016 Amortisation of intangible assets 984 782 Amortisation of intangible assets arising on consolidation 14,613 Amounts written off property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 37 124 EBITDA 131,086 98,493 EBITDA margin 51.0% 53.5% EBITDA for the year was 131.1m, a 33% increase on the prior year.
This growth was driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by a substantial increase in the charge for impairment of trade receivables leading to a reduced EBITDA margin in the year under review to 51.0% from 53.5%.
EBITDA margin in the second half of the year increased to 54.2% from 47.7% in the first half, reflecting a much reduced impairment of trade receivables charge in the second half of the year following changes made to reduce client credit risk.
Earnings per share The Group seeks to maximise the growth in earnings per share over time in order to maximise shareholder value.
The Groups Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs and directors bonuses are linked to growth in diluted adjusted earnings per share and growth in the Companys share price.
Further details of LTIPs and directors bonuses are set out in the directors remuneration report and note 25 to the financial statements.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share were 24.74p compared with 20.28p in the previous year, an increase of 22.0%.
In order to facilitate comparison of performance between periods the Group uses diluted adjusted earnings per share EPS as its primary measure of EPS.
Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted earnings divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue and to be issued.
Adjusted earnings comprise earnings excluding amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation net of taxation and minority interests.
The directors consider that the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended 31 May 2005 and prior does not fully reflect changes in the Groups capital structure referred to above.
In order to facilitate comparison of performance over the periods to 31 May 2005, normalised earnings per share was established.
Normalised earnings per share were not calculated for the year ended 31 May 2006 or subsequently.
Normalised earnings per share represents earnings adjusted for normalising items, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue and to be issued, adjusted for normalising items.
Normalising adjustments to earnings comprise the impact, net of tax, of exceptional administrative costs, interest and charges on debt finance, redeemable preference share interest payable and tax items relating to the financing structure.
Normalising adjustments to the number of shares comprise the impact of restating the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue prior to a subdivision and re-designation on 31 May 2005 to the equivalent weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the period and treating the issue of new ordinary shares at the time of the Companys flotation as if it had taken place prior to 1 June 2002.
