54-79 Exploration R 3 25 10 8:40 AM Page 5 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K Additional targets The exploration team has been providing the mine with critical ounces from satellite deposits, which have enabled the mine to meet its budget in spite of the slower than anticipated underground build up, and this type of target remains a priority for exploration.
A range of targets at various stages of development exists around the Loulo plant and exploration will focus on those with the highest potential to deliver surface ounces, following the completion of the current work at Loulo 3.
These include: Loulo 1, PQ10, Bolibanta, Baboto and Yalea Structure L3-P125 Gap.
Gounkoto In May 2009, Randgold announced the discovery of a new multi-million ounce gold deposit at Gounkoto, in the southern half of the Loulo mining permit.
The target was initially identified from an airborne electromagnetic survey.
Subsequent soil sampling returned a two kilometre long, north-northwest trending plus 30ppb gold in soil anomaly.
Initial follow-up work consisted of lithosampling which returned a number of strongly mineralised results 24.6g t, 83.8g t, 48.6g t and 7.3g t. These locations were subsequently trenched and results confirmed the prospectivity of LOULO PERMIT SOUTH: GOLD the target FRT03 - 9.70 metres at 15.26g t and FRT05 - 35.75 metres at 10.66g t. DEPOSITS AND TARGETS Two reconnaissance diamond drill holes were completed, one kilometre apart, with the first being the discovery hole, FRDH01, drilled under FRT05, which intersected 46.60 metres at 13.63g t from 65.70 metres.
The company moved quickly to progress the project and a further seven diamond drill holes were drilled, confirming Gounkoto as a significant new discovery.
This was followed up with a third phase of drilling nine RC holes and 12 diamond drill Falm River Falm River holes and provided sufficient data to calculate an inferred mineral resource of SENEGAL Toronto MALI 13.1 million tonnes at a grade of 6.29g t for 2.65 million ounces.
A positive scoping study was subsequently completed and the Randgold board approved its progress to prefeasibility.
In the fourth quarter of 2009 a total of 58 diamond drill holes for P64 12 878 metres and 18 RC holes for 1 300 metres were completed, reducing the inter hole spacing to 50 metres by 50 metres.
The preparation of a prefeasibility study is in progress and due for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2010.
Gounkoto Updated mineral resources have been calculated and consist of 8.4 million tonnes at 7.28g t for 1.96 million ounces of indicated mineral resources and 4.75 million tonnes at 6.00g t for 0.92 million ounces of inferred mineral resources.
Faraba The host rocks to the Gounkoto mineralisation are a sequence of fine grained 2 000m arkoses which have suffered an early silica carbonate alteration event.
A suite of Rare Earth Elements REE at Gounkoto suggests a similar fluid to Gara with a possible magmatic component.
More than 95% of the sulphide is pyrite with minor arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite and additionally gold tellurides are present.
These tellurides also exist at Faraba and other southern targets.
Mineralisation is bounded by a hangingwall shear and footwall mylonite.
In the hangingwall there is a prominent limestone unit which is a good marker horizon.
Mineralisation, which trends north-northwest, has been confirmed over a strike length of 1.3 kilometres and down to vertical depths of 255 metres.
The geometry varies along the strike: in the south it shallows near surface and fingers out, while at depth the dip steepens: at the inflexion point, high grade mineralisation concentrates.
Towards the centre of the deposit mineralisation steepens to an almost vertical dip and the hangingwall and footwall structures close up before dilating again in the north.
To the north, mineralisation links from one north-northwest structure, to a second sub-parallel structure.
Mineralisation is open in all directions.
To the north the last drill hole GKDH145 returned 4.55 metres at 7.48g t, to the south GKDH018 returned 18.7 metres at 9.12g t, while at depth GKDH029 returned 49.6 metres at 13.73g t and GKDH105 returned 67.4 metres at 5.76g t.
