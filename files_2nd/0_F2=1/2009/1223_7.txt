Industry dynamics as ARM gains market share ARM has a different share in each of its target end-markets.
However, ARM has observed broadly similar dynamics in each end-market as our customers increase penetration.
In some applications pioneers need support as they enter a new market for the first time.
In other markets ARM technology has gradually become accepted as a universal platform enabling our customers freedom to innovate and diversify.
ARM gaining market share benefits the whole ecosystem from chip developers to software engineers to consumers.
