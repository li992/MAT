The table below presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of 13 years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases is also shown in the table below.
Income from Funds and Joint Ventures is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction.

Further liquidity can be achieved through sales of property assets or investments and debt refinancings.
