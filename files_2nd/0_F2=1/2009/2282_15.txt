Our bones, effectively composites, absorb such stresses regularly and effectively for much of our lifetime.
When joints fail, they are often replaced with metal alloy implants.
These implants must be incredibly strong, biocompatible, and able to last the lifetime of the patient.
A combination of heat treatment, hot isostatic pressing and surface technology makes this possible.
