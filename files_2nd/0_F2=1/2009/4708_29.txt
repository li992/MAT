Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information 61 Business review Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 27 August 2009: This has been a very challenging year.
Overall however our results demonstrate the resilience of our business.
Our brand range and our geographic reach enabled us to deliver 4% organic operating profi t growth and 10% eps growth.
While the economic downturn has aff ected all markets, the response of customers and consumers has not been uniform and therefore the impact on our business has been varied.
By region, International, North America and Asia Pacifi c have been stronger than Europe.
By category, we have delivered growth in categories which account for over 50% of our sales, primarily vodka, rum, tequila and beer.
The gin and wine categories have been weaker and scotch and liqueurs have been most impacted by fide-stocking.
Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Jos Cuervo and Guinness, two of our three largest local priority brands, Buchanans and Windsor, and category brands, Croc, Cacique and Harp, all grew supported by innovation and eff ective marketing.
We benefi ted from the addition of Ketel One vodka, Zacapa rum and Rosenblum Cellars wine, all of which have broadened our brand range in important categories.
Johnnie Walker faced a tougher market environment being at a relatively higher price point and saw more impact from fide-stocking.
The consumer downturn in Spain and fide-stocking in a number of markets also aff ected the performance of Baileys.
We took action quickly to manage these diffi cult times, reducing our cost base and refocusing marketing spend as consumer trends changed.
In the year ending 30 June 2010 we will benefi t from cost reductions of 120 million as a result of our global restructuring initiative.
While the global economy appears to be stabilising, there is still uncertainty as to the sustainability and pace of any recovery and the next fi financial year will be challenging, as we lap a strong fi first quarter and a reasonable fi first half performance this year.
That being recognised, we expect to deliver low single digit organic operating profi t growth in the year ending 30 June 2010.

Free cash fl ow decreased by 48 million to 1,204 million in the year ended 30 June 2009.
Cash generated from operations increased from 2,305 million to 2,626 million in the year ended 30 June 2009.

Tax payments were higher in the year ended 30 June 2009 than in the comparative year primarily as a result of settlements agreed with tax authorities in the year ended 30 June 2009.

Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Business review 63 Borrowings The group policy with regard to the expected maturity profi le of borrowings of group fi nancing companies is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, it is group policy to maintain backstop facility terms from relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
The groups net borrowings and gross borrowings in the tables below are measured at amortised cost with the exception of borrowings designated in fair value relationships, interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards.
For borrowings designated in fair value relationships, Diageo recognises a fair value adjustment to the risk being hedged in the balance sheet, whereas interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards are measured at fair value.
Net borrowings, reported on this basis, comprise the following: Year ended 30 June 2009 2008 2007 million million million Overdrafts 68 31 46 Other borrowings due within one year 822 1,632 1,489 Borrowings due within one year 890 1,663 1,535 Borrowings due between one and three years 1,537 802 1,209 Borrowings due between three and fi five years 2,747 1,765 1,206 Borrowings due after fi five years 3,401 2,978 1,717 Fair value of foreign currency swaps and forwards 170 29 29 Fair value of interest rate hedging instruments 93 27 20 Finance leases 21 9 14 Gross borrowings 8,333 7,161 5,730 Off set by: Cash and cash equivalents 914 714 885 Net borrowings 7,419 6,447 4,845 Based on average monthly net borrowings and interest charge, the eff ective interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2009 was 6.2% 2008 5.9%: 2007 5.5%.
For this calculation, the interest charge excludes fi finance charges unrelated to net borrowings, the forward element on derivative fi financial instruments and fair value adjustments to borrowings.
Designated net borrowings in net investment hedge relationships amounted to 5,266 million as at 30 June 2009 2008 5,396 million: 2007 4,624 million.
