Our global network has evolved steadily over the years, with offices opening only when local market conditions were favourable and we were ready to make our move.
In much the same way, all our leading managers have grown within the company, progressing and earning promotions at the right time, leading to long and fruitful careers within Michael Page.
These talented people are sent around the Michael Page world, tasked with spreading their influence and bringing the unique Michael Page culture and principles to every office, in every country we serve.
The map below shows just some of the moves our management team have made to ensure we grow our business organically and consistently.
