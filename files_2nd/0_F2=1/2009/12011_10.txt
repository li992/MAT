PBITA, PBT AND RETURN ON EqUITY PBITA and PBT are key overall measures of Viridors performance and are set out in the table below for the nine-year period 2001 to 2009.
The table also sets out the Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR for these measures, being the rate of growth between 2001 and 2009 expressed as a single annual average figure over the period.
Return on equity is also a key measure of Viridors performance and is calculated as PBT expressed as a percentage of Pennon Groups equity investment in Viridor 207 million at 31 March 2009.

12 Pennon Group Annual Report and Accounts There is scope for a major increase in the amount of energy recovered from waste in the UK particularly in EfW facilities especially with CHP as well as in developing technologies such as AD.
The Institution of Civil Engineers has estimated that waste could theoretically account for up to 17% of total UK electricity production.
The Institution of Mechanical Engineers has recently published a similar estimate.
Even if these are over-estimates it is still clear that waste can make a major contribution to the UKs future energy needs.
As the UK increasingly relies on imports of energy and seeks to grow its output of renewable energy, Viridors growing power generation business is expected to become an increasingly valuable asset.
Gas produced from decomposing waste on landfill sites is increasingly used The need for councils to avoid steeply increasing landfill tax and to achieve to generate electricity.
It is a form of renewable energy and now represents their landfill diversion targets creates attractive opportunities for PFI 24% of the UKs total renewable energy generation with EfW representing PPP contracts.
Examples include Viridors contracts with West Sussex, a further 6% according to Defra.
The Governments stated strategy is to Somerset, Greater Manchester and the South London Waste Partnership, increase the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources facilities such as the Lakeside EfW plant and the Runcorn EfW CHP plants from the current figure of around 5% to a target of 10% in 2010 and 15% and recycling operations such as Viridors resource management and in 2015.
