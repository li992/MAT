Morila is owned by a Malian company, Socit des Mines fide Morila SA Morila, which in turn is owned 80% by Morila Limited and 20% by the Malian government.
Morila Limited is jointly owned by Randgold and AngloGold Ashanti Limited and the mine is controlled by a 50:50 joint venture management committee.
Responsibility for the day-to-day operations rests with Randgold.
As planned, the mine was converted in April 2009 from open pit mining to a 100% stockpile treatment operation.
Gold production for the year was 342 000 ounces, 3% ahead of budgeted production.
Total cash cost for the year was US$480 per ounce, including stockpile adjustments of US$98 per ounce.
The mine successfully completed a rightsizing exercise as part of the cost saving initiatives to ensure that it continued to be a positive cash generator for the rest of its life, which is anticipated to continue until 2013.
Consequently, despite the drop in grade associated with processing the stockpiles, the mine still reported US$166.7 million in profits from mining activity and paid US$155 million to its shareholders.
