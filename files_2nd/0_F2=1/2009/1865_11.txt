Business and General Aviation We are focused primarily on servicing aircraft in the business and general aviation B&GA fl fleet, which is impacted by the levels of fl ying activity and, in particular, the number of hours fl own.
Deliveries of new aircraft give us an indication of future fl fleet growth and demand for services, and the proportion of the B&GA fl fleet available for sale is a medium term indicator of demand.
Following 15 years of sustained growth in traditionally cyclical B&GA fl ying hours, there was a severe decline in this, our major market, in 2008 and 2009.
At the trough of the US market in the fi first half of 2009 the monthly decline in B&GA movements from the 2007 peak reached 34%.
The European market followed a similar pattern although the peak to trough decline was marginally lower at 23%.
The rate of decline moderated during the second half of 2009 with an overall 19% decline in US market activity compared to 2008.
There was evidence at the end of 2009 that B&GA fl ying activity is beginning to recover as utilisation rates start to rise and the number of new and second hand business jets for sale is gradually falling.
The period from 2004 to 2008 saw unprecedented growth in the production of business aircraft.
The economic turmoil resulted in a sharp decline in the number of business aircraft deliveries in 2009.
External industry analysts are projecting further reductions until 2011 2012 and the peak levels of business aircraft sales seen in 2007 and 2008 will not be seen again until the middle of this decade.
However, even at these reduced delivery levels the fl fleet continues to grow in absolute terms, and analysts expect that approximately 12,000 business aircraft will be built over the next nine years, which represents a 28% expansion of the existing fl fleet net of retirements.

A small number of Very Light Jets VLJs were delivered in 2009, mainly Cessna Mustangs and Embraer Phenom 100s, which we believe confi rms our view that VLJs will remain an interesting but small segment of the fl fleet.
External analysts expect that over the next 10 years in excess of 50% of new plane deliveries will be outside North America and the rate of growth of European, Asian and the Middle Eastern fl eets is likely to exceed that of North America.
However, with the continued absolute growth in fl fleet size and much higher utilisation rates compared to the rest of the world, North America will remain a growing market and by far the largest market for B&GA fl ying activity for the foreseeable future.

Commercial aviation travel is increasingly challenging, with ageing infrastructure, further inconvenience and commercial pressures reducing fl ights to regional destinations.
Investment in intermodal alternatives is limited and uneconomic.
We therefore look forward to both cyclical recovery in B&GA fl ying hours and to the return of long-term growth.
Commercial Aviation Our commercial aviation service business is focused on providing value added services to commercial aviation providers.
Our market is driven by commercial aviation movements.
2009 was a challenging year for commercial aviation.
The global economic recession has driven a signifi cant reduction in commercial traffi c. Airlines have responded by mothballing a signifi cant proportion of the commercial fl fleet and reducing fl ight capacity.
They have also reduced costs through layoff s and downsizing.
Military Aviation Our military aviation service businesses focus primarily on the support of legacy military platforms.
Whilst there was some evidence of fide-stocking of the aftermarket supply chain, US military spending remained fairly robust in 2009.
The recession in the USA and its impact on tax revenues may mean that defence spending is no longer immune to cuts.
However, given that it is anticipated that there will be limited change to mission requirements for the foreseeable future, it is likely that this will lead to legacy platforms remaining in service longer which would have a positive eff ect on those products which our businesses support.
