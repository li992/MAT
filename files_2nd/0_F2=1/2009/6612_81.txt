Performance Share Plan PSP awards Performance share awards are made to Executive Directors on an annual basis.

The Committee adjusted the comparator group by removing Schering-Plough and Wyeth following their fide-listing during 2009, and revised the vesting schedule accordingly.
For outstanding and future awards, TSR performance will be measured against the revised comparator group including GSK, as set out below.
Dividends are reinvested on the performance shares awarded to Executives, throughout the performance period and up to the date of the final award.
The dividend reinvestment is calculated as of the dividend payment date.
Under the terms of the PSP, US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
