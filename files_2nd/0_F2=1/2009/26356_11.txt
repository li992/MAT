Total income decreased by 154 million, or 8 per cent, to 1,830 million from lower business volumes on assets held under operating leases, lower insurance income in the Personal Finance business due to the move to a monthly premium product, as well as reduced new business volumes.
This was offset in part by margin improvement across the consumer finance businesses.
Operating expenses decreased by 362 million, or 20 per cent, to 1,458 million, reflecting the impact of lower business volumes reducing depreciation charges on assets held under operating lease, year-on-year improvement in used car values and cost savings achieved from integration.
Impairment losses increased by 422 million to 828 million, reflecting increases in impairment in both the retail and non-retail consumer finance businesses.
In retail consumer finance, impairment increases reflected both the increase in the number of customers going into arrears and changes in the expected recovery rates on the defaulted second lien portfolio resulting from house price deflation, which has now stabilised.
The business has also seen a significant increase in the number of corporate failures within its non-retail books which have also caused an increase in the impairment charge.

ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS A bottom-up approach is used to determine the economic assumptions for valuing the business in order to determine a market consistent valuation.
The results for the HBOS Life, Pensions and Investments business have been restated from those previously published and have been produced using the market consistent economic assumptions adopted by Scottish Widows.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds.
In accordance with the approach adopted in December 2008, the value of the in-force business asset for annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of these corporate bond holdings.
For December 2008 onwards, the risk-free rate assumed in valuing the non-annuity in-force business is the 15 year government bond yield for the appropriate territory.
The risk-free rate assumed in valuing the in-force asset for the UK annuity business is presented as a single risk-free rate to allow a better comparison to the rate used for other business.
That single risk-free rate has been derived to give the equivalent value to the UK annuity book, had that book been valued using the UK gilt yield curve increased to reflect the illiquidity premium described above.
The risk-free rate used in valuing financial options and guarantees in the Scottish Widows With Profit Fund is defined as the spot yield derived from the UK gilt yield curve.
A similar approach is taken to valuing the financial options and guarantees in the HBOS Life, Pensions and Investments business.
The table below shows the range of resulting yields and other key assumptions.

8 Under a market consistent valuation, changes in assumed equity and property returns have no impact on the EEV.
9 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in corporate bond yields and the corresponding reduction in market values.
Government bond yields, the risk-free rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged.
10 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 10 basis point increase in the allowance for illiquidity premium.
It assumes that the overall corporate bond spreads are unchanged and hence market values are unchanged.
Government bond yields and the non-annuity risk-free rate are both assumed to be unchanged.
The increased illiquidity premium increases the annuity risk-free rate.
In sensitivities 4 to 7 and 9 assumptions have been flexed on the basis used to calculate the value of in-force business and the realistic and statutory reserving bases.
A change in risk discount rates is not relevant as the risk discount rate is not an input to a market consistent valuation.

Claims were 156 million higher than 2008, primarily due to higher payment protection insurance claims related to unemployment.
This also reflects the reclassification of Lloyds TSB Insurance Claims Handling expenses into claims paid in 2009.
Whilst property claims were impacted by flooding and freeze claims in the final quarter of the year, benefits from ongoing investments in claims processes continue to be realised.
Against the background of a particularly competitive market in which the General Insurance business has a leading position, home insurance income generated modest growth of 1 per cent to 874 million.
Payment protection insurance income decreased by 16 million, or 4 per cent, to 349 million as a result of the market wide move to monthly premiums on payment protection, partly offset by lower distribution commission payable to the Retail division.
Other income has reduced, primarily reflecting lower interest rates and the allocation of certain charges.
Operating expenses decreased by 98 million, or 27 per cent, to 262 million.
Adjusting for the reclassification of claims handling expenses into claims paid and non-recurring marketing spend in 2008, costs improved by 10 per cent year-on-year, reflecting continued focus on cost management and cost savings achieved through the integration.
46 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 DIVISIONAL RESULTS GROUP OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Group Operations manages the Groups technology platforms, property estate, operations, procurement services and security.
Through these areas Group Operations drives efficiencies and supports income growth across multiple brands and channels using scalable platforms, common processes and leveraging the Groups purchasing power.
The division operates through four primary business functions: Information Technology: Operations: Procurement and Property.
The Information Technology area provides technological expertise to each area of the Group whilst Operations includes Banking Operations, Collections and Recoveries and Payments and Business Services.
The role of Procurement is to ensure that the Group gets the best value from its external expenditure and strategic suppliers and Property manages and maintains the Groups estates portfolio.
STRATEGY Group Operations aims to be recognised as a world class operations business by colleagues, customers, stakeholders and peers whilst ensuring value through cost and process efficiency.
This will be achieved by providing excellent technology and effective process to support the businesses: driving simplification, automation and continuous improvement: developing world class operations, leadership and capability: and maintaining strong controls to protect the Group.
In addition to this the Integration programme will develop and deliver plans to produce synergy benefits.
The focus throughout 2010 will be to combine systems and process legacies onto a single platform.
This will primarily be achieved by delivering the IT consolidation, a single and centralised operating model, along with excellent disciplined procurement and rationalisation of the property portfolio.
