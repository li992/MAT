As mentioned above, trail commissions are calculated by reference to the management fees BlueBay earns on a product.
Business Review 25 As we have developed our bonus pool methodology we believe the split of compensation charges between a performancebased component and a non-performance based component is no longer useful.
Instead, we present the following components of the compensation which we hope will be more informative: salaries charged to the income statement during the financial year including National Insurance : the current calendar year cash bonus and deferral charge accruals i. e. the total bonuses accrued for the period from 1 January to 30 June each year : the actual cash bonus charge for the prior calendar year that was charged to the current financial year i. e. the total bonuses charged to the Income Statement for the period from 30 June to 31 December : and fixed compensation charges resulting from prior year awards.
As is set in the Remuneration Report on page 41, our intention is to maintain total cash equivalent compensation in any given calendar year in a range of between 40% and 50% of Total Fee Income.
Given the dramatic changes that are currently underway in the mix of our business, we anticipate that the actual ratio for calendar year 2009 is likely to be towards the upper end of this range.
The Summary Group Income Statement set out on page 22 provides the breakdown of the compensation charge for the financial year ended 30 June 2009.
The majority of the increase is due to an increase of 3.9 million in the fixed compensation charge from prior calendar year awards.
A further 2.1 million is due to an increase in salaries which reflected an average headcount that was 9.3% higher during the year ended 30 June 2009 than in the previous financial year.
