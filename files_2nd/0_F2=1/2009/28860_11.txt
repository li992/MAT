Our strategic plan and progress 12 RBS Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Our strategic plan and progress Our strategy is simple and its concepts are well tested in this and other industries.
Its implementation, however, constitutes one of the largest and most far reaching company restructurings yet seen globally.
We aim to remake RBS as one of the worlds most admired, valuable and stable universal banks.
Driven by market-leading businesses in large customer-driven markets, RBS targets a 15% sustainable return on equity from a stable AA category risk profile and balance sheet.
We are concentrating RBS around the competitive strengths we enjoy in each of our Core businesses.
We are focusing on what we are good at and making it better.
At the same time we are reducing our balance sheet, risk and funding exposures through massive restructuring and are reducing both scale and scope in areas where we are not naturally strong.
We are re-engineering cost structures and have embarked on overdue business investment.
Management and cultural change has also been comprehensive.
