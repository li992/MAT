All three wells drilled since 2006 on the Kingfisher field have been successful and found hydrocarbons.
Energy Africa now owned by Tullow farmed-in to the licence in August 2001, acquiring 50% in return for funding a seismic survey and partly funding the costs of a well.
The discovered oil in Block 3A is good o o quality, light between 30 and 32 API and sweet with a low gas-oil ratio and some associated wax.
The reservoirs are highly permeable sandstones with an estimated permeability of up to 3,000 milliDarcies.
In February 2009, the successful Kingfisher- 3A sidetrack completed drilling.
The same three sandstone reservoir intervals were encountered in all of the Kingfisher wells highlighting the continuity and the lateral extent of the reservoirs.
All three Kingfisher wells drilled to date have been suspended as future producers.
A number of other prospects, including the large Pelican and Crane prospects, have been mapped in the lake from various seismic surveys acquired by Heritage.
