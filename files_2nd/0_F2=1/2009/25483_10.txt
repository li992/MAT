Central Services We have a policy of allocating costs housed in the centre that are, in effect, performing a function for the divisions of the group.
There are certain costs that are strategic in nature which have not been allocated for pure segmental disclosure, amounting to 64.1 million 2008: 73.4 million.
However, a portion thereof 53.2 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Refer to page 28 for further details.
Central costs are lower than the prior year mainly due to a decrease in variable remuneration in line with reduced pro tability.
Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained.
Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the speci c financial and strategic requirements the group faces at the time.
The funds raised are applied towards making acquisitions, funding central services and debt obligations, and purchasing corporate assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

- A pro t of 25.8 million 2008: pro t of 23.4 million arising on the derivative hedging of the preferred securities issued by a subsidiary of Investec plc from Euros into Pounds Sterling.
This exposure is hedged with the equal and opposite impact re ected in losses earnings attributable to minorities.
The increase in interest paid on sub-debt is as a result of new debt being issued in South Africa in December 2007, February 2008 and April 2008.
The decline in principal transaction income re ects a lower return on certain of the assets in the South African portfolio.
Furthermore, the division bene ted from a number of realisations in the prior period.
