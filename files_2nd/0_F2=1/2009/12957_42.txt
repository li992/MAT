Tongon is controlled by an Ivorian company, Socit des Mines fide Tongon SA, in which Randgold has an 89% interest, the government of Cte dIvoire 10% and 1% is held by a local Ivorian company.
The Tongon project is located within the Nielle exploration permit in the north of Cte dIvoire, 55 kilometres south of the border with Mali.
GEOLOGY The Tongon deposits are located within the Lower Proterozoic Senoufo Belt, which is a 200 kilometre long, volcanisedimentary belt of greenschist grade metamorphism bounded on either side by variably tectonised granitoid gneiss terraines.
Mineralisation at Tongon is defined in two zones.
In the Northern Zone, the major part of the mineralisation is located within volcaniclastic rocks which have been intruded by granodiorite and diorite intrusives and is bounded by sheared footwall and hangingwall shale units.
The mineralised zone varies in thickness from 3 metres to 35 metres and averages 25 metres in zones of dilation.
The mineralisation is associated with increased silicification, sulphidation and fine brecciation.

RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 34 Composite 32-53 Projects R 3 25 10 8:39 AM Page 4 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K MINERAL RESOURCES AND ORE RESERVES No changes have been made to the mineral resources and mineral reserves models published in 2008, but advanced grade control drilling has now been completed to a 25 metre spacing over the two pits, in preparation for mining.
Changes to reserves are based on updated pit designs including slope optimisations and revised costs together with a higher gold price of US$700 per ounce.
Following additional geotechnical drilling the inpit slope design has been optimised and steepened, resulting in an increase of the mineral reserve.
Open pit resources were reported as those insitu mineral resources falling within a US$1 000 per ounce whittle shell.
During the year Randgold acquired a further 5% interest in the Tongon project, raising its stake in the project to 89%.
METALLURGY AND PLANT DESIGN The metallurgical plant is designed to process 3.6 million tonnes per annum with ores being treated through a primary, secondary and tertiary crushing circuit.
Milling will comprise two ball mills with the discharge from each mill being pumped into separate cyclone feed pump and classifier systems.
A flash flotation circuit will be used to recover floatable gold, with the balance flotation tails gravitating to the ball mills for further size reduction.
A thickener will be used to enhance the control around the milling and classification circuit, as well as ensuring constant feed density to the carbon in leach CIL circuit.
The thickener underflow will be pumped to the leach CIL circuit where gold will be dissolved and adsorbed onto activated carbon.
The resultant CIL tailings slurry will be subjected to tailings thickening to recover the maximum amount of process water containing available unused cyanide, which will reduce the amount of fresh cyanide required for leaching.
A cyanide destruction process will also be incorporated into the process design.
The thickened underflow will be pumped to the tailings storage facility which will be located as a valley fill impoundment, approximately six kilometres to the west of the plant site.
Gold will be recovered from the flotation concentrates through a combination of fine grinding and cyanidation.
The leached tails from the concentrate stream will be combined with the flotation tails as these are fed to the main CIL circuit.
Loaded carbon from the CIL circuit will be acid washed prior to elution, followed by regeneration of the eluted carbon.
Gold will be deposited onto cathodes following electrowinning of the eluate.
The dried gold sludge will be smelted to produce gold The metallurgical plant is designed to dor which will be shipped to the refinery.
Average recoveries over the Life of Mine process 3.6 million tonnes per annum with ores being treated through a primary, are expected to exceed 90%.
secondary and tertiary crushing circuit.
INFRASTRUCTURE The footprint of the mine site has been delineated with the aim of keeping the project area to a minimum.
This reduces the impact on the environment and the local population.
Electrical power will be supplied from the national grid via a dedicated overhead line.
Clearing of the power line corridor has started, with six kilometres of the designated servitude already cleared.
A full back-up power generation plant is also being installed and a total of 12 x 1.2MW generator sets have already arrived at on site at Tongon.
In total there will be 20 x 1.2MW generator sets with a total capacity of 24MW available as back-up power.
The phase 1 water storage dam has been completed to the 320 metre AMSL mark.
For phase 2 of the water storage dam construction, the final wall construction will lift the water spillway height to the 324 metre AMSL mark, resulting in a storage capacity of approximately 35 million cubic metres.
RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 35 Composite 32-53 Projects R 3 25 10 8:39 AM Page 5 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K Construction of all 14 CIL tanks at the Tongon plant has been completed.
After the commissioning and ramp-up of the process plant, the mill feed throughput rate will stabilise at 300 000 tonnes per month.
PRE-PRODUCTION OPERATIONS Setting up the operational aspects of the mine started at the beginning of 2010 and the designated contractor miner, DTP, has started to mobilise to site.
The first of three 9350 Liebherr excavators has arrived and will be assembled by the team on site.
In addition, the first five of 17 CAT777F trucks has arrived in Abidjan.
Other support equipment has also arrived in Abidjan.
DTP are in the process of recruiting approximately 400 personnel, following Randgolds recruitment strategy of locals first, thereafter nationals and then expatriates.
The recruitment process is adhering to three phases namely a learning ability battery test, then interviewing of potential candidates and thereafter, medical examinations.
Operational management personnel have started to mobilise on site and started recruiting 350 personnel, adhering to the same recruitment strategy and hiring process.
DTP is scheduled to move first open pit ground at the end of March 2010.
Prior to this, local contractors are being used to strip vegetation and prepare the pit area for mining.
Low grade mineralised sands are being excavated and stockpiled for first fill and production through the process treatment plant.

Construction of security fencing completed.
3 22 000m of concrete poured to date.
Outer boundaries of the north and south pits cleared with the north pit vegetation cleared and topsoil moved onto the stockpile.
Safety has been excellent and the site has now achieved 2 600 000 man hours without a Lost Time Injury LTI.
To date, 55 single accommodation blocks, each with four rooms, have been built and 12 senior staff units have been completed with another eight senior staff units in various stages of construction.
Over the past 12 months of the main construction programme, expatriate employment has been minimised by using local contracting companies to supply most of the skills needed.
The number of people working on the construction of the mine has grown to 1 680, with 1 120 employed by Tongon construction and the balance by various site contractors.
Eight Ivorian contracting companies are currently on site, performing functions such as welding, pipefitting, civil work, earthmoving and machine hire.
Of the 1 680 workforce, 7.2% are expatriates, which is within the company's original projections and well within the guidelines set by Cte d'Ivoires labour law.
81% have been recruited from the communities around the mine site and the balance from other parts of the country.
PRODUCTION PROFILE The process plant is currently being constructed in two phases, with the first phase being the oxide stream.
The sulphide stream, including the secondary and tertiary crushing stages and concentrate treatment sections, will follow directly after the completion of the oxide stream.
Gold production is estimated at 75 000 ounces in 2010, with first gold still on track for October 2010.
EXPLORATION On the Nielle permit, following the successful conversion of resources to reserves at Tongon, the exploration emphasis has shifted to the discovery of new ounces On the Nielle permit, following the successful close to the existing ore bodies, as well as the development of targets further afield.
conversion of resources to reserves at 2009 was a difficult year for exploration as results were not forthcoming from the Tongon, the exploration emphasis has initial targets evaluated.
Consequently a decision was made to stop field exploration shifted to the discovery of new ounces close and concentrate on reviewing all the data layers, including Landsat, airborne to the existing orebodies, as well as the geophysics, geology, geochemistry, drill data and information from the Tongon development of targets further afield.
This led to a new geological interpretation and the completion of a revised prospectivity analysis.
The results of this study helped to reprioritise targets and a new field programme started after the rainy season.
Positive results were received from four soil grids on new targets and trenching was completed on key targets, including Tongon West and Seydou.
Early indications suggest that Tongon West has the potential to develop into a small low grade resource with results from trenching returning 28 metres at 1.50g t and 38 metres at 1.16g t. At Seydou a first trench, testing a 3.6 kilometre gold in soil anomaly, returned 19 metres at 5.32g t from altered volcaniclastics and consequently further trenching is in progress.
An airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey is currently being flown, not only over the Nielle permit but also the neighbouring Diawala and Fapoha permits to the north and south, which is expected to further aid the geological and structural understanding of the Senoufo Greenstone Belt.
