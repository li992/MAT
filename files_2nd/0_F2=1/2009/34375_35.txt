82 Notes to the Accounts The British Land Company PLC 10 Pensions The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal pension scheme in the Group.
It is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and not contracted out of SERPS.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
Existing entitlements will be retained by the members, with freedom to transfer to a new Defined Contribution Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary and paid by the Company.
In certain circumstances it may be necessary to pay higher contributions when recruiting senior executives.
The Group has five other small pension schemes.
The total net pension cost charged for the year was 4m 2008: 4m, of which 2m 2008: 1m relates to defined contribution plans.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2006 and updated since then annually for accounting purposes by consulting actuaries, Hewitt Associates Ltd.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 48.9% pa of basic salaries.
The best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2010 is 4m.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 5.8 6.0 5.4 4.9 5.3 Salary inflation 4.4 3.4 5.4 5.2 5.1 Pensions increase 2.9 3.4 3.2 3.0 2.9 Price inflation 2.9 5.6 3.2 3.0 2.9 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average to age 89 if they are male and to age 92 if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45 and retires in 2023 at age 60 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 30 years after retirement to age 90 if they are male and for a further 33 years after retirement to age 93 if they are female.

Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the Scheme at 31 March 2009.
