and supply increasing at a lower 2% annual rate, there was a significant reduction in stocks that had built up at the end of the previous year.
Net imports into China grew substantially.
The resumption of rapid economic growth in China fuelled strong domestic demand which, Xstrata Coal secured contract price settlements with Japanese Power coupled with a programme of mine consolidation and closure, led to Utilities for the year commencing 1 April 2009 in the range of $70-$72 domestic coal prices which were higher than international market prices.

These settlements surge in import demand.
As a result, in 2009 China imported 92 million are referenced for contracts with other customers in the Pacic market, tonnes of thermal coal, 173% higher than in 2008.
In addition, Chinas where term and annual contracts represented 65% of Xstrata Coals exports for 2009 fell to 18 million tonnes, a 47% reduction from the thermal coal sales in 2009.

Thermal coal imports under term or annual contracts.
FOB prices, as indicated by the API4 during 2009 were an estimated 56 million tonnes, 49% higher than the index, ranged from $56 to $81 per tonne in 2009.
A significant portion of this demand Outlook was met from South Africa, whose exports to India grew by Strong demand for imported coal from China and India and a recovery in demand from other Asian consumers led to improved conditions in the Pacic coal markets and also supported stronger API4 prices in the final quarter of 2009.
While the spark spread currently favours gas ahead of coal in Europe, the strong growth outlook in Asia, which is attracting Atlantic coal to the Pacic basin, coupled with continuing recovery from the economic slowdown in Atlantic markets suggests a positive outlook for seaborne thermal coal demand in 2010.
In the longer term, coal demand is expected to continue to grow strongly, driven primarily by Asian economies where coal-red power underpins economic growth.
Import demand will grow strongly in economies where current domestic supplies cannot meet demand.
This demand growth prole is not matched by projected supply growth, suggesting a robust long-term outlook for thermal coal markets.
