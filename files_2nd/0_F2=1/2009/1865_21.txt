Legacy Support working together with customers, licensors and other BBA Aviation businesses Providing solutions for aerospace OEMs and airframe operators by taking complete responsibility for their non-core and legacy products and allowing them to focus on current and future programmes is Legacy Supports speciality.
Since joining the BBA Aviation group of companies in 2006, Ontics portfolio of licensed and acquired products has grown signifi cantly and now includes more than 4,000 end item assemblies plus their associated sub-assemblies and components.
Through license or acquisition, Ontic provides all manufacturing, support and maintenance that these products require.
In 2007, Ontic relocated its business to larger premises in its home town of Chatsworth, California creating more space for expansion and an improved working environment for employees and, in 2009, Ontic established a new base in the UK.
Working closely with customers, licensors and, increasingly, using the specifi c product expertise of other BBA Aviation aftermarket businesses, Ontic has obtained major licences in new areas such as landing gear, auxiliary power units and associated components.

For Ontic two signifi cant areas of focus in 2009 have been the adoption in the US of the Honeywell 700 Series Auxiliary Power Unit APU licence and the establishment of a UK presence to support the Kidde Graviner Gaseous Emergency Oxygen Equipment GEOE licence, both signed in 2008.
Both adoptions have proceeded in line with plan and the UK facility is now fully operational and has received all of the required approvals and certifi cations.
The Ontic US order book continues to grow, and at the end of 2009 stood at $56 million, a further 18% increase since the end of 2008.
We continue to see considerable opportunities to grow this business via licence acquisition, particularly in the current climate as OEMs rationalise their product lines in the face of contracting demand for new original equipment.
We are also looking to leverage our new footprint in the UK to extend our licensing model.
