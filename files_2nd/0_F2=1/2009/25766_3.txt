American pp01 18 11 3 10 9:34 am Page 5 Investment Managers Report Market Review For the US stock market, the last 12 months have arguably been one of the most dramatic periods on record.
The first few months of 2009 continued as 2008 had ended with stock prices falling swiftly and the decline continued into early March.
By the time prices bottomed out, investors had witnessed one of the steepest stock market plunges and the worst economic collapses since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Banks largely stopped lending, layoffs soared, fear spread and consumer confidence declined sharply.
The market rebound was equally dramatic.
Driven largely by coordinated efforts by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve to shore up confidence in the financial system and keep credit flowing, stocks, beginning in March, staged a significant relief rally the biggest since the 1930s that spanned the entire US equity spectrum.
By the end of the year, stocks had recouped significant portions of their losses though major indices remained well below their highs set in the autumn of 2007.
In the meantime, the US economy showed signs of life by expanding at an annualised rate of 2.8% in the third quarter, its first increase since the second quarter of 2008 and showed further improvement in the fourth quarter with an annualized 5.7% rate of growth.
Within this volatile market environment, the NAV, despite its 11.6% return, slightly underperformed its benchmark.
Overall Asset Allocation The investment management team is responsible for managing the allocation between the two investment portfolios, together with the levels of cash and gearing.
In recent years your investment team has worked closely with the Board of Directors to develop modelling tools to assist in both asset allocation and gearing decisions.
In 2009, the Companys gearing ranged between 107% and 113% of shareholders funds, with the level at the year end being 111%.
The level of gearing is adjusted at regular intervals within the gearing guidelines laid down by the Board to reflect the outlook on risk and return for both equities and bonds.
After increasing the gearing level late in 2008, we maintained a relatively high level throughout 2009 due to our gearing asset allocation model favouring equities and our belief that the overall market provided decent value.
The weighting in the smaller companies portfolio ranged between 6.8% and 8.3% of the Companys total assets less current liabilities and ended the year at 7.7%.
We believe that our ability to move between the two segments enhances potential returns to shareholders.
Attribution data for 2009 shows that it was the smaller companies portfolio and gearing that gave the greatest contribution towards performance.
The large cap underperformance was driven more by stock selection than by sector positioning as we did not shift the portfolio as rapidly as the market changed its appetite for riskier securities.
Detailed reports on the larger and smaller companies portfolios are shown below.
Large Companies Portfolio Our investment methodology continues to focus on investing in high quality, reasonably valued companies.
This style leads us to invest in companies that exhibit good growth characteristics with growing earnings, strong cash flows and reasonable valuations.
This approach produced mixed results throughout 2009.

As we look out to 2010, we have seen quite a bit of an improvement in the market indicators.
Volatility has fallen, credit spreads have narrowed, fund flows have picked up again and earnings are forecast to rise.
These improvements should help boost performance, but again relative to large caps, it might not be enough.
We think the small cap market will be less liquid and probably more volatile than in previous years and thus fundamentals should start to matter along with quality.
This should bode well for our portfolio.
Market Outlook Our belief is that the US economy will grow at a slightly above-trend rate in 2010, just enough to nudge the unemployment rate a bit lower.
Business inventories are only in the early stages of being replenished and high corporate cash balances are likely to be used, in part, to fund new capital expenditures, especially after the sharp cuts seen in 2009.
Despite the popular assumption that the highly leveraged consumer will be a small factor in the recovery, we do believe increased consumption will contribute to growth in 2010.
Estimates for US GDP growth are much lower than would be typical after such a deep recession, as significant headwinds, such as demand being restrained by weakness in bank credit, sluggish growth in employment and the still saturated residential and commercial real estate markets, have developed.
The rescue operation performed by both the US Government and The Federal Reserve Fed in 2008-2009 restored investor confidence, which allowed markets to bounce back from their March 2009 lows.
However, official support for a number of markets is set to expire over the coming months.
The Feds purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities will cease at the end of March and the tax credit for US homebuyers is currently scheduled to end in April.
Whether or not the financial markets and broader economy can stand on their own will therefore depend on demand from the private sector being strong enough to take up the slack.
Also, in the forefront of investors minds is how interest rates will be impacted by the recovery of economic activity, potentially higher inflation expectations and deteriorating fiscal budgets.
S&P 500 operating earnings per share are expected to rise by 25% or more this year, as sustained cost containment and moderate economic growth allow firms to benefit from both revenue gains and higher profit margins.
In addition, US equities still look attractive on a free cash flow valuation basis, especially given todays low borrowing costs.
While we expect the upward trend for the equity markets to remain mostly intact, given the size of last years strong advance and the prospect of less of a tailwind provided by government stimulus, the vigour of the 2009 rally is unlikely to be maintained.
