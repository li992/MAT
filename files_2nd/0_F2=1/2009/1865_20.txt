The organic reduction refl ected lower market activity across all product lines.
In response to the sharp decline in activity levels, prompt action was taken early in 2009 and again mid-year with headcount reduced in total by 256 FTEs, taking the workforce reduction since 2008 to 22%.
In 2009 there was a signifi cant eff ort in cross-training of the remaining workforce, so as to be more fl exible in matching staffi ng levels to demand.
Despite the weaker market conditions ERO won new long-term contracts with the Brazilian Air Force for PW100 engines $15 million over fi five years, US based fractional provider Avantair for PT6 $5 million over fi five years and a three-year service agreement with Hawker Beechcraft Services as its preferred engine service provider.
We successfully secured the sale of a number of engines generating cash of 17.6 million, consistent with our aim of reducing our investment in these types of assets.
In addition, ERO continued its structural reduction in inventory which fell by 14.3 million adding to the 13.0 million reduction achieved in 2008.
ERO continued to expand its locations, placing it closer to its customers, with the establishment of a turbine engine shop inside Cessnas facility in Wichita, Kansas, a Mobile Response Team in Los Angeles, California, a regional turbine centre RTC in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and two fi eld technical support offi ces in Johannesburg and Mumbai thus further strengthening its global service support capability.
A number of new authorisations were signed in the year, including the PT6T Twinpac helicopter engine in Europe at a cost of 5.7 million for the licence and other assets with payment deferred until 2010 which should generate annual revenues in excess of 5.0 million once fully adopted.
Additional authorisations were secured for the Hamilton Sunstrand T40-1 APU, used on Sikorsky Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, and JT15D for the Pratt & Whitney Canada ESP Maintenance Programme.
