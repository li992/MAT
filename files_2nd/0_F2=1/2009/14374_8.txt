EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATERISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Board of directors of the Company has established a set of policies to manage funding, currencyand interest rate risks.
Derivative financial instruments are used only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
The Groups financial instruments are subject to changes in fair values as a result of changes in market rates of exchange and forward interest rates.
Financial instruments entered into to hedge sales and purchase transactions in foreign currency and interest rate exposures are accounted for as hedges.
Changes in fair values of these financial instruments would not affect the Groups income statement.
The movements in the fair value of financialinstruments that are not accountedfor as hedges offset movements inthe values ofassets andliabilities and are recognised through the income statement.
The net impact of these changes in fair value on the Groups incomestatement isnotsignificant.
