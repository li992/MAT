Monitoring Liquidity risk is constantly monitored to evaluate the Groups position having regard to its risk appetite and key metrics.
Daily, weekly and monthly monitoring and control processes are in place, which allow management to take appropriate action.
Actions taken to improve the liquidity risk include a focus on improving the loan to deposit ratio, issuing longer-term wholesale funding, both guaranteed and unguaranteed, and the size of the conduit commitments.

The Group is targeting a liquidity pool of 150 Monitoring continued billion by 2013.
The table below shows the breakdown of these assets.
Undrawn commitments: The Group has been actively managing down In addition to available liquid assets, the Group has a pool of the amount of undrawn commitments that it is exposed to.
Undrawn unencumbered assets that are available for securitisation to raise funds commitments decreased from 349 billion at 31 December 2008 to if and when required.
The types of assets which can be used in securitisation include lending assets, and the Group benefits from not having encumbered significant amounts of lending assets historically.
Conduit commitments: The Group has taken additional measures to improve the balance sheet structure.
One area of focus has been reducing the size of the multi-seller conduits business, which relies upon funding assets through the issuance of short term asset-backed commercial paper.
Total facilities have declined by 17.9 billion to 25.0 billion at 31 December 2009.
This has reduced the liquidity risk to the Group through the commitments provided for this type of business.
Repo Agreements: At 31 December 2009 the Group had 68 billion of customer secured funding and 38 billion of bank secured funding, which includes borrowing using central bank funding schemes.
With markets continuing to stabilise through the course of 2009, the Group has significantly reduced its reliance on secured funding from central bank liquidity schemes.
Liquidity reserves: The total stock of liquid assets has increased by 81 billion during 2009 from 90 billion at 31 December 2008 to 171 billion at 31 December 2009: this reflects the injection of 25.5 billion of B shares at the end of December 2009 provided as 2009 2008 Liquidity reserves m m Government securities 57,407 27,303 Cash and central bank balances 51,500 11,830 Unencumbered collateral 1 42,055 30,054 Other liquid assets 19,699 20,647 Total liquidity reserve 170,661 89,834 Note: 1 Includes secured assets which are eligible for discounting at central banks.

The Group will continue to reduce reliance on government supported schemes and be governed by the state of the markets and economies in which it operates.
These strategies will ensure that the Group will be more resilient to any further disruptions in the market and will be better placed to take advantage of favourable trading conditions as they return.
Regulatory environment The Group operates in multiple jurisdictions across the globe and is subject to a number of regulatory regimes.
The Groups lead regulator is the UK FSA, with other authorities such as the fide Nederlandsche Bank and the US Federal Reserve Bank playing key roles.
The liquidity framework applied by the FSA is the Sterling Stock regime.
In line with the FSA policy statement PS09 16, the Group will be subject to a new liquidity risk regulatory framework in the future.
The Group has been working towards this new framework and will meet the requirements as they come into force.
Outlook for 2010 Whilst there have been improvements in the state of the global economy In the US the Group is required to meet the liquidity requirements set over the course of 2009, the outlook for 2010 remains uncertain.
