The figure shown represents the amount of pension benefits based on service, pensionable earnings and, where appropriate, transferred pension rights, which would have been preserved for each director had he left service on 31 March 2009.
The figure shown for Stanley Musesengwa includes his accrued deferred pension as at 23 July 2008 when he stepped down from the Board.
The augmentation that was granted to him on 31 July 2008, after converting the immediate pension granted to a deferred pension using the Schemes early retirement factors, has been included.
For each director, the figure represents the contributions paid over the year.
For Tim Lodge it represents the contributions paid since his appointment.
For each director, the figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 March 2009 and the corresponding accrued pension at the beginning of the year.
For Stanley Musesengwa and Stuart Strathdee, their accrued pensions at 31 July 2008, rather than 31 March 2009, have been used.
For the former, this includes the augmentation described in note 5.
No allowance is made for inflation.
As note 3, except that the figures quoted include an adjustment for inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The figures shown represent the transfer value of the inflation-adjusted increase in the total accrued pension for the year, net of Directors own contributions.
Stanley Musesengwa worked for Tate & Lyle for over 28 years, most of which were in Africa.
The value of his pension accrued during his service in Africa was minimal and significantly less than would have been the case had he served in the UK.
Accordingly, as part of his termination arrangements, the Committee decided to augment his total accumulated pension value by 754,000, which, taken together with his compensation for loss of office described in note 4 on page 90, represented an ex gratia enhancement of around 290,000 in excess of his contractual entitlement.
This brought his total accumulated pension value to the level of the Lifetime Allowance permitted under the UK tax regime to partially offset the negative impact of his African service on his pension entitlement.
The final pension payable to Stanley Musesengwa will still be very considerably less than a comparable director who had completed his service in the UK.
The figures shown represent the transfer value of the accumulated total accrued pension as at the beginning of the year or date of appointment in the case of Tim Lodge.
The figures shown represent the transfer value of the accumulated total accrued pension at 31 March 2009.
During the course of the year the actuarial basis used by the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme was amended by the Trustee, generally resulting in an increase in transfer value amounts.
The transfer values quoted have been calculated using the actuarial bases which applied at 31 March 2009.
Part of the increase in the transfer values over the year is attributable to the change in actuarial basis.
The figures shown represent the increase in the transfer values from the beginning of the year or date of appointment in the case of Tim Lodge to 31 March 2009.
The transfer values quoted have been calculated using the actuarial bases which applied at each reporting date, net of the directors own contributions.
As a result of the changes to the taxation of UK pension benefits that took effect from 6 April 2006, benefits accrued by Stanley Musesengwa in respect of service after that date are no longer subject to a cap on pensionable earnings.
As a result, from 6 April 2006 the cash salary supplement previously paid to him in lieu of pension benefits in excess of the earnings cap ceased.
The earnings cap continued to apply to benefits accrued in respect of his service prior to 6 April 2006.
