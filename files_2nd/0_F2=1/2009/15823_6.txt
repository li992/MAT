12 KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES We assess the financial performance of our businesses using a variety of measures.
Certain of these measures are particularly important and we have termed them key performance measures.
We refer to these measures in the Directors Report and use them in presentations to investors.
Some of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS.
A summary of each of the key performance measures and how we use them is presented below.
A detailed explanation of each of the measures, how they are calculated and, in the case of the non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of their limitations, is presented on pages 151 to 159.
We assess the non-financial performance of our businesses using measures that are discussed under the heading Corporate Social Responsibility on pages 38 and 39.
