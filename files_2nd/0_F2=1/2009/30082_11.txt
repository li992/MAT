ORDINARY SHARES Managers Report Ordinary Share Class Chris Turner MRICS Fund Manager 4 June 2009 Performance In the year ended March 2009 the Ordinary share class IFRS NAV fell by 42.6%.
This sad regression compares with an even larger decline of 51.2% in the benchmark index.
In total return terms the figures are -40.5% for the NAV and -48.6% for the benchmark.
On a simple difference basis the total return outperformance was therefore 8.1%.
The main contributor to outperformance was the substantial net cash holdings which were maintained in the share class throughout the year, mainly in Euros.
Stock selection, which emphasised companies with below average leverage, also assisted as did the relative outperformance of our direct property portfolio.
Errors of judgement were multiple.
At the country level, I kept too much money in UK stocks, which fell by 62.5% and remained underweight in the outperforming Belgian and Swiss markets.
We did, however avoid Norway altogether and were very substantially underweight in Austria, the two worst performers at the country level.
At the stock level, the range of performance was as wide as I can recall in any year and hinged almost entirely on gearing.
Those companies that entered the downturn with modest leverage, or took early action to sell assets and repay debt, all outperformed.
The many businesses which did neither saw their share prices decimated.
Our largest investment, Unibail, fell into the former camp, our second and third largest, Land Securities and British Land fell eventually into the latter.
Our currency positions were close to neutral in terms of relative performance and strongly positive in terms of absolute returns.
Our direct property portfolio contributed outperformance showing a negative return of -14.9%.
