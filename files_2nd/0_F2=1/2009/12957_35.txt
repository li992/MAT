22-30 Operations R 3 25 10 8:39 AM Page 9 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K RESOURCES AND RESERVES There was no significant change in the measured and indicated mineral resource Despite the drop in grade associated with base apart from depletion from mining and processing.
Remaining reserves were processing the stockpiles, the mine still slightly higher than last year after depletion has been taken into account as a result reported US$166.7 million in profits from of good bye cuts carried out below the pit design in 2009.
Open pit mining mining activity and paid US$155.0 million activities ended in April 2009, as planned, and therefore the current reserves are to its shareholders in 2009. based on already mined stockpiles.
Already mined mineralised waste has been included as an inferred resource due to its sensitivity to the price of gold.
EXPLORATION In 2009 it was decided to stop further exploration on the Morila lease, following extensive programmes over the Life of Mine, including a final drilling programme in the first quarter of the year on four conceptual targets which failed to intersect additional economic mineralisation.
OPEN PIT MINING Open pit mining ceased in April 2009, as planned, and hence the mining figures reported above reflect less than four in pit months mining for 2009.
MINE PLANNING The mine operated broadly in line with its budgeted mine plan, including the successful transition from in pit mining to stockpile processing at the end of April 2009.
Overall recoveries and throughput were slightly ahead of budget resulting in the mine exceeding its forecast production by 3%.
PROCESSING During the year, the mine processed 4.30 million tonnes, in line with the prior year and slightly ahead of budget.
Recoveries of 91.4% were in line with the prior year, but ahead of budget, an excellent achievement given the drop in the average head grade.
ENGINEERING The mine faced plant maintenance challenges from the primary crusher and SAG mill during the year.
However, with focused maintenance, the SAG mill Combiflex was re-built promptly to ensure a just-on-target plant availability of 93.8% versus a budget of 94%.
The team also relocated the aggregate crusher to supply finer crushed ore to feed the ball mill during extended planned maintenance and relining of the SAG mill.
As the plant ages, so the issue of ensuring operational availability becomes more important, and in this regard a more integrated planned maintenance system will be pursued during the year ahead.
