The Company is an investment company as defined by section 833 of the Companies Act 2006 and operates as an investment trust in accordance with section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 ICTA 1988.
HM Revenue & Customs have approved the Companys status as an investment trust, subject to there being no subsequent enquiry under Corporation Tax Self Assessment, in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008.

It is the Companys intention to continue to seek authorisation under Section 842 of ICTA 1988.
Objective and Investment Policy The Company invests in UK securities with the long term objective of achieving: 1. an increase of the Net Asset Value per share by more than the growth in the FTSE All-Share Index: and 2. growth in dividends per share by more than the rate of UK inflation.
The Company will generally invest only in companies quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the UK or in those which are about to enter the FTSE All-Share Index.
The portfolio is selected by the Manager on the basis of its assessment of the fundamental value available in individual securities.
Whilst the Companys overall exposure to individual securities is monitored carefully by the Board, the portfolio is not primarily structured on the basis of industry weightings.
The securities of no one company, as determined at the time of acquisition, may represent more than 10% of the market value of the Companys equity portfolio.
Similarly, the Company will not hold more than 5% of the issued share capital or voting shares in any one company.
Investment in convertibles is subject to normal security limits.
Should these or any other limit be exceeded by subsequent market movement, each resulting position is specifically reviewed by the Board.
The Company borrows money to provide gearing to the equity portfolio up to a maximum of 200 million.
Use of derivative instruments is permitted within the following constraints and is monitored carefully by the Board.
The writing of covered calls, to a maximum of 10% of the value of the portfolio, is permitted and a maximum of 15% may be invested in FTSE 100 futures.
Other derivative contracts may be employed subject to an aggregate of the above limits and to the prior approval of the Board.
At the AGM, on 17 July 2009, the Directors are proposing a change to this Objective and Investment Policy to permit the investment manager to invest up to 15% of the Companys assets in non-domestic listed securities.
