Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 17 Directors report for the period to 2 May 2009 continued The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that might result in the restriction of transfer or voting rights in relation to the shares held by such shareholders.
All of the Companys employee share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid.
Under these provisions, a change of control of the Company would normally be a vesting event, facilitating the exercise or transfer of awards, subject to any relevant performance conditions being satisfied.
The Company is not a party to any other significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid other than its bank facility agreement, which provides that on a change of control, the Company is unable to draw down any further amounts under the facility and all sums must be repaid.
Further, it is not party to any agreement with the Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise that occurs as a result of a takeover bid.
13 Annual General Meeting In addition to resolutions to adopt the accounts, declare a final dividend, approve the Directors remuneration report, re-elect Directors and reappoint the auditors, four further resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The first is to give the Directors general power to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 224,058 being equal to approximately 33.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority, which will lapse at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, but retain the authority to do so.
The second asks shareholders to disapply the statutory rights of pre-emption contained in section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 so as to grant the Directors authority to allot equity securities or sell treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of 33,608 being 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital as at 29 June 2009.
The Directors consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power which will terminate at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
The third resolution will renew an existing authority which gives the Company power to purchase its own Ordinary shares, such authority being limited to the purchase of 10% of the Ordinary shares in issue as at 29 June 2009.
The maximum price payable for the purchase by the Company of its own Ordinary shares will be limited to the higher of i 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of the Companys Ordinary shares, as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for the five business days prior to the purchase: ii the price of the last independent trade of an Ordinary share: and iii the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary share as derived from the trading venue where the purchase is carried out.
The minimum price payable by the Company for the purchase of its own Ordinary shares will be 1 penny per share being the nominal value of an Ordinary share.
The authority to purchase the Companys own Ordinary shares will only be exercised if the Directors consider that there is likely to be a beneficial impact on earnings per Ordinary share and that it is in the best interests of the Company at the time.
Options over 859,725 Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company were outstanding as at 26 June 2009 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report representing 1.3% of the issued share capital of the Company as at that date.
If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under the proposed resolution, the options outstanding as at 26 June 2009 would represent 1.4% of the Ordinary share capital in issue following such exercise.
The fourth resolution is to consider and, if thought fit, approve adjustments to the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, details of which are set on pages 27 to 29.
14 Audit information Each of the Directors of the Company in office at the date of approval of this Report has confirmed that a so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware and b that each Director has taken all steps they should have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
