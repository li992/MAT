Non branded sales were up by 3.2% half of the year.
Firstly, a material retailer brand contract was to 421m.
Secondly, the market for retailer brand goods was down as promotions on branded goods and increases in retailer brand market pricing caused consumers to switch away from retailer brand products.
This effect was particularly marked in canned soup where total retailer brand sales in the category were down 10%.
These two effects are likely to mean that Grocery non branded sales revenue will be lower in the first half of 2010 than in the first half of 2009.
We have seen an improved performance in Ireland during the second half of 2009.
The decline in sales seen earlier in the year has been significantly reduced and our brands are gaining market share.

Firstly, there was an increase in the level of deal activity across all grocery markets, with retailers There was a 6m net cost as a result of increased competing to offer value during the manufacturing costs.
Savings were realised from closing recession.
These savings were offset by inflation, notably 30% of volumes sold on deal in in utilities and by initially high running costs as the new 2009 versus a more normal rate processes were commissioned in the factories receiving the of 28% seen in 2008 and prior products previously made in the factories which were closed.

There was a 5m improvement in operating expenses comprising lower administration costs offset by additional investment in marketing.
The additional marketing costs of 6m were incurred to support driving market share and the new product launches.
We expect this cost to continue to increase in the future as we refresh our brand ranges.
Administration costs benefited from synergies and lower pension service and bonus costs.
In conclusion, in 2009, Grocery succeeded in growing its branded sales, added to sales through innovation and added to gross profit by better procurement efficiency.
With delivery of further efficiencies now enabled, we are confident of making further progress in 2010.

The system utilises bar-code scanning technology, managed by the SAP application, to track products from production, through the distribution chain, using a set of complex but simple to operate rules.
Hovis produce approximately 18 million baked products each week.
In some instances a complex cross docking operation will result in bread being moved via a number of sites.
All this has to be done within a 24 hour window to ensure that product is delivered fresh to stores nationwide.
With 22 distribution sites, 13 of which are also bakeries, and just under 1,000 product types, this is a complicated logistics picture, involving around 2,000 employees.
Prior to Track and Trace this was a largely manual operation, requiring individual decisions about where to send product, with limited management visibility.
