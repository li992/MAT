Environmental, social and ethical issues The Board takes account of the significance of environmental, social and ethical matters to the business of the Group.
Environmental The Company has an environmental policy which can be viewed on the Domino website at www.
Mr Bond is the Director responsible for environmental matters.
An Environmental Steering Group has been established chaired by Mr Bond which is responsible for promoting and monitoring compliance with the environmental policy.
The Group keeps Dominos products and business methods under review to find ways of reducing Dominos environmental impact and serve the needs of customers who are becoming increasingly environmentally aware.
In particular, there are programmes to reduce solvent usage and power consumption.
Each Group company has established a Green Team consisting of employees who volunteer to take responsibility for devising and implementing environmental initiatives.
These teams have undertaken numerous projects ranging from recycling schemes to tree planting.
Domino is a member of the Green Organisation, an independent non-profit making environmental group dedicated to recognising, rewarding and promoting environmental best practice around the world.
A paper on the activities of Dominos UK Green Team has been included in the Green Book which is a reference work on environmental best practice published by the Green Organisation.
Each Group company is also required to record and monitor waste levels, power and water consumption, airline travel and vehicle fleet emissions with the objective of achieving annual reductions of at least 10 per cent in all these areas.
As part of this initiative Domino has signed up to the 10:10 project, which aims to encourage organisations to reduce their emissions by 10 per cent in 2010.
During the year there have been some notable successes: Domino Amjet in the US reduced airline travel by 25 per cent and Domino Printing Solutions in Canada reduced waste sent to landfill sites by 37 per cent.
The Environmental Steering Group is now working to introduce common methods of measuring power consumption, landfill, recycling and vehicle fleet emissions so that achievement against objectives is reported on a group wide basis.
The Group has fluids manufacturing plants in the UK, US, China and India.
These operations have been identified as having the potential to create an environmental impact due to the hazardous nature of the materials used.
The UK, US and Chinese plants are certificated under the Environmental Management Standard BS EN ISO 14001:2004.
The Standard requires the completion of an environmental impact assessment, the development and implementation of plans to achieve continuous improvement and the measurement of such achievement.
Compliance with the standard is assessed by external audit.
The UK and US fluids plants are accredited under the ISRS system.
This system is designed to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements and to provide continuous improvement.
The UK fluids plant and the Chinese plant are also accredited under the OHSAS 18001:2007 Health & Safety Standard and subject to external audits by BSI.
The fluids plants in the UK, China and the US operate under environmental protection legislation requiring compliance with emission standards and the production of verifiable evidence of compliance.
The environmental policy has been effective in raising awareness of environmental issues and encouraging the adoption of a range of initiatives.
The Group is committed to continue with its work to seek to reduce the environmental impact of its operations.

Each Domino employee has an individual responsibility to deal ethically with customers, suppliers, fellow employees and the general public.
The policy has been effective in defining the ethical standards to be followed throughout the Group.

Opportunities for development and promotion are open to all employees.
Employee involvement Employee communication is organised both centrally and locally.
Centrally organised communication deals with the affairs of the Group as a whole and the media used for this purpose include the annual report and accounts, information circulars and meetings.
Operating units organise local presentations by directors or managers and hold briefings to pass on information to employees and to ascertain their views.
In the UK, at least four National Employee Council meetings are held each year to which all employees are invited.
The Council meetings are used to inform employees of any matters affecting their interests.
In addition, regular management briefing meetings are held at which presentations are given on the current state of the business as well as any other topics of interest.
These briefings are usually attended by an Executive Director who is available to answer questions.
Executive Directors and some senior managers are eligible for conditional allocations of shares under a Long Term Incentive Plan.
Other senior managers are eligible for the grant of options under the Executive share option schemes.
