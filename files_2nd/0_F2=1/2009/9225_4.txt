The Group is exploring ways to promote brand loyalty even if perhaps their closest Improving machine offering betting shop is that of a competitor.
Continually improve the cost base In 2009 the UK Retail business succeeded in reducing costs by 1%.
The majority of the savings were delivered through the staff cost line where the Group has worked very hard to streamline the business.
Costs remain a key area of focus for the team who are continuing to seek to control costs against an inflationary backdrop.
Improve the shop As described on page six, in 2009 Ladbrokes began trialling alternative suppliers to introduce competitive tension and ensure estate footprint that our customers are offered the best machine content available in the market.
The Group is focused on the profitability of the estate and through the continued process of relocation, refurbishment and the closure of loss making shops seeks to improve the current footprint.
The Group also seeks to open new shops which offer attractive returns on investment.

indd 10 24 02 2010 07:50 OddsOn programme Growing the estate targeted marketing In June 2008 Ladbrokes became the first retail bookmaker to offer a large scale system driven loyalty programme in its betting shops.
Ladbrokes believes it gives the Group a competitive advantage in terms of customer understanding and the ability to adopt a more sophisticated customer relationship management programme with its retail customers.
As per page seven, there have been some recent modifications to the OddsOn!
programme, including a change in the point award scheme and a move from its initial recruitment focus to targeted marketing.
For example, we are now able to encourage customers who visit the shops on Saturdays but not Sundays to make an extra visit over the weekend, and we can measure the response.
We are also trialling the use of OddsOn!
on machines and cross-channel with eGaming.
During 2008 09 we developed and tested an updated shop format for use in new licence developments and existing shop refurbishments that reduced capital costs by 10%, reduced carbon emissions by in excess of 20% and generated promising levels of shop profit contribution.
Using a more sophisticated method of site identification, with census, sociodemographic and OddsOn!
data, we are planning on opening 50 shops in 2010 at a cost of c10 million.
We also plan to relocate and refurbish a further 70 shops.
The investment in new licences is expected to pay back within two to three years.
Premium pay buyout During 2009 the Group bought out premium pay for shop staff.
In exchange for a one-off cash payment the staff agreed to receive normal pay on Sundays and Bank holidays, where they had been receiving double time.
The nature of the cash payments means that the savings from moving to single time will only be seen from Q4 2010, when the annualised benefit of circa 12 million will begin to come through.

Ladbrokes has the most recognised betting brand in the UK see page 27.
This is a competitive advantage which must be capitalised upon.

In addition, there are Mobile betting opportunities to maximise the brand across the various channels including Retail and eGaming and through exciting new channels such as mobile.
