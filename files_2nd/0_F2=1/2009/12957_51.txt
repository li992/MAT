Results from this drilling are encouraging and define a continuation of mineralisation 650 metres to the north of the current open pit.
Drilling continues to fully delineate the potential of the Loulo 3 deposit.
Loulo 2 The Loulo 2 target includes three approximately 100 metre to 300 metre long dilation zones over a 2 kilometre strike and has been the focus of evaluation drilling during 2009.
This resulted in the delineation of a indicated mineral resource of 140 000 tonnes at 3.94g t for 17 874 ounces of which 15 000 ounces was subsequently mined from Loulo 2 North.
Mineralisation is associated with haematisation of tourmaline sediments.
In the Central Zone work returned a number of good but narrow intersections: 3 metres at 6.31g t: 5 metres at 3.03g t: and 4 metres at 5.56g t. Additional followup work is required.
Further to the south, low grade mineralisation was encountered.
Yalea structure The Yalea structure, on which Loulo 2 and Loulo 3 are located, is a significant mineralised structure and, as well as surface work, deeper conceptual holes targeting blind mineralisation will be motivated in 2010.
