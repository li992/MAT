In the fourth quarter of 2009, Xstrata Nickel was operating with a C1 cash cost of below $3.00 per pound based on prevailing metal prices and exchange rates.
The significant actions taken to reduce costs and conserve cash, combined with lower cost production from Nickel Rim South and, commencing in 2012, from Koniambo, are expected to continue to move Xstrata Nickel signicantly down the cost curve.
Restructuring of Xstrata Nickel Mike Cayen, a jumbo operator working underground at Xstrata Nickels Nickel In response to falling nickel prices and declining Rim South mine in Sudbury, Canada market conditions, Xstrata Nickels management team undertook an ambitious transformation of their business in 2009.
Part of the asset optimisation plan involved the restructuring of the Sudbury operations.
The end-of-life, higher-cost Craig and Thayer-Lindsley mines were closed and the Fraser Mine complex was suspended.
In the Dominican Republic, the oil-fuelled ferronickel Falcondo operation was put on care and maintenance and efficiency improvements were made at the Nikkelverk renery in Norway.
Lost production was replaced through the ramping up of the Western Australian operations, initial production from Nickel Rim South and improved volumes and grades at Raglan.
The steps taken by Xstrata Nickel have transformed the businesss average cash costs and competitive position while retaining its highly attractive suite of longer-term growth options.
qxd:Layout 1 18 3 10 00:53 Page 80 | 80 PERFORMANCE Nickel continued The substantial fall in average nickel prices in 2009, some 30% lower than the previous year, combined with lower prices for by-products, reduced operating earnings by $483 million.
EBITDA of $427 million was recorded in 2009, reecting the positive impact of real cost savings, which mitigated the impact of lower prices and exchange rates.
In 2009, average US dollar exchange rates strengthened against Xstrata Nickels local currencies and lowered costs in US dollar terms.
However, this favourable impact was more than offset by a year-on-year unrealised foreign exchange loss relating to the revaluation of net non-US dollar liabilities at year end as a result of the weaker US dollar at the end of 2009.
Operations INO Integrated Nickel Operations INO comprise the Sudbury mines and smelter, Montcalm and Raglan mines in Canada, Xstrata Nickel Australasia XNA and the Nikkelverk renery in Norway.
Nickel sales from INO fell by 2% compared to 2008.
The loss of feed from restructuring activities was largely offset by initial ore from Nickel Rim South, higher production from Raglan and signicantly higher volumes from the Australian operations.
Higher grade supply from Xstrata Nickels own operations fed into INOs downstream facilities, offsetting reduced third-party volumes, which were down by 11% year-on-year, as a number of suppliers suspended or reduced production in response to weak market conditions.
Low-cost debottlenecking at INO metallurgical facilities continued to improve unit costs and increase capacity.
The Sudbury restructuring and INO mine plan optimisation reduced unit production costs by 33% compared to the prior year.
However, reduced by-product credits from Louis Noel, bolt technician lower average copper, cobalt and precious metal prices largely offset these underground at Xstrata Nickels Nickel savings.

In response to decreased local feed volumes, Strathconas milling capacity was reduced by 50% and total mined ore processed declined by 45% in 2009 compared to last year.
At the Sudbury smelter, feed volumes decreased by 8% to 491,824 tonnes compared to 2008 due to the suspension or closure of the Craig, Thayer-Lindsley and Montcalm mines.
Nickel in matte output increased by 2% year-on-year due to higher grade feed from XNA and a 31% increase in concentrate from Raglan.
Production of copper-in-matte increased by 4% to 18,560 tonnes as a result of the higher copper volumes from Raglan and XNA, while cobalt-in-matte decreased by 6% to 2,476 tonnes, driven primarily by lower volumes of cobalt-rich third-party feed.

Koniambo is on track for first ore to be processed in the first half of 2012, ramping up to annual capacity of 60,000 tonnes of nickel in ferronickel within the following two years.
The metallurgical plant for the site is being constructed in modules in China and remains on schedule, with the first module shipment to the Koniambo site expected in the third quarter of 2010.
Industrial site earthworks are substantially complete, dredging is expected to be complete in early 2010 and the construction of the main wharf is under way.
The Koniambo project is continuing to take up opportunities to optimise capital costs.
Re-sequencing activities in 2009 deferred capital expenditures for the year by approximately 50%, as the project team took advantage of the economic downturn and consequent lower capital costs to secure Strategy in action unordered goods and services at lower prices, renegotiate contractor Koniambo terms and access greater availability of skilled labour.

Improvements at the Strathcona mill, including increased copper capacity, were completed in 2009 in order to handle Nickel Rim South feed.
Denition drilling has proven up 9.6 million tonnes of reserves.
The project has increased resources by more than 25% since project execution began.
Nickel Rim South is expected to be a negative cash cost operation as a result of its high grade, poly-metallic resource, which will further transform the average cash cost position of Xstrata Nickels operations.

A low-cost expansion of the Cosmos mill was completed in 2009 to increase capacity to 13,500 tonnes of nickel in concentrate per annum and lower unit costs.
Development of the Prospero deposit continued throughout 2009, contributing to a 54% increase in production at Cosmos.
The open pit mine at Sinclair was completed in the third quarter of 2009 while development of the underground mine was deferred in April 2009 due to market conditions.
Sinclair has been repositioned as a swing producer and will operate as a satellite operation, leveraging the infrastructure and capacity available from Cosmos to limit overheads.
Falcondo The feasibility study to convert the energy source for Falcondos process plant from oil to natural gas and to optimise mining and plant processes is scheduled to be completed in 2010.
These initiatives aim to transform Falcondo from a traditional swing producer into a sustainable operation, with minimum capital outlay.
While under care and maintenance, Falcondo continues to support the Dominican Republic by providing an ongoing supply of electricity and through increased contributions to the Falcondo Foundations numerous social responsibility programmes.
Mine rehabilitation and reforestation activities also continue.
