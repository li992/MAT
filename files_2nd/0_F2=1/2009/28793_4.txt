The valuations of unquoted investments are reviewed twice a year by a valuation committee which is chaired by an independent non-executive director, the latest review being at 31 March 2009.
However, if circumstances warrant, valuations are amended between these dates.
Valuation Changes During the year the portfolio experienced a net valuation decline of 70.2 million resulting from revaluations of the underlying companies as well as favourable exchange rate movements.
Approximately 71% of the year end valuation was denominated in US Dollar or Euros and has therefore benefited from the strengthening of those currencies against Sterling over the year.
Significant valuation changes including currency are shown below: 48.7 Robin Hood Holdings Valley National Gas 10.0 -6.8 Martin Currie -6.8 United American Indemnity -8.1 Castle Investment Holdings -21.1 Readers Digest -34.8 Harbourmaster -40 -20 0 20 40 60 million 214413 RIT R&A pp01-pp20 6 3 09 2:21 PM Page 15 15 The revaluation of Robin Hood Holdings reflects continued strong growth, increased profitability and the signing of significant new partnerships.
Valley National Gas was revalued as a result of a disposal which completed immediately after the year end.
Our stake was sold for 13.8 million, representing a 9.7 million profit or 3.4 times the cost of our investment in 2007.
The proceeds represented a 6.4 million premium to the 30 September 2008 valuation.
The decline in the valuation of Harbourmaster reflects the payment of a 22.3 million dividend to RITCP, and also the impact of the continued weakness in the CLO market.
Readers Digest suffered from a challenging operating environment and, in particular, high financial leverage.
