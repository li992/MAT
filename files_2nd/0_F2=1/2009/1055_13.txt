It produces copper concentrate containing gold and silver and molybdenum concentrate, through a milling and Completion of the Los Pelambres plant expansion is flotation process.
expected to increase plant throughput by approximately Revenue at Los Pelambres in 2009 was US$2,081.5 million, slightly 30%, from the current 130,000 tonnes per day level to below the US$2,172.0 million achieved in 2008.
The reduction reflected a 175,000 tonnes per day level in 2010.
As a result, the a decrease in copper volumes and the lower molybdenum price, largely offset by an increase in the realised copper price.
production of payable copper is expected to be 407,000 tonnes in 2010, compared with 311,600 tonnes in 2009.
Los Pelambres produced 311,600 tonnes of payable copper in 2009, a reduction compared to the 2008 full year production of 339,200 tonnes, although ahead of the original forecast for the year of 300,000 tonnes.
The decrease in production compared to 2008 was mainly due to lower plant throughput due to the higher level of harder primary ore and a marginal decrease in ore grades.
Ore throughput averaged 129,200 tonnes per day 2008 136,800 tonnes per day, while the ore grade in the area of the open pit mined during the year was 0.74% copper 2008 0.76%.
Molybdenum production was unchanged from 2008 at 7,800 tonnes, with marginally higher ore grades and metallurgical recoveries offsetting the lower plant throughput.
Realised copper prices at Los Pelambres were 286.8 cents per pound, 16% higher than the 2008 realised price of 246.5 cents per pound.
This was despite the average LME price for the year of 234.2 cents per pound actually being 26% lower than in the previous year 2008 315.3 cents per pound.
The general increase in the copper price during 2009 resulted in positive pricing adjustments of US$380.3 million, reflecting both the settlement of open sales in the year and the impact of mark-to-market adjustments at the beginning and end of the year.
Conversely, the sharp fall in the copper price in the second half of 2008 resulted in negative adjustments of US$541.9 million in 2008.
Realised molybdenum prices were US$11.3 per pound 2008 US$23.9 per pound which was broadly in line with the average market price of US$11.1 per pound 2008 US$28.9 per pound.
Further details of pricing adjustments for both copper and molybdenum are given in the Financial Review on pages 42 and 43 Key data for 2009 and in Note 25 d to the financial statements.
