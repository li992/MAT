IMPACT ON OUR MARKETS 2009 was a year of weakening growth in most of our markets.
On the retail side, net new market mortgage lending ie new lending minus repayments was very low throughout 2009, as a result of which growth in outstanding balances slowed to around 1 per cent by year end.
Net new market unsecured consumer lending was very weak in the first half of the year, and turned negative in the second half.
Weakening lending growth appears to have been driven by both supply and demand.
Some lenders have pulled back from the market, especially from higher risk segments.
But at the same time, data on our own retail customers shows that they have reacted to the recession by prioritising reducing debt.
This trend is apparent across all our customer groups, whether split by age, income, or indebtedness.
This helps to explain why market deposit growth also weakened in 2009, despite a higher national saving ratio.
Households have on average chosen to use the cash freed up by reduced spending and lower debt interest payments to pay off debt rather than save more.
Market mortgage arrears rose during the first half of 2009, but then fell back in the second half.
Market credit card arrears also fell during the second half.
Improving arrears trends may have been helped by households starting to pay down debt.
And many mortgage borrowers will have found their debt servicing costs reduced during 2009 as their variable mortgage rates fell or as their fixed rate loans expired and they rolled off onto lower standard variable rates.
Quite strong growth in the average households real disposable income in 2009 will also have helped, aided by better-than-expected employment levels in the second half and falling inflation.
Businesses also appear to have used 2009 to strengthen their financial position where possible.
Sharp cutbacks in investment spending, and in stocks, have enabled businesses in aggregate to remain in financial surplus and reduce their reliance on external credit from banks, trade creditors and others.
