At year end we had 94 quoted clients.
62 Annual report 2009 Divisional review Investment Banking Integrated business focused on local client delivery with international access Southern Africa We maintained our strong positioning with a lower level of activity.
Our main focus was on M&A, restructuring and black economic empowerment transactions.
We retained all our major clients and gained several new mandates during the period.
The total value of Corporate Finance transactions decreased to R23.4 billion 2008: R113 billion during the period and the number of transactions decreased to 60 2008: 109.
Sponsor broker deals completed during the period decreased to 96 2008: 165 with the value also decreasing to R51 billion 2008: R149 billion.

This is the sixth year running that we have won this M&A award.
The Corporate Finance and Sponsor divisions were also both ranked first in volume of M&A transactions in the Ernst & Young review for M&A 2008 calendar year.
Australia There is increasing awareness and recognition of the Investec brand within the Australian market and we have continued to increase the quality and size of our client list.
During the period we strengthened our team in Sydney and Brisbane.
We have continued to expand our sector specialisation, with our Natural Resources team showing the strongest pipeline.
Despite the challenging market conditions, we are currently active on a number of mandates.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading UK and Europe Volatile and dif cult market conditions have restricted secondary commission growth.
Trading revenues have showed considerable improvement.
We have strengthened our UK research team over the year with the addition of a number of experienced analysts.
We continue to expand the capacity of our New York sales team.
We have also seen market share gains in large cap trading.
Market share gains continue across our trading platform.
Southern Africa A decline in income from our core equity broking operation was cushioned by a strong performance from the prime broking business.
The remaining gaps in our research team have been lled and we are well on track to meet our coverage objective.
The prime broking operation signed up a number of new clients over the period and initiated a system upgrade, further entrenching itself as one of the leading players in the industry.
Activity through the electronic execution platform recorded healthy growth and a number of new and updated algorithms were released to our client base.
Principal Investments UK, Europe and Hong Kong Performance has been impacted by volatile market conditions.
Southern Africa The Direct Investments portfolio increased to R1 816 million at 31 March 2009 March 2008: R1 051 million.
The increase in value was driven by a good performance from the underlying investments and a few selective new investments.
The Private Equity portfolio was R2 525 million at 31 March 2009 March 2008: R1 976 million.
We continued to expand the capacity of our private equity investments through bolt-on acquisitions and capital expenditure.
During the year under review we have had signi cant realisation through dividends and a few disposals.
Australia The total size of the Private Equity funds is AUD460 million.
Performance has been impacted by market conditions.
Annual report 2009 63 Divisional review Investment Banking Integrated business focused on local client delivery with international access Outlook, risks and uncertainties Corporate Finance While market conditions remain uncertain and problematic for transactions, we are well positioned to take advantage of the changing competitive landscape.
The increase in our number of corporate clients in the UK, especially in the FTSE 250, is testimony to this.
Black economic empowerment, restructuring and M&A transactions are expected to continue to drive activity at a reasonable level in South Africa.
In Australia M&A mandates are scarcer and transactions are taking longer to complete.
However, the strong relationships established by the corporate advisory team will provide a solid platform for future growth opportunities when market conditions improve.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading The UK business has, through ongoing investment, substantially strengthened its positioning across sales, trading and research.
The market conditions however, remain dif cult.
The outlook for the South African business remains challenging with the sharp decline in the value of trading activity experienced on the JSE unlikely to reverse in the near term.
Nevertheless, our continued investment in the business, broad revenue base, market share gains and tight cost control, position us well for the next economic upswing.
Principal Investments We remain active in seeking direct investment opportunities, while continuing to unlock further value from the portfolio and the building of black economic empowerment platforms in South Africa.
The majority of the companies in our Private Equity portfolio in South Africa are trading in line with expectations in very dif cult market conditions and the overall outlook remains positive.
The Australian business continues to add value to existing investments and is well placed to take advantage of new investment opportunities.
