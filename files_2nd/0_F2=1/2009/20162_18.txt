The Groups track record of making such investments for over 60 years has provided it with the experience, approach and techniques critical to success in minority investing.
These are underpinned by only investing where we can align interests with entrepreneurs and management teams and the differentiated approach that 3i takes to adding value to its portfolio companies.
Another important aspect of our business model is the way in which we drive the growth in the value of our portfolio companies.
As can be seen from chart 4, the major driver of value creation in the Growth Capital business, for investments realised from the 2003 and more recent vintages, has been the underlying earnings growth of portfolio companies.
Multiple enhancement on exit in Growth Capital portfolio companies is driven by three factors: improvement in the strategic positioning of portfolio companies: the fact that whilst investments are made on minority valuations, exits tend to occur when a company is sold or listed: and general market conditions.

The performance of the more mature vintages 2002 to 2005 has remained stable due to the significant realisations achieved in previous years.
Similarly, 2006 remains above 20%, having already returned more than the original investment cost.
The 2007 vintage has had two early profitable exits during the year with Little Sheep exited at 3.1x our original cost for a 62% IRR and Electrawinds, a Belgiumbased energy business, exited for 1.6x our original cost for a 47% IRR.
Notwithstanding these early gains, the impact of lower valuations, driven by reductions in multiples, has reduced the IRR to a marginally negative return.
The 2008 vintage is immature and has been hardest hit by reduced valuations, leading to a negative IRR of 16 %.
