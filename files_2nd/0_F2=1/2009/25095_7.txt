Business Review INVESTMENT POLICY i Objective and policy The Companys objective is to enable investors to benefit from rapid and sustained growth anticipated by the directors in the markets for cleaner or more efficient delivery of basic services of energy, water and waste.
Investments are made predominantly in quoted companies which provide, utilise, implement or advise upon technology-based systems, products or services in environmental markets, particularly those of alternative energy and energy efficiency, water treatment and pollution control, and waste technology and resource management.
ii Asset allocation Investments are selected on an individual basis but each investment is categorised according to three primary environmental markets which are the focus of the Companys investment policy.
Alternative Energy and Energy Efficiency In the alternative energy and energy efficiency sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: wind turbine manufacturing solar panel manufacturing and integration renewable energy developers and independent power producers biofuels meters, utility software and demand side management industrial energy efficiency buildings energy efficiency transport energy efficiency businesses relating to the trading of carbon and other environmental assets fuel cells, flywheels, superconductors, supercapacitors and other new energy technologies As at 31 December 2009, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 183m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 47.4% of the Companys portfolio at that time.
Waste Technologies and Resource Management In the waste technologies and resource management sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: recycling equipment and systems recycling of commodities including metals, plastics, oils, paper and vehicles integrated waste management hazardous waste management environmental consultancy As at 31 December 2009, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 118m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 30.6% of the Companys portfolio at that time.

iii Risk diversification The Company has the following maximum exposures in place in order to ensure that there is a reasonable diversification of risk in the Companys portfolio: a Not more than 10% of the Companys Net Asset Value will be invested in any one company at the time of investment.
b The Company will not make an investment if as a consequence of that investment individual holdings of 5% or more would in aggregate represent more than 40% of NAV.
The Company did not exceed either of the above maximum exposures during the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Company held investments in 94 companies as at 31 December 2009, the largest one being China Everbright which represented 2.5% of net assets at that time.
The Company does not have prescriptive limits on the maximum amounts that can be invested in the sub-sectors listed above.
The directors believe that the imposition of such limits could impact on efficient portfolio management.
iv Gearing At present the Company does not have any long-term or short-term borrowings, and during the year ended 31 December 2009 did not utilise any borrowings.
The Board has authorised the Manager to utilise short-term borrowings of up to 10% of net assets in order to provide liquidity for efficient portfolio management where the Manager sees fit.
While there is no current intention to utilise long-term borrowings, the Company retains the flexibility to do so in appropriate circumstances.
Any long-term borrowings and any borrowings in excess of 10% of net assets would require the separate authorisation of the Board.
The borrowings of the Company shall not at any time, without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution of the Company, exceed an amount equal to one third of the aggregate of: i the amount paid up on the share capital of the Company: ii the total of the capital and revenue reserves of the Company, including any share premium account, capital redemption reserve and credit balance on the profit and loss account as shown in the latest audited balance sheet and profit and loss account of the Company subject to certain adjustments detailed in the Companys Articles of Association.

The Board monitors the undiluted net asset value NAV and compares this with the MSCI World Index and other indices.
ii Maintenance of a reasonable level of discount or premium of share price to diluted net asset value.
iii Maintenance of reasonable level of total expense ratio TER compared with the Companys net assets.
Quantitative analysis of the above KPIs is shown in the next section below.
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE The Chairmans statement on pages 3 and 4 incorporates a review of the highlights during the year.
The Managers report on pages 5 to 10 gives details on investments made during the year and how performance has been achieved.

Therefore the total gain after tax for the Company was 91,833,000 2008: 91,375,000, loss.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Board considers that the risks faced by the Company fall into two main categories.
i External risks Price movements of the Companys investments are highly correlated to performance of global equities in general and small and mid cap equities in particular.
Consequently falls in stock markets are likely to negatively affect the performance of the Companys investments.
The Company invests in companies in Environmental Markets.
Such companies carry risks that government liberalisation may not occur as expected, costs of technology may not fall, capital spending by their customers is reduced or deferred and their products or services are not adopted.
The Company invests in companies with small market capitalisations, which are likely to be subject to higher valuation uncertainties and liquidity risks than larger capitalisation securities.
The Company also invests in unquoted securities which generally have higher valuation uncertainties and liquidity risks than securities listed or traded on a regulated market.
The Company invests in securities which are not denominated or quoted in sterling.
Movements of exchange rates between sterling and other currencies in which the Companys investments are denominated may have an unfavourable effect on the return in the investments made by the Company.
ii Internal risks The main risk areas are poor allocation of the Companys assets by the Investment Manager, poor governance by the Board and poor compliance or administration including the loss of investment trust status.
These factors could potentially result in unacceptable returns for shareholders.
RISK CONTROLS i External risks There are inherent risks involved in stock selection.
The Investment Manager is experienced and employs its expertise in selecting the stocks in which the Company invests.
The Manager spreads the investment risk over a wide portfolio of investments in three main sectors and at the year end the Company held investments in 94 companies.
The Company will not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but the Manager takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
Further detail on external risk controls is provided in note 14 to the accounts.
ii Internal risks The control of risks related to the Companys business areas is described in detail in the corporate governance report on pages 25 to 29.
OUTLOOK The outlook for the Company is discussed in the Chairmans Statement on page 4.

In the opinion of the directors, the Company has conducted its affairs so as to be able to seek approved investment trust status from the HM Revenue & Customs under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Company will seek such approval when these accounts are submitted.
Approval of investment trust status has been received for the year ended 31 December 2008.
SHARE ISSUES The authority to issue new shares for cash granted at the Annual General Meeting held on 11 May 2009 will expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Board recommends that the Company is granted a new authority to issue up to a maximum of 30,405,480 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 9.99% of the shares in issue, excluding Treasury Shares, at the date of this document and to disapply pre-emption rights when issuing those Ordinary Shares.
Resolutions to this effect will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The maximum number of Ordinary Shares which can be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange without the publication of a prospectus is 10% of the Ordinary Share Capital on a rolling previous 12 month basis at the time of admission of the shares.
Under the terms of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority relating to investment trust companies, the Company, being a closed-end investment trust, cannot make an issue of shares for cash in this way unless the price per share at which such shares are issued is not less than the net asset value of such shares.
WARRANTS Warrantholders have the right to subscribe in cash for all or any of the Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company to which the Warrantholder is entitled under the Warrants as follows: a on an annual basis, on 15 June in each of the years 2006 to 2010, both inclusive, or if such day is not a business day, then on the next business day: and b under certain other circumstances as described in the circular to shareholders dated 20 October 2005.
Each Warrant carries the right to subscribe for one Ordinary Share in cash at a subscription price of 96p per Ordinary Share.
The final subscription date will be on 15 June 2010.
A separate reminder subscription notice will be sent out to Warrantholders at least 28 days before but not more than 56 days before the subscription date.
On 15 June 2009 the holders of 438,068 Warrants subscribed in cash for Ordinary Shares on a one Warrant for one Ordinary Share basis and at a subscription price of 96p per Ordinary Share.
As a result 438,068 Ordinary Shares were issued.
In aggregate, net proceeds of 420,545 were received for these Ordinary Shares.
The new Ordinary Shares were admitted to trading on 22 June 2009.
At the year end 18,666,085 Warrants remained in issue.

CANCELLATION OF SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT As described in the circular dated 13 May 2009, the Company applied to the Court for the cancellation of its share premium in order to create additional distributable reserves which would be available for the buy back of its own Ordinary Shares.
The cancellation was approved by shareholders on 4 June 2009, confirmed by the Court on 8 July 2009 and became effective on 15 July 2009.
An amount of 246,486,789 was transferred from the share premium account to the share purchase reserve on the effective date.
