Business Review Exploration MALTA In December 2007, the SICILY Group entered into a Siracusa PSC with the Maltese Tunis Government for a 100% interest in areas 2 and 7 in the south-eastern MALTA offshore region of Malta.
The licences cover almost 18,000 square Area 2 kilometres and are situated approximately 80 TUNISIA Medina Bank-1 kilometres and 140 kilometres, for Area 2 and Area 7 respectively, from the south-eastern Stax Maltese coast in water depths of Area 7 approximately 300 metres.
The two Areas are close to a number of producing fields offshore Libya and Tunisia.
The licences are under-explored with only one well previously drilled in Area 2: the Heritage Licence Exploration Well Medina Bank-1 well in 1980.
The well was Oil and Gas Shows drilled to a depth of 1,225 metres but failed Oil Field to reach the target horizons, estimated to Gas Field Tarbulus Tripoli be between 1,500 and 4,500 metres.
The Condensate LIBYA Maltese Licences well did, however, encounter gas shows in porous, fractured carbonates.
Current seismic interpretation is based on an extensive data set of almost 3,500 Area Date Heritage kilometres of 2D seismic acquired in 2000.

Primary targets are Area 7 8,778 December 2007 100% Miocene, Lower Eocene and Cretaceous mounded carbonates that are recognised as major hydrocarbon producing zones in the central part of the Mediterranean.
In addition, the Company has recognised the presence of a north-south trending shelf margin on the eastern margin of the blocks and a number of attractive reef prospects have been mapped.
Heritage will acquire a further 1,000 kilometres of 2D seismic this year and a high impact exploration well is planned for the second half of 2010 targeting approximately 500 mmboe.
