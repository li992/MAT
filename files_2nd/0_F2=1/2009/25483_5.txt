- Income from Experien included for the full period compared to six months in the prior year.
- Decreased arrangement fees, exit fees and deferred income as a result of lower activity levels.
- Tighter net interest margins resulting from an increase in the cost of funding.
The impact of IAS 18 has resulted in a cumulative R576 million 31 March 2008: R648 million of lending fees in the South African business being deferred for future recognition.
The decrease in net fees and commissions receivable re ects reduced contributions across all three geographies.
Europe fell the most off a higher base.
General Banking, Private Wealth Management and Trust and Fiduciary had similar contributions to the prior year.
Each of the lending specialisations had lower contributions as a result of reduced activity levels and limited exit fees.
Principal transactions include the revaluations and realisations of equity and warrant positions held these are associated with our lending activities and the manner in which certain of our deals are structured.
The decrease in principal transactions re ects dif cult market conditions which have impacted the quantum and timing of revaluations and exit opportunities.
Furthermore, a number of signi cant transactions were recorded in the prior year.
Impairment losses on loans and advances have increased in all three geographies as a result of the weaker credit environment.
The decrease in expenses is mainly a result of lower variable remuneration in line with reduced pro tability.

Customer deposits showed a net out ow in the third quarter of the year at the height of the upheaval in the financial markets.
This trend was reversed during December 2008 when net in ows were recorded and growth has been strong ever since.
The Banking business continues to be a key focus area where distribution teams, product and marketing have all bene ted from a signi cant increase in investment.
The High 5, a three month notice deposit, has been particularly successful in attracting new clients to the Investec brand.
Activity levels in the lending specialisations have been lower.
The focus has been on managing underperforming loans and seeking out the opportunistic transactions which arise in this market.
In certain areas the competitive landscape has been completely reshaped, presenting an opportunity for Investec Private Bank to build a portfolio and brand which previously would have been impossible.
The Private Wealth Management business has been under pressure as a result of market conditions and the performance of certain special opportunities.
This specialisation remains a key area of focus and will continue to bene t from investment over the coming period.
44 Annual report 2009 Divisional review Private Banking Partner of choice from wealth creation to wealth management The Trust and Fiduciary business has again shown modest growth in revenues on the back of reduced activity levels from private clients.
Investec Administration Services, a Guernsey based funds administration business, was sold during the fourth quarter of the year.
The sale had an immaterial impact on overall pro ts.
Southern Africa Trading conditions deteriorated in South Africa during the second half of the year.
Customer deposits showed a net out ow in the second and third quarters of the year at the height of the upheaval in the financial markets.
This trend was reversed during December 2008 when net in ows were recorded and growth has been positive ever since.
Money markets were tight throughout the period, making funding through securitisation vehicles more dif cult than in the past.
Assets under management were under pressure as a result of market conditions, as well as the performance of certain special opportunities.
This specialisation did however attract R2.7 billion of new money over the period.
The Structured Property Finance specialisation is experiencing lower activity levels, particularly in the residential development space.
The commercial property market is showing resilience despite current market conditions.
In the Growth and Acquisition specialisation activity levels have remained strong throughout the year.
Exits have, however, been delayed due to the economic environment and some write-downs have been taken on equity stakes and pro t shares held.
The loan portfolio in the Banking business performed well albeit in more dif cult economic conditions.
This serves to illustrate the sound credit quality of our client base.
The private bank account business did, however, suffer from reduced point of sale income as private client spending was lower.
The Insurance business was sold to Santam Ltd with effect from 1 December 2008.
This had an immaterial impact on overall pro ts.
Australia The professional finance business of Investec-Experien has been fully integrated into Investec Private Bank and now operates under the Investec-Experien brand.
This business has provided a diversi cation to the historical lending portfolio and has achieved book growth of 30%.
Through product innovation, broadening of distribution channels and the depositor base, and the introduction of the Government Guarantee scheme, private client deposits have increased by 46% during the period under review.
The cost of retail funds has however, also increased.
Lending activities in Structured Property Finance, Specialised Lending and Growth and Acquisition Finance have been negatively affected by the economic environment.
Activity levels are down and there have been no material realisations of equity stakes and pro t shares.
Outlook, risks and uncertainties Current market conditions continue to have a negative impact on impairments, realisations and activity levels across each of the lending specialisations.
We expect growth in the combined total loan portfolio to be at for the year ahead, and we will continue to re-price existing assets.
Substantial investment will continue to be made in our general banking business targeting retail deposits.
The drive to accelerate the contribution of our Private Wealth Management business will be supported by further investment.
We will continue to focus on realigning costs to future revenues.
Management of impairments and underperforming loans remains a key focus in all geographies for the forthcoming period.
The business will continue to seek out opportunistic transactions resulting from the fallout in the broader market.

Ongoing deterioration in international economies and the consequent effects on corporate pro ts should add to investor disaffection towards equities notwithstanding good, long-term value currently presented in certain parts of the market.
Similarly speculative trading activity is expected to decrease as volatility subsides and share price inef ciencies gradually diminish, thereby reducing prospective short-term returns.
We are reasonably con dent that current and future business strategies which focus on alternative commission and brokerage revenue, together with the large annuity fee income stream earned from discretionary assets under management, should help offset reductions in traditional share trading and other non-discretionary brokerage income.
Furthermore, our conservative risk management policies in prior years leaves us relatively unexposed to the direct effects of the credit market collapse particularly where this relates to trading activity in leveraged derivative instruments Single Stock Futures and CFDs and client carry accounts.
We continue to focus on disciplined cost management and are optimistic that expenses can be controlled without detracting from client service quality levels and the high calibre staff resources that we employ.
We are con dent that our business strategies and various specialised services are suited to the current environment and that our solid position will allow us to capitalise on any distressed opportunities within the industry.
