22-30 Operations R 3 25 10 8:39 AM Page 5 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K PROCESSING A total of 2 946 706 tonnes of ore was milled at a reconciled head grade of 4.22g t, with throughput being 8.3% higher than the prior years 2 721 208 tonnes as a result of the crushing and process plant upgrade.
At the crushing plant, the two secondary crushers were replaced by one super secondary crusher with three tertiary crushers against two in the previous flow sheet.
These changes allowed the operation to reach the higher hourly and daily throughput of 650 and 12 500 tonnes respectively.
The challenge is to optimise and maintain this high throughput by managing the secondary relining and good coordination of operation and maintenance downtimes.
The screening before the secondary crusher has been removed.
A screening plant has been commissioned during the year, giving a finer product for the process plant feed P80 12mm.
The hard rock crusher throughput was 3 117 251 tonnes and was 16.1% higher than the previous year of 2 686 060 tonnes.
ENGINEERING During the year maintenance activities, including upgrades and modifications, were carried out according to schedule, resulting in the achievement of the budgeted combined mills and crusher availabilities of 95% and 85% respectively.
Looking forward the mine is examining the implementation of an integrated planned maintenance system, to ensure the highest levels of availability and production.
UNDERGROUND MINING AND DEVELOPMENT During 2009, a total of 5 788 metres of development was completed and 500 267 tonnes of ore at a grade of 4.38g t was hauled to surface.
Despite the slower than planned build up, the development rates are now increasing, with the December development of 618 metres and 56 634 ore tonnes representing monthly project records.
The following table shows a summary of the underground sections progress to date.
