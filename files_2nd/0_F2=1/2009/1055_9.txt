However, the relative speed and extent of the recovery in the copper price Copper concentrate market during 2009 was stronger than many had envisaged at the start of the year.
The concentrate market has continued to be in deficit, with available This was driven mainly by strong demand from China as a result of underlying smelting capacity significantly in excess of mine supply, resulting in low growth, restocking and support from the government-led fiscal stimulus treatment and refining charges TC RCs which favour mine producers.

The price rose relatively steadily tonnes of contained copper in 2010, with a deficit expected to continue throughout most of 2009, and by 31 December 2009 had reached 333.2 for a number of years.

The general increase in the copper price during 2009 resulted in positive provisional pricing adjustments: conversely, the sharp fall in the copper price in the second half of 2008 had resulted in negative adjustments in that year.
