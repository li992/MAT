NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 March 2009 1.
Segmental analysis Primary reporting format business segments The groups principal activities include: the provision of networked IT services: local, national and international telecommunications services: broadband and internet products and services: and converged xed mobile products and services.
The group is organised into four customer-facing lines of business, BT Global Services, BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach, which are supported by two internal functional units, BT Design and BT Operate.
The activities of each of the customer-facing lines of business are as follows: BT Global Services serves major corporate, carrier and government organisations across the world, providing high-performance managed networked IT services, application management, professional services and outsourcing solutions.
BT Retail serves consumer customers and small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs in the UK, providing a range of innovative communications products and services.
BT Retail also includes BT Ireland, which operates across the major corporate, SME, consumer and wholesale markets throughout the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Enterprises, which comprises a number of individual businesses such as BT Conferencing, BT Directories and BT Payphones.
BT Wholesale provides services to UK communications providers through a diverse portfolio ranging from nationally available broadband, voice and data connectivity services and interconnect to bespoke, fully managed network outsourcing and value-added solutions.
Openreach is responsible for the crucial first mile connecting communications providers customers to their local telephone exchange, giving them equal, open and economic access to the UK network.
Openreach products are sold on an equivalent basis to BT lines of business and other communications providers at the same arms length prices, with the BT lines of business being treated no differently than any other customer with regard to terms and conditions or access to systems and data.
BT Design and BT Operate are internal functional units which support the four customer-facing lines of business.
BT Design is responsible for the design and build of the platforms, systems and processes which support the provision of the groups products and services, and BT Operate is responsible for their operation.
The groups reportable segments are the four customer-facing lines of business: neither BT Design nor BT Operate are reportable segments.
Neither BT Design nor BT Operate generate any revenue and both operate on a cost recovery basis.
The costs incurred by BT Design and BT Operate are allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
The depreciation and amortisation incurred by BT Operate in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the customer-facing lines of the business are allocated to the lines of business based on their respective utilisation.
The assets managed by BT Operate and their capital expenditure in the year are also allocated to the lines of business in a manner consistent with their depreciation and amortisation.
Accordingly, the segmental results do not necessarily reect the operating results of the lines of business as if they were independent business operations.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business.
In addition to the four customer-facing lines of business, the remaining operations of the group are aggregated and included within the Other category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group.
In the prior year the results of Other included any over or under recovery of costs by BT Design and BT Operate.
In the current year, all costs from BT Design and BT Operate have been fully allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
This amounts to 32m of operating costs and 129m of depreciation and amortisation in the year to 31 March 2009.
In 2008, there was no such allocation as we were transforming the business and developing the trading model.

b Leaver costs exclude manager leaver costs associated with the groups transformation and reorganisation activities during 2009 and 2008.
Manager leaver costs associated with the transformation activities have been recorded as a specific item.
Other leaver costs are included within wages and salaries and social security costs.
c Research and development expenditure includes amortisation of 431m 2008: 325m, 2007: 314m in respect of internally developed computer software.
In 2009, the group recognised contract and financial review charges of 1,639m, of which 1,598m was recorded within other operating costs and 41m was recorded as a reduction to revenue.
As described on page 3, the financial review covered the financial performance of BT Global Services and its balance sheet position.
The contract reviews covered the largest and most complex contracts.
These charges reect a more cautious view of the recognition of future cost efficiencies and other changes in the underlying assumptions and estimates, particularly in the light of the current economic outlook and events occurring during the year.
The total charge of 1,639m was allocated against the following assets and liabilities: intangible assets 241m: non current trade and other receivables 913m: prepayments 52m: accrued income 41m: provisions 256m: 136m was allocated against a number of other balance sheet categories and the individual amounts are insignicant.

Specic items The group separately identies and discloses significant one off or unusual items termed specic items.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and we believe it assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
A denition of specic items is provided on page 30.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2009 51 9.
Intangible assets continued Impairments test of goodwill The group performs an annual goodwill impairment test, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services and the following business units within BT Retail: Consumer, BT Business, BT Ireland and Enterprises.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services Consumer BT Business BT Ireland Enterprises Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2007 691 57 16 55 819 Acquisitions through business combinations 250 13 34 297 Disposals and adjustments 39 23 62 Exchange differences 11 11 At 1 April 2008 913 47 34 16 55 1,065 Acquisitions through business combinations 74 10 10 68 162 Disposals and adjustments 1 1 Exchange differences 252 17 269 At 31 March 2009 1,240 57 44 16 140 1,497 The key assumptions used in performing the impairment test, by CGU, are shown below: BT Retail BT Global Services Consumer BT Business BT Ireland Enterprises Method of determining recoverable amount Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Discount rate 11.1% 11.1% 11.1% 11.1% 11.1% Perpetuity growth rate 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash ow projections derived from financial plans approved by the board covering a three year period and a further two years approved by the line of business and group senior management team.
They reect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA and operating cash ows, based on past experience and future expectations, for performance of the businesses.
The forecast operating cash ows for BT Global Services include the benets expected to arise from the revised operating model and the cash ows associated with the restructuring charges.
Cash ows beyond the five year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the different risk proles of the individual CGUs.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the sector in which the CGU operates.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The growth rates used in 2009 are higher than those used in previous years and are more closely aligned to managements assessment for each CGUs long-term growth.
Sensitivities For the BT Retail CGUs, significant headroom exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 850m.
The following changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: a reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.5% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 0.0% or less: an increase in the discount rate from the 11.1% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 12.9% or more: a reduction in the projected operating cash ows across five years by 18% or more.
A reduction in forecast operating cashows could arise from the lower than anticipated realisation of cost savings from the revised operating model, particularly in the next two financial years.

A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2009 m Expiry of losses Restricted losses: Americas 271 2009-2029 Europe 1,875 2009-2024 Total restricted losses 2,146 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 3,410 no expiry Capital losses 17,780 no expiry Other 932 no expiry Total unrestricted losses 22,122 Total 24,268 At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 10.1bn 2008: 10.6bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.

Related party transactions Amounts paid to the groups retirement benefit plans are set out in note 27.
There were a number of transactions during the year between the company and its subsidiary undertakings, which are eliminated on consolidation and therefore not disclosed.
British Telecommunications plc principally acts as a funder and deposit taker for cash related transactions for both its parent and ultimate parent company.
The loan arrangements described below with these companies reect this.
Cash transactions usually arise where the parent and ultimate parent company are required to meet their external payment obligations or receive amounts from third parties.
These principally relate to the payment of dividends, the buy back of shares and the exercise of share options.
Transactions between the ultimate parent company, parent company and the group are settled on both a cash and non-cash basis through these loan accounts depending on the nature of the transaction.
In the 2002 financial year, the group demerged its former mobile phone business and as a result BT Group plc became the listed ultimate parent company of the remaining group.
The demerger steps resulted in the formation of an intermediary holding company, BT Group Investments Limited, between BT Group plc and British Telecommunications plc.
This intermediary company held an investment of 18.5bn in British Telecommunications plc which was funded by an intercompany loan facility with British Telecommunications plc.
At 31 March 2009, the amount of loan outstanding amounted to 18,226m 2008: 17,950m of non current asset investments and 404m 2008: 646m of current assets investments see note 11.
The loan facility accrued interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points, is subject to an overall maximum of 25bn, and is either repayable on demand or on 2 February 2015.
In the 2009 financial year, the loan increased to reect the settlement of interest, net of amounts settled in cash, and to fund the parent company for amounts it had due to the ultimate parent company.
This was offset by amounts due to the parent company in respect of dividends.
Interest income of 1,005m was recognised in the 2009 financial year 2008: 1,184m, 2007: 994m see note 5.
The parent company primarily nances its obligations on the loan as they fall due through dividends paid by the company.
In addition, at 31 March 2009, the group had amounts payable to the parent company of 238m 2008: 304m which accrued interest charges of 15m 2008: 13m and non interest bearing amounts receivable of 10m 2008: 258m and payable of 76m 2008: 317m.
The group also had amounts due to the ultimate parent company of 123m 2008: 996m which accrued interest charges of 25m 2008: 50m.
At 31 March 2009, the group had a non interest bearing amount due to the ultimate parent company of 4m 2008: nil and at 31 March 2008 also had an interest bearing amount due from the ultimate holding company of 8m.
During the year the group acquired 98.9% of the issued share capital of Net 2S SA from the ultimate parent company for consideration of 64m, settled in cash.
The company holds ordinary shares in the ultimate parent company, disclosed in note 11.
Key management personnel are deemed to be the members of the Operating Committee.
Of the seven 2008 and 2007: five members of the Operating Committee, four 2008: four, 2007: five were members of the Board of the ultimate parent company.
It is the Operating Committee which has responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group.
Key management personnel compensation is shown in the table below: 2009 2008 2007 m m m Salaries and short-term benets 6.8 7.0 6.5 Termination benets 2.4 Post employment benets 2.3 1.0 1.4 Share based payments 3.6 5.0 3.2 15.1 13.0 11.1 During 2009, the group purchased services in the normal course of business and on an arms length basis from its principal associate, Tech Mahindra Limited.
The net value of services purchased was 296m 2008: 305m, 2007: 178m and the amount outstanding and payable for services at 31 March 2009 was 89m 2008: 125m, 2007: 97m.
In 2008, a cash payment of 55m was received from Tech Mahindra Limited, representing income of 28m and a prepayment of 27m.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities Capital expenditure contracted for at the balance sheet date but not yet incurred was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Property, plant and equipment 414 639 Software 37 101 Total 451 740 Future minimum operating lease payments for the group were as follows: 2009 2008 m m Payable in the year ending 31 March: 2009 469 2010 484 453 2011 455 432 2012 430 408 2013 403 388 2014 377 365 Thereafter 5,855 6,227 Total future minimum operating lease payments 8,004 8,742 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings.
Leases have an average term of 23 years 2008: 24 years and rentals are xed for an average of 23 years 2008: 24 years.
At 31 March 2009, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
62 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 25.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities continued The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O UK Limited prior to its demerger with O on 19 November 2 2 2001.
O plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure is US$110m as at 31 March 2009 2008: 2 US$72m, approximately 77m 2008: 36m, although this could increase by a further US$399m 2008: US$402m, approximately 278m 2008: 202m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O UK 2 Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS universal mobile telecommunications system auction in 2000.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor has appealed the courts decision.
If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK government set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on state aid.
It concluded that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision has now been appealed but the company continues to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless, and that the appeal will not succeed.

Retirement benefit plans Background The group offers retirement benefit plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 when it was replaced by a dened contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan BTRP.
On 1 April 2009 BT set up the BT Retirement Saving Scheme, a contract based dened contribution arrangement to which BTRP members are being invited to transfer their accumulated assets.
The total pension cost of the group for the year included within staff costs was 543m 2008: 626m, 2007: 643m.
The total cost associated with the groups dened benefit pension schemes was 459m 2008: 576m, 2007: 600m.
Dened contribution schemes The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the group based on a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension cost for the year in respect of the groups main dened contribution scheme was 47m 2008: 37m, 2007: 28m and 4m 2008: 3m, 2007: 3m of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2009.
Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the trust deed of the BTPS, there are nine trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions including the Chairman of the Trustees.
Four trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 Scheme assets are measured at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
The liabilities of the BTPS are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash ows are discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of an equivalent term to the liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The financial assumptions used to measure the net pension obligation of the BTPS at 31 March 2009 are as follows: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 % %% % % Rate used to discount liabilities 3.84 3.24 2.28 6.85 6.85 5.35 a a a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 0.75 2.90 4.28 3.77 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.90 3.50 3.00 Ination average increase in retail price index 2.90 3.50 3.00 a There is a short-term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.5% for the first three years.

The expected returns on xed interest and index-linked are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
Alternative asset classes include commodities and hedge funds.
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income.

Retirement benefit plans continued Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the BTPS scheme liabilities The assumed discount rate, mortality rates and salary increases all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions.
Impact on liability Decrease increase bn 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.2 salary increases 0.3 Additional 1 year increase to life expectancy 1.3 Funding valuation and future funding obligations A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent Trustee by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December as this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2008 has reached an advanced stage of completion.
As the parties are at an advanced stage compared to other scheme valuations and given the uncertain market conditions, the Pensions Regulator has indicated it wishes to discuss with the Trustee and BT the underlying assumptions and basis of the valuation.
The Pensions Regulator has requested that the valuation and assumptions are not nalised or disclosed in advance of the completion of those discussions.
BT, the Trustee and the Pensions Regulator are keen to complete this as soon as practicable.
BT and the Trustee agreed in May 2009 that deficit contributions of 525m per annum will be made in cash, or in specie, over the next three years.
This agreement has been approved by the Pensions Regulator.
The last two triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2005 2002 2005 2002 valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%% Discount rate Pre retirement liabilities 3.06 5.84 Post retirement liabilities 1.79 4.54 Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 7.13 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 3.53 Return on future investments 4.00 6.60 Average increase in retail price index 2.70 2.50 a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 1.5 3.47 4.04 Average increase in pensions 2.70 2.50 a There is a short-term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
At 31 December 2005, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 34.4bn 2002: 22.8bn and were sufficient to cover 90.9% 2002: 91.6% of the benets accrued by that date.
This represented a funding deficit of 3.4bn compared with 2.1bn at 31 December 2002.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions.
The market value of equity investments had increased and the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid in the three years ended 31 December 2005.
However, the deficit had not improved by the same amount as the assets because the liabilities included longer life expectancy assumptions and used a lower discount rate.
Under the 2005 valuation the ordinary contributions rate was 19.5% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions of 6% and deficit contributions were 280m per annum.
In 2009, the group made regular contributions of 433m 2008: 380m.
No deficit contributions were made in 2009 as they had been paid in advance during 2008.
We expect the regular contribution rate to reduce as a result of the implementation of the future benefit changes, following the UK pensions review, with effect from 1 April 2009.
The intention is for there to be sufficient assets in the scheme to pay pensions now and in the future.
Without any further contribution from the company, it is estimated that as at 31 December 2005, the assets of the scheme would have been sufficient to provide around 70% of the members benets with an insurance company.
If the group were to become insolvent, however, there are a number of additional protections available to members.
Firstly, there is the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984.
This applies, on a winding up of the group, to pension entitlements for anyone who joined the scheme before 6 August 1984, and to payments to beneciaries of such persons.
Secondly, the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay certain benets to members.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2009 69 27.
Retirement benefit plans continued Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
Directors emoluments and pensions For the year ended 31 March 2009 the aggregate emoluments of the directors was 3,598,000 2008: 5,052,000.
This includes deferred bonuses of 420,000 2008: 1,877,000 which have been awarded and are payable in 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc in three years time subject to continuous employment.
Retirement benets were accruing to three directors 2008: one under a dened benefit pension scheme.
During the year one director exercised options 2008: one under BT Group share option plans.
Five directors who held ofce for the whole or part of the year 2008: four received or are entitled to receive 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc under BT long-term incentive plans.
The aggregate value of BT Group plc shares vested in directors during the year under BT long-term incentive plans was 3,905,562.
The emoluments of the highest paid director were 1,277,000 2008: 3,350,000.
He is not entitled to receive any BT Group plc 5p ordinary shares under BT long-term incentive plans.
Included in the above aggregate emoluments are those of Ian Livingston, Tony Chanmugam and Hanif Lalani, who are also directors of the ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, as well as Ben Verwaayen who resigned as a director of British Telecommunications plc and BT Group plc on 30 June 2008.
The directors do not believe it is practicable for the purposes of this report to apportion the amounts of total emoluments received by them between their services as directors of the company and their services as directors of BT Group plc.
Share based payments The total charge recognised in 2009 in respect of share based payments was 31m 2008: 73m, 2007: 93m.
The ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, has an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share based payment plans are equity settled and details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

Share based payments continued Share Options BT Group Employee Sharesave plans There is an HMRC approved savings related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a xed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five year plans and 10% for three year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, for employees in the US, enables participants to purchase American Depositary Shares ADSs quarterly at a price which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the end of each quarterly purchase period.
The sixth offer under the ESPP was cancelled in December 2008 as the market price of an ADS had been lower than the Initial Base Option Price for three consecutive quarters.
The seventh offer under the ESPP which does not base the purchase price on the Initial Base Option Price, was launched in December 2008.
From 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009, nil shares were transferred to participants out of treasury shares under the ESPP from 15 May 2007 to 31 March 2008 1,596,480 shares 159,648 ADSs were transferred to participants out of treasury shares under the ESPP.
The following are legacy option plans which are no longer operated by the ultimate parent company.
BT Group Global Share Option Plan GSOP The options granted in previous years were exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets.
Options must be exercised within ten years of the grant date.
BT Group Legacy Option Plan GLOP On the demerger of 02, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave plans and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was launched on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger of 02 in November 2001, and is therefore outside the scope of IFRS 2.
The options were exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets.
Options must be exercised within ten years of the original grant date.
Share Plans Incentive Share Plan, Retention Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan Under the BT Group Incentive Share Plan ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
The corporate performance measure is BTs total shareholder return TSR measured against a comparator group of companies from the European Telecom Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
Under the BT Group Retention Share Plan RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest annually in tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the employee is still employed by the group.
Under the BT Group Deferred Bonus Plan DBP awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP, RSP and DBP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP The ESIP is an HMRC approved plan that has been in operation since December 2001.
It allows BT employees to buy shares with contributions of up to 1,500 per tax year out of gross pay directshare and allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years allshare.
During 2009, 10.7m directshare shares 2008: 5.4m directshare shares, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 20,384 2008: 19,603 employees at a total cost of 16.4m 2008: 15.8m.
A further 3.3m shares 2008: 1.4m shares were purchased by the Trustee by dividend reinvestment on behalf of 21,782 2008: 22,136 allshare and directshare employee participants.
In 2008, allshare was replaced by free BT Total Broadband Option 3 for all BT employees in the UK.
Employees outside the UK continue to receive awards of shares where practicable, otherwise they will receive awards equivalent to the value of free shares.

Awards under the ISP have been valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs were generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reect the BT share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Sharesave options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the RSP and DBP were determined using the middle market share price three days prior to the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for RSP awards granted in 2009 was 151p 2008: 310p, 2007: 267p.

The audit of the companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation represents fees payable for services in relation to the audit of the financial statements of subsidiary companies.
The increase in 2009 includes the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements and an increase in relation to newly-acquired subsidiaries.
Other services pursuant to legislation represents fees payable for services in relation to other statutory lings or engagements that are required to be carried out by the appointed auditor.
In particular, this includes fees for audit reports issued on the groups regulatory financial statements.
Tax services represents fees payable for tax compliance and advisory services.
Services relating to corporate finance transactions represent fees payable in relation to due diligence work completed on acquisitions and disposals.
All other services represents fees payable for non-regulatory reporting on internal controls and other advice on accounting or financial matters.
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non-audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies, work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value-added benets to the company.
Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term and shortterm borrowings mainly using commercial paper supported by committed borrowing facilities.
The group borrows in the major long-term bond markets in major currencies and typically, but not exclusively, these markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from funding its overseas operations, acquisitions, overseas assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The financial instruments used comprise forward currency contracts.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investments and counterparty credit risk arising with financial institutions.
The centralised treasury operation also manages the groups market risk exposures, including risks arising from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The centralised treasury operation acts as a central bank to members of the BT group providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The centralised treasury operation is not a profit centre and the objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The BT Group plc Board sets the policy for the groups centralised treasury operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments and group wide exposures under its management.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated its authority to operate these polices to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director of the BT Group plc Board.
The key policies dened by the BT Group plc Board are highlighted in each of the sections below.
The financial risk management of exposures arising from trading related financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply these policies and procedures and perform review processes to assess and manage financial risk exposures arising from these financial instruments.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2009 and the date of these financial statements.
74 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Interest rate risk management The group has interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities which may expose the group to either cash ow or fair value volatility.
The BT Group plc Board policy is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at xed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the centralised treasury operation whilst long-term interest rate management decisions requires further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
In order to manage this prole, the group has entered into swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under cross currency swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, US dollar and Euro xed rates into either xed or oating Sterling interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under Sterling interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate Sterling interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The group primarily uses a combination of these derivatives to x its interest rates.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of hedging instruments.
Outstanding currency and interest rate swaps at 31 March 2009 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives sections below.
The majority of the groups investments relate to amounts owed by the parent and the ultimate parent company, they are predominantly denominated in Sterling and earn a oating rate interest by reference to LIBOR interest rates.
The group is exposed to income statement and shareholders equity volatility arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 100 basis point increase 2008: 100 basis point increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
All adjustments to interest rates for the impacted financial instruments are assumed to take effect from the respective balance sheet date.
After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from investments mainly amounts owed by the parent and ultimate parent companies, variable rate borrowings and fair value movements on derivatives not in hedging relationships which are largely influenced by Sterling rates of interest by reference to LIBOR rates.
Trade payables, trade receivables and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to interest rate volatility.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of balance sheet financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 March 2009, a 100 basis point increase 2008: 100 basis point increase in Sterling interest rates would increase the groups annual net finance income by approximately 180m 2008: 180m.
The groups main IFRS 7 dened exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest exposure to Sterling, Euro and US dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 100 basis point increase 2008: 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, pre tax, as follows: 2009 2008 m m Charge credit Charge credit Sterling interest rates 550 470 US dollar interest rates 538 347 Euro interest rates 149 91 The long-term debt instruments which the group issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants providing that if the BT Group plc groups credit rating were downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next coupon period at a rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In March 2009, both Moodys and S&P downgraded BT Group plcs credit rating to Baa2 and BBB, respectively.
Prior to this financial year, S&P downgraded BT Group plcs credit rating to BBB plus in July 2006 and Moodys downgraded BT Group plcs credit rating to Baa1 in May 2001.
Based on debt of 5.8bn outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2009, BT plcs annual consolidated finance expense would increase by approximately 28m if BT Group plcs credit rating were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa2 BBB.
If BT Group plcs credit rating with each of Moodys and S&P were to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual finance expense would be reduced by approximately 28m.
Foreign exchange risk management The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The BT Group plc Board policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the centralised treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions requires further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Treasurer to take positions of up to 100m and for the BT Group plc Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1bn.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2009 75 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued A significant proportion of the groups current revenue is invoiced in Sterling, and a significant element of its operations and costs arise within the UK.
The groups overseas operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
The groups foreign currency borrowings, which totalled 10.1bn at 31 March 2009 2008: 6.9bn, are used to finance its operations and have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross currency swaps.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally US dollar and Euro denominated.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.
After hedging, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening in Sterling against other currencies, would result in a credit of approximately 40m in 2009 and did not have a significant impact in 2008.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity would be insignicant in both 2009 and 2008.
Outstanding cross currency swaps at 31 March 2009 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives sections below.
Credit risk management The groups exposure to credit risk arises mainly from financial assets transacted by the centralised treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading related receivables.
For treasury related balances, the BT Group plc Board dened policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and Standard and Poors and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
The centralised treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Management review significant utilisations on a regular basis to determine the adjustments required, if any, and actively manage any exposures which may arise.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk.
Currently the group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation.
In addition, where possible the group will seek a combination of legal right of set off and net settlement.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
During the 2009 financial year, the centralised treasury operation tightened the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties in response to market conditions and continued to monitor their credit quality and actively managed any exposures which arose.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008 was as follows: 2009 2008 m m Derivative financial assets 2,700 387 Investments 18,855 19,096 a Trade and other receivables 3,111 3,420 Cash and cash equivalents 1,287 1,418 Total 25,953 24,321 a The carrying amount excludes 1,084m 2008: 1,257m of current and 322m 2008: 854m of non current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets.
Note 15 discloses the credit concentration and credit quality of derivative financial assets.
After applying a legal right of set off under the groups International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation, the group had a net exposure to derivative counterparties of 2,282m.
Of this, 85% was with six counterparties.
The majority of these derivatives are in designated cash ow hedges.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of net derivative financial assets at 31 March 2009, a 100 basis point increase in yield curves across each of the ratings categories within which these derivative financial assets are classied would reduce their carrying values and impact equity, pre tax, as follows: Impact of 100 basis point increase m Moodys S&P credit rating Aa2 AA 18 Aa3 AA- 21 A1 A 92 A2 A 146 A3 A- 277 The group also has credit exposure arising on amounts owed by its parent and ultimate parent companies, with the majority of this balance being owed by the parent company.
The related party disclosures detailed in note 24 provide details of how this loan has arisen.
The loan owed by the parent company is primarily supported by the parent companys investment in British Telecommunications plc.
The credit quality of other treasury related financial assets is provided in notes 8 and 11.
76 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2009 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The groups credit policy for trading related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection when appropriate, taking into consideration the customers exposure to the group, by applying processes which include netting and off-setting and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group has taken proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading related financial assets.
The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 13 which analyses outstanding balances by line of business and reects the nature of customers in each segment.
Liquidity risk management The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the centralised treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
The groups liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ows and considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources and back-up facilities.
The BT Group plc Board reviews the BT Group plc consolidated forecasts which incorporates the British Telecommunications plc consolidated group, including cash ow forecasts, on a quarterly basis.
The centralised treasury operation reviews cash ows more frequently to assess the short and medium-term requirements.
These assessments ensure the group responds to possible future cash constraints in a timely manner.
Liquid assets surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed by the centralised treasury operation.
Requests from group companies for operating finance are met whenever possible from central resources.
During 2009, debt amounting to 0.9bn matured consisting of Sterling oating rate notes.
This was offset by new issuances of 1.5bn mainly consisting of a 1bn bond at 6.5% repayable in 2015, which was swapped 0.8bn at an average annualised pound sterling interest rate of 7.7%, and commercial paper.
In addition, investments of 0.3bn matured and amounts due to the parent and ultimate parent companies increased by 1.0bn.
During 2008, debt amounting to 1.9bn matured consisting of 2007 US dollar 7% notes, finance leases and commercial paper.
This was more than offset by new issuances of 3.9bn mainly consisting of issuances through the groups European Medium Term Note and US Shelf programmes with maturities ranging between 2013 and 2037 and bank loans see note 14.
The group has a European Medium Term Note programme and a US Shelf registration in place of which 3.9bn and $6.9bn respectively, have been utilised.
During the 2009 and 2008 financial years the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current asset investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2009, the group had an undrawn committed borrowing facility of up to 1,500m 2008: 1,500m.
The facility is available for the period to January 2013.
The group had an additional undrawn committed borrowing facility of 900m 2008: 935m, of which 800m 2008: 835m was agreed in the 2009 financial year, with a further 100m being agreed after the balance sheet date in both 2009 and 2008.
This facility is for a term of 364 days from March 2009 with a oneyear term out.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
The group has no significant debt maturities until December 2010.

Other derivatives At 31 March 2009, the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales and had a notional principal amount of 533m for purchases of currency 2008: 295m and had a maturity period of under nine months 2008: under nine months.
Interest rate swaps not in hedging relationships under IAS 39 had a notional principal amount of 1.9bn 2008: 1.9bn and mature between 2014 and 2030 2008: 2014 and 2030.
The interest receivable under these swap contracts is at a weighted average rate of 6% 2008: 6.9% and interest payable is at a weighted average rate of 7.6% 2008: 8.5%.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their fair value movements.
The group entered into credit default swap contracts to economically hedge part of its US dollar denominated derivative financial assets.
These contracts had a notional principal of $90m 2008: $nil and mature within one year.
The group entered into a low cost borrowing structure during 2008 which was marginally earnings positive after tax.
The structure included a forward currency contract for the sale of currency with a notional principal of 512m which had matured by 31 March 2008 realising a loss of 26m.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair value of financial instruments The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to their fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2009 and 2008.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair value of the financial instruments is the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
The carrying value of oating rate investments approximated to their fair values due to the frequent reset of interest rates to market rates.
The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist or the carrying value of oating rate borrowings approximated to their fair values due to the frequent reset of interest rates to market rates.
The fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts were the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
