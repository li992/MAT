Auditors The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the external auditors and their relationship with the Group, including monitoring the Groups use of the auditors for non-audit services.
Note 7 to the financial statements sets out details of the auditors remuneration.
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the existing auditors, KPMG Audit Plc be reappointed.
KPMG Audit Plc were appointed as auditors following the resignation of  LLP on 27 May 2009 KPMG Audit Plc have indicated their willingness to continue in of ce and ordinary resolutions reappointing them as auditors and authorising the directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at the 2010 AGM.
The directors in of ce at the date of signing of this report con rm that there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware and that each director has taken all reasonable steps to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting The 2010 Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday 5 May 2010 at 12.00 noon at 159 New Bond Street, London, W1S 2UD.
The notice of the meeting is on pages 114 to 120 with details of the resolutions proposed and explanatory notes.
Special business The resolutions proposed include an ordinary resolution classi ed by the Articles of Association as non-routine special business to renew the existing authority to the directors to allot up to 14.2 million shares with an aggregate nominal amount of up to 710,000 and to allot up to a further 14.2 million shares for fully pre-emptive rights issues.
The Board are also seeking to renew, by special resolution, the existing authorities to waive pre-emption rights and to make market purchases of ordinary shares under certain stringent conditions both subject to limits.
The annual special resolution seeking the authority to convene a general meeting other than the AGM with not less than 14 days notice is proposed as is the adoption of new Articles of Association following the full implementation of the Companies Act 2006.
A technical irregularity regarding the historic payment of dividends by the Company has been identi ed.
Distributions made by a company must not exceed the distributable pro ts as reported in the last set of relevant accounts of the company.
For the purposes of the Companies Acts the relevant accounts are either a companys last annual audited accounts or its latest interim accounts.
In order to rely on interim accounts to pay a dividend a company must le those interim accounts with the Registrar of Companies.
Whilst the Company has always been satis ed that it had suf cient reserves at the date of the payment of the dividend to shareholders, it has not always led the requisite interim accounts with the Registrar of Companies.
The appropriate relevant accounts for each dividend payment would therefore be deemed to be the Companys prior annual accounts and a number of dividend payments made have exceeded the distributable pro ts of the Company reported in those annual accounts.
This technical non-compliance with the terms of the Companies Acts could, in theory, result in a right for the Company to claim for repayment of the relevant dividends from shareholders who received those dividend payments and or from the directors who approved the payments.
In order to put the shareholders and directors into the position in which they were always intended to be the Company proposes to release and waive any such claims.
Resolutions will be put to shareholders at the AGM to approve such release and waiver and to protect directors and shareholders against any future claim.
To avoid a similar issue with the payment of the second interim dividend for 2009 on 31 March 2010, interim accounts of the Company to 28 February 2010 will be led at Companies House in accordance with Section 838 of the Companies Act 2006.
It is anticipated that all directors, including the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, will be at the AGM and available to answer questions.
