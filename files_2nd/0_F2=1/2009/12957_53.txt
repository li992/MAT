The main structure, which strikes between 350 and 020, is intersected by both northeast and northwest structures and there are prominent The discovery of Gounkoto and the quartz tourmaline units within the corridor.
continued success at Loulo 3 demonstrates the potential to add ounces from areas surrounding the Loulo mine.
Additionally a further three conceptual targets, identified from the airborne electromagnetic survey exist across the Faraba district, which have yet to be tested.
On the Bambadji joint venture in Senegal, but part of the Loulo district, a 9 122 metre Rotary Air Blast RAB and 827 metre RC drilling programme was completed in the first half of the year.
Positive results were returned from Kolya, Kabetea and Baquata targets, where both RAB and RC drilling intersected altered and mineralised rocks over considerable strike lengths.
At Kolya, for example, a tourmalinised sandstone has returned anomalous lithosamples and RAB intersections over a five kilometre strike.
In the north of the target, RC drill holes returned 7 metres at 3.12g t and 17 metres at 7.58g t. The Mananord and Kabewest targets have been eliminated from the resource triangle.
The discovery of Gounkoto and the continued success at Loulo 3 demonstrates the potential to add ounces from areas surrounding the mine, as well as in the Loulo district.
Loulo has historically shown the ability to increase the mineral resource base year on year and replace the ounces mined.
The companys objective has not only been to increase mineral reserves and resources at Loulo but to use it as a centre for regional exploration programmes.
Objectives for 2010 at Loulo include the completion of a feasibility study at Gounkoto, the definition of additional mineral resources from satellite deposits and the development of targets in the Bambadji joint venture in Senegal.
Morila exploitation lease Following extensive exploration over the life of mine, including a final drilling programme in the first quarter of 2009, on four conceptual targets which failed to intersect economic mineralisation, a decision was made to halt further exploration on the mining lease.
Southern Mali The newly acquired Mena permit, which is located to the southeast of the Morila mine, features a similar structural architecture to Morila with splays from the Banifin Shear Zone passing through the permit.
Work highlighted a small enclave of flat lying, high metamorphic grade sediments, in the southwest of the permit.
A programme of five oriented diamond drill holes was completed, and while not intersecting gold mineralisation, it did confirm the flat lying nature of the sediments, a  schist metamorphosed semipelitic sediment, metamorphosed to lower amphibolite facies and intruded by a complex igneous suite comprising granodiorite, tonalite, dolerite, granite, diorite, monzonite, and syenite.
This information is being integrated with the data from adjacent permits and gravity data to drive future programmes.
Generative work focused on interpreting regional radiometric data, integrating regional soil geochemistry, geology and knowledge from the research at Morila to develop a new geotectonic architecture for the region.
