Scottish and Southern Energy 10 Annual Report 2009 Thoughts on Generation Sustainability Affordability Glendoe Hydro Electric Scheme In December 2008 I went on a roadshow around SSEs major sites to mark the Reliabilit y 10th anniversary of the companys formation.
The highlight was an early morning visit to Glendoe to see the end of its first 24-hour run at its full load of 100MW.
This was my fifth visit to the project, starting with the ground-breaking back in 2006.
Dependabilit y Although Glendoe is a small part of our overall 6.7bn investment programme, it has always been my personal favourite as it demonstrates a successful blend of our heritage and engineering skills with our drive to improve the sustainability of our generation business.
As the evidence on climate change becomes clearer, we are going to have to change both how we use energy and how we produce it.
Glendoe is a key part of our commitment in this vital area, and having successfully completed it I expect us to follow it with more investments in renewable energy in the future.
