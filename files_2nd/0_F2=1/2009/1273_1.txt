TRAINS PUBLIC Our strategy TRANSPORT In 1999 we recognised the long-term growth opportunities OPERATOR that would be presented by the historic opening of transport markets across Europe, and refocused our COACHES strategy to concentrate on public transport.
We started a disposal programme of our contract hire, motor retailing and vehicle rental businesses.
In their place, we carefully and patiently built up a network of operations in mainland Europe, through targeted acquisitions and WATER contract wins, and today we operate around 8,500 buses BUSES and 370 train sets in mainland Europe.
With around 6,300 buses and two UK rail franchises we are also one of the largest public transport operators in the UK.
