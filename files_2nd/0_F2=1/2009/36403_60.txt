Board performance evaluation The Board undertakes a formal internal evaluation conducted by the Senior Independent Director of its own performance and that of its Committees and individual directors annually, alternated with an evaluation, at least every fourth year, conducted by external consultants.
This year, the performance evaluation was undertaken internally and involved each director, including the Chairman, completing a comprehensive questionnaire and then having one-to-one interviews with Kathleen ODonovan as the Senior Independent Director assisted by Desna Martin as the Company Secretary.
The process covered Board, Committee and personal performance and the output: the results of the questionnaire: a summary of the interviews: and the recommendations and actions required, was reviewed at the 1 April 2009 Board meeting as part of a wider corporate governance review.
Overall, it was concluded that the Board and its Committees continued to operate effectively with appropriate procedures put in place for minor areas identified for improvement.
