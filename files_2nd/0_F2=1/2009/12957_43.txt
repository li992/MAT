Randgold holds an effective 80% interest in the project.
The project has moved rapidly this year from a greenfields exploration find through a scoping study and is approaching completion of a prefeasibility study.
GEOLOGY The host rocks to the Gounkoto mineralisation are a sequence of fine grained arkoses which have suffered an early silica carbonate alteration event.
A suite of Rare Earth Elements REE at Gounkoto suggests a similar fluid to Gara with a possible magmatic component.
More than 95% of the sulphide is pyrite with minor arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite and additionally gold tellurides are present.
These tellurides also exist at Faraba and other southern targets.
Mineralisation is bounded by a hangingwall shear and footwall mylonite.
In the hangingwall there is a prominent limestone unit which is a good marker horizon.

RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 38 Composite 32-53 Projects R 3 25 10 8:39 AM Page 8 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K Initial open pit mineral reserves of 1.6Moz at 6.83g t, with significant potential along strike and underground Orebody open in all directions Project to be fast tracked through development stages INITIAL SCOPING STUDY Following the completion of the first drill campaign, an inferred mineral resource of 13.1 million tonnes at a grade of 6.29g t for 2.65 million ounces was estimated from the first 19 diamond holes, nine RC holes and three trenches over a one kilometre strike length.
The P64 target, which features 250 strike metres of similar alteration and mineralisation, is located 300 metres to the northwest of Gounkoto, while the Faraba deposit, with an inferred mineral resource of 6.78 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.60g t for 565 000 ounces, is located 2.5 kilometres to the southeast.
A preliminary assessment was conducted on the inferred mineral resource and the results of this scoping study were published in November 2009.
This assessment is preliminary in nature, in that it used inferred mineral resources considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them to be categorised as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realised.
For preliminary purposes, pit optimisations were carried out at US$650 and US$850 gold prices with the following input cost assumptions: US$2.74 tonne Life of Mine mining cost.
95%, 93% and 91% metallurgical recovery for oxide, transition and fresh ore assuming a simple process of crush, mill and cyanide leach.

PREFEASIBILITY STUDY UPDATE Following the very positive results from the preliminary assessment, the project has been fast tracked to prefeasibility with the completion of an additional 59 diamond holes, eight RC holes and nine trenches during the year.
A decision was taken to initiate full social and environmental assessments, including public consultation and participation, prior to the completion of the final feasibility in the expectation that the project will move rapidly to development.
The drilling concentrated on infilling the material within the US$850 per ounce scoping pit shell.
The drilling has resulted in a thinning of the geological model when compared to the scoping geological model, but the GOUNKOTO: MINERAL RESOURCES higher grades were confirmed.

Drilling is currently underway to test depth and strike 3 extensions and these results will be used to evaluate upside potential from extending the Gounkoto orebody together with incremental material from Faraba and P64.
Given the strong base of the Gounkoto orebody, the company is confident that this area will grow into a multi-mine complex.
2 The prefeasibility study, on track for completion at the end of the first quarter of 2010, will be based on the open pit reserve at Gounkoto together with an upside scoping that will include the underground results and those from Faraba and P64.
