Managers Report argues strongly for ASCoT to maintain its gearing.
However, the gearing is employed on a tactical rather than structural basis and it will be withdrawn when absolute valuations within the portfolio move closer to more appropriate levels.
The closure of these value gaps, enhanced by the gearing, should be the basis for an improvement in ASCoTs relative performance.
The precise timing is as difficult as ever to call, but some comfort may be drawn from ASCoTs history: your managers value investment style has led to phases of weak relative returns in previous bull markets but returns have improved as the adjustment in risk appetites comes to an end.
