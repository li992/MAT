Shareholders will be invited to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 23 July 2009.
1 Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The current members of the Committee, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors, are given on page 23.
The Chairman of the Committee is Mr R J Harrison OBE.
The Group Company Secretary acts as its secretary.
The terms of reference for the Committee can be found on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.
The role of the Committee is to decide on all aspects of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the Chairman.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter to be agreed between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
The Committee reviews and retains a right of veto on all aspects of remuneration for all direct reports of Executive Directors and all members of the senior management team.
1 Remuneration Policy The Group aims to provide competitive salary and benefit packages for all employees.
As far as is practicable it pursues a consistent policy of terms and conditions across the Divisions.
In that context benefits such as share options and pension scheme membership are open to all qualifying employees.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, comparison is made with the packages offered by companies of similar size and business diversity and after considering general pay and employment conditions in the Group.
The Committee has access to New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who as independent consultants, provide external research on market data and trends.
In order to align individuals rewards with the Companys performance, annual bonuses and share incentive schemes are linked to the Companys strategy and determined by levels of performance achieved against key targets.
1 Executive Directors The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors to maintain the profitable growth of the business.
As far as possible, it is the Committees intention to align Executive Directors interests with those of the shareholders.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are as follows: Basic salary Benefits in kind Annual bonus scheme Pension arrangements Share incentive schemes The Groups policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
The targeted composition of each Executive Directors annual remuneration is for performance related remuneration to be more than 50% of the total.
During the year the Committee reviewed the following areas of the senior managements remuneration in light of the current economic conditions.
1 Basic Salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Committee annually after a review of individual performance and having regard to competitive practice.
Pay rises take effect from 1 April each year unless an individual changes role, when pay changes take effect from the date of change.
All Executive Directors received pay rises on 1 April 2008 after review by the Remuneration Committee against benchmark data for other market sector companies and taking into account the sustained growth and performance of the business which has doubled its turnover over the last five years.
All employees and Directors pay increases effective from 1 April 2009 were individually determined based upon their own performance and are typically within a range of 0 to 5%.
1 Benefits in Kind The Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind, which in the main relate to the provision of a company car.
1 Annual Bonus Scheme All of the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a short term incentive scheme for which targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The targets are designed to encourage individual performance, operating efficiencies and profitable growth.
During 2008 09 these related to improvements in profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses 90% of basic salary and the achievement of working capital targets 10% of basic salary.
The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 31 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued Mr A Balls targets differ to Mr G Slark and Mr J R Murray as he is also a managing director of a division of the Group PTS.
65% of basic salary is based upon improvements in profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses for the Group and another 30% of basic salary is based upon this metric but just for PTS.
The final 5% of basic salary is based upon improvements in own brand sales growth.
Therefore the maximum payable under the scheme during 2008 09 was 100% of basic salary.
For the financial year 2009 10, the maximum payable under the scheme will again be 100%.
The targets for 2009 10 are again based upon the achievement of working capital targets 10% of basic salary and profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses and as above for Mr A Ball.
The profit before taxation is based upon growth above the budgeted profit before taxation for the Group.
Bonuses earned are paid out in June following the announcement of the results for the financial year.
The targets for the 2008 09 scheme were not achieved for the profit before taxation element of the award, due to the decline in the economic environment that the Group trades in.
Mr G Slark and Mr J R Murray will receive 9% of basic salary each based upon achievement of working capital targets.
Mr A Ball will receive 9% of basic salary based upon growth in the own brand sales of PTS.
1 Pension Arrangements In line with the Group policy all new Executive Directors are eligible to join The BSS Group plc Group Stakeholder Pension Plan.
The BSS Group plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which Mr G Slark is a member of, is now closed to new members.
The scheme provides th a pension on normal retirement at age 62 based upon a maximum accrual rate of 1 75 of pensionable earnings for each completed year of service.
Early retirement is possible from age 55 with a reduced pension if the Company agrees.
1 Share Incentive Schemes All of the Executive Directors participate in long term incentive schemes, details of which are set out below.
The share option schemes are reviewed annually to ensure the grant level, performance conditions and vesting schedules remain appropriate and will align the interests of the participants with the shareholders.
There were two long term incentive schemes in operation during the year: The BSS Group plc Performance Share Plan and The BSS Group plc Approved and Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
The BSS Group plc Approved and Unapproved Share Option Scheme final grant of options matured on 1 June 2007: there are no future plans to grant options under this scheme.
1 The BSS Group plc Performance Share Plan The BSS Group plc Performance Share Plan the Plan, was first approved at the Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2005.
This plan is used as a means of incentivising senior management and Executive Directors, to maintain the profitable growth of the Company such that their interests continue to be aligned with those of the shareholders.
The maximum number of shares granted to any Director in any one year is equivalent to one year of basic salary.
The Plan is structured to reward performance where the Group achieves strong growth in earnings per share EPS in excess of growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI.
The fourth award under the Plan was made on 20 June 2008: performance for this award will be measured over three financial years ended 31 March 2009, 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2011.
The share price on the date of grant was 338.0p.
The principal features of the Plan are as follows: participants will receive a promise of free shares subject to meeting specific performance conditions: and vesting of awards will only take place once the performance conditions have been satisfied and agreed by the Remuneration Committee With a view to linking rewards to performance, average EPS growth per annum for the awards made shall result in vesting as follows: Growth in EPS average per annum over RPI Vesting Less than 5% EPS No part of the award will vest Between 5% and 10% inclusive Straight line proportionate vesting between 30% and 100% inclusive More than 10% EPS 100% of the award will vest The 100% vesting EPS targets for the previous three years grants are shown in the table below.
Where RPI information is not available yet a rate of 3% has been assumed.
32 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 The terms for the 2009 grant will be to target growth in profit before taxation of over 10% above RPI based upon the budget profit before taxation for financial year 2009 10.
The same proportionate vesting from average growth per annum between 5% and 10% growth over RPI will be applied as targets for each of the three years during the life of the grant.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for existing grants of share options during the year.
1 Dilution Newly issued shares are currently used to satisfy the exercise of all employee and Executive share options.
Grants of shares for the Performance Share Plan are satisfied by shares delivered from the Employee Benefit Trust which are bought from the Company using funding from the Company.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10 year period to employees under share plans.
Within this 10%, the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary Executive plans.
1 Save-As-You-Earn SAYE Executive Directors may participate in an Inland Revenue approved SAYE scheme which is open to all employees.
Details of Directors interests including share options are shown on page 35.
