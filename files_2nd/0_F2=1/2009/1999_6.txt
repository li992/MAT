Sustainability Each year Berkeley produces a Sustainability Report to provide its stakeholders with a full and transparent account of how its sustainability strategy and policies are put into practice throughout the Group.
This year, in its eighth annual Sustainability Report, Berkeley has once again applied the Global Reporting Initiative GRI Sustainability Reporting Principles in order to give a balanced and relevant account of its sustainability performance.
This approach has allowed Berkeley to focus on what it considers to be the most signi cant or material issues to the business and how it is managing and responding to them.
The report is structured around the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability, under which performance against each relevant material issue is highlighted.
Case studies on speci c sustainability issues are integrated throughout the report, and detailed performance data is provided against Key Performance Indicators to track progress over time.
The report reviews how Berkeley performed against its 2008 09 targets, and sets new targets to drive progress in the coming year.
For further information, please refer to Berkeleys eighth annual Sustainability Report on its website.

These do not entitle the participants to a greater interest in the shares of the Company than that created by the initial grant of the award.
