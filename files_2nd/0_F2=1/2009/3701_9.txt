| Business overview Our capabilities Cobham and the network enabled environment Cobhams equipment enables the rapid, secure and resilient movement of voice, video and data between sensors and decision makers.
There are many different types of sensor, huge volumes of information to move and many users to keep safe in what is increasingly becoming a network enabled environment.
As these illustrations show, Cobham technology is at the heart of many advanced systems on space, air, land and marine platforms, providing life saving situational awareness, safety, survival and life support systems.
The examples show defence and security applications, but the technology is equally applicable to non military markets.
Reliability and speed essential The Groups equipment also enables data to be moved reliably and quickly, providing life saving tactical situational awareness.
12 Security Cobham enables data to be transferred securely in Radio Frequency RF environments and in cyberspace, providing critical information assurance in challenging environments.
Increased data transfer The type and volume of data being exchanged on the modern digital battlefield is increasing enormously, with Cobham equipment supporting voice communications, email, video, GPS navigation, radar, electronic warning systems data transfer.
Connectivity increased Today, every soldier, vehicle, ship, aircraft and satellite is becoming a node in a network enabled environment, as the demand for connectivity increases.
