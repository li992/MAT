Risk and governance Risk management Capital management and allocation Although Investec plc and its subsidiaries and Investec Limited and its subsidiaries are managed independently, the approach to capital management of each group is consistently applied.
The DLC structure requires the two groups to be considered independent from a capital perspective and hence capital is managed on this basis.
This approach is exercised through the BRCC via the Investec DLC Capital Committee which is a board sub-committee with ultimate responsibility for the capital suf ciency of both Investec plc and Investec Limited.
The legal and regulatory treatment of capital is independent of existing shareholder arrangements that are in place to ensure that shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single uni ed enterprise.
Investec plc is regulated by the FSA in the UK and Investec Limited is regulated by the SARB.
In addition, a number or subsidiaries are subject to the capital regulations of the regulators for the jurisdictions in which they operate.
Philosophy and approach As a consequence of the global financial crisis there is a strong expectation from bank stakeholders that banking groups need to and will improve their capital adequacy ratios.
Investec has always held capital well in excess of regulatory requirements and the group intends to perpetuate this philosophy and ensure that it remains well capitalised in a vastly changed banking world.
Accordingly, the group considers it appropriate to adjust its capital adequacy targets and build its capital base, targeting a minimum tier one capital ratio of 11% and a total capital adequacy ratio of 14% to 17% on a consolidated basis for Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively.
The determination of target capital is driven by our strategy and risk appetite, taking into account regulatory and market factors applicable to the group.
At the most fundamental level, we seek to balance our capital consumption between ensuring that we are prudently capitalised to meet our risks, and optimisation of shareholder returns.
Our internal economic capital framework is designed to manage and achieve this balance.
The internal capital framework is tied to group-wide disciplines surrounding: Capital allocation and structuring Investment decision making and pricing Risk management, especially as it relates to the selection of deals, markets, and investment opportunities Performance measurement Risk-based incentive compensation.
Consequently the objectives of the internal capital framework are to: Maintain suf cient capital to satisfy the boards risk appetite across all risks faced by the group Support a target level of financial strength aligned with a long-term rating of at least A Provide protection to depositors against losses arising from risks inherent in the business Provide suf cient capital surplus to ensure that the group is able to retain its going concern basis under relatively severe operating conditions and support growth in assets Maintain suf cient capital to meet regulatory requirements across each regulated entity Support our growth strategy Allow the exploration of acquisition opportunities where such opportunities are consistent with our strategy and risk appetite Facilitate pricing that is commensurate with the risk being taken Allocate capital according to the greatest expected marginal risk based return, and track performance on this basis Reward performance taking into account the relative levels of risk adopted.
The framework has been approved by the board and is managed by the DLC Capital Committee, which is responsible for oversight of the management of capital on a regulatory and an internal basis.
150 Annual report 2009 Risk and governance Risk management In order to achieve these objectives, we adhere to the following approach to the integration of risk and capital management.

This is a bottom up process initially performed by each business unit across the group.
Key risks are then debated and agreed at senior management level and ultimately by BRCC.
Assessment of the materiality of risks is directly linked to the boards stated risk appetite and approved risk management policies covering all key risks.
Risk reporting As part of standard business practice, identi ed key risks are monitored by Group Risk Management and by Internal Audit to ensure that risks are managed to an acceptable level of risk.
Detailed performance and control metrics of these risks are reported to each ERRF and BRCC meeting, including, where appropriate the results of scenario testing.
Key risk types that are considered fall within the following: Credit and counterparty risk Traded market risk Equity risk in the banking book Balance sheet liquidity and non-trading interest rate risk Legal risk Operational risk.
Each of these risk categories may consist of a number of speci c risks, each of which are analysed in detail and managed through ERRF and BRCC.
Role of regulatory capital in capital management On 1 January 2008, we began operating under the Basel II regulatory regime across all regulated entities.
We have adopted the Standardised Approach under Pillar 1 to determining our minimum capital requirements.
The regulatory rules within Basel II are designed to provide greater differentiation of risk between asset classes.
In addition, the rules seek to account for operational risk, in addition to the traditional capital requirements for credit and market risks.
We do not, however, use regulatory capital as the driver exclusive of capital allocation.
In addition, while the measurement of capital from a regulatory perspective has changed following the introduction of Basel II, the risk appetite of the board and senior management remains unchanged.
Indeed, given the rapid deterioration in capital availability across the global banking industry and the increasing risk aversion of the market, senior management have determined that capital should remain at conservative levels, in line with capital targets, regardless of any potential bene t arising from a change in regulatory capital rules.
This requirement has been adopted within our approach to Pillar 2, of which the internal capital framework constitutes a central role.
Annual report 2009 151 Risk and governance Risk management Therefore, while capital requirements under Pillar 1 form the minimum capital for Investec plc, Investec Limited and their various regulated subsidiaries, our capital management framework places emphasis on the determination of internal capital requirements.
However, we do manage our capital resources to ensure that all group entities exceed local capital adequacy rules in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
Local management are responsible for compliance with entities minimum regulatory requirements, although the allocation of capital supply is controlled by the DLC Capital Committee.
Internal capital Internal capital requirements are quanti ed by analysis of the potential impact of key risks to a degree consistent with our risk appetite.
Internal capital requirements are supported by the board approved risk assessment process described above.
Assessments for all risks are based on analysis of internal data, management expertise and judgment and external benchmarking.
The following risks are included within the internal capital framework and quanti ed for capital allocation purposes: Credit and counterparty risk, including: - Underlying counterparty risk - Concentration risk - Securitisation risk Traded market risk: Equity and property risk in the banking book: Balance sheet risk, including: - Liquidity - Non-trading interest rate risk Strategic and reputational risks: Business risk: Operational risk: and Pension risk UK only.
Operational risk is considered as an umbrella term and covers a range of independent risks including, but not limited to, risks relating to: fraud, litigation, business continuity, outsourcing and out of policy trading.
The speci c risks covered are assessed dynamically through constant assessment of the underlying business environment.
Capital management, planning and scenario testing A group capital plan is prepared at least three times annually considering the impact of business strategy and market conditions on our capital suf ciency.
This plan is designed to determine capital suf ciency under a range of economic and internal conditions over the medium term 3 years, with the impact on both earnings and asset growth considered.
The plan provides the board via the BRCC with a basis for which to align strategy given constraints on capital where these exist.
This plan is revised based on actual results and presented to the BRCC at least three times annually.
Stressing the capital plans is an important tool by which the board can gain insight as to the potential sources of vulnerability of the capital suf ciency of the group through market, economic or internal events.
As such, we stress the capital plans based on conditions most likely to place us under duress.
The conditions themselves are agreed by the DLC Capital Committee.
Such plans are used by management to formulate responses to potential adverse business conditions using all available management levers.
In particular, our capital plans are designed to allow senior management and the board to review: Changes to capital demand caused by implementation of agreed strategic objectives, including the creation or acquisition of new businesses, or as a result of the manifestation of one or more of the risks to which we are potentially susceptible The impact on pro tability of current and future strategies Required changes to the capital structure The impact of implementing a proposed dividend strategy The impact of alternate market or operating conditions on any of the above.
At a minimum level, each capital plan assesses the impact on our capital adequacy of a range of scenarios based on an expected case, upturn and downturn scenarios.
On the basis of the results of this analysis the DLC Capital Committee, and the BRCC, are presented with the potential variability in capital adequacy and are responsible, in consultation with the board, for consideration of the appropriate response.
152 Annual report 2009 Risk and governance Risk management Pricing and performance measurement Internal capital is fully integrated into many key operational processes, including: Determining transactional risk based returns on capital Establishing break even pricing Optimising capital allocation Comparing risk based performance across business areas Forming a basis for the determination of Economic Value Added at a transactional level, and hence the basis for discretionary variable remuneration.
The use of internal capital means that all transactions are considered in the context of the impact on the allocation of our capital resources, and hence on the basis of their contribution to risk adjusted return on capital.
This is to ensure that expected returns are suf cient after taking recognition of the inherent risk generated for a given transaction.
This approach allows us to embed risk and capital discipline at the level of deal initiation.
This compels a wider population beyond the formal governance committees to understand the capital implications of business activity and ensure that risk is priced appropriately.
These processes have been embedded across the business with the process designed to ensure that risk and capital management form the basis for key processes at both a group and a transactional level.
Responsibility for oversight for each of these processes ultimately falls to the BRCC.
This process forms the fundamental structure of our capital adequacy assessment process.
For an assessment of return on equity and our return on economic capital utilised refer to pages 26 to 28.
Responsibility for the risk and capital management process The Investec plc and Investec Limited boards of directors are ultimately responsible for the respective silos capital management.
The groups senior management take active roles in allocating capital at a transactional level.
At the highest level, the boards have delegated direct responsibility for capital management to the BRCC, and in turn the DLC Capital Committee.
These forums have been in place for several years and their roles and responsibilities are discussed on pages 179 to 181.
In order to feed into this forum, Investec plc convenes a separate capital committee on a weekly basis to monitor the capital positions of its various subsidiaries, in particular the businesses in the UK and Australia.
A formally constituted capital management committee also exists in Australia.
The Southern African operations meet monthly through the Regulatory Forum, which analyses regulatory information, including capital use in Investec Bank Limited and Investec Bank Mauritius Limited.
This structure ensures that capital is actively managed from the lowest reporting level and cascades up to the ultimate responsible body - the BRCC.
The following areas within the structure of the business have speci c operational capital management responsibilities: Business units, in particular those who conduct their business out of a regulated entity and use large amounts of capital Private Bank and Capital Markets : - The transactional consultants within the business units consider the capital requirements and the projected return on this capital as part of the deal approval process.
Pricing explicitly takes into account the capital usage.
- Each business unit is responsible for translating their detailed individual strategies into a bottom-up capital usage projection for incorporation into the group capital plan.
These plans assist senior management with prioritising the use of our available capital.
Risk Management: - The credit approval process for each relevant transaction is approved only after review and approval by our central credit risk management team.
Capital usage forms an explicit part of the approval process.
- For exposures which generate market risk, the market risk management team quantify and monitor market risk capital generated by trading activities.
Traded market risk is closely monitored by our various risk management fora, - As part of operational risk management, a process managed by centralised operational risk management and embedded risk managers within each business unit identify, assess and quantify key operational risks arising from Investecs operations.
Quanti cation is then used as the basis for the operational risk capital used held via the internal capital framework, - Underpinning all risk management functions is their IT support division, which ensures that all applications used to calculate and report risk are functioning properly and reconcile to underlying source systems.
Group Finance: - Regulatory reporting is the responsibility of a dedicated team within Group Finance, who are responsible for ensuring regulatory capital requirements are continuously met.
- Financial control, through the capital management function, includes responsibility for the development and implementation of the internal capital framework and to manage and report on regulatory capital requirements.
The development of the internal capital framework includes the result of analysis performed by Risk Management, - Group Finance is also responsible for co-ordinating, with business units, the development of the groups capital plan, - As part of the responsibility for the internal capital framework, the allocation of capital is managed centrally by Group Finance, - As with Risk Management, the Group Finance IT division plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity of the ledger and all supporting applications which contribute to the regulatory and business intelligence reporting processes.
Annual report 2009 153 Risk and governance Risk management Board and Group Executive: - The BRCC has ultimate responsibility for the oversight of day to day risk management, capital management and ensuring that both risk and capital are managed commensurate with our strategy and risk appetite.
- The BRCC has delegated management of capital to the DLC Capital Committee and risk management to ERRF.
We optimise the use of capital through a rigorous risk based approach to pricing, performance and remuneration.
Capital is managed closely for return and risk from the inception of a transaction.
This approach ensures that the linkage of risk to target capital suf ciency is entrenched in our transactional processes.
This results in a capital management process driven by capital adequacy goals which are closely monitored by strategic capital plans.
These strategic capital plans, as with all elements of internal capital, are subject to a robust approval process involving senior business unit managers, Group Executive and the board.
