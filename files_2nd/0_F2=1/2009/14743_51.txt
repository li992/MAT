Shares which are released under the DBS, DBP 2006, and PSP attract additional shares in respect of the notional reinvestment of dividends.
Shares released under the DBS during the year included the following arising from such notional reinvestment: Ian Marchant 4,324 shares: Gregor Alexander 2,141 shares.
The performance conditions applicable to awards under the PSP since 2007 are described on page 70.
The 2006 award under the PSP was subject to a slightly different target in that full vesting would occur after three years for EPS growth of RPI plus 8% and TSR at or above 75th percentile, and 30% of the award vesting for median performance for TSR and EPS growth of RPI plus 3%.
This award will vest shortly after preliminary announcement of the companys results for 2008 09 in May 2009.
As described on page 70, the performance conditions were met in full, so that the full number of shares stated will be released, plus a further number of shares in respect of notional reinvestment of dividends.
The DBS was the companys main long-term incentive arrangement prior to the introduction of the PSP in 2006.
Vesting of shares was dependent on continued service over a three year period.
The number of shares placed under option under the DBS depended on meeting financial and non-financial performance criteria in the financial years preceding the award, and therefore no further performance condition applies to the vesting of DBS options.
The final DBS options, which were granted in June 2006 in relation to 2005 06 performance, will vest in June 2009, but participants may exercise their options during the period indicated in the table.
Since 2007, 25% of annual bonus payable to Executive Directors and Senior Managers has been satisfied as a conditional award of shares under the DBP 2006.
Vesting of shares is dependent on continued service over a three year period.
In view of the linkage to annual bonus, no further performance condition applies to the vesting of DBP 2006 awards.
The market value of a share on the date on which these awards were made was 1145.5p.
The market value of a share on the date on which these awards were realised was 1400p.
The market value of a share on the date this option was exercised was 1445p.
The closing market price of the shares at 31 March 2009 was 1109p and the range for the year was 1040p to 1541p.
Awards granted during the year were granted under the DBP 2006 and the PSP.
Options were granted under the Sharesave scheme.
The aggregate amount of gains made by the Directors on the exercise of share options and realisation of awards during the year was 840,423.00 2008 838,836.90.
