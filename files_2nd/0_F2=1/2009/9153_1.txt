King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 01 2008 09 Progress update from the Group Chief Executive When I became your Chief Executive last year, I stated my aim to deliver a step-change in value for Kingfi sher shareholders.
As I said in last years Annual Report, this will be achieved by focusing on three key priorities Management, Capital and Returns.
It has been a busy and challenging year but I am pleased to report good progress with these priorities.
Ian Cheshire Management Group Chief Executive The previous decentralised management structure has been replaced by a new senior team King sher plc which has collective responsibility for overall delivery of Group results in addition to their individual responsibilities.
Capital Capital expenditure has been signifi cantly reduced and reprioritised, targeting higher hurdle rates and faster payback.
With a more vigorous focus on cash we have reduced working capital by 180 million and sold Castorama Italy for an excellent price, thereby reducing our net debt by 41% in constant currency to 1 billion.
Cash returns Greater focus has been placed on generating higher cash returns from the retail businesses.
Stretching targets for sales growth, margin improvement and cost reduction were introduced and in June we launched our seven point Delivering Value plan.
