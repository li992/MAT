included as standard in contracts in Kurdistan.
The Miran Block contains two large structures, Miran West and Miran East, which have been mapped from the 332 kilometres of excellent quality 2D seismic data acquired by Heritage in the second quarter of 2008.
The Miran West structure is believed to be one of the larger structures in Kurdistan, with an estimated areal extent of approximately 200 square kilometres.
Miran East has an estimated areal extent of 130 square kilometres.
Upon completion of seismic interpretation, the Company decided to accelerate the Miran work programme.
Consequently, drilling commenced on the Miran West-1 well in December 2008.
In March 2009, drilling of the Miran West-1 well was completed having reached a total depth of 2,935 metres.
The well encountered oil shows over a 1,100 metre interval including the three principal proven reservoir formations in the region.
The initial test programme on the Miran West-1 well was completed in May 2009.
