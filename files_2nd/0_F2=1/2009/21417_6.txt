War income has continued to grow during 2009 due to the increased pirate activity in a number of war zones, most visibly in the Gulf of Aden which caused a surge in demand for additional kidnap insurance resulting in an increase in gross written premiums of 86% to 27.2m in 2009.
The percentage of business we lead has remained constant at around 55% and we renewed 74% of the 2008 portfolio in 2009.
In Hong Kong we recruited a cargo underwriter to take advantage of regional opportunities, writing on a delegated basis through our coverholder Beazley Limited.
We have also employed a new liability underwriting team to write marine professional indemnity, logistic liability and port authority business.
This adds further diversification to the marine and overall Beazley portfolio, in addition to gaining some synergy with the small professional indemnity business of the specialty lines division.
