Over the next 25 February 2010 three years the Group expects its public capital and senior funding issuance to total in the range of 20 billion to 25 billion per annum.
We have made good progress on our 2010 term funding issuance plans following the issuance in December 2009 of US$2 billion tier 1 securities and in January 2010 the Group issued US$5 billion senior unsecured debt, and executed a 2.5 billion Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities RMBS transaction which included the first public US$ tranche of RMBS by a UK issuer since 2008.
At 31 December 2009, the Groups overall funding support from governmental and central bank sources totalled 157 billion, with a significant proportion predominantly Special Liquidity Scheme SLS and Credit Guarantee Scheme CGS funding maturing over the course of the next two years.
The Groups balance sheet reduction plans will avoid the necessity to refinance much of this funding.
The current cost to the Group of participating in these schemes is currently approximately 50 basis points over LIBOR for the SLS and approximately 130 basis points over LIBOR for CGS.
Overall, based on expected spreads and balance sheet mix, we believe the increased cost of wholesale funding over the next few years is expected to negatively impact the Groups net interest margin by less than 10 basis points, and this cost is expected to be more than offset by the impact of improved product pricing.

These adjustments principally reflect the application of market based credit spreads to HBOSs lending portfolios and own debt.
The net fair value unwind in 2009 is mainly attributable to a reduction in the impairment charge of 6,859 million, as losses reflected in the opening balance sheet valuation of the lending portfolios have been incurred, offset by a charge to net interest income of 2,166 million as the value of HBOSs own debt accretes to par.
2 The Groups net interest income includes certain amounts attributable to policyholders, in addition to the interest earnings on shareholders funds held in the Groups insurance businesses.
In addition, the Groups net interest income is significantly affected by the accounting treatment of a number of products predominately in Wholesale division where either the funding costs or the related revenues are recognised within other income.
In order to enhance comparability in the Groups banking net interest margin, these items have been excluded in determining net interest income and average interest earning assets.
