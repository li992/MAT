The Group policy with respect to cash deposits is to only have deposits with pre-approved banks with short-term credit ratings of A1 P1 and with limits on the amount deposited with each institution dependent on their long-term credit rating.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity less than three months.
Financial Risk Management and Treasury Policies The main fi financial risks of the Group relate to funding and liquidity, interest rate fl uctuations and currency exposures.
A central treasury department that reports directly to the Group Finance Director and operates according to objectives, policies and authorities approved by the Board, performs the management of these risks.
The overall policy objective is to use fi financial instruments to manage fi financial risks arising from the underlying business activities and therefore the Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying fi financial exposure.
More details are set out in note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Funding and Liquidity The Groups operations are fi nanced by a combination of retained profi ts, equity and borrowings.
Borrowings are generally raised at Group level from banks and then lent to operating subsidiaries.
The Group maintains suffi cient available committed borrowing facilities to meet any forecasted funding requirements.
At the end of 2009, the Group had two committed bank facilities totalling $1,075.0 million of which $752 million was drawn across them.
These facilities are subject to cross-default.
In the primary $900 million facility, having spent more than $100 million on the acquisition of Hawker Beechcraft in 2008, the Group exercised the option to increase the net debt to EBITDA covenant to 4.25 times at the 31 December 2008 testing date and to 4.0 times at the 30 June and 31 December 2009 testing dates respectively.
From 30 June 2010 the covenant will return to 3.5 times.
In addition, the Group maintains uncommitted facilities for daily working capital fl uctuation purposes.
At the end of 2009, the undrawn amount of these uncommitted facilities totalled $31.4 million.
The rationale for preparing the fi financial statements on a going concern basis has been set out on page 60.
Interest Rate Risk Management The interest rate exposure arising from the Groups borrowing and deposit activity is managed by using a combination of fi xed and variable rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy with respect to interest rate risk management is to fi x portions of debt for varying periods based upon our debt maturity profi le and an assessment of interest rate trends.
At the end of 2009, approximately 65% of the Groups total borrowings were fi xed at weighted average interest rates of 3.3% for varying terms of up to fi five years.
Currency Risk Management The Groups policy is to hedge all signifi cant transactional currency exposures through the use of forward currency contracts.
Historically it has been the Groups policy to hedge overseas capital employed, including recognised goodwill, between 50% and 85% by means of currency loans and currency swaps.
During the year, the Board undertook a review of our hedging policy.
In light of the fact that shareholders funds are no longer as relevant in our banking covenants, and so as to minimise volatility in the leverage ratio, the decision was made to phase out the use of cross currency swaps in hedging our overseas net assets, and in future net assets will be hedged using underlying borrowings only.
