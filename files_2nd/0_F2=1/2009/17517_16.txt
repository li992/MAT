Compounding the contraction in end-user consumption, Global supply of rened lead decreased by approximately 2% to 8.2 inventories were signicantly reduced and remained low through to the million tonnes, following cutbacks by producers worldwide, notably in end of 2009.
Demand recovered somewhat in the second half, primarily Peru, Italy and Mexico.
As a result, demand and supply for rened lead as a result of government stimulus spending and cash for clunkers car remained balanced.

Global mine production was relatively unchanged in 2009 as cuts to mine Despite lower zinc demand in most countries, demand from China continued production in many regions, including Peru, North America and Australia, to grow throughout 2009 as domestic consumption was supported by were offset by increases in other countries including India, Bolivia and infrastructure spending and increased lending rates.

make up roughly half of the worlds feed for lead smelters and reneries, declined slightly during 2009 in a market that approached equilibrium.
An oversupply of zinc metal in the face of poor demand led LME warehouse stocks to rise to 489,125 tonnes by the end of 2009 or approximately 18 LME lead prices climbed during the year due to strong Chinese demand days of global consumption.
While this level represents a significant increase and an improvement in demand from other regions in the second half, of over 235,650 tonnes compared to December 2008, it remains slightly averaging $2,329 per tonne in December compared to $963 per tonne in below the annual average of the past two decades.
The average LME price for 2009 was $1,726 per tonne, compared to $2,084 in 2008.
LME stocks of lead increased, partly in LME zinc prices climbed during the year to a monthly average of $2,376 response to the gradual rise in the lead price throughout 2009.
By the per tonne in December compared to $1,101 per tonne in December end of the year, LME stocks had risen to 146,500 tonnes, equivalent to 2008.

Global rened zinc production declined by approximately 2% in 2009 to Outlook 11.2 million tonnes due to unprecedented mine and smelter cutbacks in Demand for lead is expected to continue to grow as lead batteries, the main 2008 and early 2009.
Mine closures in China led to record imports of zinc application for lead, are expected to play an increasingly important part in the concentrate to feed Chinese smelters as rened production continued to urbanisation and industrialisation of developing nations, in particular in Asia.
This trend was in stark contrast to the cuts in rened zinc production Lead consumption will rise as increasingly prosperous Indian and Chinese elsewhere, in particular in Europe.
Rising metal prices in 2009 resulted in consumers switch from electric bicycles to motorcycles and automobiles.

European benchmark treatment charges for 2009 settled at $198.50 per tonne of concentrate on a $1,250 per tonne zinc price basis, down from 2008 levels of $300 per tonne on a $2,000 per tonne zinc price basis.
Outlook The gradual economic recovery in Western markets and continued growth from Asia will drive increased zinc consumption from the galvanised sector, underpinned by vehicle production, infrastructure projects and consumer goods.
In the medium to longer term, global demand growth is expected to average over 5% per annum as China and the developing economies mature.
A market deficit is expected to emerge within the next four years as the significant new projects required to satisfy the forecast growth in demand are yet to be dened.
