More importantly they have positioned us to move the business forward in 2009 10 and beyond.
Ian Dyson Group Finance and Operations Director Results Group revenue was up 0.4% to just over 9bn.

Investment in margin We responded to the economic downturn and the effect that this was having on our customers by making significant investments in pricing and promotions.
While this has resulted in even better value for our customers and has been a major factor in retaining their loyalty to our brand, it has 125 YEARS OF INNOVATION adversely impacted our UK gross margin, which was 170 bps lower than last year at 41.3%.
Above: New & Improved We opened 75 stores and modernised a further 24 in 2008 09.

Total UK operating costs were 2,740.6m which 5.7% was up 4.9% excluding bonus.

Staff costs Retail staff costs were 863.3m which was up only 1.9% reflecting substantial improvements in productivity and staff scheduling, without affecting service levels.
This can be seen in our monthly customer service tests our mystery shopping programme.

Our compliance audit scores, that measure our legal and safety performance, improved from 80 to 92%.
Distribution We made significant changes to our logistics operations during the year as part of a long-term programme to radically improve the operating efficiency of our supply chain.
These changes benefited costs this year, but will have a more significant impact in 2009 10 and beyond.

Investing in the business Following significant investment in the business over the last three years, we reduced capital expenditure to 652m in 2008 09 from over 1bn in 2007 08.
Stores We opened 75 stores during the year in out-of-town, retail park and high street locations, while continuing to review the portfolio to ensure Group capital expenditure 2009 10 it is working to its fullest potential.

In addition to reducing capital expenditure to 652m from over 1bn in the previous year, we generated a working capital inflow of 194.0m and raised 58.3m from the disposal of non-trading stores.
As a result we generated a net cash inflow of 107.5m after paying interest, tax, dividend and share buy back of 661.2m.
In addition we agreed certain changes to the property partnership with the pension fund that provide us with discretion around the annual payments from the partnership to the fund.
This gives us additional cash flow flexibility and reclassifies the obligation from debt to equity.
As a result of our good cash flow management and the changes to Net debt the property partnership, net debt at year-end was down to 2.5bn from 3.1bn at the end of 2007 08.
2.5bn Like many businesses, during 2008 09 we took steps to manage the cost of providing our defined benefit pension scheme.
We wanted to ensure that pensions can be paid out to members when they need it and at a price we can afford.
From 1 October 2009 only pay increases up to 1% will count towards the pensions of our existing members.
Amendments were also 125 YEARS OF SERVICE made to the early retirement factors for members who joined the scheme before 1 January 1996 and are still active in the scheme.
These changes 1939 At the outbreak of World War II M&S reduced the Groups pension liabilities by 231.3m.
By 1945 over 100 of these had been damaged by bombs and The retirement benefit valuation showed a deficit of 152.2m under IAS 16 had been completely destroyed.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the fund is underway with the results expected by the end of the calendar year.
This valuation will form the basis of funding discussions with the pension trustee.
Looking forward, and with the economy still fragile, further strengthening of our balance sheet is a priority for the Group.
We want to retain our During World War II 1,500 of M&S 2,000 investment grade credit rating, we want the ability to continue to invest male employees fought in the war earning a total of 124 medals and distinctions and all of in our business, and we will need to continue to manage our pension our employees took part in fire watch duty obligations.
every night, with specialist training in first-aid In view of these requirements, the Board has taken the decision to re-base and anti-gas precautions.
the Groups dividend payment to 15.0p per share from the current level of 22.5p per share, a reduction of 33.3%.
This will be achieved through a 33.1% reduction in the 2008 09 final dividend to 9.5p per share, followed by a reduction in the 2009 10 interim dividend to 5.5p per share.
Having re-based the dividend to 15.0p per share, the Boards policy regarding future dividends is to re-build cover towards two times and thereafter, to grow dividends in line with adjusted earnings per share.
Outlook The economy remains uncertain and we will continue to manage accordingly, focusing on margins, costs and cash flow so that we maximise our profits in the short term, but also position our business to move forward in the medium to longer term.
