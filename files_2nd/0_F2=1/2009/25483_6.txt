The increase in net fee and commission income is attributable to another solid performance from the advisory and structuring businesses.
The increase in principal transactions primarily re ects a lower level of losses on the US structured credit investments in the current period of 13 million compared to 49 million written off in the prior year, the acquisition of Kensington and the improved performance of the trading desks.
Impairment losses on loans and advances have increased by 76.5 million mainly due to increased write-downs on resource finance transactions, the Acquisition Finance book and Kensington.
Expenses have increased largely due to an increase in average headcount to support the new initiatives on the trading desks, the continued investment in product development and IT infrastructure and a full year of Kensington ownership.
The Acquisition Finance book is under pressure as a result of deteriorating economic conditions, and is being monitored closely.
The Asset Finance business is now ranked in the top three in the small ticket leasing market.
We are considered one of the top ten European banks in aircraft finance.
The trading desks showed an improved performance bene ting from market volatility, the introduction of new products and increased staff in certain areas.
The Corporate Foreign Exchange and Structured Equity desks are now fully operational.
The Structured Equity retail distribution platforms have been established and we have recently launched eight in the UK market.
The desk has won numerous awards, including Income Product of the Year 2008 and Product Provider of the Year 2009 at the Professional Adviser Structured Products Provider Awards and best Online Branding Campaign at the Online Finance Awards 2008.
The Treasury Products and distribution desk has been established to actively market structured solutions, foreign exchange and interest rates to the corporate market.
The uncertain credit markets continue to impact activity in the Principal Finance division.
Southern Africa Deal activity in our lending areas has been good during the year.
This has been the case in most of the specialist asset classes and with increases experienced in average margins.
The division has seen a marginal increase in impairments compared to the prior year.
The division continues to hold a number of equity related positions associated with our lending activities, the revaluation of our positions has negatively impacted on our results for the year.
Pro tability on the Foreign Exchange and Interest Rate trading desks has been excellent with historic levels of volatility offering good trading and client ow opportunities.
Customer deal ow in Equity Derivatives was reduced during the year as a result of severe market volatility and a declining equity market.
The Foreign Exchange trading desk has captured signi cant market share in the listed currency futures market.
Debt Capital Markets concluded three successful securitisations during the year although the outlook for this area of business is negative.
Annual report 2009 55 Divisional review Capital Markets Specialist structuring and advisory business Australia The Investec Global Aircraft Fund IGAF is now fully invested.
The fund has a portfolio of seven aircraft with a value of AUD669 million.
A second capital raising for the fund is currently underway.
The strategic intention of sourcing and developing clean energy assets resulted in the realisation of a pro t share on the sale of two wind farm assets.
We successfully issued an institutional government guaranteed medium term note in February 2009 in which we raised AUD600 million AUD400 million of three year funding and AUD200 million of five year funding.
The liquidity position remains very strong.
The marketing strategy for the Commodities and Resource Finance business continues to be cautious in light of sustained commodity price and capital market volatility.
However, an immediate business goal is to increase exposure to mid tier resource companies, with resource assets in production, where the current risk return pro les are very attractive.
Outlook, risks and opportunities We continue to be a focused business targeting markets where we can be distinctive and competitive focusing on our core value drivers.
We remain committed to building a sustainable scale business with diversi ed revenue streams.
In the UK and South Africa we will continue to strive for depth and greater penetration.
In Australia we continue to look for opportunities to broaden our franchise.
The current negative cycle is a time to shape the business for the future and to position ourselves for a return to a more normal market.
This stage of the cycle is likely to see a rise in corporate defaults and losses in the acquisition finance portfolio.
Additional effort and resources will be spent on asset management to ensure our portfolios perform optimally in poor economic conditions.
Looking at the environment in our core geographies: - South Africa remains the least affected although the impact of the global recession is now starting to be felt.
We are generally well positioned in this market with a reasonably robust credit portfolio.
Conditions and volumes remain good for the trading businesses.
The effects of the recession may lead to reduced activity in the structuring and lending businesses.
- In the UK and Australia the environment remains weak and it is too early to say if the green shoots represent any sustained change.
We expect impairments to continue, however, trading conditions remain favourable and the dislocated markets continue to present opportunities.
Overall we continue to be reasonably well positioned to weather the storm in conditions that are similar to last year.
The environment has changed but so too has the competitive landscape.
A large amount of capacity has been removed from the market and the number of players in our core geographies has reduced substantially.
This plays to our strengths of being a specialist and bespoke service provider.
In the short-term we expect conditions to remain challenging, however, we believe that in the medium term this is an excellent opportunity to grow market share and deepen our franchise.
