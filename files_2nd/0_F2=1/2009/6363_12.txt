Every employee was asked a number of questions about their involvement, development and engagement with the group, and more than 169,000 employees responded almost a third of the total workforce.
Around the world, employees responded positively to being involved in such a constructive process and the overall feedback was very encouraging with four out of five employees who responded saying they would recommend G4S as an employer to a friend.
Having now analysed the feedback in detail, each business is in the process of developing an action plan to encourage even greater levels of engagement by the time the survey is repeated in 2011.
During the year the company also began rolling out the Ethical Employment Partnership which it entered into at the end of 2008 with UNI, the global union federation.
The agreement is designed to drive improvements in employment standards across the security industry while helping to ensure that employee and union rights are respected throughout the group, and has already resulted in a positive impact on employees, their families and their communities.
The first phase of implementation covered South Africa and India, involving around a quarter of the groups employees, and in both cases the new level of social dialogue has been well received as employees start to see tangible benefits affecting their everyday lives.
Attracting and retaining talented individuals continues to be essential to the success of the group and the diversity of its workforce helps it meet its customers expectations.
The overall approach of the group to diversity and inclusion is to ensure that it appoints, promotes and develops employees in accordance with their talents and aptitudes, regardless of any disability.
To encourage loyalty and retain employees skills, the group also aims to retain existing employees who become disabled wherever possible.
Further details of the groups approach to employee engagement and social dialogue are included in the groups separate Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
