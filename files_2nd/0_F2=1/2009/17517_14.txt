This stock-build largely reects the impact of rising copper prices, leading to softer Chinese copper imports in the second half and the minimisation of consumer inventories.

Overall, the North Queensland mining operations, comprising the Mount Isa and Ernest Henry mines, produced 197,500 tonnes of copper in concentrate in 2009, a decrease of 25% over 2008.
Increased mill throughput and higher grades increased production by 7% at the Mount Isa operations, partially compensating for a 68% decrease in production at Ernest Henry due to the impact of record wet season ooding that required extensive pit dewatering in the first half, planned lower grades and the higher rate of stripping required to access the next ore zone.
The Mount Isa smelter produced 214,350 tonnes of anode, a decrease of 9% over 2008 as a result of lower feed from Ernest Henry.
The Townsville renery produced a record 277,300 tonnes of cathode, a 4% improvement compared to 266,500 tonnes in 2008, from North Queensland mined production and anode predominantly from the Altonorte smelter in north Chile.
Canada In 2009, the profitability of the Canadian division was severely impacted by reduced metal production and sales following unplanned metallurgical plant closures and slowdowns in response to the dramatic collapse in demand for sulphuric acid, lower North American demand for cathodes and a global shortage of concentrates.
Higher energy prices also impacted divisional profitability.

Volumes were affected by two seismic events which impacted mining rates, offset by a 5% improvement in head grades.
Zinc in concentrate production declined by 7% to 108,100 tonnes mainly due to a 2% decline in head grades, lower recoveries and reduced mining rates.
The collapse in sulphuric acid demand in North America together with the consequent impact on prices and a shortage of third party concentrate led the Kidd Metallurgical site to implement two temporary shutdowns during the year.
As a result, anode production from the Kidd smelter decreased by 26% to 73,200 tonnes.
