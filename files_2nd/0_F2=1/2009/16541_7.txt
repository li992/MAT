Description Production Performance We commenced progressive Vedanta is one of the largest Record production of 462,000 tonnes of commissioning of the 250,000 tonne Aluminium producers in India aluminium in FY 2009 was an increase Phase 1 of the Jharsuguda aluminium with mining and processing of 16.7% compared with FY 2008.
This smelter where 264 pots out of 304 facilities located in India.
increase in production is attributable to pots have been brought on-line to the first time production contribution of date.
The first phase of 250,000 tpa 82,000 tonnes from the new Jharsuguda is expected to be fully operational 120.5 million tonnes of Reserves aluminium smelter in FY 2009, which in the first quarter of FY 2010. and Resources of bauxite.
was offset to some extent by the ramp down of the MALCO smelter in mid Unit Costs Key locations December 2008 and a shutdown of FY 2009 witnessed two divergent halves India - Bauxite Mines a part of the BALCO Plant I smelter in with H1 FY 2009 driven by the buoyancy Q4 FY 2009, due to higher operational in the global markets leading to higher Niyamgiri costs.
Consequently, we are selling input costs.
This contrasted with the Mainpat surplus power to maximise returns.
deteriorating economic conditions in Bodai-Daldali H2 FY 2009 as a result of which input The production of wire rods, costs of commodities started softening.

Smelting costs at BALCO Plant the first stream, feeding our captive II were US$859 INR 39,436 per tonne Aluminium smelters requirements.
The second stream per tonne in FY 2009 compared with commenced commissioning costs of US$805 INR 32,385 per tonne Korba activities in April 2009.
We expect per tonne in FY 2008, primarily due to Jharsuguda to start progressive feeding of the higher input costs including carbon re nery with our own Niyamgiri and coal, despite improved operational Alumina re nery bauxite by mid FY 2010. ef ciencies.
Continued focus on reducing costs helped in achieving an Lanjigarh exit smelting cost of US$637 per tonne Korba at BALCO Plant II at end of FY 2009.
