British Land has formed two strategic joint ventures with Tesco and Sainsburys: working with the operators themselves helps align our business strategies to maximise the value of our assets.
During the year we have funded four further extensions to properties in our Tesco joint ventures totalling 50,300 sq ft producing an additional income of 1.1 million pa.
In total we have enlarged our superstore portfolio by 802,000 sq ft over the period of our ownership.
As operators are expanding into smaller formats we are now including foodstores under 25,000 sq ft in this category which were previously included in the in-town portfolio.
Additionally British Land owns 22 units let to food retailers on retail parks and shopping centres, totalling some 1.2 million sq ft.
These are included in the valuations of our retail warehouse and shopping centre portfolios.
