The replacement cost profit for the year is arrived at by excluding from profit inventory holding gains and losses and their associated tax effect.
Inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the average cost to BP of supplies incurred during the year and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out method, including any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost.
Inventory holding gains and losses, for this purpose, are calculated for all inventories except for those that are held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.
BP uses this measure to assist investors in assessing BPs performance from period to period.
Replacement cost profit for the group is a non-GAAP measure.
On pages 4-9, references within BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009 to profits, results and return on average capital employed are to those measures on a replacement cost basis unless otherwise indicated.
