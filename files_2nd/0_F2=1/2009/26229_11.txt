OUR PERFORMaNCE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 29 FOCUS ON GOvERNaNCE LGIMs governance approach is focused on protecting shareholders interests.
Since many of our investments are held as part of an index-tracking mandate, individual stocks cannot be sold or assigned a reduced weighting.
Instead, if we see a potential problem emerging in an investee company, our approach is to work with that company to ensure the best interests of its shareholders are maintained.
To achieve this, we engage in dialogue with the company and if our differences are not reconciled, we will follow up with a vote which reinforces our position at the companys Annual General Meeting.
During the course of 2009, LGIM held 136 meetings with company chairmen and non-executive directors on a variety of governance issues.
Our approach is steered by our adherence to the Combined Code of Corporate Governance and by the ABIs Principles for Social, Ethical and Environmental investment.
