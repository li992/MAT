The reduction in pro tability of the UK and international operations was underpinned by reduced assets under management following the negative market movements during the year and net out ows on the retail side of the business.
Assets under management decreased by 5.2% to 13.1 billion.
The institutional book showed strong growth over the period with net in ows of approximately 1.6 billion.
Southern Africa Operating pro t of the Southern Africa operations in Rands of R717.0 million is 2.9% lower than the prior period of R738.1 million.
Investment performance remained good and as a result performance fee revenue increased signi cantly to R354.5 million 2008: R252.7 million.
Assets under management in Rands decreased from R241.2 billion to R213.5 billion.
The retail side of the business experienced net in ows of R1.9 billion for the period and there were R5.1 billion of institutional out ows.
Costs The decrease in expenses is largely due to a decrease in variable remuneration in line with the decrease in pro tability and the effect of tighter cost control.
