Adjusted profits from joint ventures excluding valuation movements, movements in the fair value of derivatives and loss on property sales were 9.2 million, down 6.9 million on last year, mainly due to the sale of properties and the refinancing of GCP which has increased interest costs within the joint venture but reduced the Groups interest expense.
Administration costs fell by almost 10% year on year to 12.8 million primarily due to lower variable employee costs, reduced accounting charges for share-based compensation schemes and corporate overheads.
During the year the Groups headcount was reduced by six people around 10% as a result of business realignment initiatives.
Underlying finance costs were managed down by 30.0% to 20.8 million due to lower interest rates and reduced debt.
Adjusted earnings per share were 12.2 pence, 3.2% lower than last year.
This reduction in earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted profit before tax, described above.
Revaluation falls and loss on sale of assets caused the Group to report an accounting loss after tax of 436.1 million 2008: loss of 4.1 million.
Basic EPS for the year showed a loss of 241.1 pence 2008: loss of 2.2 pence.
Results of joint ventures The joint venture operations have contracted since last year end following disposals at GVP2, GWP and GCP.
At 31 March 2009 28.9% of Group rent roll and 32.2% of net assets were in 50:50 joint ventures: at 31 March 2008 the comparable figures were 36.3% and 37.2% respectively.
Non-recourse net debt in the joint ventures has fallen from 145.8 million at 31 March 2008 to 135.4 million at year end, primarily due to the repayment of the loan in GVP2 following the sale of 208 222 Regent Street, W1 in July.
The Groups net investment in joint ventures was 183.2 million compared to 390.6 million at the end of last year, a decline caused by valuation falls and significant property sales.
Our share of joint venture net rental income was 22.1 million, compared to 21.8 million for last year, principally due to a full years ownership of GCP.
The Groups share of joint venture adjusted profits fell to 9.2 million as a result of disposals and higher interest costs in GCP.
The underlying joint venture profits are stated after charging 4.7 million of GPE management fees 2008: 5.8 million.
Financial resources and capital management Although the Groups underlying profits were lower than last year, a favourable movement in 371.0m working capital contributed to the cash generated from operations improving to 48.5 million, Group consolidated net debt was up 21.0 million compared to 2008.
Group consolidated net debt was 371.0 million at down 13% from 31 March 2008 31 March 2009 down from 424.6 million a year earlier as a consequence of major disposals and operational cash flow.
The sales of properties including our share of joint ventures generated 102.9 million in proceeds.
Group gearing increased to 65.2% at 31 March 2009 from 40.5% at 31 March 2008 because of the fall in portfolio valuation which outweighed the reduction in debt.
Interest cover for the year improved to 2.1x 2008: 1.8x, the highest level for over four years.
