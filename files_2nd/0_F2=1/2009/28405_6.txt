Providents products compete to varying degrees with all these sources of small-sum, short-term credit to meet the needs of non-standard consumers.
Credit products that are tailored to the needs of the non-standard consumer tend to be more costly to deliver and incur higher risks for lenders and so pricing in this market typically exceeds that of the mainstream consumer credit market in the UK.
