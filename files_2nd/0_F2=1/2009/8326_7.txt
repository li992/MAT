A discussion of the policies we believe to be most critical in considering the impact of estimates and judgements on the Groups financial position and results of operations are set out on pages 60 to 63.

Free cash flow for the year at 791 million was very strong, increasing by 278 million compared to 2008.
The increase is primarily due to the increase in profitability and a 210 million year-on-year favourable movement in working capital.
Working capital has improved due to a reduction in coal stocks at Rugeley, which were built up as a result of flue gas desulphurisation FGD construction delays in 2008, a catch up on the sale of green certificates in Maestrale in 2009, and a reduction in debtors at the end of 2009 in both the US and UK.
Interest and tax payments were 50 million higher principally as a result of the impact of the weakening of sterling on the retranslation of the overseas interest and tax payments.
Maintenance capex was 40 million higher in 2009, with a major planned outage at Deeside being the biggest contributor to this increase.

Payment of this final dividend to shareholders registered on the Company share register on 28 May 2010 is due to be made on 24 June 2010, following approval at the 2010 Annual General Meeting which will be held on 18 May 2010.
Outlook Our performance in 2009 again reflects the strength of our international portfolio of both long-term contracted and merchant assets.
Whilst 2010 will reflect the sale of our Czech business and the likely impact of weak market conditions in the US and the UK, our high quality asset base means we are well positioned to capture value from any market recovery, and from periods of pricing volatility.
We continue to pursue a range of growth opportunities to create value for shareholders, and overall the Groups financial position is strong, with good corporate liquidity and free cash flow.
