It should be noted that this data in keeping with our past practice compares all sales in the year against the previous March 2008 year end valuations.

The recent post year end sales shown are in line with current valuation.
These are smaller lot sizes where the range of interested investors is larger as is usual and there are signs of increasing market activity.
