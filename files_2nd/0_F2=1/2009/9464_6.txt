Strong growth in the UK was offset by declines in other geographies.
As expected, the Benelux remained our most difficult market.
In the Nordics, strong growth in Finland was offset by the weakness in Sweden.
The second half in France saw a similar year on year decline to the first half, while the International business was stable on last year in the second half.
Both France and the International business showed modest growth in the fourth quarter.

Public Sector and Energy and Utilities benefited from a strong first half, with the second half being broadly stable against a strong 2008 comparative.

Adjusted operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles initially recognised on acquisition of 272 million 2008: 289 million was lower than last year, mainly as a result of the revenue decline experienced in the year.
Lower margin in the non-outsourcing business as a result of reduced utilisation was the main contributor to margin declining in a number of geographies.
This particularly impacted the Benelux.
Improvements in the UK and International broadly offset the declines elsewhere, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 7.4% 2008: 7.5%.
