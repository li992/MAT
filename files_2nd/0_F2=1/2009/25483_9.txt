The business earned fees on deals completed in the current year, however, the investments business has been negatively impacted by the state of the listed property investments market.
The revaluation of investment properties net of funding costs amounted to R230 million 2008: R447 million.
UK: This business, having commenced in May 2007, generated a year to date operating pro t of 774K 2008: 144K.
Australia re ects a newly created business focusing on property funds management.
Annual report 2009 75 Divisional review Property Activities Leading fund and asset manager, seeking selective trading opportunities Developments UK and Europe The Property Investments business is now fully operational.
The global financial crisis has severely affected the property market and therefore our business.
However, a number of opportunities have been identi ed and are being actively pursued.
We will continue to source UK stock for our various initiatives and consider suitable investments from the UK REIT sector for Investec and third party client investment purposes.
The Investec GLL Global Special Opportunities Real Estate Fund has invested in four properties in Chile 2, Argentina and the USA.
The fund will continue to invest in international direct commercial real estate with caution and endeavour to unlock value in the short-term.
A total of e375 million has been raised to date and of this, e75 million has been invested.
The business will raise capital for the UK Special Opportunities Property Fund when it believes it prudent and responsible to do so.
Development and refurbishment opportunities will be considered on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with experienced operators.
South Africa A slow down in global economic activity has hampered initiatives for new development.
However, the business is underpinned by a good quality pipeline and the Property Investments business which provides annuity income.
Notwithstanding the negative outlook for property in the short-term, prospects remain positive with numerous projects underway and opportunities to convert and refurbish existing holdings.
The ability to fund new grassroots developments is extremely expensive with anticipated yields hindering progress.
The global property products under development are expected to provide a broader range of investment products for local investors, e. g. UK Special Opportunities Property Fund and investing into UK REITs.
Total funds under management are R846 million 2008: R1 176 million.
Australia The Investec Property Opportunity Fund has largely invested its equity.
The fund is performing in line with its targeted return.
The business is positioning itself for further fund raising opportunities in the second half of this year to take advantage of a stressed market.
Total funds under management are AUD252 million 2008: AUD252 million.
Outlook, risks and opportunities UK and Europe The ability to raise capital for the newly established UK fund is dif cult in the current market due to the lack of liquidity.
There will be opportunities as the financial crisis unwinds.
The repricing of the UK property market has resulted in the business being able to source potentially attractive real estate for the Investec GLL Global Special Opportunities Real Estate Fund.
The distressed UK REIT market and its recent aggressive repricing is also providing potential investment for Investec direct and third party investment.
South Africa Property, like all the other sectors in the economy, is susceptible to weakness when the economy experiences a slow down as the underlying tenants become vulnerable to the vagaries of the economy.
New developments have been hampered as there has been a reduction in tenant demand, and many current opportunities are not able to achieve the required rental levels that would give an acceptable return.
Current sellers of vacant land have not adjusted their pricing to re ect the current downturn in the market.
Opportunities to enhance value to existing portfolios remain positive.
The volatility in global markets has resulted in a sharp sell-off in South African property equities.
Markets are expected to start re ecting value which creates opportunities on the back of weakening prices.
Australia The Australia REIT mangers are raising equity to replace debt that cannot be re nanced.
The high cost of debt to the property markets suggest further asset devaluation in the short-term Given current market conditions and the age of the fund, the focus is on the growth and development of the assets under management.
We will continue to look for acquisition opportunities in the current market.
