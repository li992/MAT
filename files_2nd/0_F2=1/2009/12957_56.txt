They are part of the same northeast trending mineralised structure, which has been offset by north-south belt discordant structures.
Geological logging of core and interpretation confirms that the mineralised system occurs at a volcanic sedimentary contact, where a prominent and continuous lapilli tuff unit acts as a marker horizon.
The average bedding strikes 020 and dips 60 to 76 to the west.
Graded-bedding is common and suggests the sequence is overturned.
The host sequences have been intruded by felsic dykes, gabbros and granitic bodies.
Both sediment and volcaniclastics have been sheared and intruded by a suite of igneous rocks including gabbros and porphyries.
These intrusives create competency contrasts and can act as rigid bodies which then At Massawa a total strike length of influence the geometry of structures and subsequent gold mineralisation.
Mineralisation 8.5 kilometres has been drill tested, but only is hosted in a variety of rocks including: greywackes, volcaniclastics and both mafic a four kilometre portion of this has been gabbros and felsic intrusives.
The mineralised system is however structurally evaluated for the present mineral resource controlled and deformation is essentially brittle-ductile.
is composed of sericite, silica, carbonate, pyrite, arsenopyrite and locally hematite.
Along the Massawa system, a high grade south plunging shoot has been identified in North 2 with an average grade of plus 7g t and in the Central Zone narrow silicified structures within a broader low grade envelope contain bonanza style grades with coarse visible gold.
North 2 830 metres strike length The gold mineralisation at North 2 is bounded by two carbonaceous shears and is associated with the brittle fracturing of a greywacke host and disseminated arsenopyrite.
A high grade plus 7g t southerly plunging shoot has been defined by drilling and is the result of the bedding and shear plane intersection.
The up plunge continuity was tested in Lion Extension to the north and has been confirmed over an additional strike length of 255 metres, before being offset by a north-south structure.
Extensions to the northeast are viewed as a high priority target.
In the southern end of the North 2 zone, where there was an apparent gap in the mineralisation towards North 1, a deeper hole MDH232 was drilled to test 250 metres below the surface and returned a good intersection: 44.88 metres at 3.42g t. This was drilled below an earlier hole MWDH042, which returned only 10.66 metres at 0.57g t, and further enhances the potential of Massawa at depth as well as along strike.
North 1 1 049 metres strike length North 1 is structurally more complex than North 2, where north-south structures cause discontinuities in the northeast trending mineralisation.
Mineralisation occurs in three to four bands with the highest grade and more continuous zone hosted within a greywacke, displaying similar characteristics alterations and deformation to the North 2 mineralisation.
The two other bands are irregular and lower grade, hosted along the volcanic sediments contact or within narrow porphyry bodies intruding the volcaniclastics.
Although, near surface, the mineralisation in North 1 is narrow and of erratic weak grade, previous drilling did highlight the potential at depth MWDDH139: 20.68 metres at 7.35g t. A further five bore holes were drilled to test the depth potential of North 1.
Drill results from this phase confirmed and enhanced the potential at depth, especially towards the north, which may be the continuation of the south dipping high grade shoot in North 2.
Intersections from this zone include: MWDDH258 - 10.40 metres at 5.22g t: MWDDH259 - 17.95 metres at 2.21g t and 10.50 metres at 2.80g t intersected at plus 285 metres vertical depth.
However, in the centre of this zone results returned low grades 6.30 metres at 1.45g t before the structure dilates in the south with 16.19 metres at 3.87g t. Central Zone 1 & 2 combined strike: 1 532 metres The Central Zone is defined by a large altered envelope containing numerous mineralised bands which occur on deformed and altered intrusive margins and along sheared bands within greywackes.
Although mineralisation is structurally controlled, gold is related to strongly brittle-ductile zones, associated with strong pyrite, arsenopyrite and hematite veins occurring within greywacke, gabbro, porphyries and volcaniclastics.
The Central Zone has been divided into two based on the host lithologies: Central 1 and 2.
In Central 1, mineralisation locates within the volcaniclastic package while in Central 2, the structure transgresses the contact and is hosted by sediments.
RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 67 Composite 54-79 Exploration R 3 25 10 8:40 AM Page 15 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K In Central 1 the drilling has highlighted one main mineralised envelope, termed 1, together with 3 to 4 footwall envelopes.
Within envelope 1, two to three discreet anastomising shears have been logged, varying in width from 1 to 20 metres.
These shears occur along the upper and lower contacts of the gabbro and can also wander in and out of the contact zones into the surrounding sediments.
These shears are silicified and contain abundant quartz carbonate and haematite together with coarse visible gold generating bonanza style grades: MWDDH172 - 16.55 metres at 5.38g t: MWDDH178 - 15 metres at 10.9g t: MWDDH193 - 9.1 metres at 6.75g t: MWDDH184 - 4.1 metres at 33.78g t: MWDDH195 - 14.9 metres at 7.8g t: MWDDH198 - 10.3 metres at 76g t including 0.8 metres at 947g t: MWDDH201 - 11.1 metres at 49.9g t including 4 metres at 133.73g t: MWDDH207 - 18 metres at 12.67g t: and MWDDH171 - 11.5 metres at 9.7g t. This gold forms a distinctive population above 13g t in the statistics of the Massawa deposit and averages 30g t. In Central 1 these shears are continuous over 800 metres before either wrapping around or penetrating a large porphyry intrusion.
The shears then appear to link across to another structure in Central 2 which locates on the volcaniclastic sediment contact and have been confirmed over a strike of 400 metres.
In order to confirm the continuity of these shears in the Central Zone and aid the evaluation process a programme of 11 priority holes was drilled on 25 metre centres, both on section and between sections.
All holes intersected these shears but the grade was variable.
However, one hole returned exceptionally high grade: MWDDH398 - 32.2 metres at 51.6g t including 5.8 metres at 278.2g t and 1 metre at 1 568g t. These shears are currently being modelled separately in order to better constrain the influence of the high grade zones and develop a more accurate evaluation of the deposit.
Massawa South At Massawa South, a linear northeast trending, detailed gold in soil anomaly 3.4 kilometres by 50 to 350 metres, plus 20ppb up to 360ppb was defined.
The soil anomaly was initially tested by 11 RAB lines 200 to 500 metres spacing, totalling 5 175 metres.
The RAB results confirm the soil trend, and include: MWRAB180 - 17 metres at 2g t: MWRAB200 - 3 metres at 10.1g t: MWRAB208 - 9 metres at 0.69g t: MWRAB209 - 21 metres at 1.32g t: MWRAB227 - 6 metres at 1.33g t: MWRAB239 - 21 metres at 1.35g t: MWRAB288 - 9 metres at 1.99g t: MWRAB290 - 3 metres at 1.2g t: and MWRAB291 - 3 metres at 9.4g t.
