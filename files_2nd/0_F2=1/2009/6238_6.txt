and exploit mineral potential, and they may specify required levels of capital expenditure and minimum environmental, health and safety standards.
In order to maintain these concessions in good standing, companies are required to pay yearly fees based on hectares under claim and to demonstrate continued work in progress.
No royalty payments are required in Mexico for extracting metals.
Mining concessions grant rights to mine: concession holders are required to negotiate access to the land under which the concession is located with the surface land owner.
Companies holding concessions must be incorporated under the laws of Mexico, although they may be wholly owned by foreign investors.
The scal regime There are no taxes or levies imposed specifically on the mining industry.
Companies are subject to standard corporate income tax rates, which are determined by the Federal Government.
Based on the Tax Reform Bill approved by the Mexican Government in December 2009, this rate will temporarily increase to 30% for the years 2010-2012, then decrease to 29% in 2013 and revert to 28% in 2014.

Mining companies must also obtain environmental impact permits prior to any mining and exploration activities.
There are ofcial standards for building and managing tailings dams.
Mexican environmental regulations have become increasingly stringent over the last decade as a result of international agreements that Mexico has ratied, including the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation parallel to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity, among others.
Workforce Mexicos long history of mining and an extensive natural resources sector provide a skilled workforce, although the growth of the mining industry in recent years has led to some scarcity of trained workers.
There have been a number of instances in recent years of mining companies facing industrial action and work stoppages: under Mexican law, it is permissible for employees to engage in industrial action in sympathy with unionised employees of other companies who are engaged in a dispute, despite the absence of any dispute with their own employer.
Fresnillo Group workers did not support any such actions in 2009.
