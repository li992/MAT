08 Introduction | Path to a new medicine Path to a new medicine The discovery, development and commercialisation of a medicine is a complex External clinicians process.
This is a high level overview of the process for a new small molecule and organisations may be medicine.
It is not intended to and nor does it represent involved in the design and the life-cycle of any particular medicine or of every medicine discovered and running of these studies.
These third parties are typically involved at AstraZeneca people each study phase AstraZeneca stakeholders and other third parties Begin to develop manufacturing route Collaborations with to ensure the Create appropriate academia and external manufacturing process branding for the new clinicians to access the is robust and costs medicine in Begin the process 5 best external science and are minimised preparation for of seeking patent medical opinion.
