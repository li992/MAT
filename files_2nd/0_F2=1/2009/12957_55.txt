resources of 36.76 million tonnes at 2.87g t for 3.39 million ounces to a successful prefeasibility study by year end, including mineral reserves of 10.03 million tonnes at 4.64g t for 1.50 million ounces.
Massawa The Massawa gold project is located within the Kounemba permit in Eastern Senegal which geologically lies within the 150 kilometre long Mako belt, itself part of the Kedougou-Kniba Inlier KKI, the westernmost exposed part of the Paleoproterozoic Birimian terrain.
The granite-greenstone assemblage of the KKI, is dated between 2.213 and 2.198 Ga, and was intruded by granitoids yielding ages between 2.160 and 2.070 Ga.
The volcanic belt and sedimentary basin rocks are divided into the Mako supergroup in the west and the Dial-Dalma supergroups in the east.
The Mako supergroup, comprises mafic-ultramafic and felsic volcanic rocks intruded by granitoids that form the Kakadian batholith.
A regional crustal scale shear zone, the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone MTZ with northeast-southwest trend exploits the lithological contact between the Mako and the Dial-Dalma Supergroups and is the host structure to mineralisation at Massawa.
A total strike length of 8.5 kilometres has been drill tested, but only a four kilometre portion of this has been evaluated for the present mineral resource modelling and has been drill tested to a 50 metre by 50 metre spacing to vertical depths of 250 metres.
In 2009, a total of 220 diamond holes for 53 820 metres and 84 RC holes for 6 272 metres were drilled.
