Introduction from Patrick OSullivan As the Group embarks on significant change, I am very pleased to be asked to add my experience to the Board in helping us meet the challenges ahead.
One of my initial priorities has been to spend time getting to know as much about our business and people as possible.
It is clear we have some very strong businesses and others that are positioned strategically to win in increasingly competitive markets.
The management team has also identified numerous opportunities for generating value from these businesses working together, which will be a real area of focus during 2010.
We have a clear strategy and vision for the Group predicated on improving the value we offer both customers and shareholders.
