The Group case study including our share of JVs took lease surrenders worth 0.7 million per annum over 28,300 sq ft during the year 2008: 294,000 sq ft.
In many cases these transactions enabled rental levels to be enhanced from the previous passing rent or provided for the alignment of an occupational lease to allow a future refurbishment scheme to be implemented.
The portfolio void rate at year end of 7.8% 2008: 3.2% has increased partly due to lease expiries at Wigmore Street, W1 and Buchanan House, 24 31 Holborn, EC1 where we have deferred redevelopment and have been seeking short-term lettings to maintain flexibility.
Excluding these properties where the strategy has recently changed to reflect market conditions, the void rate would be 5.9%.
Letting activity since the year end has reduced the void rate to 7.3%.
