Land Securities Annual Report 2009 38 Business review Retail Portfolio A significant reduction in sales growth hit both retailers and landlords hard, and impacted values heavily.
Our market The long-term strength of the retail property market has been based on the historic Chart 26 trend of retail sales growth, together with relatively tight planning controls and the UK retail sales growth to 31 March % need for retailers to improve store locations to meet changing consumer demand.

In the occupational market, we are matching developments to demand for high quality space in attractive locations.
Mitigating voids will remain a priority and we will work closely with occupiers to support each other through these tough conditions.
There is a substantial oversupply of office space in London, but, by combining flexibility on terms with good quality product, we are well placed to compete for new tenants for the limited space we have available.
In London, we have always responded early to market cycles and we will continue to do the same, recycling capital to strengthen our position and maximise potential future returns for shareholders.
By taking tough decisions early we are able to evolve with the market as it moves into the next phase of the cycle.
