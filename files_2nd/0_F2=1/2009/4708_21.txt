Diageo Annual Report 2009 38 Operating results 2009 Analysis by business area and brand In order to assist the reader of the fi financial statements, the following comparison of 2009 with 2008 includes tables which present the exchange, acquisitions and disposals and organic components of the year on year movement for each of volume, sales, net sales and operating profi t. Organic movements in the tables below are calculated as follows: a The organic movement percentage is the amount in the column headed Organic movement in the tables below expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the column headed 2008 Reported, the column headed Exchange and the amounts, if any, in respect of disposals and transfers included in the column headed Acquisitions, disposals and transfers.
The inclusion of the column headed Exchange in the organic movement calculation refl ects the adjustment to recalculate the prior period results as if they had been generated at the current periods exchange rates.
b Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the current period, the group, in organic movement calculations, adjusts the results for the comparable prior period to exclude the amount the group earned in that period that it could not have earned in the current period i. e. the period between the date in the prior period, equivalent to the date of the disposal in the current period, and the end of the prior period.
As a result, the organic movement numbers refl ect only comparable performance.
Similarly, if a business was disposed of part way through the equivalent prior period, then its contribution would be completely excluded from that prior periods performance in the organic movement calculation, since the group recognised no contribution from that business in the current period.
In the calculation of operating profi t, the overheads included in disposals are only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed of, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.
For acquisitions, a similar adjustment is made in the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions subsequent to the end of the equivalent prior period, the post acquisition results in the current period are excluded from the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the prior period, post acquisition results are included in full in the prior period but are only included from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period.
