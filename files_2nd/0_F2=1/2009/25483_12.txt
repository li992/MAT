Credit and counterparty risk arises when funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether re ected on or off balance sheet.
Credit and counterparty risk arises primarily from three types of transactions: Lending transactions, giving rise to a direct exposure.
The risk is created that an obligor will be unable or unwilling to repay capital and or interest on advances and loans granted to it.
This category includes bank placements, where we have placed funds with other financial institutions: Issuer risk on financial instruments where payments due from the issuer of a financial instrument will not be received: and Trading transactions, giving rise to settlement and replacement risk collectively counterparty risk.
- Settlement risk is the risk that the settlement of a transaction does not take place as expected, with one party effecting required settlements as they fall due but not receiving settlements to which they are entitled.
- Replacement risk is the risk following default by the original counterparty resulting in the contract holder having to enter into a replacement contract with a second counterparty in order to nalise the transaction.
Credit and counterparty risk can manifest as country risk as a result of the geopolitical and transfer risk associated with exposures arising from transactions with borrowers who are resident in a particular foreign country, or dependent on that countrys economy.
Credit and counterparty risk may also arise in other ways and it is the role of the various independent credit committees, assisted by Credit Risk Management, to identify situations falling outside these fide nitions where credit risk may also be present.
Audited Credit and counterparty risk governance structure To manage, measure and mitigate credit and counterparty risk, independent credit committees exist in each geography where we assume credit risk.
These committees operate under board approved delegated limits, policies and procedures.
There is a high level of executive and non-executive involvement in the credit decision making forums.
It is policy that all centralised credit committees have a majority of voting members who are independent of the originating business unit.
All decisions to enter into a transaction are based on unanimous consent.
Annual report 2009 91 Risk and governance Risk management In addition to the Group Credit Committee, the following processes assist in managing, measuring and monitoring credit and counterparty risk: Day to day arrears management and regular arrears reporting ensures that individual positions and any potential trends are dealt with in a timely manner Watchlist Committee, which reviews the management of distressed loans, potential problem loans and exposures in arrears that require additional attention and supervision Corporate Watch Forum, which reviews and manages exposures that may potentially become distressed as a result of changes in the economic environment or adverse share price movements, or that are vulnerable to volatile exchange rate or interest rate movements.
Whilst we do not have a separate country risk committee, the Global Credit Committees will consider, analyse, and assess the appropriate limits to be recorded when required, to extend the loans to foreign jurisdictions.
When applications are submitted to the local group credit committee, consideration of the country risk element forms part of the sanctioning process.
The local group credit committee has the power to recommend to the Global Credit Committee an appropriate country credit limit where undertaking a particular transaction could exceed the approved country limit.
The Global Credit Committee is responsible for approving country limits.
Credit and counterparty risk appetite We have a preference for exposure to EU countries, other G10 countries, Australasia, South Africa and speci c countries where we have subsidiaries or branches.
Credit and counterparty risk is always assessed with reference to the aggregate exposure to a single counterparty or group of related parties to avoid or minimise over exposure and concentration risk.
Our assessment of our clients includes consideration of their character and integrity, core competencies, track record and financial strength.
A strong emphasis is placed on income and cash ow streams generated by the clients, third party income or cash ow streams derived from lease or rental agreements in support of property related transactions.
In this manner, we seek comfort in mitigating our risk by thoroughly assessing the ability of our borrowers to meet their payment obligations.
Furthermore we have very little appetite for unsecured debt and ensure that good quality collateral is provided in support of obligations refer to page 120 for further information.
We typically originate loans with the intent of holding these assets to maturity, and thereby developing a hands on and longstanding relationship with our clients.
In certain instances we have elected to sell certain assets down and or securitised them refer to page 89 for further information.
Pricing is motivated by the relevant business unit on a transaction by transaction basis, with consideration given to the manner of origination of the asset and the forward strategy for the asset, capital usage and liquidity.
Pricing recommendations are discussed and agreed at the appropriate credit committee to ensure that reward is appropriate to the risk and that pricing is not compromised in the pursuit of volume or relationship.
As a consequence of market behaviour, pricing for similar risk may differ from time to time.
Audited Management and measurement of credit and counterparty risk Fundamental principles employed in the management of credit and counterparty risk are: A clear fide nition of our target market A quantitative and qualitative assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties Appropriate independent due diligence Analysis of all related risks, including concentration risk concentration risk considerations include asset class, industry, counterparty, and geographical concentration Prudential limits Regular monitoring and review of existing and potential exposures once facilities have been approved A high level of executive involvement in decision-making with non-executive review and oversight.
Regular reporting of credit and counterparty risk exposures within our operating units is made to management, the executives and the board.
The board regularly reviews and approves the appetite for credit and counterparty risk, which is documented in risk appetite statements and policy documents and implemented by our Group Credit division.
Despite strict adherence to the above principles increased default risk may arise from unforeseen circumstances particularly in times of extreme market volatility.
Investec completes scenario tests on its loan portfolio with regards to the capital held.
These tests stress the existing portfolio to allow the bank to identify underlying risks and manage them accordingly.
These stresses include but are not limited to residential and commercial property prices, foreign exchange rates, default rates, impairments and capital usage.
The credit risk stress tests also play an integral part in the banks capital planning process.
A large proportion of the portfolio is not rated by external rating agencies.
As a result we mainly place reliance upon internal considerations of counterparties and borrowers, and use ratings prepared externally where available for support.
Within the credit approval process all available internal and external ratings are included in the assessment of the client quality.
92 Annual report 2009 Risk and governance Risk management The internal rating models used are speci c to each portfolio.
The internal ratings are used as an input into the credit decision and as a means of assessing the risk of rated portfolios.
Ongoing development of internal rating models has yielded good results in Project Finance, Private Bank Property, Corporate and Bank and Financial Institutions areas of operation.
We remain focused on developing our models in the light of our idiosyncratic risk pro le and against extreme downturn events.
Fitch, Standard and Poors and Moodys have been approved as eligible external credit assessment institutions ECAIs for the purposes of determining external credit ratings with the following elections: In relation to banks and securities rms, Fitch has been selected by us as the primary ECAI, with Standard & Poors being used as support where a Fitch rating is not available.
In relation to sovereigns, corporates and small to medium enterprises, both Standard & Poors and Moodys are considered to be eligible ECAIs.
Where the assessments of these two ECAIs differ, the more conservative rating will be applied.
Credit and counterparty risk in the UK and Europe The UK and European group comprises businesses in the UK, including a branch in Ireland and banking businesses in the Channel Islands and Switzerland.
Credit risk arises mainly through our Private Banking and Capital Markets activities, although some credit and counterparty risk does arise in other businesses.
Private Banking The Private Bank has businesses in the UK London and Manchester, including branches in Ireland, the Channel Islands and Switzerland.
Credit risk arises from the following activities which we undertake in the division: structured property finance, private client lending, specialised lending, growth and acquisition finance, and asset based lending on receivables and stock.
The Structured Property Finance area provides senior debt and secondary funding for property transactions covering the residential and commercial markets.
Our exposure to the property market is well diversi ed.
Our properties are well located residential or good quality commercial assets with recognised tenant covenant, there are also some exposures linked to asset performance.
Assets are located in the UK, with limited exposure to retail property assets in Germany and Switzerland, which are anchored by major European retail covenants.
Client quality and expertise are at the core of our credit philosophy.
Debt service cover ratios are core to the lending process supported by reasonable loan to security values.
These average at approximately 80% taking into account recent market falls.
All facilities are reviewed at least annually and property values are monitored by reference to reports from our appointed panel valuation rms.
Committees review and monitor our mezzanine funding exposure on a quarterly basis.
Growth and Acquisition Finance provides composite debt funding to proven management teams, running UK based mid-market companies.
Transaction sizes typically range between 8 million and 20 million.
Credit risk is assessed against debt service coverage from the robustness of the cash generation for the business both historically and against forecasts.
Higher risk exposures arising out of the transactions mentioned above is approximately 200 million, against a total portfolio of 3.6 billion.
Asset Based Lending provides working capital and business loans secured on collateral or assets used in the conduct of the business, for example, account receivables, inventory, plant and machinery, and property.
We also provide advances against cash ow or other assets such as committed income or rights.
Specialised Lending provides bespoke credit facilities to high net worth individuals and nancially sophisticated clients.
We also provide funding secured on contracted cash ows, including media rights and sponsorship transactions where certainty of serviceability, client quality and expertise are key.
Private Client Lending provides bespoke mortgages and secured lending to high net worth and high income individuals.
Credit risk is assessed against prudent debt servicing cover ratios.
Lending is underpinned by good quality assets, including residential and commercial property, bank guarantees, discretionary investment portfolios and cash deposits.
In determining serviceability, we also consider the liquidity of the client, including cash reserves and liquid asset holdings.
Funding is characterised by long-term annuity income and a historically low probability of default.
Property assets are located predominantly in the UK, with some exposure to prime residential areas in Europe.
All facilities are reviewed at least annually and property values are monitored by our appointed panel valuation rms.
The total bespoke mortgage portfolio at 31 March 2009 was 224 million.
Annual report 2009 93 Risk and governance Risk management Capital Markets The bulk of Capital Markets activities are conducted from London and Ireland.
As part of the daily management of liquidity, the treasury function places funds with banks and other financial institutions.
These market counterparties are highly rated with credit risk of a systemic nature in the UK, Europe and US.
Our trading portfolio consists of positions in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, with some non precious metal positions.
Credit risk arises from normal trading risks.
We maintain a thorough risk process that reviews and monitors all potential credit risks inherent in customer trading facilities.
These positions are marked to market daily with margin calls where necessary to mitigate credit exposure in the event of counterparty default.
Within the banking business, credit risk can arise from structured finance, project and resource nancing, asset finance, acquisition finance, principal finance and corporate lending activities.
There are approved limits specifying the maximum exposure to each individual counterparty, to minimise concentration risk.
Facilities are secured on the assets of the underlying corporate.
The credit appetite for each counterparty is based on the financial strength of the principal borrower, underlying cash ow and security.
While most of the activities of our Capital Markets division are concentrated in Europe, any exposure to counterparties outside this jurisdiction is mitigated through a stringent country risk approval and monitoring process, and covered by political risk insurance where deemed appropriate.
A summary of the nature of the lending within some of the key areas within the banking business is provided below: Structured and Asset Finance: loans leases against xed assets linked to the success of the business they are employed in.
These transactions amortise from anticipated cash ows.
Project Finance: provides advisory, debt and equity arranging services to renewable energy projects and public private projects, e. g. roads, hospitals, prisons.
Loans are secured on the project themselves with a high degree of due diligence around both the delivery risks and the cash ow to repay any facilities.
Acquisition Finance: participation in senior debt facilities in the leveraged buy-out market relating to medium to large corporates.
Maximum exposure is approximately 20 million per entity, giving portfolio diversity.
Principal Finance: securitisation of our assets, predominantly residential and commercial mortgages.
There is modest investment and trading in structured credit investments see page 89 for further information.
Commodities and Resource Finance: working capital lending and commodity price risk hedging to base and precious metal producing entities.
Provable reserves and good cash ow generation is paramount in the credit decision process.
Investment Banking Counterparty risk in this area is modest.
All share underwriting is fully sub underwritten with well known market counterparties.
The business also trades approved shares on an approved basis and makes markets in shares where we are appointed corporate broker under pre agreed market risk limits.
Settlement trades are all on a delivery versus payment basis, through major stock exchanges.
Credit risk only occurs in the event of counterparty failure and would be linked to any mark to market losses on the underlying security.
Asset Management Investec Asset Management Limited regularly transact with well known rated market counterparties.
These are all on an exchange traded delivery versus payment basis and exposure is to a move in the underlying security in the unlikely event a counterparty fails.
Credit and counterparty risk in South Africa Credit and counterparty risk is assumed mainly through the Private Bank, Capital Markets, and Asset Finance Reichmans Capital divisions.
Private Banking Lending products are primarily offered through our structured property and growth and acquisition finance activities, and are targeted to meet the requirements of our clients.
Central to our credit philosophy is the concept of sustainability of income through the cycle.
As such, the client base has been fide ned to include high net worth clients who through diversi cation of income streams will reduce income volatility and individuals with a profession which has historically supported a high and sustainable income stream irrespective of stage in the economic cycle.
A large portion of the lending portfolio is supported by residential and commercial property collateral.
Exposure to commercial and retail properties was originally approved at conservative loan to value ratios.
Income producing assets are generally substantially let with good quality anchor tenants.
Collateral exposure to the South African property market is regionally diversi ed primarily Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth.
Serviceability of a loan advanced against property and not only asset value and quality of the client are primary considerations in the credit assessment process.
94 Annual report 2009 Risk and governance Risk management The combination of low probability of default clients due to our niche focus and appropriate loan to value ratios results in a low level of expected loss which has been borne out by historical experience of actual losses.
The global financial crisis impacted negatively on defaults and impairments across the residential and commercial property portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.
These defaults are mainly made up of a relatively small number of clients.
Further information is provided on pages 118 and 119.
Capital Markets Investec Corporate Treasury provides money market and foreign exchange products to corporates and institutions.
We are an active market maker in the spot and forward US Dollar Rand interbank markets.
Trading transactions giving rise to issuer, settlement and replacement risk were among the primary areas of potential credit and counterparty risk in the year under review.
Simulation based methodologies have been implemented for the majority of the Corporate Treasury product offering, the bene t of which is the identi cation of increases in exposures as a result of changes in volatility and prices and the identi cation of roll-off risk.
The Specialised Finance, Project Finance and Resource Finance businesses lend money on a structured basis to corporates, government and institutions, with full recourse to either a suitable asset or to the balance sheet of the entity to which the funds are advanced.
Typical assets that are funded include property, plant and equipment, infrastructure and movable assets.
Credit limits are set for each counterparty and monitored to ensure risk is mitigated.
The credit appetite for each counterparty is based on the financial strength of the principal borrower, underlying security, cash ow and, in the case of trading products, the nature of the underlying security traded.
The Resource Finance business may be exposed to countries presenting complex legal and political risks.
Politcal risk insurance is taken to ensure political risks are well managed.
There is also strong adherence to prudent country risk limits to manage concentration risk on an ongoing basis.
Most of the Resource Finance business activities form part of the corporate asset class as fide ned by Basel ll, since recourse in the event of default will be to the total assets of the corporate and not merely the resources being nanced.
Due to the relative illiquidity of the credit derivative market in South Africa, counterparty exposures and mitigation bene ts obtained as a result of credit derivative transactions are negligible.
Reichmans Capital Reichmans Capital is an asset finance business which operates on a premium margin business model for small and medium sized corporates.
The business is a relatively small portion of the overall group credit exposure.
Credit and counterparty risk in Mauritius Investec Bank Mauritius Limited offers various banking services and its primary business activities are corporate lending, property finance, resource finance and structured finance.
Target market includes both corporate and private clients.
Prudential limits have been set and are monitored daily.
Investec Bank Mauritius Limited is a subsidiary of Investec Bank Limited.
It has a decentralised credit approval and management process in compliance with our group credit philosophy, policy and procedures.
Credit and counterparty risk in Australia Investec Bank Australia Limited operates within a clearly fide ned framework for managing credit risk.
The policies and procedures for credit risk management are consistent with those of the group and comply with the prudential standards issued by the APRA.
Credit and counterparty risk is assumed through transacting with target private and corporate clients, project and resource finance, and the placement of surplus liquidity with highly rated domestic banks and financial institutions.
Details with respect to the nature of the credit and counterparty risk assumed is similar to that of the activity conducted within our UK operations.
Audited Asset quality analysis - credit risk classi cation and provisioning policy It is a policy requirement that each operating division overseen by Central Credit Management makes provision for speci c impairments and calculates the appropriate level of portfolio impairments.
This is in accordance with established group guidelines and in conjunction with the Watchlist Committee policy and process.
In the financial statements, credit losses and impairments are reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The information provided below re ects the guidelines and fide nitions that have been applied in assessing the asset quality of credit exposures see page 106.
The impairment fide nitions and guidelines are consistent with IFRS.
IFRS differs from the requirements laid out in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards Basel II framework which has been adopted by the banking regulators in all of the locales in which we have operations.
IFRS focuses on the concept of incurred loss, whereas Basel ll centres on the concept of expected loss.
The reconciling differences are primarily due to the fact that IFRS impairments only re ect a decrease in the value of assets with credit risk where a loss trigger event has occurred, and only that portion of the expected loss which has actually been incurred at the reporting date.
A loss trigger event is an event which exhibits a high correlation to the crystallisation of loss.

96 Annual report 2009 Risk and governance Risk management Audited Credit risk mitigation Collateral is assessed with reference to the sustainability of value and the likelihood of realisation.
Acceptable collateral generally exhibits characteristics that allow for it to be held physically and appropriately valued.
The bulk of collateral taken by the Private Bank, which makes up a substantial portion of on balance sheet assets, is commercial and residential real estate.
Commercial real estate generally takes the form of good quality property often underpinned by strong third party leases.
Residential property is also generally of a high quality and based in desirable locations.
In the year under review, there was downward pressure on the value of commercial and residential real estate as a result of the global economic slowdown in all our key operating jurisdictions UK, South Africa and Australia.
This has resulted in an increased focus on residential and commercial property valuations.
It is our policy to obtain a formal valuation, performed by an approved valuer of every commercial property offered as collateral for a lending facility before advancing funds under the credit facility and to revalue all commercial properties held as collateral on a regular basis, at the discretion of the credit committee.
Residential properties valued by a combination of Computer Aided Valuation CAV and approved valuers, if applicable.
Other common forms of collateral in the retail asset class are motor vehicles, cash and share portfolios.
Property is split between residential and commercial classes with commercial consisting of investment and development sub classes.
Development property is further analysed into Residential Land, Residential Buildings, Commercial Industrial, Commercial Retail and Commercial Of ce.
The majority of credit mitigation within our Treasury activities is in the form of netting primarily International Swap Dealers Association, Global Master Securities Lending Agreement and International Securities Master Agreement and margining agreements primarily through Credit Support Agreements.
Where netting agreements have been signed and the enforceability is supported by external legal opinion within the legal jurisdiction of the agreement, the exposures for all product categories covered by such agreements should be stated net of any liabilities owing by Investec to the agreement counterparty for those product categories.
Set-off has been applied between assets subject to credit risk and related liabilities in the financial statements where: A legally enforceable right to set-off exists: and There is an intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
In addition to the above accounting set-off criteria, banking regulators impose the following additional criteria: Debit and credit balances relate to the same obligor counterparty Debit and credit balances be denominated in the same currency and have identical maturities Exposures subject to set-off are risk managed on a net basis.
For this reason there will be instances where credit and counterparty exposures are displayed on a net basis in these financial statements but reported on a gross basis to regulators.
An analysis of collateral is provided on page 120. Credit and counterparty risk year in review UK and Europe The year in review has seen large market volatilities caused by the global financial market crisis and the subsequent economic downturn.
Through prudent risk management, exposures to large well published, distressed, bankrupted and failed counterparties have been avoided or losses substantially minimised.
The worsening economy has made it more dif cult to refinance or sell assets due to reduced liquidity and vastly lower asset prices in the market for all asset classes, in particular property, equities and commodities.
Many traditional purchasers of assets either have not been able to raise funding to acquire new assets, or believe that assets will continue to cheapen and are cautious in their approach to new acquisitions.
The slowdown has affected most asset classes and we have seen both property and corporate lending being negatively impacted particularly from diminishing asset values.
Core loans and advances increased by 13.1% to 6.0 billion, primarily as a result of currency uctuations rather than increased lending activity.
Approximately 20% of the book is denominated in Euro which has strengthened against Pounds Sterling in the year under review.
Default loans net of impairments have increased from 2.3% to 3.6% of core loans and advances, but remain within tolerable levels.
The credit loss ratio has increased from 0.5% to 1.6%.
All accounts are proactively managed and customers have demonstrated ability to service loans where assets have not been sold.
The relatively low interest rate environment has enabled clients to bear the fairly low interest burden attached to their debt for longer periods.
Holding assets for longer periods has thus allowed customers to avoid forced sale scenarios which may have exacerbated already depressed asset values.
The performance of all accounts is regularly reviewed by the independent credit function and impairments taken as necessary.
As a risk management strategy, prudent account management is formulised over asset growth.
Within our Capital Markets division we have experienced increased defaults in our Acquisition Finance, Resource Finance and small ticket leasing businesses.
Acquisition Finance: counterparties in the automotive, construction and leisure sectors in particular have experienced severe cash ow pressures.
Our exposures are all senior secured facilities.
We expect further dif culties to be experienced in this book as consumer facing counterparties cash ows weaken.
Annual report 2009 97 Risk and governance Risk management Resource Finance: juniorto mid-cap mining operators have suffered from the collapse in commodity prices and the drying up of equity finance.
We are in active negotiations regarding the re nancing of several of our larger facilities.
We expect to receive repayment on a signi cant proportion of our book over the next few months.
Activity in the Private Banking business diminished signi cantly in the second half of the financial year.
The business unit members as well as members of the Group Risk division have proactively assessed the entire loan book to ascertain where the bank may be exposed to increased risk.
Where customers have experienced financial dif culty we have worked with them to arrive at an optimal solution including change of use for certain property related transactions and extensions of time for properties that are servicing their debt obligations.
Where private clients have supported a transaction by way of personal guarantees, and the original exit was through the sale of assets and such sale would severely diminish the pro tability of a project, we may agree an extension of term to achieve an orderly exit.
The Kensington mortgage book continues to perform within expectations taking into account the economic landscape.
The Group Risk division will continue to work closely with the business units over the course of the next financial year to manage the risks in the lending portfolios.
The focus will be on active book management whilst scanning the market for opportunities that present themselves.
Southern Africa The past financial year has seen a number of trends and factors impacting on the credit quality and assessment of credit and counterparty risk: The global financial crisis had a negative impact on the domestic economic cycle, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.
Liquidity constraints and general tightening in liquidity across the industry.
Conservative lending approach from the banking sector and the effects of repricing.
A high interest rate environment with consumers reducing discretionary spending.
High in ation numbers which delayed the central bank in reducing the repurchase rate.
High levels of rand volatility against major trading currencies Euro, US Dollar and Pounds Sterling.
Market volatility with the main exchange JSE re ecting a reduction of 31.1% on a year on year basis.
Collapse in commodity prices and continued volatility.
Low or negative growth in the residential and commercial property markets.
The South African property market has been under pressure for the year in review.
We are conscious of the effect of the slowdown of growth in the property market both global and local and the slowing economic cycle that have put pressure on our property portfolios.
The high net worth and or stable income streams of our target market clients provides a level of protection from decreases in property values.
Over the past few years as property values increased, many clients built an effective equity buffer, resulting in lower average loan to value ratios which have reduced potential losses on depreciation of values.
As at 31 March 2009 the average loan to value ratio within the property development portfolio stood at 52% based on net sell out values.
An increase in client ow, together with greater hedging activity due to higher levels of volatility, has resulted in increased pro tability and exposure in the Treasury Foreign Exchange business.
For both interest rate and foreign exchange rate products simulation methodologies are employed which enable us to identify more accurately the level of potential exposures to counterparties for these trading activities.
The methodologies recognise volume of trading, volatility of products traded, deal tenor and credit mitigants in deriving granular counterparty exposure pro les and, in so doing, allow for roll-off risk assessments.
Loans and advances secured by share portfolios including BEE transactions are monitored frequently due to market volatility.
Most of these counterparties remain within credit approved loan to value or cover ratios and are performing on current debt obligations.
For assets written during the current year there has been strict adherence to lower loan to value lending and increased pricing requirements.
Credit quality on gross core loans and advances deteriorated throughout the year under review notably from September 2008, with the majority of impairments raised in the Private Bank division, distributed between the residential and commercial property portfolios which are made up of a relatively small number of clients.
Investec Capital Markets reported 3 material defaults in Specialised Finance and Resource Finance respectively, which were impaired accordingly.
Investec Bank Mauritius reported 1 material default as at year end.
Core loans and advances portfolio increased by 16.3% to R120.4 billion.
The quality of the overall loans and advances portfolio in Southern Africa deteriorated as a result of the global financial crisis with default loans net of impairments as a percentage of core loans and advances increasing from 0.7% to 2.2%.
The credit loss ratio has increased from 0.5% to 0.7% Due to the deteriorating asset quality a lot of emphasis has been placed on the strengthening of recoveries and administrative areas and increased involvement from executive and senior management to deal with potential problematic loans and working on the best outcome solution for our clients and ourselves.
98 Annual report 2009 Risk and governance Risk management Australia During the year core loans and advances to customers increased by 13.2% to AUD2.9 billion, predominantly through selective growth within the professional finance business unit: which provides finance to targeted members of the medical and accounting professions.
There has been deterioration in credit quality throughout the year under review.
Defaults net of impairments have risen to 9.6% of core loans and advances and the credit loss ratio has increased from 0.7% to 1.7%.
A continued focus on asset quality remains fundamental to our approach to the challenging credit environment.

3 Whilst the group manages all risks including credit risk from a day to day operational perspective, these assets are within special purpose vehicles that ring fence the assets to speci c credit providers and limits security to the assets in the vehicle.
The table above re ects the net credit exposure in the vehicles that the group has re ected in the total credit and counterparty exposure with the maximum credit exposure referenced to credit providers external to the group in the column headed assets that we do not hold legal credit risk or have no credit risk.
4 Largely relates to net investments in Kensington securitised vehicles to which Investec has no direct exposure as discussed on pages 52 and 53.
Also includes liquidity facilities provided to third party corporate securitisation vehicles in South Africa.
These facilities have remained undrawn and are re ected as a contingent liability, i. e. off-balance sheet exposure of the bank.
We believe that these adjustments are necessary in order to derive a value that re ects actual core lending activities.
In this regard the following methodology has been applied: Loans and advances which have been originated by us and securitised primarily to provide an alternative source of funding are added to loans and advances.
Warehouse funding facilities and warehouse assets arising out of our securitisation and principal finance activities have been deducted.
The risks associated with our securitisation and principal finance activities are discussed in detail on page 89.
