14 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Ukraine During 2009, our development programme in Ukraine was supplemented by an increasing number During 2009, of stimulations and recompletions.
Poltava Petroleum Company PPC, a wholly owned our development subsidiary of JKX, holds four production licences covering 127sq.
km in the Poltava region of Ukraine.
Each production licence contains one or more programme in distinct fields which together form the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex.
Ukraine was PPC has three exploration permits in the area: Zaplavskoye, Elizavetovskoye and Chervonoyarske supplemented East, representing a total licensed exploration area of 172sq.
During 2009, the ongoing development drilling by an increasing programme was supplemented by an increasing number of recompletions and stimulations, all with number of the aim of maintaining production levels at, or above, previous levels in the face of declining reservoir pressure in the main producing fields of stimulations and Ignatovskoye and Molchanovskoye North.
To achieve this, PPC: recompletions.
Drilled, tested and or completed a total of eight appraisal and development wells.
Stimulated and tested two exploration wells.
Carried out 23 workover operations, including 12 recompletions, seven well repairs, three fishing operations and one well abandonment.
Performed three acid frac operations and one propped frac operation.
km extension to the 3D seismic database to cover Rudenkovskoye North and 30km of additional high resolution 2D data over the Rudenkovskoye area.
Continued to upgrade and fide-bottleneck the production facility.
Installed additional generating and compression facilities.
Ukrainian reserves As described in this Review, the ongoing work in the Poltava fields has resulted in no reserve reassessments taking place in 2009.
Although drilling, workover and seismic activity will continue in 2010, it is possible that a reassessment could be completed towards the end of the year.
However, it may be 2011 before this can be concluded in the Rudenkovskoye field areas.
