The principal risks facing the Company include Market Price Risk, Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Liquidity Risk, and Foreign Currency Risk as further detailed in Note 17 of the Notes to the Accounts.
In addition the Company is also focused on the following risks: Macroeconomic risks The performance of the Companys underlying investment portfolio is principally influenced by a combination of economic growth, the availability of appropriately priced debt finance, interest rates and the number of active trade and financial buyers.
All of these factors have an impact on the Companys ability to invest and on the Companys ability to exit from its underlying portfolio or on the levels of profitability achieved on exit.
Long term strategic risk The Company is subject to the risk that its long-term strategy and its level of performance fails to meet the expectations of its shareholders.
The Board monitors the level of discount of share price to net asset value per share and considers the most effective methodologies to keep this at a minimum, including the share buy-back policy.
The Company has, in the last year, repurchased shares within parameters set by the Board and subject to shareholder authority.

Gearing risks of Zero Dividend Preference shares ZDP shares Electra Private Equity Investments plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued ZDP shares during the year, which represents a form of gearing for the Company.
The principal gearing risk of these ZDP shares is that they rank prior to the Companys ordinary shares in respect of their final capital entitlement due in 2016 and that there may therefore be an adverse impact on the Companys performance.
Secondary risks relate to whether the cost of this gearing is too high and whether the length of gearing is appropriate.
The Board regularly monitors and reviews the impact of the ZDP shares and their final capital entitlement cost to the Company.

Investment risks The Company operates in a very competitive market.
Changes in the number of market participants, the availability of funds within the market, the pricing of assets, or in the ability of Electra Partners to access deals could have a significant effect on the Companys competitive position and on the sustainability of returns.
In order to source and execute good quality investments the Company is primarily dependent on Electra Partners having the ability to attract and retain executives with the requisite investment experience and whose compensation is in line with the Companys objectives.
21 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Reports Report of the Directors Reports Once invested, the performance of the Companys portfolio is dependent upon a range of factors.
These include but are not limited to i the quality of the initial investment decision: ii the ability of the portfolio company to execute successfully its business strategy: and iii actual outcomes against the key assumptions underlying the portfolio companys financial projections.
Any one of these factors could have an impact on the valuation of a portfolio company and upon the Companys ability to make a profitable exit from the investment within the desired timeframe.
A rigorous process is put in place by Electra Partners for managing the relationship with each investee company.
This includes regular asset reviews and, in many cases, board representation by one of Electra Partners executives.
The Board reviews both the performance of Electra Partners and its incentive arrangements on a regular basis to ensure that both are appropriate to the objectives of the Company.
Operational risk The Companys investment management, custody of assets and many administrative systems are provided or arranged for the Company by Electra Partners.
Therefore the Company is exposed to a range of operational risks at Electra Partners which might arise from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external factors affecting these.
These include operational events such as human resources risks, legal and regulatory risks, information technology systems failures, business disruption and shortcomings in internal controls.
The Companys system of internal control mainly comprises the monitoring of the services provided by Electra Partners, including the operating controls established by them to ensure they meet the Companys business objectives, as further detailed in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 31.

Electra Partners is responsible for the investment management of a number of limited partnership funds to which the Company has subscribed.
Electra Partners manages the Companys investments in accordance with guidelines determined by Directors and as specified in limited partnership and in management and investment guideline agreements.
Socially Responsible Investment Electra believes that high standards of corporate social responsibility CSR make good business sense and have the potential to protect and enhance investment returns.
Consequently, the investment process takes social, environmental and ethical issues into account when, in Electra Partners view, these have a material impact on either investment risk or return.
Electra recognises and supports the view that social, environmental and ethical best practice should be encouraged.
It favours investing in companies committed to high standards of CSR and to the principles of sustainable development.
22 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Electra Partners does not screen out companies from its investment universe purely on the grounds of poor social, environmental or ethical performance.
Instead, it adopts a positive engagement approach whereby, if it is appropriate, it discusses these issues with the management of the companies in which it invests.
The information gathered during these meetings is used both to assist Electra Partners investment decisions and also to encourage investee company management to improve procedures and attitudes.
Electra Partners strongly believes that this is the most effective way to improve the CSR policies of the businesses in which it invests and the Board endorses this view.
