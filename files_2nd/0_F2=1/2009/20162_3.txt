A liquidity crisis, which spread through the banking system during 2008, undermined confidence in the capital markets and led to a broader economic slowdown in most of the worlds major economies, as well as a significant reduction in mergers and acquisitions activity.
3i has been affected in three ways through the fall in asset values, by the lack of liquidity available from the stressed banking sector, and by the fall in underlying economic demand for goods and services.
Our priorities Our immediate priorities, having further strengthened our balance sheet, are to generate increased value from the Groups portfolio and prepare 3i to take full advantage of the opportunities that will emerge.
Longer term, our strategy continues to be to invest in high-return assets: grow our assets, including external funds: extend our international reach: use our balance sheet and resources to develop existing and new business lines: and to continue to build our strong culture of operating as one company across business lines, geographies and sectors.
