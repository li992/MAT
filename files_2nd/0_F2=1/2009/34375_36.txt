The historical cost of properties was 6,000m 2008: 7,315m.
At 31 March 2009, the book value of owner-occupied property is 30m 2008: 53m after charging 1m 2008: nil depreciation to the income statement for the year.
The property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases 2008: nil.
Properties valued at 3,665m 2008: 7,162m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to 1m 2008: 2m.
Included within the property valuation is 67m 2008: 58m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income, against which the Group holds a provision of 25m 2008: 8m.
The balance arises through the IFRS treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.
Cumulative interest capitalised against investment and development properties amounts to 51m and 51m 2008: 33m and 84m respectively.
