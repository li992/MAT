30 31 Business Review Financial Summary Results Foreign exchange movements have enhanced the Groups year-on-year results but have also masked what was otherwise a creditable performance in mitigating the impact of the 48.9m downturn in revenue.
Headline operating profit, which is the Groups measure of the underlying operating profit, fell by 45.5m from 143.5m to 98.0m suggesting minimal recovery of costs.
When the 2008 figures are restated at 2009 exchange rates, the true cost recovery picture can be seen.
At constant rates of exchange the revenue variance increases by 83.3m to 132.2m and the operating profit variance increases by 12.7m to 59.5m leading to a further reduction in expenses including hotel fixed charges, non-hotel expenses and central costs of 70.6m to 72.7m.
This is a 55.0% recovery, while at hotel level the recovery is 51.1%.
This cost recovery reflects the impact that the profit protection plan and the various restructuring exercises have had on the Groups profitability.
The table below summarises the exchange impact on revenue and expenses.
A large element of the saving in fixed charges which included rent is due to the variable element of rent agreements for the four Singapore hotels in the REIT.
Profit before tax fell by 20.3% to 81.9m 2008: 102.8m and headline profit before tax reduced by 33.1% to 84.2m 2008: 125.9m.
Basic earnings per share increased by 7.5% to 22.9p 2008: 21.3p.
