7 bu siness and financial review introduction Right: Geoff Drabble, Chief executive Far right: Ian Robson, Finance director In the past year the Group has delivered good performance against the background of a signi cant downturn in our markets.
This year we have focused on getting the business in the best possible shape to withstand the recession and also to bene t quickly when the prevailing economic situation improves.
Ashtead serves cyclical markets and, consequently, managing cycles is inherent to our business.
We aim to ensure our business model is as exible as possible to enable us to adapt to constant changes in the economic environment in which we operate.
While the current cycle is likely to involve a deeper downturn than most others, our usual management principles still apply.
A major component of our strategy to create a exible business model is the breadth of markets, geographies and industries we serve.
While the largest end market for our services is new-build, non-residential construction, we also serve a wide range of other markets such as facilities management, repair and renewal, disaster relief, event management and traf c control.
This diversi cation broadens the markets we serve beyond the new-build construction market where economic cycles tend to be particularly pronounced.
Also we often play a signi cant part in the background at many high pro le projects such as the US presidential inauguration and the construction of the London Olympic infrastructure.
Over the next few pages we demonstrate the breadth of the work that we have been involved with over the last year, as well as showing how we typically work on major projects.
