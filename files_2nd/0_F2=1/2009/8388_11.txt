Markets Market conditions were very challenging across all of the divisions markets with significantly reduced customer production across most sectors driven by reductions in consumer demand in most countries as a result of the current economic climate.
This was compounded by inventory reductions throughout the supply chain, particularly in the second half as customers adjusted their capacity in line with the reduced demand.
Developments Our focus during the year has been on reacting with agility to changes in our markets by rapidly adjusting our manufacturing capacity to align it with the reduced levels of customer demand.
These actions have helped to minimise the effect of the decline in revenue upon operating profit and cash performance.
Overheads and factory headcount have been significantly reduced as we continue the focus upon improving productivity within our plants.
Headcount has been reduced by 27% to 7,517.
In addition to controlling costs, we are also reducing our manufacturing capacity in North America by the closure of two further facilities in the US and one in Mexico, consolidating manufacturing from these plants into another existing facility in Matamoros, Mexico.
Total restructuring charges in the year were 23 million.
