Approval for the year ended 31 March 2008 is subject to no subsequent enquiry being made under the Corporation Tax Self Assessment legislation.
The Directors are of the opinion that, since that date, the Company has conducted its affairs in a manner which will satisfy the conditions for continued approval as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Taxes Act 1988.

This dividend will reduce the Companys distributable reserves by 11.6 million.
The movements on capital reserve and consolidated revenue reserve are shown in notes 22 and 23 on pages 67 and 68.
SHARE CAPITAL Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 20 on page 67 of the accounts.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, no ordinary shares were issued and a total of 356,520 ordinary shares were repurchased and cancelled in accordance with the shareholders authority granted on 17 July 2008.
The shares were repurchased at prices between 731p and 760p per ordinary share.
The existing authority for the repurchase of shares expires on 30 September 2009 and a replacement authority is to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting, as explained in the Notice and Explanatory Notes on pages 92 and 96.
NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value of one ordinary share at 31 March 2009, before deducting the proposed dividend, was 874.3p.
INVESTMENT POLICY The Companys Corporate Objective is: to deliver long-term capital growth, while preserving shareholders capital: to invest without the constraints of a formal benchmark, but to deliver for shareholders increases in capital value in excess of the relevant indices over time.
The Companys Investment Policy is: to invest in a widely diversified, international portfolio across a range of asset classes, both quoted and unquoted: to allocate part of the portfolio to exceptional managers in order to ensure access to the best external talent available.
The Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority require closed-ended investment funds to publish information about the policies that the fund will follow relating to asset allocation, risk diversification and gearing, including maximum exposures.
214413 RIT R&A pp21-pp40 6 3 09 2:25 PM Page 22 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 DIRECTORS REPORT 22 Asset allocation The Board currently intends to continue to allocate the Groups assets predominantly amongst quoted equities, hedge funds, long equity funds, unquoted investments, unquoted funds, government securities and money market funds, and properties.
There are no restrictions in the relative allocation of assets amongst these classes and the maximum exposure of any single asset class is therefore 100%, subject to the investment trust restrictions incumbent upon the Company, which require that the Companys income from shares and securities must be at least 70% of its total income, thus automatically limiting the allocation of assets to areas such as property.
In addition the Group uses derivatives to hedge various risk exposures and also to increase exposure to movements in individual securities, markets and currencies where desired.
The allocation amongst these asset classes at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 is shown on page 3.
Risk diversification The Groups investment portfolio is highly diversified by asset class, geography and currency.
Overall exposures in each case are monitored and managed by executive management under the supervision of the Board.
The portfolio is further diversified through the selection of external managers with different mandates.
At 31 March 2009, 63% of the quoted portfolio was delegated to external managers, themselves under obligations to maintain appropriate risk diversification.
The names of these external managers who manage segregated investment accounts for the Group are listed on page 24.
The remainder of the quoted portfolio is managed internally by the executive management under the supervision of the Board.
The Groups investments in hedge funds, long equity funds, unquoted funds and certain of the investments in money market funds are also externally managed and provide additional diversification.
The Company also complies with the requirements of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
Gearing The Company maintains structural gearing principally through two term loans.
At 31 March 2009, the Sterling equivalent of the indebtedness under the term loans was 369.3 million, against total assets of 1,804.5 million, or 20.5%.
This percentage may fluctuate as permitted under the financial covenants of the facility agreement.
Were it not for these, the maximum indebtedness that the Company is empowered to incur under its Articles of Association is five times its adjusted capital and reserves, as defined.
Cross holdings The UKLA Listing Rules also require closed-ended investment companies to disclose quarterly all of their investments in other closed-ended investment funds which themselves do not have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds.
RIT Capital Partners plc complies by its disclosures, but has made no statement restricting its own investment policies in this manner.
BUSINESS REVIEW The Company invests with the object of achieving long-term capital growth.
The investment portfolio was valued at 1,621.7 million at 31 March 2009.
An analysis of these investments is contained in the Investment Review on pages 8 to 18 and note 11 on pages 59 to 61.
The Group holds both listed and unlisted investments, mainly in the USA, the UK, Europe and the Far East.
The Chairmans Statement on pages 4 to 7 of this annual report and the Investment Review contain a review of the Groups business in the year to 31 March 2009.
Financial Highlights and Performance Information is set out on page 2, and the portfolio and currency exposure is analysed on page 3.
The principal risks are as set out in note 26 on pages 70 to 84.
The Directors consider that the Key Performance indicators most relevant to the Group are the three indices as set out under Performance on page 2, compared with the movement in the Groups net asset value per share, also as set out on that page.
At the present time, the portfolio meets the requirements to enable the shares of the Company to be included as an investment within an Individual Savings Account ISA.

The investment managers charge fees based on a percentage of the funds under management in the range from 0.5% to 1.5% per annum and, in certain cases, performance fees are charged where the increase in the value of the funds exceeds specified hurdles.
None of the other amounts listed in the table above is invested in other funds managed by the investment managers themselves and therefore there is no double-counting of investment management fees.
The investment management agreements can be terminated with notice periods of between one and three months.
Apart from the right to receive accrued fees, the investment management agreements do not provide for any other payment on termination.

The terms of the contracts between the Company and those managers are also reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate.
