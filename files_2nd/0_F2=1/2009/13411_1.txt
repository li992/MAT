Introduction to Rexam Rexam is a leading global consumer packaging company.
We make beverage cans as well as a broad range of plastic packaging products and solutions.
Our manufacturing skills, level of service and understanding of customer and consumer needs make us a sought after business partner for many of the worlds most famous and successful consumer brands.
Our packaging is often key to maintaining and reinforcing our customers reputation and values.
It plays a major role in their strategies, helping to shape their consumers brand experiences.
Consumer packaging is an integral part of modern living.
It helps brand owners to promote their goods and to inform their consumers.
The lifestyle many of us take for granted is predicated, in part, on the availability of a sustainable packaging supply chain.
We are continually seeking innovative ways to design more effective packaging and manufacture it more efficiently.
Packaging is a significant part of the supply chain and there are compelling commercial reasons to use less materials, energy and water but there are equally good environmental ones too.
We focus on reducing costs and environmental impact throughout the supply chain and the lifecycle of the packaging and we actively support measures to increase the amount of used packaging that is recovered and recycled.
