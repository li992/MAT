Financial position and shareholder returns Our careful control over cash has enabled us to reduce our overall net debt position by $0.2 billion to $1.1 billion, an excellent achievement considering the challenging trading environment during the year.
In December 2009, we issued a seven-year 250 million bond which was swapped into US dollars and used to reduce the term loan which matures in November 2010 from $500 million to $85 million.
Last year we refinanced our $1.6 billion syndicated loan facility which matures in May 2013.
In order to preserve cash and maintain the strength of our balance sheet, the remaining 30 million of the share buyback programme was deferred in 2008: consequently, no returns above normal dividends were made to shareholders in 2009.
Total funds returned since March 2004 amount to more than 3.5 billion.
Outlook 2009 was a challenging year for the whole hotel market.
We have taken decisive actions to minimise the impact on our business, having achieved a $50 million sustainable reduction in regional and central costs, representing a saving of over 15 per cent, whilst opening a record 439 hotels and driving forward with the Holiday Inn relaunch.
On behalf of the Board, I should like to thank everyone in IHG for their unstinting efforts in a difficult year and their commitment to the future success of our business.
The trading environment will continue to be tough in 2010 but I remain confident that our global scale, fee-based business model, powerful system and proven management team position us well to benefit from the upturn when it comes.
