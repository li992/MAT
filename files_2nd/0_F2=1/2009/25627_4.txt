Introduction Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2009 3 Key performance indicators Revenue per employee showed a positive trend across the Group.
The trend was particularly strong in our Risk & Insurance group, comprising Retail and London Market, due to market leading organic growth and the benefit of currency movements.
The Employee Benefits group had a challenging year in difficult trading conditions but maintained its underlying revenue and benefitted from the revenue contribution of HSBC Actuaries & Consultants Ltd, which was acquired at the beginning of December.
The trading margin of the Group increased 1.6 percentage points to 15.8% building on the 1.1 percentage point increase delivered in 2008.
The key driver for this was the 2.2 percentage points increase in the trading margin of our London Market operations within the Risk & Insurance group.
Our Retail operations and Employee Benefits business saw a small reduction in their trading margins due to a combination of competitive trading conditions and investments for future growth.
Most areas of the business delivered a reduction in staff costs as a proportion of turnover.
This was driven by strong organic growth, currency benefits and the initial benefits of the Business Transformation Programme.
This ratio compares favourably with our two largest competitors.
