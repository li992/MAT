The initial three development wells have been drilled and completed, and now require fraccing prior to production.
The unmanned platform and topsides were installed in September 2009, and the tie-back to the West Sole platform was completed early in 2010.
Dependent on WESTERN ISLES reservoir performance, a further two wells may be drilled in 2011.
BARBARAPHYLLIS BABBAGE Barbara-Phyllis gas fields Aligned partnership group with project sanction planned by end 2010 and first gas late 2012 Dana participated in the discovery of the Barbara field in 2002 and followed this up with an appraisal well on the Barbara extension in 2005.
Thereafter, Dana increased its equity in Barbara and has worked with the Phyllis owners, Shell and ExxonMobil, to progress a combined development of the two fields.
The proposed development is for 3-4 sub-sea wells tied back using a pipe-in-pipe system to neighbouring infrastructure.
The partnership group has now agreed pre-development equities and selected the host platform.
Initial production rates will be 75-100 mmscfd with total reserves of approximately 230 bcf.
10 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2009 Western Isles oil fields Sanction decision planned by end 2010 with first production late 2012 The Dana operated Western Isles development lies in 155 m water depth, 500 km NNE of Aberdeen.
The development comprises four discrete oil accumulations, namely Lewis, Harris, Uist and Barra, which were discovered during exploration drilling from 2005-2009.
The decision was made in January 2010 to develop the field using a floating production system, with up to Lewis 12 production and water injection wells initially.
Early production rates are expected to be approximately 40,000 bbl day.
Base case reserves are approximately Harris 65 mmboe but significant further potential is also recognised in the area.
