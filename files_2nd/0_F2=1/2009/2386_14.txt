For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax.
In addition, a reconciliation is required between the total of the operating segments measures of profit or loss and the group profit or loss before taxation.
b Replacement cost profit reflects the replacement cost of supplies.
The replacement cost profit for the period is arrived at by excluding from profit inventory holding gains and losses and their associated tax effect.
Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized GAAP measure.
