sales growth slowed in europe during the second half, which reflected deteriorating economic conditions in a number of markets.
in contrast, sales growth in asia accelerated, driven by the acquisition of the 36 Homever stores in south Korea at the start of the second half.
these contributed some 350m to sales, including the strong uplifts achieved on the initial conversions to our Homeplus format, and this represented 2.6 percentage points of the years total international growth at actual rates.

Us sales and initial trading losses were previously reported within the UK segment.
Us sales were 208m in the year, including like-for-like growth of 30%, and trading losses were 142m last year Us trading losses were 62m.
at constant exchange rates, trading losses were 123m, higher than our guidance provided last year, reflecting the more challenging trading environment in the Western states and our decision not to open stores in northern california for the time being.
sales overall were lower than anticipated at the time of last years preliminary Results, as a consequence of our previously announced decision to maintain, rather than accelerate, our rate of new store expansion during the second half given the severity of the economic downturn in some geographic markets in the Western Us.
Us trading losses reflect the fact that the Us business which has now been trading for 16 months has been built with the necessary infrastructure in place from the beginning to support hundreds of stores.
at this stage, it is therefore operating with high overhead and other costs in relation to the scale of the business, whilst also trading from immature stores.

com annualreport09 Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs 34 Group performance continued UK in competitive market conditions, our core business delivered a year of solid progress.
UK sales increased by 9.5% to 41.5bn last year 37.9bn, including like-for-like growth of 4.3%, 2.7% growth from net new stores, a contribution of 2.1% from the 53rd week and a first-time contribution from the consolidation of tpF.
excluding petrol, like-for-like sales grew by 3.0%, with increases of 2.0% and 2.7% in the third and fourth quarters respectively.
adjusting for the reduction in vat rates, which came into effect in early December, like-for-like growth excluding petrol was 3.7% in the fourth quarter.
the pattern of our trading during the year was affected by a number of factors.
inflation reduced during the second half and our rate of growth was also impacted by a sharp increase during the year in the level of downtrading by customers seeking to spend less on their weekly shop.
tesco supported both of these trends by cutting prices and introducing more affordable products including our successful new Discount Brand ranges.
a combination of recovering competitors and more subdued customer demand in some non-food product categories continued to hold back sales progress in the second half, although non-food sales growth remained positive in a subdued market and broadly stable in like-for-like terms.
increased productivity and good expense control enabled us to maintain solid margins and deliver good profit growth despite these challenges, whilst also absorbing initial trading losses totalling around 22m on tesco Direct.
after these costs, UK trading profit rose 12.7% to 2,381m last year 2,112m, with trading margins at 6.2% including tpF, slightly up on last year.
on a 52-week comparable basis, UK trading profit rose 10.7%.
in December, we completed as planned the acquisition of the Royal Bank of scotland group plcs 50% shareholding in tesco personal Finance tpF and on becoming a subsidiary, its results were consolidated into our UK business for the final ten weeks of the financial year.
During this period it contributed 163m to UK sales and made a small contribution to trading profit.
tpFs results to the date of acquisition are reported as usual within Joint ventures and associates.
UK sales inc. vat 41,520m 9.5% 7.4% UK trading profit 2,381m 12.7% 10.7% trading margin 6.2% Joint ventures and associates our share of profit net of tax and interest for the year was 110m, an increase of 35m compared with last year.
tesco personal Finance delivered a good performance in a challenging financial services market and profit was reported within Joint ventures and associates for 50 weeks 50% share.
Underlying growth in the business was encouraging with the number of customer accounts rising to six million and the new management team demonstrating that there is significant growth potential for tpF within the financial services sector, particularly amongst loyal tesco customers, and as we build our portfolio of products.
although we are seeing rises in credit card arrears and bad debts, tpF is well-provisioned.
tesco mobile, our joint venture with o2, saw strong growth, with a pleasing rise in profits during the year, reflecting excellent increases in customer numbers and revenues.
Finance costs and tax net finance costs rose substantially to 362m last year 63m, reflecting principally increased average net debt levels linked to acquisitions and foreign exchange movements, higher coupon rates on commercial paper and unfavourable changes in the non-cash iFRs elements of the interest charge.
the interest charge, excluding iFRs adjustments, rose by 150m.
total group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 26.7% last year 24.0%.
this increase in tax rate is primarily due to last years one-off tax reimbursement, reflecting settlement of prior year tax items with HmRc.
We also benefited in the prior year from an adjustment of deferred tax balances as a result of the lowering of the rate of UK corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 april 2008.
We expect the effective tax rate for the current year to be around 27%.
Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 7.0% to 28.92p last year 27.02p, despite the significantly lower than normal effective tax rate in the prior year.
Using a constant tax rate, underlying diluted earnings per share rose by 11.0%, or by 9.7% on a 52-week comparable basis.
Dividend the Board has proposed a final dividend of 8.39p per share last year 7.70p.
this represents an increase of 9.0%, and takes the full year increase in dividend to 9.7%.
this rise in dividend is in line with the 52-week growth in underlying diluted earnings per share, which are inclusive of net property profits, using a constant tax rate.
going forward, we intend to continue with our policy of growing annual dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted earnings per share growth.
the final dividend will be paid on 10 July 2009 to shareholders on the Register of members at the close of business on 1 may 2009.
Cash flow and balance sheet tesco has a strong, property-backed balance sheet, with sufficient funding in place to meet our needs, including no material bond maturities during the current financial year.
We plan to fund the growth of the group predominantly from internal sources recognising the current uncertainties in financial markets and this will be achieved by reducing capital expenditure to below our operating cash flow.
group capital expenditure excluding acquisitions rose to 4.7bn last year 3.9bn, slightly higher than the forecast made at our interim Results.
this increase compared with last year was attributable principally to the purchase of a small number of trading stores from a competitor and investment in new mixed-use development schemes in the UK, combined with higher international capital expenditure, including our initial investment in freehold shopping centre developments in china.
Furthermore, international capital spending, and as a result total group expenditure, was impacted by the decline in sterling relative to most of our trading currencies.
UK capital expenditure was 2.6bn last year 2.3bn.
total international capital expenditure rose to 2.1bn last year 1.6bn comprising 0.9bn in asia, 0.9bn in europe and 0.3bn in the Us.
Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs 35 We are now reducing UK capital spend on large mixed-use development schemes and we have purchased fewer existing trading stores from competitors, allowing UK capital expenditure to revert to the levels of four years ago.
importantly this is being achieved whilst continuing to meet our objective of adding some 6 to 7% to our UK selling space annually.
in some of our markets, such as the Us, we are taking a more cautious approach to expansion during the downturn and we are also seeing substantial falls in store site and build costs.
taken together, these changes mean that we are able to plan for group capital expenditure to reduce substantially this year to around 3.5bn, whilst still delivering strong organic growth in group selling space of around 9% in the current year.
cash flow from operating activities totalled 5.0bn last year 4.1bn, including an improvement of 582m within working capital, driven in part by good control of stock.
net debt rose to 9.6bn at the year-end last year 6.2bn.
1.9bn of this increase is attributable to the impact of acquiring tpF and Homever, and a further 1.0bn to the effect of unfavourable currency movements.
We are targeting a reduction in net debt in the current year, driven by lower capital expenditure, property divestments, lower stock levels and other improvements in working capital.
Property in april 2006, we announced plans to release cash from property through a sequence of joint ventures and other sale and leaseback transactions, in the UK and internationally and return significant value to shareholders, both through enhanced dividends through the growth in underlying earnings per share, which includes property profits and share buy-backs.
We have managed the pace of this programme in light of the current financial and property market conditions, and as a result we have divested the property at attractive yields.
the transactions completed so far with pension funds, property companies and other investors have delivered aggregate proceeds of 2.2bn.
Whilst yields have increased modestly in recent months, we expect to be able to complete further transactions on attractive terms in the months ahead and we are currently in discussion with potential counterparties.
proceeds for the remainder of this year will principally be used to pay down debt.
the net book value of our fixed tangible assets is 24.7bn, most of it in our freehold store portfolio even after recent property divestments linked to our 5bn programme.
We estimate the current market value of these assets to be 30.4bn, representing a 23% premium to book value.
Pensions our award-winning defined-benefit pension scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, which helps tesco recruit and retain the best people.
the trustees manage and fund our scheme on an actuarial valuation basis and, at our triennial valuation dated 31 march 2008, the scheme had a small deficit of 275m.
Following the valuation, member and company contributions have increased and, to further improve the security of the scheme for members, the trustees will be granted contingent property assets worth 500m.
as at February 2009, under the ias 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, the scheme had a deficit on a post-tax basis of 1.1bn last year 0.6bn.
this change has been driven mainly by falls in capital markets and other asset classes, although the deficit is similar to the level reported at our interim results.
Return on capital employed in January 2004, we said that we had an aspiration to increase our post-tax return on capital employed Roce of 10.2% in the 2002 3 financial year by 200 basis points over five years on then current plans.
in april 2006, we renewed our commitment to increasing our post-tax return on capital employed Roce by a further 200 basis points, having exceeded our 2004 aspiration early.
Roce rose slightly to 13.0% in the year before the effect of the two major acquisitions tpF and Homever which were completed in the second half.
this represents a good performance and we remain on track to deliver our targeted Roce improvement in the years ahead as these investments mature.
