Los Pelambres El Tesoro Michilla Completion of the Los Pelambres plant During 2009 the El Tesoro plant began Michilla has approved an extension of its expansion is expected to increase plant processing material from the Tesoro mine plan through to 2012 with expected throughput by approximately 30%, from North-East deposit, and run-of-mine production of 40,000 tonnes in 2010. the current 130,000 tonnes per day level processing of the Esperanza oxide cap also Page 23 to a 175,000 tonnes per day level in 2010. commenced.
These additional resources As a result, the production of payable extend the mine life to 2019.
As a result copper is expected to be 407,000 of the full year impact of these additional Esperanza tonnes in 2010, compared with resources, production in 2010 is expected Esperanza is expected to complete 311,600 tonnes in 2009. to increase to 96,000 tonnes from the construction and begin commissioning 90,200 tonnes produced in 2009. by the end of 2010.
Over its first 10 years Page 17 of operation it is expected to produce on Page 20 average 191,000 tonnes of payable copper in concentrate containing 215,000 ounces of payable gold annually.

Promising exploration results have is significantly greater than the 1.5 billion In August 2009 a decision was taken to been obtained from drilling programmes tonnes of proven and probable reserves progress with a full feasibility study for a at the Caracoles, Mirador and Telgrafo currently incorporated in Los Pelambres stand-alone heap leach SX-EW operation deposits.
These could eventually provide mine plan.
This presents opportunities for at Antucoya, located approximately 45km further mineral resources to extend the longer term planning either by providing east of Michilla.
