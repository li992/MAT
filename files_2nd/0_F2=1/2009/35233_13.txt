Balance sheet gearing has correspondingly been reduced to 62.2% in December 2009 from 71.2% a year earlier and the ratio of net debt to property values fell from 39.7% in December 2008 to 36.4% at 31st December 2009.
Other factors in explaining why we have not needed to recapitalise the business during 2009 were sensible financial covenants under debt facilities and our consistent focus on maintaining income across the portfolio.
These characteristics have, over a number of years, instilled confidence in our lenders and we will continue to nurture the valued relationships that have been built up, as well as forging new ones, through the coming years.
In addition to the facilities refinanced in 2008, the group renewed a 125m bank facility in the second quarter of 2009 such that the next facility due for refinancing does not arise until December 2011.
We have already started to consider options to refinance this facility and it is clear that banks are willing to lend again though only to their chosen customers.
