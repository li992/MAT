The operating margin Case study: Surf A growth sensation For a laundry brand to be successful it must clean well and smell nice, while being sold at a good price.
And it has to be marketed effectively.
It sounds straightforward, but in such an intensely competitive market there is no margin for error.
Doing these basics brilliantly is behind the phenomenal success of Surf also called Sunlight and Rinso, one of the best known laundry brands in the world.
In the last few years, we have launched the brand successfully in new markets, and taken innovations into existing markets.
In 2009 we created a premium range, Twilight Sensations, which is already delivering results.
Understanding the local market and positioning the brand effectively has been key to Surfs 12.5% growth in 2009, underscoring our decision in 2008 to sell our North American laundry business to focus on stronger investment opportunities elsewhere.
