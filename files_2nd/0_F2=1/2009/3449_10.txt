Section 3: Governance DIRECTORS REPORT PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY AND BUSINESS REVIEW The principal activity during the year under review was the supply of secure power solutions, including the manufacture and sale of uninterruptible power supply systems and power conditioners, and after-sale technical support.
The business review on pages 7 to 29, which comprises the Chief Executives review, the financial review, the risk management report and the corporate social responsibility report, forms part of the directors report.
The business review comments on the Groups performance and development during the financial year, its position at the end of the year, the key performance indicators, and the principal risks and uncertainties relating to the Group.
ACQUISITIONS Details are set out in note 28 to the financial statements on pages 82 to 85.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS The results for the year and the financial position at 31 March 2009 are shown in the consolidated income statement on page 51 and the consolidated balance sheet on page 52.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 2.85p per share which, together with the interim dividend of 1.85p per share paid on 3 December 2008 makes a total dividend for the year of 4.70p per share 2008: 4.00p.
Payment of the final dividend, if approved at the Annual General Meeting AGM, will be made on 3 August 2009 to shareholders on the record at the close of business on 10 July 2009.
GOING CONCERN The results and financial position of the Group, its cash ows, borrowing facilities and liquidity are set out in pages 18 to 23 of the financial review and in note 20 on page 73.
The outlook for trading performance of the Group is discussed in both the Chairmans statement and the Chief Executives report.
Current economic conditions create uncertainty and make forecasting difficult.
The principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the Groups results and cash ows and financial position are discussed in the key risk section of the financial review.
The Groups committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2009 amount to 110.0 million of which 52.0 million was drawn indicating an overall borrowing headroom of 58.0 million in addition to cash and cash equivalents of 38.1 million.
In addition the Group has uncommitted facilities of 13.0 million.
Included in the committed facilities amount are two credit facilities amounting to 25.0 million each that expire in June 2009 and November 2009 respectively.
The Group has been successful in renewing the first of these facilities and increasing the same to 30.0 million and is well advanced in discussions with the renewal or replacement of the other facility and expects to complete this exercise in the next quarter.
The directors have considered the Groups internal forecasts and projections that take into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance.
The levels of committed facilities have been compared to forecast borrowing requirements.
The directors have also analysed the effect of forecast performance on covenant compliance.
Chloride has significant headroom in terms of both available facilities and in terms of its operation within existing covenants.
Based on the above, and after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate facilities to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
