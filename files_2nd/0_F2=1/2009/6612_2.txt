04 Our strategy We are focused on delivering three strategic priorities to transform GSK into a company that delivers more growth, has less risk and an improved long-term financial performance.
To be a successful and sustainable business we must also fulfil our social responsibilities.
We are doing this by making our company more responsive, more flexible and more open.
Strategic priorities Grow a diversified global business We are diversifying our business to create a more balanced product portfolio and move away from a reliance on traditional white pill western markets.
We are investing in key growth areas such as Emerging Markets, Japan, Vaccines and our Consumer Healthcare business.
Deliver more products of value We aim to sustain an industry-leading pipeline of products, ensuring that they demonstrate value for healthcare providers.
Our R&D strategy is built around focussing on the best science, diversifying through externalisation of research, and improving the returns on investment.
Simplify the operating model GSK is a large and complex organisation.
We are transforming our operational model to reduce complexities, improve efficiency and reduce costs.
For updates on our progress against these priorities and further measures to operate with responsibility and integrity, please visit our website at www.
