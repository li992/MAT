The council has recently embarked upon a highly ambitious business transformation programme that is set to revolutionise the way services are delivered to the people of Birmingham.
It is expected to save the city a total of 1billion over ten years through more cost-effective ways of working.
Driving this transformation project is a rich understanding of Birminghams customers, supported by Experian.
The citys population has been segmented into 12 distinct customer groups, each with its own shared characteristics and public service needs.
This unique segmentation system will enable the council to target resources with much greater precision, ensuring that individual communities increasingly receive the type of service they require.
It is also helping join up services to meet the diverse demands and preferences of Birminghams population.
Paul Tilsley, Deputy Leader of Birmingham City Council: Our business transformation project has to be driven by a deep insight into Birmingham peoples needs and preferences - we are delighted that Experian is helping us to develop this insight.
