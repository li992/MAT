Total revenue returns per Ordinary share have been based on the average number of Ordinary shares in issue during each year see note 8 on page 46.
Net Asset Values per Ordinary and B Ordinary share have been calculated after deducting prior capital at nominal values and have been adjusted for the annual B Ordinary scrip issues.
The 1999 dividend per share does not include the special component of 0.75p to compensate for lack of tax credit on the first interim dividend.
The Net Asset Value figure for 2005 has been restated to reflect the changes in accounting policies FRS 26 - 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement': FRS 21 - 'Events after the Balance Sheet Date'.
The figures for dividends reflect the dividends for the years in which they were earned.
Please note that past performance is not a guide to future performance.
