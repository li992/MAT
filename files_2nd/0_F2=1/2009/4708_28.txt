Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information 61 Business review Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 27 August 2009: This has been a very challenging year.
Overall however our results demonstrate the resilience of our business.
Our brand range and our geographic reach enabled us to deliver 4% organic operating profi t growth and 10% eps growth.
While the economic downturn has aff ected all markets, the response of customers and consumers has not been uniform and therefore the impact on our business has been varied.
By region, International, North America and Asia Pacifi c have been stronger than Europe.
By category, we have delivered growth in categories which account for over 50% of our sales, primarily vodka, rum, tequila and beer.
The gin and wine categories have been weaker and scotch and liqueurs have been most impacted by fide-stocking.
Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Jos Cuervo and Guinness, two of our three largest local priority brands, Buchanans and Windsor, and category brands, Croc, Cacique and Harp, all grew supported by innovation and eff ective marketing.
We benefi ted from the addition of Ketel One vodka, Zacapa rum and Rosenblum Cellars wine, all of which have broadened our brand range in important categories.
Johnnie Walker faced a tougher market environment being at a relatively higher price point and saw more impact from fide-stocking.
The consumer downturn in Spain and fide-stocking in a number of markets also aff ected the performance of Baileys.
We took action quickly to manage these diffi cult times, reducing our cost base and refocusing marketing spend as consumer trends changed.
In the year ending 30 June 2010 we will benefi t from cost reductions of 120 million as a result of our global restructuring initiative.
While the global economy appears to be stabilising, there is still uncertainty as to the sustainability and pace of any recovery and the next fi financial year will be challenging, as we lap a strong fi first quarter and a reasonable fi first half performance this year.
That being recognised, we expect to deliver low single digit organic operating profi t growth in the year ending 30 June 2010.
