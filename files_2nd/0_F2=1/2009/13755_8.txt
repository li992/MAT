22 Operations review SABMiller plc Annual Report 2009 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information MGD 64 strengthens MillerCoors portfolio As a full-calorie beer in a market that increasingly prefers lighter beers, Miller Genuine Draft had been in decline in the USA since the 1990s.
Even the lighter variant, MGD Light, had failed to make much impression.
After a series of marketing campaigns failed to reverse the trend, it was clear that a different approach was needed.
Last year MGD Light was reformulated to create MGD 64.
With its crisp flavour and just 64 calories per 12-ounce serving, the new product marketed as being as light as it gets is designed to appeal to healthy-living, calorie-conscious consumers.
Supported by national TV advertising, the launch and roll-out of MGD 64 have struck a chord with the target market.
MGD 64 sales were higher in the 2008 calendar year than those of MGD Light in 2007 even though MGD 64 was not available nationally until September 2008.
MGD 64 has joined Miller Lite and Coors Light in the MillerCoors line up of premium light beers.
MGD 64 also has created a halo effect over the MGD name.
Consumers are rediscovering Miller Genuine Draft and the franchise as a whole is growing for the first time in a decade.
