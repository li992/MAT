Chief Financial Officers overview CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW In 2009 Prudential has continued to balance profitable growth, capital conservation and cash generation to both protect the Groups financial strength and preserve its long-term growth potential.
We have focused on generating significant levels of sales of highly profitable and capital efficient products.
Our results, as summarised below, show that we have achieved our dual objectives of higher profitability and lower levels of investment in new business at a time when market conditions remained challenging for the insurance industry.
This highlights our focus on value over volume as we manage investment in new business to meet our capital management targets.
In addition we have been able to strengthen our capital position and have continued to generate a positive Group operating holding company cash flow.
The global economic environment has gradually improved through 2009, led by emerging economies, especially Asia.
The Asian region appears to be more resilient than the rest of the world and we expect it is likely to return sooner to strong growth while the western world seems to be set for a prolonged period of weaker growth.
Against this backdrop, and in particular in those countries in Asia where we have leading positions, our long-term Nic Nicandrou growth potential remains intact, and we believe we are well Chief Financial Officer positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the pre and post retirement markets in our chosen geographical markets.
In 2009, in a difficult economic and market environment, Prudential produced a strong performance across all of its key performance indicators.
We believe this performance demonstrates the success of our strategy and the resilience and strength of Prudentials business model.
ved our dual objectives of higher profitability We have achie and lower levels of investment in new business at a time when market conditions remained challenging for the insurance industry.
Group retail APE new business sales were 2,890 million, 11 per cent higher than for 2008.
In Asia, sales were 1,261 million, up four per cent, boosted by a record fourth quarter.
In the US, Jackson continued to be a beneficiary of the significant changes in the competitive landscape, with a 53 per cent increase in retail sales at 912 million.
In the UK, the Groups disciplined approach to capital consumption led to retail sales of 717 million, down 11 per cent.
Wholesale sales were held to a minimum as the Group continued to focus on products with higher IRRs and shorter payback periods.
Net investment flows increased by 11.2 billion to 15.4 billion, driven by strong performances in M&Gs retail and institutional business, and the Asian asset management operations.
With these contributions and recovering investment markets, external funds under management have increased by 27.5 billion to 89.8 billion during the year.
