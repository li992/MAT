Overview Business r Business review eview Governance Financial statements How we performed in 2009 Throughout 2009 ARM demonstrated the resilience of its business model by outperforming the semiconductor industry.
Despite industry revenues being down 20% in the relevant period, ARMs dollar revenues declined 10% as we continued to gain market share, and made progress on our strategy.
Outperformance looks set to continue as we further build the base of licences that will drive long-term royalty growth.
Industry context in 2009 KPI: Building the base of licences 2009 was a difficult year for the semiconductor industry.
At the beginning of the year, analysts were forecasting Every licence represents the opportunity for a future a 30% decline in full-year semiconductor revenues.
In most years ARM adds between forecast presented a challenge for the semiconductor 60-70 processor licences to its existing base of licences.
manufacturers: although they wanted to continue In 2009, we signed 87 processor licences, the highest their R&D programmes, building the chips that would number signed in a year.
This takes the licensing base drive revenue in 2011 and beyond, reduced revenues to more than 660 licences.

These programmes continued, but with Multiple 4 limited budgets, and ARM signed more licences with constrained licence terms.
These licences have a lower up-front cost, but higher future royalties.
5 How we performed in 2009 continued KPI: KPI: Growing the number of ARM-based chips Increasing value per mobile phone In 2009, ARMs customers reported 3.9 billion chips During 2009, although the overall number of mobile shipped, only a small decline on 2008, despite a phones sold declined, the number of smartphones sold 20% decline in the semiconductor industry over the increased by 15%.
Smartphones have more chips per phone than basic This demonstrates ARMs ability to gain market share even phones and this has helped to increase the average during a downturn in the industry.
In 2008 ARM had a number of ARM-based chips per phone to 2.1 from 23% market share and in 2009 this rose to 26%.

ARM-based chips started shipping in the early 1990s and by the end of 2009, ARMs Partners had shipped a total of Smartphone chips also have a higher price than basic more than 18 billion chips.

7 How we performed in 2009 continued KPI: Growing normalised operating margin, EPS, cash generation and dividends ARMs unique business model and exposure to structural growth markets means that ARM is well positioned to become increasingly profitable, to generate cash and to support a progressive dividend.
ARM intends to cover most of its operational costs from the licence revenues of each new technology.
This leaves the majority of royalties as profits.
Over the medium term, we expect royalties to As our customers are the worlds largest semiconductor grow faster than licence revenues and costs.

The reduction in cash generation is operating margins over 30%.

This increase is based on the boards confidence in ARMs long-term growth prospects.
Net cash generation is defined as movement on cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities, adding back share buybacks, dividend payments, investment and acquisition consideration, restructuring payments, other acquistion-related payments and share-based payroll taxes, and deducting inflows from share option exercises and proceeds from investment disposals.
