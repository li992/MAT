Marketplace key challenges and opportunities in the industry Although most of the larger developed countries have now moved to ePassports, in IDS core markets customers are continuing to transition gradually, as expected.
IDS has aimed to place itself strongly in the machine readable passport market in order to benefit from this transition.
The changing technology increases the scope of countries requirements, adding a need for more sophisticated services for data capture, handling and assurance.
In the identity card market, IDS has pursued a similar strategy, culminating in the sale of its first chipped identity card products this year.
IDS has opportunities to grow as its target customers pursue this migration to electronic identity cards and ePassports.
The growing technology challenges faced by governments also present IDS with an opportunity to deepen its services to existing customers.
The business anticipates continued steady growth.
The business will also seek to improve profitability over the next two years through continued procurement focus and improvements in production efficiency.
