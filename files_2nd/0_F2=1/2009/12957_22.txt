At the base of the resource triangle, new interpretations drawn from the mine complex was principally from the Gara, integration of existing local and regional data with the 2008 airborne electromagnetic Yalea and Loulo 3 pits.
programme resulted in a prospectivity map for the Loulo district which has generated a host of new targets for follow-up work.
Following the completion of a viable scoping study on the Gounkoto orebody in the south of the mining permit, the Loulo mining permit has been divided into a northern area, which includes the Loulo mine infrastructure as well as the Gara and Yalea orebodies, and the southern area where the Faraba and recently discovered orebodies are located.
Consequently exploration work within the southern area is reported on under the Gounkoto development project.
In the north of the permit the team focused on generating high grade ounces for the plant and successfully delivered the Loulo 2 deposit and the Loulo 3 complex, which resulted in over 60 000 additional ounces being fed to the plant during 2009.
The team has added more than 170 000 ounces to the Loulo 3 resource since work restarted there and continues to locate new potential around the pits, most recently under the old exploration camp.
In addition, a broader programme has been carried out along the full length of the LOULO: YALEA, GARA, LOULO 3 Yalea structure where wide spaced RC fences have outlined numerous anomalous intersections which now form part of the exploration portfolio.
This work also AND SATELLITES covered the Loulo 1 and Loulo 3 P125 Gap targets.
OPEN PIT MINING Mining operations at Loulo are carried out under contract by BCM Mali SA, a subsidiary of BCM International Ltd, and by MARS Mali, a subsidiary of DTP, the mining division of the French Bouygues Group.
BCM operates a fleet to mine the Yalea and Gara pits.
In the middle of 2009 the decision was taken to contract PQ10 Loulo 3 mining to MARS, as well as the development of the Gara boxcut for the Loulo 1 new underground mine.
Gara Gara W Loulo 2 Mining during the year was principally from the Gara, Yalea and Loulo 3 pits.
The average production volume for the mining fleet during 2009 was 919kbcm per Loulo 3 month, compared to 886kbcm per month in the previous year.
P129 P125 MINE PLANNING During the year, the mine made significant changes in the budgeted plan due to a Yalea Ridge number of challenges: A wall failure that occurred in the south of Yalea pit prevented Yalea access to the high grade ore in this area containing approximately 50 000 ounces: the slower build up of ore tonnes from the Yalea underground mine: and the poor availability and lower contracted volumes from the open pit miner during the first 2km half of the year.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the mine did exceptionally well Northern area of Loulo permit to come within 2% of its budgeted production, through the incorporation of additional which includes the mine in pit mining and satellite pits, notably Loulo 2 and Loulo 3. infrastructure and the Yalea, Gara and Loulo 3 deposits and satellite targets.
