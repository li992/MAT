The Group exceeded these new ambitious goals, in spite of the unprecedented maintaining production volume while increasing both cost efficiency and weakness affecting all markets product quality.
Despite lower production in January and February as a result of and industries particularly during adverse weather conditions, Ferrexpo produced broadly the same volume of iron the first months of the year.

to settle prices with our contract customers at approximately this implied benchmark level with prices applicable until the end of the first quarter of 2010.
This settlement brought to a close a nine-month period of higher spot market sales and the associated exposure to seaborne freight rates and enabled Ferrexpo to resume supplying close to normal volumes to its portfolio of longterm contract customers.
In 2009, 93% by volume of the Groups iron ore products were exported.
As a result of demand weakness in Europe in the first half of the year, approximately 70% of our 2009 sales by volume were made under long-term supply agreements with iron and steel producers, compared with 88% in 2008.

At the end of 2009, approximately 91% of iron ore pellets were committed under long-term framework contracts with major customers.
The Group remains focused on the development of its substantial iron ore resource.
Significant capital commitments were placed on hold by the Board in late 2008 and during 2009 we continued to advance our growth projects at a low level, spending small amounts of capital to preserve their value while maintaining prudent cash management.
Good progress was made on pre-stripping works at the new Yeristovskoye mine during the year and the Group has taken the opportunity afforded by the moratorium on significant capital expenditure to re-examine the scope and capital costs of all of its major projects.
We are of the view that the capital estimates for the Yeristovskoye project and the plan to upgrade our product quality at Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM can be reduced significantly.
Meanwhile work has continued on product quality improvement and market development.
The outlook for 2010 is clearer and more positive than it was for 2009 and the Group was able to renew the majority of One of the features of Ferrexpos drive Ferrexpos expansion plans and its banking facilities at the end of 2009 to reduce costs and increase growth projects are based on best during a difficult period for the debt capital operating efficiencies is the international design and world class markets.
