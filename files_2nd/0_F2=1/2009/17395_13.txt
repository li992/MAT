The remainder of the contracts are performing in line with expectations and the business also benefited from a non-recurring gain of 1.7m.
Performance in the managing agent business was ahead of expectations and the prior year.
This business has recently secured a new five-year contract with a major financial services client and been invited to expand the scope of services provided to two public sector clients.
The segment also realised a profit of 2.5m on the disposal of our interest in Modern Housing Solutions Prime Limited at the beginning of the year.
Outlook Our Asset Management segment is dominated by a relatively small number of long-term contracts and work in hand at 31 March 2009 represented 99% of budgeted revenue for 2009 10 2008: 99%.
