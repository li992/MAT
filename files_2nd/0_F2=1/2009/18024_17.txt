CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES PLC DIRECTORS REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009 FUTURE INVESTMENT PLANS continued space.
In addition, in line with our strategy of organic growth and recognising the increasing out performance of larger centres, the Group is exploring the feasibility of major extensions to existing centres where there is the potential for significant additional retail space.
Investment decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis and assessed against internal return requirements on a risk adjusted basis.
2010 PRIORITIES Our priorities for 2010 are to make significant progress in the following areas, the financial impact of which in terms of enhanced net rental income is not likely to be seen until 2011 and beyond: Re-letting short-term leases closer to ERV Large space negotiations where price tension is greater Commencing value-enhancing active management projects to create organic growth opportunities not dependent on acquisition Completing the initial letting of St Davids, Cardiff CASH FLOW The Group cash flow shows a net inflow of 215.8 million in 2009 from operating activities.
This is an increase of 149.0 million from 2008 largely due to a favourable movement in working capital balances.
The net outflow from investing activities reflects the net investment in property assets during 2009.
The major components of the 101.5 million expenditure on the purchase and development of property are the expenditure on the Groups major developments at Cardiff and upgrading certain facilities at the MetroCentre.
FINANCIAL POSITION The vast majority, over 90 per cent, of the Groups debt has been arranged on an assetspecific basis.
This structure permits the Group a higher degree of financial flexibility in dealing with individual property issues than a financing structure based on a single Groupwide borrowing facility.
In addition to the non-recourse debt, the Group had two corporate bonds outstanding at 31 December 2008.
The CSC 2009 bonds of 31.5 million were repaid on 31 March 2009.
The remaining outstanding bonds of 26.7 million are due for repayment in 2013.
Net external debt, which excludes the MetroCentre compound financial instrument of 129.9 million, increased from 2,616 million at 31 December 2008 to 2,623 million at 31 December 2009.
The Group had cash of 54 million at 31 December 2009.
At this date the debt to assets ratio was 60 per cent 31 December 2008: 65 per cent.

The two main covenants are Loan to Value LTV and Interest Cover IC.
The actual requirements vary and are specific to each loan.
At 31 December 2009 813 million of nonrecourse loans had no loan to value requirement.
