Regulation and legislation During the year we responded to the introduction of an interest rate cap in our smallest established market, Slovakia.

We continue to monitor the implementation of the EU Consumer Credit Directive which will pass into law in each of our Central European markets and Romania over the course of the next two years.
The new Directive focuses on fairness to customers and transparency.
There are some areas where the precise details of the law will only be clear when the Directive is enacted in each member state and, in due course, we may need to make some adjustments, but overall we welcome the changes it will bring.
