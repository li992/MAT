Divisional review Global Banking & Markets Global Banking & Markets is a leading banking partner to major corporations and financial institutions around the world, providing an extensive range of debt and equity financing, risk management and investment services to its customers.
In 2008 the division was organised along four principal business lines: rates, currencies, and commodities, including RBS Sempra Commodities LLP, the  joint venture between RBS and Sempra Energy which was formed on 1 April 2008: equities: credit markets: and asset and portfolio management.
The poor results recorded by GBM in 2008 should not be allowed to disguise the fact that many businesses produced good performances, most notably rates and currencies, and that the activities which directly support our relationships with customers provide the platform for a return to sustainable profitability.
Total income before credit market write-downs and unusual items was 10,214 million, down 6% from 2007.
In addition to losses on previously identified credit market exposures of 7,781 million, GBM incurred 5,776 million in trading asset write-downs.
Although direct expenses were cut by 18% as we addressed the challenges facing the business, credit impairments rose sharply.
The operating loss for the year was 10,994 million.
On an indicative basis, the return on equity ROE of GBM was -35%.
These losses occurred in relatively narrow parts of the business, focused on proprietary trading, structured credit and counterparty exposure.
More than 50% of losses pertained to Divisionalreview ABN AMRO-originated portfolios.
Despite the disappointing headlines and the difficulties encountered by individual business lines, market volatility provided opportunities.
