Exchange adjustments 5.9 1.0 Cookson has entered into various precious metal consignment arrangements with precious metals consigning entities the Consignors.
The metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from a Consignor and sold Business acquisitions 4.8 concurrently to the customer, or may be consigned and sold directly from a Consignor to the Groups customers, with the Group Charge for the year 8.9 4.1 charging customers only for the fabrication process.
As the Consignors retain title and associated risks and benefits of ownership Receivables written-off during the year as uncollectable 1.6 0.4 under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recorded on the Group Balance Sheet.
Consequently, Unused amounts reversed 2.1 2.5 the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet.
The utilisation of As at 31 December 34.0 18.1 consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious metals industry.
Cookson provides a guarantee in respect of each consignment arrangement.
Whilst the terms of each consignment arrangement differ in their specific terms, they share similar characteristics.
Metals are held on consignment by the relevant member of Cookson Consignee and the Consignor retains title to the metal and has a right of physical return of the metal without penalty unless the Consignee purchases such metal at a market price for such metals plus a premium.
The Consignee pays a consignment fee on the value of the metals consigned to it which have not been returned or purchased.
Consignment fees are charged by the Consignor and were 6.6m for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 3.8m.
Consigned metals may be co-mingled with other metals.
Consignors are party to either committed or uncommitted arrangements.
Under uncommitted arrangements the Consignor is under no obligation to supply metal to the Groups fabrication operations and has the right, with limited or, in some cases, no notice to demand physical return of its consigned metal.
Under committed arrangements the Consignors provide a rolling 12 month commitment to supply metal to the Groups fabrication operations.
