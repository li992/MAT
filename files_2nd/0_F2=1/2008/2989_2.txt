We have three major competitive advantages in our UK Fixed Line business: our distribution, our telecoms network and our scale.
We are the only major residential telecoms player in the UK with a network of stores, which provide a consistent and low cost channel for customer recruitment.
Increasingly they are also playing a role in explaining the complexities of wireless technology to customers.
Our telecoms network is the only large scale all-IP network in the UK, meaning that voice and data traffic is carried over a single infrastructure, making us highly cost efficient and allowing the development of new value-added services over time.
Scale is essential to generate an attractive return from the high fixed costs of a telecoms network: it creates barriers to entry for new players and means that the profitability of each marginal customer is very high.
