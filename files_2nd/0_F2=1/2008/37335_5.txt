Loss pro t before tax The main drivers of our loss before tax are the change in value of our investment portfolio including any pro ts or losses on disposal of properties, our net rental income, the performance of our Trillium business, and the amount of interest we paid.
The degree to which movement on these and other items led to the reduction in our pro t before tax from 1,979.1m last year to a loss of 888.8m this year, is explained in Table 6 below: Martin Greenslade Table 6 Principal changes in pro t before tax and revenue pro t Pro t loss Revenue W e are recommending a final before tax pro t m m dividend payment of 16.0p Year ended 31 March 2007 1,979.1 392.2 Valuation fide cit 2,687.2 per share.

The debt instruments issued as part of the re nancing in November 2004 do not meet the requirements of IAS 39 as they are not deemed to be substantially different from the debt they replaced.
As a result, the book value of the new instruments is reduced to the book value of the debt it replaced and the difference is amortised over the life of the new instruments.
The decrease in amortisation over the comparable period is a re ection of the maturity pro le of debt replaced.

from 392.2m to 379.1m Revenue pro t for the year decreased by 3.3% from 392.2m to 379.1m.
An increase in revenue pro t from London and Retail on the back of higher net rental income was offset by a decline in Trillium for the Adjusted diluted earnings per share accounting reasons described below.
Net rental income from our investment portfolio increased by 8.2m, showed a 16.4% increase on last despite almost 800m of net investment property sales.
This growth in rental income was driven by 17.4m of like-for-like rental income increases and 31.7m of higher income from our completed developments, which year to 81.71p 2007: 70.20p included Princesshay in Exeter and, in London, Cardinal Place, SW1 and Bankside 2&3, SE1.
While net property sales reduced rental income by 36.6m, this was more than offset by the associated interest savings.
While Trilliums operating pro t is higher than last year see Table 42 on page 49, at the revenue pro t level there has been a decline of 26.3m, due to the accounting treatment of its PPP assets.
Through the acquisition of Secondary Market Infrastructure Fund in February 2007 and subsequent transactions, Trillium has purchased a number of PPP assets.
These assets were purchased with the intention from the outset that they would be transferred to a fund, Trillium Investment Partners, in which Trillium would subsequently reduce its ownership.
As a result, we have accounted for all PPP investments which we are intending to transfer to Trillium Investment Partners or sell to third parties, as a disposal group.
The implications of this are that we do not consolidate the Land Securities Annual Report 2008
