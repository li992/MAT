Output is the amount of electricity produced by our fleet of UCLF provides a measure of unplanned energy losses.
Realised price is a measure of the price we achieve for power stations.
Output for the year was 58.4TWh, the same In 2007 08 UCLF increased to 24% compared with 23% output sold.
In 2007 08 we achieved a realised price as last year.
Output in the year was adversely affected by in 2006 07, mainly re ecting losses attributable to the of 40.7 MWh, down from 44.2 MWh in 2006 07. the Boiler Closure Unit issue at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 Boiler Closure Unit issue in 2007 08 and boiler issues at and the boiler temperature restrictions at Hinkley Point B Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B in both years.
