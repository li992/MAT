This leverages the management infrastructure and expertise we have established in the UK and the European team built up since 2004.
Features supporting this investment include the under provision of modern out-of-town retail parks in many of the major countries in Europe and the lower rents and higher initial yields than in the UK, together with similar customer preference trends which indicate that the market will develop and grow.
This is already in evidence with increasing international investor interest contributing to the European market closing the yield gap towards convergence with the UK albeit with lower interest rates applicable in Europe.
Prospects for further rental growth in out-of-town European retail continue to be good, with rents still at some 50% of the level seen in the UK.
As a result, our assets in Europe have performed well over this financial year.
During the year British Land and PREF jointly acquired a new prime regional shopping centre and retail park, Nueva Condomina in Murcia, Spain: the property was acquired for 350m 237m with completion in July 2007.
The 120,000 sq m 1.3 million sq ft scheme includes a two-storey enclosed shopping centre, a retail park, a multiplex cinema and a hypermarket, all now 97% let to major international and Spanish retail brands.
In December 2007 PREF sold to HERALD, the Henderson European Retail Property Fund, a portfolio of five retail parks in Europe and one-half of its interest in Nueva Condomina, overall at above valuation.
The transaction anticipated the potential for market Nueva Condomina, Murcia, Spain weakness, followed our UK strategy of divesting assets with weaker growth prospects and enables PREF to focus on its core countries, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy, recycling its capital into purchasing opportunities.
In addition to these transactions, PREF purchased three smaller retail parks in Spain, France and Portugal, on favourable yields with low base rents, and sold two PC City properties in Madrid and Palma.
By providing attractive and well congured properties we generate new demand resulting in increasing rental values.
