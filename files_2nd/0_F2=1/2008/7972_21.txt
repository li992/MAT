For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 20.9 years 2007 20.9 years for current pensioners and 22.5 years 2007 22.5 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset principally equities and bonds.
The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities and expected yields on bonds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.
The asset liability recognised in the balance sheet is determined as follows: United Kingdom Overseas Total 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 628.6 738.0 43.9 28.1 672.5 766.1 Fair value of plan assets 697.7 767.5 29.6 31.8 727.3 799.3 Surplus deficit in funded obligations 69.1 29.5 14.3 3.7 54.8 33.2 Irrecoverable surplus 43.6 0.3 0.3 43.9 0.3 Net surplus deficit in funded obligations 25.5 29.5 14.6 3.4 10.9 32.9 Present value of unfunded obligations 2.7 3.0 2.2 1.4 4.9 4.4 22.8 26.5 16.8 2.0 6.0 28.5 The net pension asset liability is analysed as follows: Schemes in surplus 49.4 48.4 3.5 49.4 51.9 Schemes in deficit 26.6 21.9 16.8 1.5 43.4 23.4 22.8 26.5 16.8 2.0 6.0 28.5 The amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement are as follows: United Kingdom Overseas Total 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m m m Current service cost 4.8 5.5 2.0 1.8 6.8 7.3 Past service cost 0.1 0.1 Interest expense on plan liabilities 42.0 38.0 1.1 1.1 43.1 39.1 Expected return on plan assets 47.1 41.9 2.3 1.9 49.4 43.8 0.3 1.7 0.8 1.0 0.5 2.7 The actual loss on plan assets amounts to 67.6m 2007 actual return of 45.1m.

Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
This may be at country, regional or brand level.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following primary reporting segments as follows: 2008 2007 m m United Kingdom 264.8 265.4 Russia and Emerging Markets 214.6 99.5 Singapore 19.6 14.1 Australia 9.7 5.5 Rest of World 0.2 0.2 Europe 4.9 508.9 389.6 Goodwill additions in 2008 arise mainly from the acquisition of the minority interest in the Groups St Petersburg businesses from the Olimp Group and the acquisition of the Musa Motors group see note 27.
Goodwill disposed of during the year related to the Groups operations in France and certain UK businesses.
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth decline, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash ows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.
These growth rates reect the long-term growth prospects of the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The growth rates used vary between 1% and 6% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash ows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate assumptions are based on an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant CGU.
The discount rates used vary between 10% and 13%, and reect long-term country risk and local tax rates.
The assumptions used with regards to discount rates and long-term growth rates in those segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Discount Rate Long-term Growth Rate United Kingdom 11% 2% Russia and Emerging Markets 11% to 13% 5% to 6% Singapore 10% 1% Impairment During the year ended 31 December 2008, the goodwill in relation to the Groups businesses in Russia and Emerging Markets was impaired by 46.8m following a significant deterioration in the automotive sector in emerging markets that has adversely affected revenue and trading profit.
The Group has consequently reassessed its short and medium-term forecasts for the relevant CGUs and recognised an impairment loss of 46.8m relating to the business acquired in Latvia in 2007.
The discount rate applied to the value in use calculation for Latvia was 11% 2007 12%.
In addition, acquisition goodwill of 7.4m related to sites in the UK which are to be sold or closed, has been impaired.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and the longterm growth rate.
With the exception of those CGUs already subject to an impairment charge and the Musa Motors group, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause an impairment in any of the other CGUs.
The value in use calculations for the Musa Motors group currently exceeds the carrying value by approximately 10%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would eliminate the headroom available.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets principally comprise computer software.
The amortisation charge is largely included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Other intangible assets also include customer contracts and back orders recognised on the acquisition of a business.
These intangible assets are recognised at the fair value attributable to them on acquisition, and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life usually up to one year.

The asset represents 116m of losses at the standard blended rate of 20.4%.
The asset is unprovided as 101m relates to losses which exist within legal entities that are not forecast to generate taxable income with reasonable certainty in the foreseeable future, and 15m relates to losses in companies which have closed or are anticipated to be closed.
The deferred tax asset of 1.8m 2007 6.7m relates to trading losses in Belgium and Poland where future profits are anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 28m 2007 37m relating to capital losses.
The asset represents 135m of losses at the standard blended rate of 20.4%.
The key territory holding the losses is the UK.
During the period the Group disposed of the French sub-group.
A liability of 14.7m arose during the year on the acquisition of the Russian and Latvian operations which relates to the requirement to fully provide for deferred tax of 11.9m on property valuations which do not attract tax allowances and which have been recognised as part of a business combination, along with other temporal differences of 2.8m.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group controls and manages the repatriation of the overseas reserves so that they are repatriated at no additional tax cost or alternatively maintains the profits in the overseas territory where they are reinvested to generate future enhanced profits.
If all overseas earnings were repatriated with immediate effect, tax of 71m 2007 39m would be payable.
The increase from 2007 is largely as a result of the Sterling weakness during the year that enhanced the UK value of overseas unrepatriated reserves.
The 2008 Finance Bill has introduced proposals that will allow the repatriation of overseas earnings by way of a dividend at no additional UK tax cost.
The proposals are not as yet substantially enacted and as such may be open to amendment prior to becoming effective.
Following the 2007 Finance Act, changes to the treatment of industrial buildings allowances and the reduction on the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28%, have now been substantially enacted and an exceptional tax charge of 6.0m has been recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of the phased abolition of industrial building allowances.
The 29.9m deferred tax liability for provisions and other timing differences consists of a 45.2m liability in respect of the net book value of tangible xed assets that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations and a 15.3m deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporal differences between the accounts base and the tax base.
The key temporal differences are 3.5m for the UK, 4.1m for Greece, 7.2m for Australia and 0.5m in other territories.

Payment becomes due when title passes to the Group, which is generally the earlier of six months from delivery or the date of sale.
An amount of 48.7m 2007 21.3m has been provided against the gross cost of inventory at the year end.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year is 4,309m 2007 4,278m.
The write down of stock to net realisable value recognised as an expense during the year was 31.5m 2007 10.0m.

Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to JapaneseYen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash ow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity.
Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt.
Changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in the US Dollar to Sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity.
Changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement.
All other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
c. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2008 the Group has borrowed at oating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities, with the exception of US$75m of debt in the UK and 11.5m in Russia.
This approach reects the continuing benign interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the xing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the oating rate interest payable on the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings and supplier related finance.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact of oating rate borrowings.

Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated Financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than in that units reporting currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in JapaneseYen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with US$475m of the US$550m Private Placement.
The effective portion on the gain or loss of the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
The Group expects hedges entered into to continue to be effective and therefore does not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the consolidated income statement to be material.
Net investment hedging Consideration is given to the currency mix of debt with the primary objective that interest on such borrowings acts as a hedge on foreign currency earnings.
In accordance with IAS 39 the Group designated US$75m of the Private Placement as a hedge against dollar related assets in Hong Kong, Saipan and Guam.
Under IAS 39 the hedge is documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Foreign currency risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in theYen and US Dollar exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts and net investment hedges.
com 100 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial Instruments continued e. Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.

At 31 December 2008, total derivative asset balances included 306m which was held with six counterparties and total cash balances included 173m which was held with eight counterparties.
Total cash balances of 458m include cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which is offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Balance sheet netting of cash and overdraft balances only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Groups broad customer base.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.

Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain exibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.

The table below summarises the maturity prole of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2008 based on contractual undiscounted cash ows.
com 102 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial Instruments continued g. Hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2008.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Cross-currency interest rate swap 155.6 8.0 Forward foreign exchange contracts 151.3 4.9 8.3 306.9 12.9 8.3 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 2.8m 2007 a loss of 0.3m.
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash ow hedges amounts to a gain of 0.4m 2007 0.5m.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedges of net investments.
Cash ow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash ows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2008 was 464.7m 2007 599.9m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholdersequity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2008 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2008 the Group had in place 4 cross-currency interest rate swaps totalling US$475m which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes.
Under these swaps the Group receives xed rate US dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR 85bps and LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
The loan notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations Included in borrowings at 31 December 2008 was a borrowing of US$75m 2007 US$75m, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in Hong Kong, Saipan and Guam and is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of net investments in the subsidiaries.
h. Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
During 2008 4,460,000 shares were bought for treasury by the Company 2007 4,535,000 shares.

Acquisitions On 8 July 2008,75.1% of the issued share capital of Musa Motors was purchased for a cash consideration of US$200.0m.
This US$200.0m is an initial down payment, with a further payment due which is dependent on 2008 EBITA less acquired debt, subject to a cap of US$250m in total.
The remaining 24.9% is to be acquired in early 2011, with payment dependent on 2010 EBITA, capped at US$250m.
Estimates of these future payments, based on current earnings and forecasts, are set out below.
Musa Motors Fair value Provisional Book value adjustments fair value m m m Net assets acquired Intangible assets i 1.0 1.0 Property, plant and equipment iv 23.1 23.1 Trade and other receivables 19.4 19.4 Deferred tax assets 0.4 0.4 Inventories 55.3 55.3 Cash 4.6 4.6 Current tax asset 0.4 0.4 Trade and other payables 55.6 55.6 Current tax liability 1.5 1.5 Borrowings 21.5 21.5 Deferred tax liabilities ii 4.2 3.9 8.1 Net assets 20.4 2.9 17.5 Minority interest acquired 0.6 Goodwill iii 107.2 Purchase consideration 124.1 satisfied by: Cash paid in 2008 100.3 Deferred consideration 17.2 Directly attributable costs 6.6 Purchase consideration 124.1 Net cash in businesses acquired 4.6 119.5 Borrowings acquired 21.5 Total consideration 141.0 i The intangible assets recognised on acquisition relate to back orders and are recognised at their fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, which is less than one year.
ii Deferred tax recognised on acquisition includes the recognition of deferred tax on non-qualifying properties in a business combination.
iii The provisional goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future cash ows of the acquired business and synergies expected to arise after the Groups acquisition.
specifically, the goodwill represents the premium paid to expand the Groups presence in this growth market, achieve regional scale in the premium brand sector and deliver growth and improved returns far quicker than would have been achievable through organic expansion.
iv Prior to acquisition, the book values of the assets acquired were held at recently revalued amounts.
Therefore, no further fair value adjustments were necessary upon acquisition.
On 25 March 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 24.9% stake in its St Petersburg business from its joint venture partner, Olimp Group, for total cash consideration of 28.5m, with goodwill arising on this acquisition of 20.9m.
This eliminates the minority interest previously accounted for.
The remaining goodwill arising in the year is attributable to additional costs incurred relating to acquisitions in the previous year.
