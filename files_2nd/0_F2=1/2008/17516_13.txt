com corporate commodities nickel Xstrata plc Annual Report 2008 63 Performance: Operating Review Nickel continued Markets The nickel price experienced extreme volatility in 2008, peaking in March at $33,300 per tonne and then falling signicantly in the second half due to deteriorating physical fundamentals, compounded by the rapid unwinding and deleveraging of commodity investments.
In the second half of 2008, the nickel market was heavily impacted by the rapid deceleration of global industrial production.
Nickel cash prices fell steadily from the second quarter to a low of $8,810 per tonne in late October.
LME cash prices averaged $21,104 per tonne for the year, a decrease of 43% over 2007.
Towards the end of the year, stainless steel mills cut production signicantly in response to weakened demand that reected widespread uncertainty over the global economic outlook.
Demand from downstream metal consumers reduced and stocks were drawn down throughout the supply chain.
Chinese stainless steel capacity utilisation remains low, although some previously idled production facilities were restarted in December.
Material restocking in the stainless sector is now not expected until the second half of 2009.
As a result of lower nickel prices, austenitic ratios have stabilised, following record nickel prices in 2007 which led steelmakers to switch production away from nickel-intensive austenitic steel grades towards ferritic grades.
Demand from non-stainless steel applications for nickel is beginning to be impacted by the global economic slowdown and orders from the aerospace and land turbine sectors are slowing.
At the same time, scrap availability is relatively high.
However, the nickel industrys supply-side response has been particularly rapid and significant.
The curtailment or suspension of unprofitable operations has resulted in approximately 350,000 tonnes of rened nickel production being taken out of 2009 production, representing approximately 21% of the previously expected level of global supply in 2009.
In addition, growth projects and exploration expenditure continue to be cancelled or deferred, introducing significant constraints to future supply.
Nickel production from Chinese pig iron has now largely ceased, due to the impact of low metal prices on these high-cost producers.
While the supply-side response continues to gain momentum, production curtailments in the fourth quarter were not sufficient to fully mitigate the impact of the sharp fall in demand.
As a result, LME inventories steadily increased, nishing the year at 78,822 tonnes, a 64% increase over closing levels the previous year.
Outlook The full impact of nickel production cuts is expected to stabilise the market in 2009.
Supply from Chinese nickel pig iron and other high cost facilities is unlikely to resume given the prevailing economic climate and lack of visibility into near-term market conditions.
If the weak pricing environment persists, further announcements of supply curtailments from industry participants can be expected.
The closure of additional production facilities will tighten physical markets and prices are expected to be supported by the economic cash break-even costs of nickel producers.
In the medium to longer term, the outlook is expected to improve as global demand recovers and the physical availability of nickel tightens.

Mining ination continued to impact earnings, as cost decreases lagged materially in 2008 despite the deteriorating economic situation.
The primary contributor to mining ination during 2008 was the oil price variance of $91 million.
At Falcondo, the cost of oil soared from $64 bbl in 2007 to $105 bbl in 2008.
While sales volume excluding the one-off impact of nickel inventory sale to Glencore in 2007 increased slightly in 2008, on the back of record production in the Nikkelverk renery, the increase in the sale of the third-party feed and the decline in sale of own mined feed led to a negative volume variance, as the margin on processing own feed on average was higher than that of third-party materials.

In order to unlock the potential formed following the acquisition of Jubilee Mines NL, decreased by synergy from its formation, XNA began shipping its concentrates to 3% compared to 2007.
This decrease is mainly due to the impact in the Sudbury smelter for processing in the fourth quarter of 2008.

With capital conservation a priority for 2009, re-sequencing activities at Koniambo are under way, resulting in reduced capital expenditures in 2009 and deferral of the related spending to subsequent years.
As a result of the re-sequencing, the Koniambo implementation timeline has changed, with the first ore planned to be processed during the first half of 2012 and target ramp up expected to reach full annual production of 60,000 tonnes of nickel in ferronickel within the following two years.
The Group has undertaken these activities in consultation with its joint venture partner and local authorities.
Kabanga Nickel The Kabanga project in Tanzania is a 50:50 joint venture between Xstrata Nickel and Barrick Gold Corporation.
Indicated resources at Kabanga are estimated at 23.2 million tonnes at 2.64% nickel and an additional 28.5 million tonnes of inferred resources at 2.7% nickel, at a 1% nickel cut-off grade.
The pre-feasibility study for the project was completed at the end of 2008.
Work plans for the execution phase are currently under review to ensure the projects timing coincides with improved market conditions.
Araguaia The Araguaia project is located in the north-western Brazilian state of Para.
Mineral resources include a measured resource of 16.1 million tonnes at 1.44% nickel, an indicated resource of 88.6 million tonnes at 1.3% nickel and an inferred resource of 37.6 million tonnes at 1.3% nickel at a 0.9% nickel cut-off grade.
Drilling has now been completed.
Engineering studies of the project at the scoping study level are still ongoing and environmental baseline evaluations have commenced, although further development is being deferred given current market conditions.
Nickel Rim South The Nickel Rim South project in the Sudbury basin remains on schedule to ramp up to 60% of its ultimate 1.25 million tonne per annum production capacity in 2009, equivalent to approximately 7,400 tonnes of nickel.
The projects first phase, budgeted at C$627 million approximately US$517 million was completed in December 2008.
Phase 1 included construction of the main and vent shafts, which were completed without a lost-time injury, on time and within budget.
The remaining project capital expenditure of C$300 million approximately $270 million is for the completion of mine development and infrastructure, which commenced in 2008 and will continue through 2009 and early 2010.
Nickel Rim South is expected to provide a high-value ore feed for more than 15 years while signicantly reducing Sudburys unit costs and will play a key role in transforming the Sudbury operations.
