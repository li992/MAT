This strategy delivered 82 leasing transactions during the year, totalling 2 45,300m, including a number of scheme pre-lettings.
The combined rental income from these lettings was 16.3 million per annum, of which 9.3 million was from space that was not income producing at the start of the year.
The difference was principally at the Angel Building, as we still receive 4.2 million per annum from BT.
Our letting activity was almost double the 8.3 million in 2007.

A significant proportion of the transactions during the year were pre-lets, substantially reducing our development risk, whilst a number were short-term lettings to accommodate our future development aspirations North Wharf Road, City Road Estate and Wedge House.

The extent of the fall in growth were lettings which added 12.3 million to 2007s total, and rent reviews which likewise provided 3.9 million.

Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2008 Directors report Liability risk management Although the base rate currently stands at 0.5%, it began 2008 at 5.50% with the three month LIBOR, which is most commonly used by companies as a basis for borrowing money, higher than that.
It was a feature of 2008 that, as banks became increasingly concerned about each others financial stability, the LIBOR showed a considerably higher divergence from base rate than has historically been the case.
While the gap has narrowed in the last quarter, the volatility of interest rates in 2008 shows why this is one of the main financial risks to which the group is exposed.
Therefore, in addition to the fixed rate debt, interest rate derivatives will continue to be used to protect the group against such movements despite the fair value adjustments that appear in the group income statement.
Board policy provides flexibility in the amount of interest rate hedging that can be undertaken, as the total of fixed debt and that fixed using derivative instruments can fluctuate between 40% and 75% of the total nominal value of debt, excluding leasehold liabilities.
At present 70% of such debt is covered, and the spot weighted cost of debt is 4.5%.
As indicated above, derivatives are fair valued at each reporting date and the movement in value over the period is reported in the group income statement.
As a result of the steep decrease in interest rates in the final quarter, the charge for 2008 was 28.1 million, compared with 5.1 million for 2007.
Under IFRS, changes in fair value of the 175 million secured bond are not required to be reported in this statement.
The fair value adjustment for the bond at 31st December 2008 was a gain of 18.7 million equivalent to 18.6p per share compared with a loss of 15.0 million, equivalent to -14.9p per share, at December 2007.
Upon acquisition of LMS, the bond had to be fair valued in accordance with IFRS 3, and the resultant amount included in the opening fair value balance sheet.
This valuation is being amortised over the life of the bond and the residual amount remaining in the balance sheet at 31st December 2008 was 20.9 million 21p per share compared with 21.6 million 21p per share at the end of the prior year.
