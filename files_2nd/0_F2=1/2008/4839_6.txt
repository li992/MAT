A further explanation of these charges is explained below: 341.3 million relating to the impairment of the Italian operations.
The main constituent of the charge is the impairment of goodwill of 246.2 million which leaves 129.0 million remaining on the balance sheet.
Other charges comprise the impairment of fixed assets and inventory of 20.1 million and 10.1 million, respectively, together with provisions for onerous lease commitments of 51.9 million and other charges of 13.0 million: strategic reorganisation costs of 29.5 million relate to the UK business transformation and mainly comprises asset impairments associated with the reformat of the UK store portfolio: 27.2 million of other business impairment charges which relate to impairments of businesses and assets outside the UK and Italy: distribution network income of 6.7 million relates to the final part of the reorganisation of the UK distribution model.
The income comprises a profit of 12.3 million generated on the sale of the Groups former main UK warehouse site in Stevenage offset by further onerous lease charges on vacant distribution centre properties reflecting the difficult property market: PC City France non-underlying income of 2.1 million, reflecting a positive variance against the expected costs of closure provided for in 2006 07: 4.4 million amortisation of acquired intangibles which predominantly comprise brand names: and the financing charge of 4.5 million comprises a gain of 1.7 million on the sale of a small minority investment offset by 6.2 million relating to net fair value remeasurement losses on revaluation of financial instruments as required by IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The net charge is caused mainly by a 7.8 million revaluation of a put option held by the minority shareholder of Kotsovolos, Fourlis, who held 10% of the share capital at 3 May 2008.
This revaluation represents an increase in the expected purchase price of this stake and is driven by a strong performance by Kotsovolos.
As described above, on 24 May 2007, Fourlis exercised an option to sell 10% of Kotsovolos such that the Group now owns 89% of this business.

Other spend of 49.0 million includes an 8.1 million offset to net pension fund interest income which is non-cash in nature and 29.5 million of revaluation settlements due to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates.
This is partly offset by the net funds currency revaluation of 14.8 million as noted below.

The Board believes that the Group has sufficient funds available to deliver the Renewal and Transformation plan.
Dividends The Board has reviewed the level of dividend in light of the Groups current performance, the Renewal and Transformation plan and the outlook for the consumer environment.
As a result the directors propose to pay a final dividend of 3.43p 2006 07 6.85p making a total for the year of 5.45p 8.87p relating to the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2007.
The Board believes that the Group should have an objective of rebuilding dividend cover to 2.0 times underlying earnings.
Once this objective has been achieved the Board considers that the Group should grow dividends in line with earnings.
Consolidated Balance Sheet Consolidated net assets decreased to 853.5 million from 1,304.3 million at 28 April 2007.
The main movements comprised an increase of 142.3 million generated from underlying post tax profits which was more than offset by non-underlying post tax charges of 402.0 million as set out in the income statement on page 68.
Net assets were further decreased by actuarial losses of 24.7 million on the UK defined benefit pension scheme but increased due to movements in derivative contracts, foreign exchange movements and related tax effects of 83.6 million, all of which affected reserves directly.
The increased stake in Kotsovolos, following the exercise of a put option, further increased net assets by 15.6 million.
These movements were offset by dividend payments of 160.3 million and 100.0 million relating to the share buy-back programme.
Tax The Groups tax rate on underlying profit was 30.7% 2006 07 30.0%.
The increase in the tax rate reflects non-recognition of tax benefits arising from loss making businesses.
Cost savings In the period, the Group delivered 30 million of cost savings from a number of areas across the business including outsourcing of IS services and reorganisation of the Groups logistics infrastructure.
The introduction of a Step Change programme presented on 15 May 2008 will remove 50 million of costs per annum commencing in 2008 09.
Initial focus will be on removing duplication and creating efficient structures in the head office, the supply chain and in stock management.
Savings from this programme will largely be reinvested back into the stores to enable the Group to deliver better on the needs of its customers.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 21 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Pensions At 3 May 2008, excluding deferred tax benefits, the IAS 19 accounting deficit of the UK defined benefit pension scheme amounted to 51.0 million 28 April 2007 38.4 million.
Including deferred tax benefits the deficit amounted to 29.9 million 28 April 2007 17.0 million.
During the period, the triennial actuarial valuation of the Groups pension scheme was completed and showed the deficit as at 5 April 2007 to be 61.0 million.
Over the last three years, the Group has been implementing a programme of changes to pension arrangements in order to address the deficit over the longer term which have included the gradual increase in the Group contribution rate and the change of benefits to operate on a career average earnings basis rather than final salary for future service.
The remedy agreed by the Group to address this deficit is for the Group to make annual cash contributions to the scheme of 12 million for the next five years.
This will be paid in two equal tranches of 6 million in June and December each year.
The charge to operating profit for the scheme was 9.3 million 2006 07 11.8 million, including the one-off benefit of 4.7 million relating to the change in legislation concerning lump sum payments allowed on retirement.
Also included in the income statement is a net financing income of 8.1 million 2006 07 4.5 million which represents the expected return on assets of the scheme, based on market conditions prevailing at the start of the financial period, offset by the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the scheme.
The defined benefit section of the UK pension scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 September 2002.
Going concern After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections and borrowing facilities available, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
