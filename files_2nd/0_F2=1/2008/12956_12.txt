GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES The Tongon deposits are located within the Lower Proterozoic Senoufo Belt, which is a 200 kilometres long, volcanisedimentary belt of greenschist grade metamorphism bounded on either side by variably tectonised granitoid gneiss terranes.
Mineralisation at Tongon is defined in two zones.
In the Northern Zone, the major part of the mineralisation is located within volcaniclastic rocks which have been intruded by granodiorite and diorite intrusives and is bounded by sheared footwall TONGON DEPOSITS NORTHERN ZONE NORTHERN ZONE SOUTHERN ZONE SOUTHERN ZONE 2km 0.5 - 1.0g t 1.0 - 2.0g t 2.0 - 3.0g t 3.0 - 4.0g t 4.0g t 30 | Randgold Resources 2 200m 2 100m 1 Photograph on page 28: A group of investment analysts from USA, Canada, UK and South Africa joined Randgold Resources geologists to inspect core results at a drill site on the Tongon project.
2 Geologists Sarah Herbert and Lynette Greyling logging and sampling trenches at Tongon.
The mineralised zone varies in thickness from 3 metres to 35 metres and averages 25 metres in zones of dilation.
The mineralisation is associated with increased silicification, sulphidation and fine brecciation.
The Southern Zone is more complex, with mineralisation controlled by multiple north-east trending, north-west dipping shears that occur adjacent to a granodiorite intrusive body.
Mineralisation extends for 2 kilometres along strike and consists of a number of individual lodes.
Host rocks include a package of volcaniclastics and intermittent carbonaceous shale units.
Alteration is similar to the Northern Zone, being located adjacent to shears and within the predominantly brittle deformed ore zones.
Sulphide mineralisation includes arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and pyrite.
Resource estimation is based on the results of 275 drillholes 252 diamond drillholes and 23 RC drillholes for a total of 52 686 metres.
Fifty-eight additional trenches have been excavated for a total of 8 608 metres.
Average drillhole spacing is 50 x 50 metres and in parts of the Southern Zone is reduced to 25 x 25 metres.
A mineral resource for the Northern Zone of 15.74 Mt at a grade of 2.58g t for a total of 1.31 Mozs has been estimated.
This includes ore within an US$850 pit shell and ore which is potentially mineable by underground methods.
For the Southern Zone, a total open pit mineral resource of 32.74 Mt at a grade of 2.97g t is estimated for 3.13 Mozs.

Pit designs have been completed using 10 metre benches for waste rock and 5 metre benches for ore.
Ramps are 25 metre wide for double lane and 12 metre wide for single lane.
Dilution of 15% at zero grade and an ore loss of 2% has been modelled for the Southern Zone, and for the Northern Zone, dilution has been set at 10% with ore loss at 3%.
Based on the pit optimisation, design and schedule, an ore reserve amounting to 38.25 Mt at a grade of 2.57g t for gold content of 3.16 Mozs has been estimated.

Preference has been given to mining the larger, higher grade Southern Zone pit followed by the Northern Zone pit.
The Life of Mine strip ratio is estimated at 4.3:1.
The peak mining rate is estimated to reach 25 Mt per annum of waste and ore.
The ore from the pits will be hauled to the crushing point on the ROM run of mine pad and will be tipped directly into the crusher bin or stockpiled on the ROM pad in the vicinity of the bin for blending.
The ROM pad will have an estimated capacity of some 700 000 tonnes of ore.
The load and haul fleet will consist of three 250 to 300 tonne class excavators, assisted by smaller 125 tonne excavators, loading 90 tonne dump trucks.
Mining activities at Tongon, including grade control drilling, drill and blast, load and haul and crusher feeding will be contracted out.
Negotiations with potential contractors are expected to be concluded around the middle of the year with the chosen contractor scheduled to start mining early in 2010.
Prior to start of mining we have initiated a 433 hole, 39 099 metre, advanced grade control programme over the planned pits of the Southern and Northern Zones.
Approximately half the holes have been completed and results to date confirm the existing grade model.
METALLURGY AND PLANT DESIGN As noted above, the plant is designed to process 3.6 Mt per annum with ores being treated through a primary, secondary and tertiary crushing circuit.
Milling will comprise two ball mills with the discharge from each mill being pumped into separate cyclone feed pump and classifier systems.
A flash flotation circuit will be used to recover floatable gold, with the balance gravitating to the ball mills for further size reduction.
A thickener will be used to enhance the control around the milling and classification circuit, as well as ensuring constant feed density to the CIL carbon in leach circuit.
The thickener underflow will be pumped to the leach CIL circuit where gold will be dissolved and adsorbed onto activated carbon.
The resultant CIL tailings slurry will be subjected to tailings thickening to recover the maximum amount of process water containing available unused cyanide, which will reduce the amount of fresh cyanide required for leaching as well as the amount of cyanide destruction required.
A cyanide destruction process will be incorporated into the process design.
The thickened underflow will be pumped to the tailings storage facility which will be located as a valley fill impoundment, approximately 6 kilometres to the west of the plant site.
Gold will be recovered from the flotation concentrates through a combination of fine grinding and cyanidation.
Loaded carbon from the CIL circuit will be acid washed prior to elution, followed by regeneration of the eluted carbon.
Gold will be deposited onto cathodes following electrowinning of the eluate.
The dried gold sludge will be smelted to produce gold dor which will be shipped to the refinery.
Average recoveries over the Life of Mine are expected to exceed 90%.
INFRASTRUCTURE The footprint of the mine site has been delineated with the aim of keeping the project area to a minimum, thus reducing its impact on the environment and the local population.
The design layout of the infrastructure has been completed.
Electrical power will be supplied from the national grid via a dedicated overhead line.
A full back-up power generation plant will also be installed.
Water will be supplied via a stream diversion dam located approximately one kilometre upstream from the Southern Zone pit.
Randgold Resources | 33 INVESTING FOR TOMORROW Tongon project continued ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT A full environmental and social impact assessment study ESIA was carried out by independent consultants, Digby Wells & Associates, as required by Cte d'Ivoire legislation as well as the companys compliance with Equator principles and the IFC performance standards on social and environmental sustainability.
Project alternatives have been examined and a public participation process completed.
The natural pre-mining environment has been described and the potential project impacts evaluated.
No fatal flaws have been identified by the specialist studies on hydrology, geohydrology, flora, fauna or archaeology.
A relocation action plan for affected farmers has been formulated and agreed with the local communities and state authorities.
The ESIA was subjected to a public enquiry process and subsequently approved by the state, and the environmental permit to develop the mine has been issued.
HUMAN RESOURCES Several hundred new job opportunities will be created in Northern Cte d'Ivoire.
The highest number of workers, exceeding 800, will be employed during the construction phase.
Subsequent to that, during the production phase, employment should total approximately 536 permanent employees of which 278 will be employed by Randgold Resources and 258 by contractors.
Recruitment has already started through a labour broker.
FINANCIAL MODEL While decreases in costs of diesel, steel, reagents and transport are expected to filter down in future, the financial analysis shown below is based on costs at September 2008, when the feasibility type 4 study was completed.
The key parameters are summarised below: A flat gold price of US$800 per ounce has been used for modelling purposes, with sensitivities applied from US$600 to US$1 000 per ounce.
Total ore mined of 38.25 Mt at a strip ratio of 4.3:1 to give total tonnes mined 3 Construction of the infrastructure is of 203 Mt and total contained gold of 3.16 Mozs.
4 Mining costs average of US$3.03 per tonne over the Life of Mine.
Mill throughput of 300 000 tonnes per month.
Plant costs average of US$12.55 per tonne.
G&A cost of US$2.90 per tonne over Life of Mine.
Capital cost of US$280 million.
In order to illustrate the effect of costs reverting to pre-commodity-boom levels, we have detailed on the next page a comparison of the September 2008 cost estimates with input costs approximating those experienced in the third quarter of 2007.
