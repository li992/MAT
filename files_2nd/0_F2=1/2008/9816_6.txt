These 47 pubs have been included in the year end pub numbers for Marstons Pub Company.
Total turnover increased by 5.6 % to 388.3 million 2007: 367.8 million.
Underlying operating profit was 67.2 million 2007: 66.7 million.
As anticipated, the sales mix was affected by the smoking ban and established market trends.
Total like-for-like sales were 0.6% below last year, with like-for-like food sales up by 3.0% and wet sales down 2.6% on the same basis.
Average turnover per pub increased by 2.9 % to 14,100 per week.
1 Food sales represent 36% of total retail turnover 2007: 34%.
Average spend per head on food was around 6, a slight increase on the previous year.
The like-for-like volume of meals sold increased by 4%.
This strong sales performance was accompanied by robust gross margins.
Net operating margin of 17.3% was 0.8% below last year, with good controls significantly mitigating higher costs associated with the change in sales mix, including food service costs and input cost inflation.
Food input cost inflation was approximately 6% in 2008, an increase of around 3 million.
We expect the general rate of food inflation for 2009 to be around 3% and have recently negotiated a range of supply contracts on favourable terms.
2 Bar staff costs represent around 26% of turnover and were well controlled considering the extension of holiday entitlement for part-time employees and the change in sales mix.
We expect further improvements from the second half of the 2009 financial year following the implementation of a new system which will facilitate refinements to be made to labour scheduling.
During 2008 we opened 16 new pubs or bars, including 12 community food-led pubs and 4 branded high street bars, investing 33 million in these mainly freehold sites.
Over the last 5 years we have opened over 50 similar outlets, the majority being new-build pubs designed as part of 3 4 new housing developments.
The sites have been carefully selected and designed for optimal use of space both internally and externally, and for maximum operational efficiency.
Food sales typically represent around 50% of turnover in these pubs.
Although return on capital from these investments remains high there has been a significant reduction in housing development by house builders and we have scaled back our plans accordingly.
We expect to open 4 new outlets in 2009 and are buying new sites for future, rather than immediate, development.
Prices paid for sites have eased over 04 05 06 07 08 04 05 06 07 08 recent months.
