KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS HOW WE MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE We monitor the performance of our business by measuring three principal indicators against appropriate benchmarks.
Set against the background of our strategy, these Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, demonstrate the extent to which earnings and valuation growth drive returns.
Growth in portfolio and equity returns should, over time, be reflected in improved shareholder returns.
