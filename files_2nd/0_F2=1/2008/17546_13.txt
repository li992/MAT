Key performance indicators Year ended 31 March The following table sets out the key performance measures we monitor in order to evaluate progress against our three part strategy of winning, keeping and growing customers.
The relative focus on these three parts will vary from period to period which necessarily leads to trade-offs between the performance measures.
The over-reaching benchmark of the success of our strategy is our revenue growth.
