The Board may also decide that no dividend is payable in respect of those default shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be registered.
These restrictions end seven days after receipt by the Company of a notice of an approved transfer of the shares or all the information required by the relevant Section 793 notice, whichever is earlier.
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be exercised in a way which the Financial Services Authority regards as preventing dealings in shares of that class from taking place on an open or proper basis.
The Directors may likewise refuse any transfer of a share in favour of more than four persons jointly.
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than: certain restrictions that may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations for example, insider trading laws : and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain employees of the Company require approval of the Company to deal in the Companys shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Resolutions will be proposed at the 2009 Annual General Meeting to authorise the Directors to exercise all powers to allot shares and approve a limited disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights.
Details are set out in the Notice of Meeting accompanying this document.
The Company was granted authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2008 to purchase its own shares up to an aggregate value of 10% of the issued nominal capital.
The authority was not used during the year.
The authority is renewed annually and approval will be sought at the Annual General Meeting in 2009 for its renewal.
Further details are set out in the Notice of Meeting accompanying this document.

Material contracts and change of control agreements The Company is party to a number of banking agreements which allow for notification of change of control within five days of becoming aware of the event following which repayment of outstanding commitments is to be made within thirty days.
The Groups UK rail portfolio currently comprises three DfT franchises: National Express East Coast, National Express East Anglia and c2c.
Each of the three rail franchise agreements with DfT contains termination rights for the benefit of DfT which would be triggered by a change of control in National Express Group PLC.
The Groups rail franchisees lease their rolling stock.
National Express East Coasts rolling stock leases with HSBC Rail UK Limited and with Porterbrook Leasing Company Limited both contain termination rights for the benefit of the lessor which would be triggered by a change of control in National Express Group PLC.
All of National Express East Anglias rolling stock leases with HSBC Rail UK Limited and its more significant leases with Porterbrook Leasing Company Limited contain termination rights for the benefit of the lessor which would be triggered by a change of control in National Express Group PLC.
The Groups UK bus business operates routes in London under a framework agreement with TfL.
That agreement contains a termination right for the benefit of TfL which would be triggered by a change of control in National Express Group PLC.
The Groups North American business operates school bus services under contracts with school boards.
Those contracts invariably contain a change of control clause for the benefit of the board which would be triggered by a change of control in National Express Group PLC.
While no one single school bus contract could be considered significant in the context of the Group turnover, the impact on that turnover in the event that each school board exercised its termination right on a change of control would be significant.
40 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Directors and employees service contracts Ray OToole has a provision in his service contract which provides that, where the Company initiates a termination other than for cause, within six months of a change of control taking place the Company will exercise its option to make a payment in lieu of notice of an amount equal to salary and benefits that the Director would have received during the notice period.
There are no other agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Auditors Resolutions to appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the Company and to authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration will be proposed at the 2009 AGM.
Disclosure of information to auditors The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware and that each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
Going concern It should be recognised that any consideration of the foreseeable future involves making a judgement, at a particular point in time, about future events which are inherently uncertain.
Nevertheless, at the time of preparation of these accounts and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Details of borrowings, liquidity risks and committed facilities can be found in notes 29 and 30 to the Group financial statements and in the OFR.
Post balance sheet event On 24 October 2008, the Group announced that it planned to exit the Dot2Dot business.
