Of the facilities, $1,000 million 503 million expire in May 2009, $900 million 452 million expire in May 2010, $1,080 million 543 million expire in May 2011 and $250 million 125 million expire in May 2012.
Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being a minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items aggregated with share of associates profits to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with all of its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.
Capital commitments not provided for at 30 June 2008 were estimated at 130 million 2007 86 million: 2006 56 million.
Diageo management believes that it has sufficient funding for its working capital requirements.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Payments due by period Less than More than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total million million million million million As at 30 June 2008 Long term debt obligations 849 791 1,755 2,989 6,384 Interest obligations 296 600 478 1,212 2,586 Operating leases 73 135 92 220 520 Purchase obligations 1,006 1,101 475 116 2,698 Provisions and other non-current payables 56 131 69 81 337 2,280 2,758 2,869 4,618 12,525 Long term debt obligations comprise the principal amount of borrowings excluding foreign currency swaps with an original maturity of greater than one year.
Interest obligations comprise interest payable on these borrowings.
Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of the year ended 30 June 2008 until maturity of the instruments.
Purchase obligations include various long term purchase contracts entered into for the supply of certain raw materials, principally bulk whisky, grapes, cans and glass bottles.
The contracts are used to guarantee supply of raw materials over the long term and to enable more accurate predictions of future costs.
Provisions and other non-current payables exclude 19 million in respect of vacant properties and 79 million for onerous contracts, which are included in operating leases and purchase obligations, respectively.
Potential income tax exposures included within corporate tax payable of 685 million 2007 673 million and deferred tax liabilities are not included in the table above, as the ultimate timing of settlement cannot reasonably be estimated.
Post employment benefit liabilities are also not included in the table above.
The group makes service-based cash contributions to the Diageo pension scheme in the United Kingdom.
In the year ending 30 June 2009, the contribution is expected to be 49 million.
In addition, the group has agreed a deficit funding plan with the trustees of the UK Diageo Pension Scheme, which provides for the group to make further payments of 50 million in each of the two years to 30 June 2010 into escrow accounts.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in October 2001, Diageo has guaranteed debt of International Multifoods Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The JM Smucker Company as from 18 June 2004, to the amount of $200 million 101 million, until November 2009.
The directors are not aware of any instances of default by the borrower at present, but the ability of the borrower to continue to be in compliance with the guaranteed debt instrument, and in particular remaining current on payments of interest and repayments of principal, is significantly dependent on the current and future operations of the borrower and its affiliates.
This guarantee is unrelated to the ongoing operations of the groups business.
Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo plc nor any member of the Diageo group, has any off-balance sheet financing arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on the groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
