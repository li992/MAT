Its objective is to assets has been slower than I anticipated and the fund maximise long term returns from a portfolio focused on has held net cash since launch.
The cash position partly smaller sized property companies across Europe.
Investors reflected the process of stock repositioning there rarely in the Ordinary shares were given the opportunity to being an opportunity for the simultaneous matching of convert Ordinary shares into Sigma shares at the ratio of sales and purchases but increasingly it became part of 1 Sigma share for every 5 Ordinary shares.
Take-up was my strategy given the broad negative trajectory of real high and in the event just under 19% of the equity estate markets over the period.
The cash holding peaked elected to convert.

At inception the portfolio mirrored that of the Ordinary My decision to eradicate gearing and hold cash was the share portfolio the conversion excluded a share of the right one but with the benefit of hindsight I should have direct property portfolio together with a pro rata share of sold even more stocks in the period immediately following the debt both short term debt and the Debentures.
At the time I judged that the large cap stocks had initial portfolio therefore comprised 64% large borne the brunt of the initial market correction due to their capitalisation stocks defined as those with a market cap liquidity.
I was nervous of selling what appeared to be of over 1bn and 36% small caps.
Taking account of the relatively cheap large cap stocks in order to invest in small additional cash raised, the effective gearing at inception caps at precisely the point at which they caught up with was 3.2%.
In part I was right small cap stocks did indeed catch a cold from their larger peers, but Performance the market as a whole had further to fall.
The first 8 months of the funds existence has been dominated by the repositioning of the portfolio.

My aim as Fund Manager is to pick companies that can out-perform in the long term.

This is more than double the rate of Belgium Offices & Industrial 2.6% 1.0% 2.6% 0.4% turnover in the Ordinary share portfolio.
Given that on the Belgium Retail 0.5% 0.5% 0.5% 0.2% Central Europe Offices 0.8% 0.6% 0.8% 0.9% day of conversion the portfolio was 64% large cap stocks, Central Europe Retail 1.4% 0.8% 1.4% 0.8% investors may well have expected turnover to have been Central Europe Logistics 0.5% 0.4% 0.5% 0.2% Central Europe Residential 0.4% 0.5% 0.4% 1.0% even higher in this initial period of asset rotation.
That it Central Europe Other 0.1% 0.3% 0.1% 0.6% wasnt, is a reflection of the deliberate change in Denmark 0.1% 0.1% 0.1% 0.1% Finland 1.8% 0.9% 1.8% 0.6% investment tempo as market conditions altered over French Retail 7.7% 5.3% 7.7% 7.4% French Offices 6.9% 6.7% 6.9% 5.7% the year.
