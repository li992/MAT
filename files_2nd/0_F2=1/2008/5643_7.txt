These site improvements have also facilitated the installation of a state of the art production line, utilising key Fibertec proprietary technology, which will become operational early in 2009.
Completion of the renovation will enhance productivity, quality and the product offering as well as bringing the facility up to the standard of global manufacturing excellence achieved by the divisions other facilities.
Looking forward to 2009, the Porous Technologies division will benefit from the full year effect of both the Lendell acquisition and new inkjet printer cartridge reservoir business secured in 2008.
In addition, expected new projects in the medical products and inkjet printer market should come on stream in the first half of the year.
