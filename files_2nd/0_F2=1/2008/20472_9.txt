2 B U s I n E s s R E V I E W The reported loss ratio for 2008 improved to 117%, from 141% in 2007.
The overall loss for the period totalled 1.2m up from a loss of 0.7m in 2007.
Regulatory environment The Group has taken advantage of the ability to passport UK regulatory permissions into Europe in structuring the three new businesses.
This means that whilst all three have to comply with local rules and regulations, the main regulator of each is either the FSA or the Gibraltar FSC, regimes that the Group is very familiar with.
Capital requirements are also set by the UK and Gibraltar regulators.
Risks and uncertainties Entering new markets The Group is starting new businesses from scratch in relatively unfamiliar markets.
There is a risk that one of more of these will take longer than planned to become profitable, or even that one or more will not become profitable.
The Groups approach to expansion is a slow and steady one, aiming to establish profitable and sustainable businesses before taking on significant amounts of business.
This means that the financial impact of start-up operations is not excessive.
Reinsurance support also helps in this regard.
Insurance, operational and regulatory risks The non-UK businesses face similar risks to those noted above in respect of the UK car insurance operation.
