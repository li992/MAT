In October 2008, both Lloyds TSB and HBOS announced that they intended to participate in a co-ordinated package of capital and funding measures for the UK banking sector being implemented by HM Treasury.
This led to Lloyds TSBs participation in the raising of 5.5 billion new capital consisting of 4.5 billion in ordinary shares and 1 billion in preference shares.
In addition, HBOS participated in the raising of 11.5 billion consisting of 8.5 billion in ordinary shares and 3 billion in preference shares.
Both of these capital raisings and the HBOS acquisition were completed in January 2009.
The Groups board believes that its participation in the Government funding proposal provided the capital necessary to complete the acquisition in a timely fashion, with certainty and on terms that were the best available in current market conditions.
The board believes that HM Treasury, which is now a 43.4 per cent shareholder of the Group, will act as a value-oriented shareholder with regard to the strategic development of the Group.
Following the completion of the acquisition and the capital raisings in January 2009, the proforma adjusted capital ratios for Lloyds Banking Group, at 31 December 2008, were 6.4 per cent for core tier 1, 9.8 per cent for tier 1 capital and 12.5 per cent for total capital.
The proforma adjusted net tangible asset value of the enlarged Group totalled an estimated 29.5 billion, equivalent to 179p per share.
A CHALLenGInG oUTLooK 2008 has been an immensely challenging period for all banks, and the assets on the enlarged Groups balance sheet have shown increasing signs of stress during the year.
Whilst our risk management and business support culture is strong, the continuing economic deterioration in the UK will make 2009 another difficult year.
We currently expect retail impairment levels to rise significantly in 2009, largely reflecting the expected increase in unemployment levels in the UK and the impact of further house price falls.
Corporate impairment levels are expected to remain at the high levels seen during 2008, whilst Treasury asset and investment portfolio write-downs are expected to be significantly lower.
Overall, before the recognition of negative goodwill, we expect the enlarged Group to report a loss for 2009.

In order to provide a clearer representation of the underlying trends within the Insurance and Investments segment, these items are shown within a separate column in the segmental analysis above.
In the year ended 31 December 2008, the contribution from central group items was a negative 552 million compared to a negative contribution of 12 million in 2007.
The result in 2008 has been significantly affected by the impact of yield curve volatility on the fair value of derivatives entered into for risk management purposes, after taking into account the effect of hedge accounting adjustments.
In addition, there were increased central costs that were not recharged to the divisions in connection with professional advice received during the year and an impairment charge in respect of an available-for-sale investment.
