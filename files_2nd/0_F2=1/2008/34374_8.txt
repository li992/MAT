The project will create more attractive accommodation for both existing and potential occupiers and will increase rental value.
Our expectations have been confirmed in this respect by a recent agreement for the letting of one floor of c. 7,000 sq ft at a new high rent for Regents Place of 61per sq ft. Also at Regents Place, the letting of the Euston Tower and its Podium to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local The Gallery, Meadowhall Government has been rearranged, to create new leases for a further 15 years subject to a tenant break option at 13 years.

The Tower will have fixed rental increases in 2012 and 2017, while the Podium will be subject to upward only open market rent reviews every seven years.
