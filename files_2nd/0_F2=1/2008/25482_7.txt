Divisional review Capital Markets Specialist structuring and advisory business Southern Africa We experienced very strong growth in our core advances across all sectors, with particularly strong activity in resource finance and acquisition related finance.
We launched a number of new initiatives and products during the year, including JSE listed Currency Futures, and Exchange Traded Funds platform.
We continued to enjoy significant market share across listed equity warrants and single stock futures.
We managed the groups asset and liability profile during a period that saw a number of interest rate increases.
The resultant interest rate risk on the South African balance sheet was managed in a profitable manner.
Treasury and derivative deal flow continued to grow resulting in excellent results across all our trading areas, including commodities, foreign exchange, interest rates and equity derivatives.
Activity in debt capital markets, including securitisations, declined rapidly in the last quarter of the year as the effects of global markets forces were felt in the local market.
We continue to develop our investments in retail funding platforms, but at a slower pace while markets normalise.
Australia We issued our first medium term note programme in June 2007 and raised a total of A$250 million.
The Structured Finance team launched the Investec Global Aircraft Fund for institutional investors, raising on a standalone basis, equity of A$73 million.
The pipeline of aircraft finance transactions remains strong.
The Project Finance business continues to exploit both lending and growth opportunities in the infrastructure and energy sectors, with a particular focus on clean, alternative and renewable energy.
Trading Activities had a profitable year, across interest rates, forex and commodities.
Our Resource Finance division continued to perform well despite difficult market conditions and strong loan book prepayments.
Outlook, risks and uncertainties The strategy has not changed.
We remain a focused business targeting markets where we can be distinctive and competitive.
In the UK and South Africa we will continue to strive for depth and greater penetration.
In Australia we continue to look for opportunities to broaden our franchise.
Our strategy around specialist funds remains a key focus.
We will continue to invest in the business to ensure continued growth in the medium term.
The liquidity issues have affected all our markets although opportunities continue to present themselves.
Deal volume has slowed in line with market conditions, and the growth of the business is dependent on liquidity and stability returning to the financial markets, including the return of securitisation in some form.
These factors will have an impact on some of our businesses in the coming year, but we have a diversified portfolio of businesses within Capital Markets and the pipeline remains good in many of our specialised lending areas, including Project Finance, Resource Finance and Structured Finance.
There is a lag between assets re-pricing and the increased cost of borrowing which will have a negative effect on net interest income.

Strong growth from the Prime Broking operation and International Broking activities was partially offset by a weaker performance from the Dual Listed Arbitrage and trading businesses.
The results of the UK Institutional Stockbroking operations were negatively impacted by a decline in IPO fees, although the division's market making and trading operations performed well.
