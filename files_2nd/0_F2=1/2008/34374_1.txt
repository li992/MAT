Foreword Concern for the environment is part of British Lands corporate culture, encouraging us to focus on a property portfolio that is both commercially attractive and sustainable in its broader context.
We aspire to enhance the quality of life for those on whom our activities impact, and this Annual Report celebrates our record of environmental management.
We believe this is the way to long-term benets for both customers and shareholders.
