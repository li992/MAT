Divisional review Investment Banking Integrated business focused on local client delivery with international access Institutional Research, Sales and Trading UK and Europe While volatile markets and unbundling have restricted secondary commission growth, net trading revenues have showed considerable improvement.
We have strengthened our UK sales team over the last six months with the addition of a number of experienced sales people, including two hedge fund specialists.
We now have a sales team in New York and continue to expand our US distribution capability.
South Africa A solid performance was achieved for the year, driven by healthy growth in the prime broking operations and international broking activities.
The prime broking activity has developed into one of the leading players in the local hedge fund market.
The international operation gained market share with a solid base being established in the US and select targeting of continental European clients.
A leading position was established in the small and mid cap research space while further gains were achieved in broadening our research coverage to reflect a distinctively South African offering.
Direct Investments and Private Equity UK, Europe and Hong Kong We continued to seek appropriate investment opportunities to enable us to leverage off the skills and knowledge base of the group and we also increased resources in this area.
South Africa The Direct Investments portfolio increased to R 1 051 million at 31 March 2008 March 2007: R 1 012 million.
This was driven by a good performance from the underlying investments and a few acquisitions and realisations.
We continued to expand the capacity of our Private Equity investments through acquisitions and capital expenditure.
The Private Equity portfolio was approximately R1 976 million at 31 March 2008 March 2007: R1 266 million.
Australia We completed the equity raising of A$40 million for Investec Wentworth Private Equity Fund 3A which will co-invest with the A$200 million Investec Wentworth Private Equity Fund 3.
The total size of the Private Equity Funds is A$460 million.
We successfully completed five new investments.
The investment portfolio continues to perform satisfactorily.
Outlook, risks and uncertainties Corporate Finance While market conditions are currently uncertain, the pipeline is positive and we continue to invest in building our Trusted Adviser capability and client base in the UK.
Black economic empowerment and M&A transactions are expected to continue to drive activity in South Africa.
We continue to invest in building the Australian team and this, together with increased brand awareness and national reach, provides a solid platform for future growth opportunities.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading The UK business has strengthened its positioning in the market, while further growth is expected to come from hedge funds and increased distribution into the US and Europe.
The outlook for the South African business looks challenging.
Ongoing global market uncertainty is likely to dampen activity while the growing local acceptance of the practice of unbundling research and execution will continue to exert downward pressure on margins.
Nevertheless, any downside is set to be cushioned by growth in the prime broking business, continued international expansion and the push into related business activities.
Direct Investments and Private Equity We remain active in seeking direct investment opportunities, while continuing to unlock further value from the portfolio and the building of black economic empowerment platforms.
The companies in our Private Equity portfolio are all trading in line with expectations and the outlook remains positive.
The Australian business continues to add value to existing investments and is well placed to take advantage of new investment opportunities.
