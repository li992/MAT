Capital unaudited The Group aims to maintain appropriate levels of capital, in excess of regulatory requirements, to ensure its capital position remains appropriate given the economic and competitive environment.
Capital adequacy and risk management are closely aligned.
The Group undertakes a regular assessment of its internal capital requirement based on a quantification of the material risks to which it is exposed.
