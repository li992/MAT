IG Group Holdings plc Group Operating and Financial Review Report and Financial Statements 2008 21 Key performance indicators The Chief Executives Report provides an overall assessment of the Groups progress during the year and prospects for the future.
The directors have assessed that the following key performance indicators, together with revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share, are the most effective measures of progress towards achieving the Groups strategies and as such towards fulfilling the Groups business objectives.
2008 2007 Increase decrease % Financial Number of clients dealing 56,291 34,483 63.2% Average revenue per client 3,064 3,184 3.8% Number of accounts opened 42,693 23,785 79.5% Number of accounts dealing for the first time 29,211 15,809 84.8% Sport Number of clients dealing 15,860 19,905 20.3% Number of accounts opened 10,401 16,437 36.7% Number of accounts dealing for the first time 8,102 12,013 32.6% Volatility of daily revenue Coefficient of variability at 31 May 0.53 0.46 15.2% Average for the year 0.55 0.53 3.8% Highest in year 0.69 0.73 5.5% Lowest in year 0.45 0.36 25.0% Number of clients dealing Revenue is determined to a significant extent by the number of clients dealing.
The number of financial clients dealing increased by 63% compared with the previous year.
The most marked increase was in the number of CFD clients dealing, reflecting growth driven by the expansion of the non-UK client base.
The number of financial betting clients dealing increased by 56% over the previous year.
The number of sports clients dealing directly with IG fell by 20% compared with the previous year which included the football World Cup.
Average revenue per financial client Average revenue per financial client represents the total revenue divided by the number of clients dealing.
This varies significantly for different products and geographies and the overall average reflects changes in the business mix during the year.
Average revenue per financial client reduced slightly from the previous year.
Higher average revenues in the UK were offset by lower average revenues elsewhere in the world.
In particular, CFD clients in the Asia Pacific and Rest of World segments are more retail in nature and represent a newer client base for which average revenues are significantly lower than for UK CFD clients.
As these businesses develop CFD revenues worldwide are tending towards similar levels to those seen in financial betting.
The average revenue for financial betting clients was consistent with the previous year.
IG Group Holdings plc 22 Report and Financial Statements 2008 Group Operating and Financial Review Key performance indicators continued Number of accounts opened and dealing for the first time Over the long term, the growth of IGs client base is a key driver of revenue growth.
The number of accounts opened and the number of accounts dealing for the first time therefore provide leading indicators of future prospects.
New financial accounts were favourably impacted by the UK launch and subsequent roll-out worldwide of the PureDeal platform and client education programmes.
Sport account openings were impacted by the lack of a major football tournament in the year.
Volatility of daily revenue The coefficient of variability of daily revenue is a statistical measure of the volatility of the Groups revenue from day to day.
The Group calculates this as the 60 day standard deviation of daily revenues divided by the 60 day mean.
Over recent years the coefficient of variability has fallen significantly as the Group has sought to reduce the volatility of its revenues and hence improve the quality of earnings.
The Group has a formal risk policy which includes limits, or a methodology for setting limits for every single financial market which the Group trades.
Despite greatly increased volatility in financial markets during the year, daily revenue volatility remained consistent with the prior year.
EBITDA and EBITDA margin EBITDA represents earnings before exceptional administrative costs, depreciation, amortisation charges, amounts written off property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, taxation, interest payable on debt and interest receivable on corporate cash balances but includes interest receivable on clients balances less interest payable to clients.
The net interest receivable on client balances is considered to be part of the normal activities of the Group and is therefore included in EBITDA.
EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
The Groups capital structure changed significantly in September 2003 when the Company raised significant debt and preference shares in order to finance the purchase of IG Group plc by IG Group Holdings plc.
This acquisition gave rise to significant goodwill.
The Groups capital structure changed again in May 2005 when this debt and preference shares were repaid at the time of the Companys initial public offering IPO.
To facilitate comparison of business performance over time the Group uses EBITDA as a primary profit measure.
The Group seeks to achieve rapid growth in EBITDA, and bonuses for most staff other than directors of the Company are linked to EBITDA.
2008 2007 000 000 Operating profit 83,350 59,202 Net interest on client balances 10,221 6,559 Depreciation 4,016 3,513 Amortisation 782 856 Amounts written off property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 124 221 EBITDA 98,493 70,351 EBITDA margin 53.5% 57.7% EBITDA for the year reached 98.5m which represents an increase of 40.0% from the previous year.
This growth was driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in betting duty and investment in overseas expansion and information technology leading to a reduced EBITDA margin in the year under review to 53.5% from 57.7%.
