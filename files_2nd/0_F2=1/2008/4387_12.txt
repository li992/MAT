Business review a dynamic exploration programme During the year, Dana had some notable successes with the drill bit.
Three of the four exploration wells completed in Europe discovered oil and a planned fifth well was delayed until the beginning of 2009.
In Egypt, seven exploration wells were completed in 2008, delivering five discoveries.
UK Two of the key 2008 oil discoveries were in the Rinnes area, namely West and East Rinnes, close to the Dana-operated Hudson field.
Both wells found good quality oil in excellent Brent Group sandstones, and a subsequent drill stem test at West Rinnes flowed very strongly at rates of up to 7,800 bopd, which was equipment restricted.
In February 2009 a further exploration well confirmed significant oil reserves at South-East Rinnes field.
The log, pressure and fluid data will be integrated to determine the total volume of oil discovered, currently estimated at a mid-case of 80 mmboe including the remaining reserves in the Hudson field.
Development studies for the three Rinnes oil fields and the adjacent Melville field are underway with the development concept likely to be determined during 2009 and development sanction scheduled for 2010.
Norway In Norway, Dana pre-qualified as an operator on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and completed one unsuccessful exploration well at the start of 2008 in production licence PL311 Bjrn.
A farm-in to production licence PL035 362 resulted in a gas condensate discovery at Fulla early in 2009.
The Fulla discovery will be further appraised by drilling a sidetrack due to spud in early April.
Egypt Dana is involved in exploration in all of the major hydrocarbon producing basins of Egypt, namely the Gulf of Suez GOS, Western Desert and Nile Delta.
During 2008 Dana participated in seven exploration wells resulting in five discoveries.
The most significant discovery, with the West El Burullus-1X well, tested gas at 26 mmscfpd in the shallow Kafr El Sheik formation.
The volumes of gas discovered, given they are in shallow water, relatively close to shore, are considered to be potentially economic in their own right whilst significantly fide-risking the further shallow structures in this prolific area.
Danas 2009 exploration programme will target prospects close to that discovery with the aim of determining the optimal economic development.
Dana had further success at its first operated well in Egypt, the Akhenaton-1X well in the South October concession, logging a significant pay interval but with a relatively tight reservoir.
The discovery is now under evaluation for commerciality.
The five-well exploration programme in East Beni Suef yielded four oil discoveries, two of which have already started production with development plans under review for the other two.
Africa Following the acquisition of 3D seismic in the St Louis concession in Senegal and the Block 1 concession in Mauritania in 2008, work is now focused on identifying drilling targets for the next phase of drilling in this area.
Subsurface work is also well advanced on the Block 7 concession in Mauritania where the timing of further drilling will be confirmed during 2009.
Two wells will be drilled in Morocco in 2009, with the first well, Anchois in the offshore TangerLarache block, already resulting in a sizeable gas discovery.
