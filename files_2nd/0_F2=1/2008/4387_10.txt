Business review production growth Group Production by Europe continued to dominate Group production at 71%, with a marked increase in the Geographic Area boepd proportion of gas at 37%, compared to 22% in 2007.
Overall field performance was good, with Dana benefiting from the effect of a significant portfolio, and in general where fields 40,000 underperformed relative to plan this was due to facility downtime related issues rather than subsurface performance.
35,000 Northern North Sea & Norway 30,000 The Hudson Field Dana 47.5% ended the year producing strongly at around 7,000 bopd 25,000 despite host facility issues and an extension of a planned platform shutdown at Tern.
Strong production performance on the Otter field Dana 19% benefited from a workover in late May.
20,000 However, this performance was somewhat offset, firstly, by one well being shut-in due to a subsurface pump failure in 2007 and, secondly, by lower than expected reservoir pressure due to insufficient water injection from the Eider host platform.
15,000 Danas Norwegian production from the Jotun field Dana 45% was slightly lower than 10,000 budgeted partly due to a 12 day unscheduled shutdown due to compressor issues.
5,000 Central North Sea 0 At an average of 7,477 boepd, gross oil production from the Enoch field Dana 8.8% exceeded 2007 2008 expectations, although the gas production component has been lower due to a smaller than expected gas cap.
Europe NNS & Norway Europe CNS A decline in production on the Claymore field Dana 7.521% was due to a period of technical Europe SNS & Netherlands problems with two out of three of the gas lift compressors which are essential to maximise Russia well performance and the loss of a separator for most of the year.
Both issues have now been Egypt Gulf of Suez Egypt Western Desert resolved.
Replacement of two water injection risers was completed on time and significantly below budget and activity on the field continued throughout the year delivering one traditional well and three slimhole multilateral legs to existing wells.
Banff Dana 12.4% produced steadily averaging a gross 6,629 boepd.
Production in the Greater Kittiwake Area GKA Dana 50% was significantly below expectations due to scale build-up on the Mallard production well which resulted in the field not producing from March until mid December.
However, a very successful rig intervention in December brought the field back onstream at higher than expected rates.
Gadwall made up some of the Mallard related shortfall whilst Goosander continued to outperform expectations, producing approximately 70% of overall GKA throughput.
Kittiwake production was significantly affected by the failure of two of the three firewater pumps adding 10 days to the planned three week maintenance shutdown and flare permit constraints necessitated restrained production whilst problems with the export gas compressor were resolved.
First oil from the Grouse field was achieved ahead of schedule on 29th December 2008 and was approximately 10,000 bopd.
With the addition of Grouse, the GKA total production capacity is approximately 27,000 bopd.
Southern North Sea In the Southern North Sea, there was stable production from the Cavendish field Dana 50%.
Compression on the Murdoch host platform is now expected to start in 2Q 2009.
