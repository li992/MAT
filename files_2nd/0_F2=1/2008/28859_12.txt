Corporate Responsibility Our approach RBS tries to be a responsible corporate citizen wherever we operate.
It involves regular and direct consultation with our stakeholders to find out what they think about how we do business and the actions they believe we should prioritise.
We use that intelligence to help plan how we run the business.
Progress towards achieving our plans is measured and monitored, allowing us to demonstrate the advances we made in 2008.
As well as responding to what we learn from stakeholders, we have to be flexible, adapting what we do as circumstances change.
The turbulence in financial markets in 2008 and its effects on our customers were precisely the types of events to which a responsible financial services company has to respond.
During the year we gave much greater emphasis to supporting our customers through the economic downturn, while continuing to work on the priorities which had previously been identified.
What this demonstrates above all is that at RBS social responsibility is business as usual.
Progress against priorities in 2008 Consultation with our stakeholders had led to the identification of 10 priority areas for action in 2008.
Full details of these are available at www.
Three leading priority areas were: financial crime: Corporate customer service: and how we market and sell our products.
Responsibility Financial crime is at the heart of our most basic responsibility as a bank: to keep our customers money secure.
