Opportunities to enhance value to existing portfolios remains positive, however, there are continued concerns around skills availability and the increased cost and shortage of building materials and power shortages are likely to result in a slowdown in developments.
A shortage of prime zoned land has become evident, driving prices to unprecedented levels, particularly industrial land.
The volatility in global markets and property values has resulted in a sharp sell-off in South African property equities.

Central Costs We have a policy of allocating costs housed in the centre that are, in effect, performing a function for the divisions of the group.
There are certain costs that are strategic in nature which have not been allocated for pure segmental disclosure, amounting to 73.4 million 2007: 74.6 million.
However, a portion thereof 71.4 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Refer to page 28 for further details.
Central costs are in line with the prior year.
2008 Investec Annual Report 73 Divisional review Group Services and Other Activities Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained.
Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the specific financial and strategic requirements the group faces at the time.
The funds raised are applied towards making acquisitions, funding central services and debt obligations, and purchasing corporate assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

This exposure is hedged with the equal and opposite impact reflected in earnings attributable to minorities.
The increase in interest paid on sub-debt is as a result of new debt being issued in the UK in January 2007 and in South Africa in December 2007 and February 2008.
The decline in principal transaction and other income reflects a lower return on certain of the assets in the South African portfolio.
