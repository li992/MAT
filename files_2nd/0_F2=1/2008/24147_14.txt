The majority of Lombard sales are euro-denominated and therefore benefited from the fall in the value of sterling against the euro.

SOUTHERN EUROPE David Steinegger New business fell by 22% in this region, which comprises Chief Executive, Lombard mainly France, Spain and Italy.
New business from France grew strongly and Italy also performed well, given the difficult economic circumstances.
Sales in Spain fell sharply compared with the very strong growth experienced in 2007.
NORTHERN EUROPE This region comprises mainly Germany and Belgium, and sales were down in 2008 by 12%.
