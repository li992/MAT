The fixed income portfolio consists wholly of preference stocks in the UK financial sector.
These securities offer a very attractive yield of around 7% at current prices and have the added advantage that the dividends are received effectively tax free as they constitute franked investment income.
The turmoil in the UK financial markets which started last summer affected sentiment across the whole sector.
As a result, the capital value of the portfolio declined by 14.3% over the year producing a negative total return of 8.2% after taking the dividend income received of 1.6 million into account.
Further volatility within the sector is likely as the credit crunch plays out.
The income yield, however, remains intact and should be supportive of capital values against a background of lower UK interest rates.
