In 2008, Performance against KPIs 60 new occupational illnesses were reported 2007: 35.
The increase was due to increased reported illnesses at operations acquired in 2008 and at Mount Isa, as a result of a comprehensive health screening Xstratas Executive Committee and Board monitor a range of financial and information programme, through which 12 additional cases and non-financial KPIs on a regular basis to measure the Groups were identied, comprising noise-induced hearing loss and musculoperformance.

This reected strong competition for skilled labour communications and awareness programmes and by continuing for the majority of the year and consequently, voluntary turnover was to invest in safety training and operational integrity as a priority.
