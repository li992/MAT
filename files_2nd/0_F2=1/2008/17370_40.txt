What we think New markets, new media and consumer insight WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell reports hange can be viewed as a frienemy or froe part friend, part enemy, part foe.
Treated well, it offers enormous opportunities, but neglect C its capricious nature and it becomes a threat.
Nowhere is this truer than in our industry.
WPPs strength has always been our ability to identify the trends that will inform our world and capitalise on them for our clients and ourselves.
Its how we began with two people in a room over 20 years ago.
It is how we will weather the current crisis.
And it is how we will position WPP for sustained growth in the years ahead albeit with more than 110,000 people directly with us and access to over 135,000.
This means anticipating geographic, functional and technological shifts, and adjusting our business to make the most of them.
For that reason, we expect the balance of our work to move from Western Europe and other established, slower-growing economies towards dynamic new markets.
They include China with its possibly 1.5 billion and rising population, along with India and the other BRICs nations, Brazil and Russia not to mention the Next 11 identified by Goldman Sachs.
