Asia in particular was strongly affected by the financial crisis in the latter months of 2008.
Against this backdrop, Friends Provident International FPI delivered sales of 210 million, representing a 13% increase.
ASIA Sales in Asia represent about half of FPIs overall sales, with the Hong Kong market dominating.
The strong progress made in Hong Kong over the first half of 2008 faltered somewhat over the second half as the economic climate deteriorated.
However, FPI is becoming increasingly more diversified in Asia as we continue to grow our operations in Singapore.
In 2008, FPI was able to move from a single product offering in Singapore to a suite of four approved products, contributing 9 million to 2008 sales.

However in 2006 FPI entered the German pensions market, leading to 8 million of sales in 2007 and rising to 18 million in 2008.
This successful venture helped overall sales in Europe reach 48 million, just 1 million down on 2007.
OUR NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH AMLIFE IN MALAYSIA In late 2008 we purchased a 30% stake in AmLife, which is part of AmBank, a major Malaysian-based banking and insurance organisation.
This transaction gives us wide access to Malaysia a new territory for our international operations.
The size of our investment is relatively modest and reflects the current size of AmLife.
However, the Malaysian market has considerable growth potential and so our access to it through this new relationship is an important strategic step.
AmLife has a very strong distribution network, based on more than 200 AmBank branches, and through a team of some 4,000 tied agents.
We are confident that with our wide-ranging expertise we can help AmLife to grow strongly and profitably in the years ahead.
