The senior independent non-executive director is Mr Finn.
It is the Companys intention that Mr Johnson will assume the role of senior independent non-executive director following the retirement of Mr Finn on 16 January 2009.
The senior independent non-executive director is available for shareholders to contact with any queries or concerns they may have.
Each of the non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, has at all times acted independently of management and has no relationship which would materially affect the exercise of his independent judgement and decision-making.
The Company considers all of its non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, to be independent, as defined in the Combined Code.
In the case of Mr Finn, the Company considers him to have remained independent throughout the financial year for the reasons which have been detailed in previous annual report and accounts.
In addition, the Company has consulted with shareholders in relation thereto.
With regard to Mr Perry, as at 1 November 2008, he will have served on the Board and its Committees for nine years.
The Company has carefully considered Mr Perrys character and judgement.
He has been subject to a rigorous evaluation process and the Company can confirm that, in its view, he remains independent.
Whenever any director considers that he is interested in any contract or arrangement to which the Group is, or may be, a party, due notice is given to the Board.
No such instances of any significance have arisen during the year.
Board evaluation During the year the directors undertook an evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual directors.
The evaluation was performed using a self-assessment framework.
This involved the Chairman, acting on behalf of the Board, evaluating the performance of the other individual directors, and the non-executive directors, led by the senior independent non-executive director, assessing the performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive directors.

The Board and its Committees reviewed the results of these evaluations and are satisfied with the evidence they provided about the balance, effectiveness and performance of the Board and its Committees and the effectiveness and commitment of each director.
