EBITDA was negatively impacted by a large IFRS Main products Wire, ats, tubes and bars inventory adjustment of $48 million, effectively revaluing stock based on the lower copper price at the end of the year.

GVA Gross Value Added GVA is considered a more appropriate performance measure than revenue as it excludes the cost of copper.
GVA is effectively the conversion charge that customers pay in excess of the copper cathode cost.
The 2008 financial year started off strongly with first-half sales volumes of 150 kt, 9% higher than the comparative period albeit against a worsening economic backdrop.
The weakness in the European housing market led to a reduction in construction projects.
The relative strength of the Euro against the US dollar in the first half of the year made MKMs exports outside Europe less competitive.
The price of copper held up for longer in 2008 than other commodities, leading to product substitution, for example, zinc and aluminium strips or plastics for tubes.
The second half of 2008, whilst bringing a lower copper price, has seen a marked downturn in demand for MKMs products, with customers reluctant to enter into orders for 2009 and being willing to run down inventories.
Wire products, containing wire rod and drawn wires, continue to make up over half of MKMs sales by volume.
Growth in eastern Europe contributed to a strong performance over most of 2008 with MKMs core markets in western Europe largely at.
At the end of 2008, orders from the automobile industry were signicantly scaled back and contracted sales volumes for 2009 are well below the 2008 level.
