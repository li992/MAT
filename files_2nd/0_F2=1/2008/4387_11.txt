Business review record reserves additions 2008 Reserves Movements 2008 was another very successful year for Dana in terms of oil and Proven and probable reserves mmboe gas reserves additions, with a substantial increase in proven and probable reserves to a new record level of 194.1 mmboe for the Group at the year end.
This growth has been achieved through the drill bit, 200 demonstrating the strength of the Groups exploration portfolio.
190 During the past 12 months independent audits on each of the Groups commercial fields has provided up-to-date reserves figures for assets either currently producing, or scheduled for production during the short term.
These audits bring reported reserves in line with revised SPE 180 guidelines.
170 A total of approximately 46 mmboe of reserves was added as a result of the new exploration discoveries in the UK at West and East Rinnes and in the offshore Nile delta, Egypt, at West El Burullus.
Further reserves growth is being sought in 2009, with Danas 17 exploration well 160 drilling programme targeting a broad range of prospects.
While there were upward revisions in reserves on West Abu Gharadig, in Egypt, Melville, and 150 Kerloch in the UK, these were balanced by downward revisions at Barbara in the UK and at Jotun in Norway.
The Barbara revision was a result of updated technical work which has been used as the basis of the unitisation of the Barbara and Phyllis fields and which will lead to a more profitable development plan.
The revision on the Jotun field was due to poorer than predicted production performance in 2008 which has resulted in a technical re-evaluation of the remaining reserves.
Taken together, revisions on existing fields and discoveries resulted in a net reduction in reserves of 1.3 mmboe.
In contrast to prior years 2008 saw no acquisition activity.
Minor divestment activity recorded a small reserves reduction of 2.5 mmboe, associated with farming down Danas interest in the Monkwell discovery.
Overall, the net effect of exploration success, minor revisions and divestments added 42.7 mmboe of proven and probable reserves during 2008.
This increase replaced Group production three-fold over the calendar year.
Group proven and probable oil and gas reserves at 31 December 2008 reached a new high of 194.1 mmboe, of which some 80% are held in Europe.
Danas end 2008 contingent resources technically recoverable hydrocarbons not yet determined to be commercial were a further 146.4 mmboe, an increase of 32.1 mmboe, due principally to the discovery at Akhenaton in Egypt and a revision of reserves on the Nefertiti discovery, both on the South October block in the Gulf of Suez, Egypt.
Therefore the total recoverable hydrocarbon resources available to the Group at the end of 2008 were 340.5 mmboe, of which 57% are currently classed as proven and probable reserves.
In addition, Dana holds a 27.5% interest in Faroe Petroleum plc.
On 18 June 2008, Faroe announced net reserves of 9 mmboe and resources of a further 22 mmboe.
Danas equity share of these reserves would add a further 2.5 mmboe reserves and 6 mmboe resources to the Groups reported reserves and resources.
