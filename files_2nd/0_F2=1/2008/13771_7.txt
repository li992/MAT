16 Entrepreneurship in action An example of the benefits of our decentralised business structure was demonstrated in Spain, where new financial legislation aimed at improving the standard of accounting procedures within SMEs came into effect on 1 January 2008.
More than 98% of businesses in Spain are SMEs, therefore, the legislation affected a large majority of the countrys business population and Sage customers.
Research showed that 75% of employers were not aware of the effects of this legislation on their businesses.
Consequently Sage Spain, along with other key SME technology providers, conducted a road show across the country designed to help Spanish SMEs understand more about how the new legislation impacts their businesses.
More than 31,000 people attended the road shows in 40 cities to find out, not only about the legislation, but also how using software can improve their business processes and help run their business more effectively.
