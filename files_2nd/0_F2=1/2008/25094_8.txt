DIRECTORS REPORT The directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008. Business Review INVESTMENT POLICY i Objective and policy The Companys objective is to enable investors to benefit from rapid and sustained growth anticipated by the directors in the markets for cleaner or more efficient delivery of basic services of energy, water and waste.
Investments are made predominantly in quoted companies which provide, utilise, implement or advise upon technology-based systems, products or services in environmental markets, particularly those of alternative energy and energy efficiency, water treatment and pollution control, and waste technology and resource management.
ii Asset allocation Investments are selected on an individual basis but each investment is categorised according to three primary environmental markets which are the focus of the Companys investment policy.
Alternative Energy and Energy Efficiency In the alternative energy and energy efficiency sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: wind turbine manufacturing solar panel manufacturing and integration renewable energy developers and independent power producers biofuels meters, utility software and demand side management industrial energy efficiency buildings energy efficiency transport energy efficiency businesses relating to the trading of carbon and other environmental assets fuel cells, flywheels, superconductors, supercapacitors and other new energy technologies As at 31 December 2008, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 125m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 41 per cent of the Companys net assets at that time.
Waste Technologies and Resource Management In the waste technologies and resource management sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: recycling equipment and systems recycling of commodities including metals, plastics, oils, paper and vehicles integrated waste management hazardous waste management environmental consultancy As at 31 December 2008, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 97m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 32 per cent of the Companys net assets at that time.
15 IMPAX ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS PLC DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Water Treatment and Pollution Control In the water treatment and pollution control sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: water treatment technologies involved in filtration, purification & separation water infrastructure including pumps, valves and actuators environmental sensing, testing and monitoring air pollution control technologies As at 31 December 2008, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 72m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 24 per cent of the Companys net assets at that time.
iii Risk diversification The Company has the following maximum exposures in place in order to ensure that there is a reasonable diversification of risk in the Companys portfolio: i Not more than 10 per cent of the Companys Net Asset Value will be invested in any one company at the time of investment.
ii The Company will not make an investment if as a consequence of that investment individual holdings of five per cent or more would in aggregate represent more than 40 per cent of NAV.
The Company did not exceed either of the above maximum exposures during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Company held investments in 95 companies as at 31 December 2008, the largest one being Regal Beloit which represented 3.0 per cent of net assets at that time.
The Company does not have prescriptive limits on the maximum amounts that can be invested in the sub-sectors listed above.
The directors believe that the imposition of such limits could impact on efficient portfolio management.
iv Gearing At present the Company does not have any long-term or short-term borrowings and during the year ended 31 December 2008 did not utilise any borrowings.
The Board has authorised the Manager to utilise short-term borrowings of up to 10 per cent of net assets in order to provide liquidity for efficient portfolio management where the Manager sees fit.
While there is no current intention to utilise long-term borrowings, the Company retains the flexibility to do so in appropriate circumstances.
Any long-term borrowings, and any borrowings in excess of 10 per cent of net assets would require the separate authorisation of the Board.
The borrowings of the Company shall not at any time, without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution of the Company, exceed an amount equal to one third of the aggregate of: i the amount paid up on the share capital of the Company: ii the total of the capital and revenue reserves of the Company, including any share premium account, capital redemption reserve and credit balance on the profit and loss account as shown in the latest audited balance sheet and profit and loss account of the Company subject to certain adjustments detailed in the Companys Articles of Association.
OBJECTIVE AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIs The Board measures the Companys success in attaining its investment objective by reference to the following KPIs: i Achievement of capital growth over the long term.
The Board monitors the undiluted net asset value NAV and compares this with the MSCI World Index and other indices.
16 IMPAX ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS PLC DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED ii Maintenance of a reasonable level of discount or premium of share price to diluted net asset value.
iii Maintenance of reasonable level of total expense ratio TER compared with the Companys net assets.
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE The Chairmans statement on pages 3 and 4 incorporates a review of the highlights during the year.
The Managers report on pages 5 to 8 gives details on investments made during the year and how performance has been achieved.
The capital growth performance of the Company is shown below.
Since launch 3 years to 1 year to 31 December 31 December 2008 2008 NAV undiluted of the Company 0.7% 6.9% 23.9% MSCI World Index 4.5% 13.7% 21.2% FTSE All-Share Index 9.8% 22.4% 32.8% FTSE ET50 Index 11.0% 23.4% 38.6% MSCI World Small Cap Index 21.9% 22.5% 22.3% Nasdaq Composite Index 13.4% 18.8% 22.1% Note: Index numbers are in sterling terms and have been sourced from Bloomberg.
Based on opening NAV after share issue expenses of 98.25p per ordinary share.
The Companys shares traded at an average discount to NAV diluted of 2.0 per cent during the year ended 31 December 2008.
Based on the Companys net assets at 31 December 2008, the Companys annualised TER was 1.2 per cent 2007: 1.2 per cent.
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND The Companys revenue return after tax for the year amounted to 2,657,000 2007: 1,159,000.
The directors expect the Company normally to generate returns in the form of capital gains rather than revenue.
In order to meet the investment trust qualifying requirements, the directors are proposing that the Company will pay a final dividend of 0.85p per Ordinary Share 2007: 0.3p per ordinary share absorbing 2,594,109 2007: 908,238 based on the Ordinary Shares in issue excluding Treasury Shares on the date of this report.
It should not be assumed that this level of revenue return or dividend will be repeated in future years.
If approved at the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 18 May 2009 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 17 April 2009.
Therefore the total loss after tax for the Company was 91,375,000 2007: 44,355,000, gain.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Board considers that the risks faced by the Company fall into two main categories.
i External risks Poor performance from stock markets in general and or foreign currency movements.
In addition, the specialist sectors in which the Company invests tend to be more volatile than general, broadly based stock market indices.
As a consequence shareholders may experience higher variability in returns than investing in stock markets generally and, in particular, may experience higher levels 17 IMPAX ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS PLC DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED of losses in the event of stock market falls.
The Company has a specific remit and the Board is focussed on the medium and longer term performance of the Company and does not consider that short term volatility should unduly influence the Companys investment policy and management of risk.
Further detail on external risks is provided in note 15 to the accounts.
ii Internal risks The main risk areas are poor allocation of the Companys assets by the Investment Manager, poor governance by the Board and poor compliance or administration including the loss of investment trust status.
These factors could potentially result in unacceptable returns for shareholders.
RISK CONTROLS i External risks There are inherent risks involved in stock selection.
The Investment Manager is experienced and employs its expertise in selecting the stocks in which the Company invests.
The Manager spreads the investment risk over a wide portfolio of investments in three main sectors and at the year end the Company held investments in 95 companies.
Further detail on external risk controls is provided in note 15 to the accounts.
ii Internal risks The control of risks related to the Companys business areas is described in detail in the corporate governance report on pages 23 to 27.
OUTLOOK The outlook for the Company is discussed in the Chairmans Statement on page 4.
Other Information LEGAL AND TAXATION STATUS The Company is an investment company within the meaning of Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006.
