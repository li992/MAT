The strategic change entailed withdrawing from less profitable segments of the individual market and focusing primarily on protection business for which we have a strong proposition.
INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION New business fell 24% from 59 million in 2007 to 45 million in 2008, of which around 35 million is life and critical illness business.
This is closely linked to the health of the UK housing market, which deteriorated significantly in 2008.
The remaining 10 million or so new business is income protection, which is not so closely linked to house purchase transactions and which reduced only by 12% over the year.
Total individual in-force protection premiums have increased from 287 million The UK market is a very to 289 million.
tough environment but we INDIVIDUAL PENSIONS are determined to be one Individual pensions business reduced by 48% to 41 million in of the winners.
2008 reflecting primarily our decision to no longer offer this business on unfunded initial commission terms.
2008 new Kevin Watkins Director, UK Individual business included 14 million received in respect of Department of Work and Pensions rebates, 3% down on 2007.
ANNUITIES New annuity business was broadly maintained at 2007 levels, falling just 4% in 2008 to 26 million.
We continue to focus primarily on providing annuities for our in-house pensions customers as they reach retirement.
Annuities in payment at year-end increased from 150 million to 166 million.
INVESTMENTS Our approach to this market is tactical, focusing on profitable segments, following our decision announced in January 2008 to no longer seek to develop a franchise in wealth management beyond the manufacture and administration of products.
This has resulted in new business reducing to a modest level of 8 million, compared with 51 million in 2007.
All new business figures are expressed as annual premium equivalent APE unless stated otherwise.

However, our share of the Individual protection 45m 59m market increased in the final quarter of 2008 and we expect to Individual pensions 41m 79m at least hold our market share, having completed the Annuities 26m 27m Investments 8m 51m restructure of our salesforce last year and having strengthened our overall protection proposition.
We will continue to pursue opportunities to broaden our distribution.
NEW BUSINESS PVNBP basis We will seek opportunities to export our strengths in group 2008 954m pensions into our individual pensions proposition, and expect 2007 1,780m to advance in this market over 2009.
We are also evaluating Individual protection 272m 362m how we might enhance our annuity offering to our existing Individual pensions 343m 644m Annuities 265m 273m pensions customers.
We expect levels of savings & investment Investments 74m 501m business to remain modest.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTION FROM NEW BUSINESS KPI Contribution from new business has decreased from 58 million 2008 14m to 14 million, internal rate of return IRR has decreased from 2007 Adjusted 49m 19.2% to 15.4% and cash payback has increased from 7 to 12 2007 58m years.
There are four main drivers.
Firstly, the reduction in sales Individual protection 9m 25m volumes as described above.
Secondly the fact that although Individual pensions 8m 19m expenses are being managed down in line with our end of 2009 Annuities -1m 13m Investments -2m 1m savings targets, sales have fallen more quickly.
Thirdly, the expenses basis change made at the end of 2007 has impacted each of these metrics.
Finally there are special factors impacting KPI annuity margins which are discussed below.
INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN ON NEW BUSINESS 2008 15.4% Individual protection, individual pensions and investments 2007 Adjusted 17.2% financial performance measures have all been driven by the 2007 19.2% above factors.
Persistency assumption changes also impacted Individual protection 8.6% 20.4% protection.
Individual protection premiums in total have Individual pensions 12.6% 16.7% Annuities N A N A increased from 287 million to 289 million.
Investments 2.7% 7.8% The reported contribution from new business for annuities has reduced to a 1 million loss in 2008.
This has arisen because KPI CASH PAYBACK ON NEW BUSINESS of prudent assumptions within our EEV basis.
Economically, 2008 12 years we believe the business is profitable, and the reporting basis 2007 Adjusted 8 years does not change the overall profitability of annuities, merely the 2007 7 years timing of when the profits are recognised.
Individual protection 13 years 6 years Individual pensions 11 years 8 years In pricing annuities we assume that we will obtain future Annuities N A 1year returns on our investments mainly corporate bonds in excess Investments No payback 24 years of the risk-free gilt return.
Our EEV reporting basis however assumes that only a risk-free rate is earned and hence a negative contribution is recorded.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of this assumption, if the basis assumed that 0.5% per annum of the higher expected corporate bond return were due to market illiquidity rather than risk of defaults, the reported contribution would be 13 million higher.
The change in embedded value basis implemented Annuities IRR and cash payback are not applicable in 2008 at the end of 2007 had revised assumptions for persistency and expenses.
In accordance with our because there is no new business strain.
normal practice we have not restated the 2007 figures but we show the impact for comparative purposes.
