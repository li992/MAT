BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Directors remuneration report Part 1 Summary BP executives delivered a strong performance in a turbulent environment during 2008 and restored the groups operations to a high standard after several years of focused effort.
We commend them for a job well done.
Key financial targets for the year were exceeded, even after adjusting for the effect of high oil prices during part of the year.
Safe and reliable operations remained at the top of the agenda and key safety metrics and milestones were achieved.
The years results were especially strong in Exploration and Production, with the start-up of the Thunder Horse platform and excellent overall reserves replacement.
Key targets were also met in Refining and Marketing and both the Texas City and Whiting refineries were safely restored to full capacity by the end of the year.
The annual bonus results, set out in the table opposite, reflect this strong performance and determined leadership.
The committee undertook a detailed review of BPs underlying performance against competitors in determining the 2006-2008 share element vesting under the executive directors incentive plan EDIP.
This review included financial measures such as earnings per share, returns on average capital employed, free cash flow, operating measures for both Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing, and non-financial measures for safety and reputation.
All measures were compared across competitors and showed BP firmly in the pack of the other European oil majors.
The comparison of total shareholder return TSR was less favourable to BP, partly due to exchange rate movements and turbulence in the financial markets.
After careful review, the committee concluded that TSR alone was not a fair reflection of underlying performance over the 2006-2008 period.
We concluded that it was appropriate to approve the vesting of 15% of the shares in the plan for the current directors.
This too is set out in the table opposite.
Salaries were increased mid-2008 after our normal review.
For 2009, we have agreed with the group chief executives view that salaries should be frozen at their current level.
There also will be no change in the target and normal maximum levels of bonus for 2009.
The group chief executives and group chief financial officers bonuses will be based 70% on group performance against key metrics in the annual plan, 15% on safety performance and 15% on people.
The chief executives of Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing will have 50% of their bonuses determined on the above basis and 50% on the performance of their respective businesses.
The EDIP share element will again provide the long-term component of remuneration for the 2009-2011 period, with some slight modifications.
First, reflecting its recent growth, ConocoPhillips will be added to the peer group of comparators currently ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron.
Second, to provide a more balanced assessment, vesting will be based half on BPs total shareholder return relative to the peer group and half on underlying performance compared with this same peer group.
BPs performance will be compared on an interpolated basis relative to the performance of the other five.
As in previous years, shares will vest at 100%, 70% and 35% for performance equivalent to first, second and third rank respectively and none for fourth or fifth.
We remain committed to a remuneration policy and practice that aligns with the long-term interests of shareholders and provides an appropriate reward for talented and committed executives.
In the current volatile climate, executive leadership is more important than ever.
The committee will continue to use careful and rigorous judgement in assessing performance, and to communicate our assessment in a clear way to shareholders.
