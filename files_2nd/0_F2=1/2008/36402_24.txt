60 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of properties, financial instruments and pension assets.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the financial statements.
Management believes that the judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Critical accounting judgements include the classification of tenant leases between financing and operating and the determination of profit taking on development management agreements, the accounting policies for these areas of judgement are set out below.
During 2008, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures: Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing costs: and IFRIC 11: IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and guidance relevant to the Group were in issue: IFRIC 14: IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction: IFRS 8 Operating segments: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements A revised presentation: Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payment: IFRS 3 revised Business combinations: and Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements.
These pronouncements will either result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Rent receivable This comprises rental income and premiums on lease surrenders on investment properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Tenant leases Management have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Lease incentives Lease incentives including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The value of resulting accrued rental income is included within the respective property.
Other property expenses Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specic properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the income statement as other property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Administration expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
Share-based payment The cost of granting share-based payments to employees and directors is recognised within administration expenses in the income statement.
The Group has used the Stochastic model to value the grants which is dependent upon factors including the share price, expected volatility and vesting period and the resulting fair value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market based criteria will not be met.
Investment properties Investment properties, including those under development, are professionally valued each year, on a market value basis, and any surpluses or deficits arising are taken to the income statement.
Disposals of properties are recognised where contracts have been unconditionally exchanged during the accounting period and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the property have been transferred to the purchaser.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 61 1 Accounting policies continued Depreciation No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings over three to five years.
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease.
Development properties Development properties are carried in property, plant and equipment and are professionally valued each year, on a market value basis, and any surpluses arising are taken to the revaluation reserve with any deficits below cost taken to the income statement.
A development property is one purchased for the purposes of development, redevelopment or substantial refurbishment with relatively little, or short-term, income whether planning permission exists or is still to be granted.
All directly attributable costs of bringing a property to a condition suitable for letting are capitalised into the cost of the property.
Once development is concluded, the property is transferred to investment property.
Any cumulative revaluation reserve in respect of that property is transferred to retained earnings.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method: the Group balance sheet contains the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures.
Long-term loans owed to or from the Group by joint ventures are included within investments.
The Groups share of joint ventures profit is included in the Group income statement in a single line.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Pension benefits The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
The full value of the net assets or liabilities of the pension fund is brought on to the balance sheet at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the Group statement of recognised income and expense, all other movements are taken to the income statement.
Capitalisation of interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development and development properties is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site or property for development properties, but does not include the original book cost of investment property under development.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specific associated borrowings.
Financial instruments: i Derivatives The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet.
To the extent that a derivative provides an effective cash flow hedge against the Groups underlying exposure the movements in the fair value of the hedge are taken to equity.
To the extent that the derivative does not effectively hedge the underlying exposure the movement in the fair value of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
ii Borrowings The Groups borrowings in the form of its debentures and bank loans are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount or premium on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently borrowings are held at amortised cost, with any discounts, premiums and attributable costs charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
iv Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Head leases The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
Segmental analysis The Group has only one reportable segment on the basis that all of its revenue is generated from investment properties located in central London: accordingly no segmental analysis is presented.
62 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Development management agreements Where the outcome of a development management agreement can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date.
Management exercise judgement when estimating the percentage complete, this is normally measured as the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed bear to the estimated total contract costs.
Variations in work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the client.
Where the outcome of a development management agreement cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

64 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 6 Tax continued The Group converted to a REIT on 1 January 2007.
From that date, the Group has been exempt from corporation tax in respect of the following: rental profits arising from its property investment business: and chargeable gains arising on the sale of properties from its property investment business, provided that the relevant property is not both: the subject of a development which costs more than 30% of the propertys fair value at the later of 1 January 2007 and the date that it was purchased by the Group: and sold within three years of the completion of the development.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will not be subject to corporation tax, it will have a very low tax charge over the coming years.
The Group has no current intention of selling any development properties that would give rise to a tax charge.
As a REIT, Great Portland Estates plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions of at least 90% of the profits excluding chargeable gains of the Groups property investment business calculated by tax rules rather than accounting rules.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Finance Act 2006.

The Group has a policy of only dealing with credit worthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees as a means of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 11 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversified range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Liquidity risk Responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the Board of Directors which operates a framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding requirements.
Cash flow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversified across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing at the balance sheet date.

It is the risk that future cash flows from a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy either to eliminate interest rate risk over the cash flows on its long-term debt finance through the use of fixed rate debentures or to mitigate the risk through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
It is the Groups policy to maintain the proportion of floating rate interest rate exposure to between 2040% of forecast total interest rate cost.
The Group adopts hedge accounting to mitigate the impact of movements in the fair value of its interest rate swaps, caps and collars in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is considered effective.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 71 14 Financial instruments continued The Group uses interest rate swaps, caps and collars to manage its interest rate risk.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps enable the Group to exchange its floating rate interest payments on its bank debt for fixed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a fixed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate caps Interest rate caps protect the Group from rises in short-term interest rates by making a payment to the Group when the underlying interest rate exceeds a specified rate the cap rate on a notional value.
If the underlying rate exceeds the cap rate, the payment is based upon the difference between the two rates, ensuring the Group only pays the maximum of the cap rate.
Interest rate collars An interest rate collar is an interest rate cap combined with an interest rate floor.
In a floor arrangement if the underlying interest rate falls below a specified rate the floor the Group will make a payment based upon the difference between the underlying rate and the floor.
Therefore an interest rate collar gives the Group certainty that the interest rate it will pay will only fluctuate between the floor and the cap giving certainty that its interest rate exposure can only fluctuate within these restricted parameters.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate derivatives outstanding at 31 March: Average contracted fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % m m m m Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps Between two and five years 5.50% 5.12% 185.0 40.0 3.7 0.7 Interest rate caps Between two and five years 6.00% 6.00% 40.0 40.0 0.1 0.2 Interest rate collars Between two and five years 4.68%6.5% 25.0 0.4 250.0 80.0 4.0 0.9 As at 31 March 2008 the aggregate amount of unrealised losses in respect of cash flow hedges was 3.8 million 2007: 0.7 million.
It is anticipated that floating interest cash flows will continue to arise until the maturity of the debt.
Amounts deferred in equity will be realised in line with these cash flows.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both non-derivative and derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For the floating liabilities the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability at 31 March 2008 was outstanding for the whole year.

Quoted market values have been used to determine the fair value of listed long-term borrowings, and derivatives have been valued by reference to market rates of interest.
The market values of all other items have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at market interest rates.

24 Employee benefits The Group contributes to a defined benefit pension plan the Plan, the assets of which are held by trustees separately from the assets of the Group.
The Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2002.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan was conducted at 1 April 2005 by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The Plan was valued using the following main assumptions: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate 6.50 5.25 Expected return on Plan assets 5.56 5.13 Expected rate of salary increases 4.50 4.00 Future pension increases 3.50 3.00 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
This resulted in the 5.56% assumption.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Plan is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Present value of unfunded obligations 13.9 16.0 Fair value of Plan assets 16.1 15.8 Pension asset liability 2.2 0.2 Amounts recognised as administration expenses in the income statement are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Current service cost 0.2 0.2 Interest on obligation 0.8 0.8 Expected return on Plan assets 0.9 0.8 0.1 0.2 Actuarial gain recognised immediately in the Group statement of recognised income and expense 1.9 Cumulative actuarial gains recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense 4.2 2.3 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 75 24 Employee benefits continued Changes in the present value of the pension obligation are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 April 16.0 15.6 Service cost 0.2 0.2 Interest cost 0.8 0.8 Actuarial loss 2.7 0.2 Benefits paid 0.4 0.4 Defined benefit obligation at 31 March 13.9 16.0 Changes to the fair value of the Plan assets are as follows: Fair value of Plan assets at 1 April 15.8 14.9 Expected return 0.9 0.8 Actuarial loss 0.8 0.2 Contributions 0.6 0.7 Benefits paid 0.4 0.4 Fair value of Plan assets at 31 March 16.1 15.8 Net asset liability 2.2 0.2 The fair value of the Plan assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows: 2008 2007 m m Equities 6.4 6.3 Bonds 9.7 9.5 16.1 15.8 The actual return on Plan assets was 0.1 million 2007: 0.6 million.
