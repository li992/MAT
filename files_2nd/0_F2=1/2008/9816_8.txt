of own brewed beers increased by 5.0%.
Our strategy has been to focus on higher margin cask ale beers with a strong regional consumer franchise and to emphasise provenance.
As a consequence, we have an outstanding range of ales in our portfolio including beers from Marstons, Bankss, Mansfield, Jennings, Ringwood, Brakspear and Wychwood.
We have also increased service and support levels in the free trade and in our commercial relationships with other pub companies.
Examples include continued investment in beer quality technicians to raise beer keeping standards and a business solutions approach to free trade customers.
In 2008 we also launched Ontrader which offers online support similar to that offered to tenants of Marstons Pub Company.
These initiatives contributed to a robust free trade volume performance which, although 4% below last year, was significantly ahead of the market.
