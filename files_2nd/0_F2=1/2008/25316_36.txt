36 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Well financed The J-curve J-curve When we open a new market we incur losses as we conduct the initial 12 to Strong profit growth 18 month pilot-test.
Then, if the pilot is successful, we see increased losses Roll-out phase for a further one to two years as we build up the infrastructure of branches Build branch infrastructure, establish country team and offices, put our country team in place, establish the agent sales force and and agent sales force, and recruit customers recruit customers.
The reason losses increase as we develop in a new market is because we incur the costs of opening new branches.
A good example of this was Romania this year, when we increased our branch infrastructure from 7 to 16 and losses increased from 4.2 million in 2007 to 7.8 million in 2008.
We would then expect losses to reduce as we move to break even and a 12-18 month Break even consistent pattern of strong profit growth thereafter.
Our developing markets pilot begins of Mexico and Romania have both moved out of the pilot phase and are following a similar J-curve pattern.
Our markets on the J-curve Mexico incurred its year of peak start-up losses in 2007, with a much reduced Central Europe loss in 2008 and it is on track to report its maiden profit in 2009.
Our Romanian operation is following a similar trend, with 2008 being the year of peak losses.
We expect much reduced losses in 2009 and remain on course to reach profitability in 2010.
Mexico Established 2003, profit expected 2009 The J-curve pattern happens every time we open a new branch.
We establish the branch office, recruit field managers and then recruit and train agents.
This incurs branch start-up losses and, only once we have done this, can we start recruiting customers, issue loans and start generating revenues.
All in all, it takes around 12 months for a new branch to move into profit.
Russia Romania Pilot established Established 2006, 2008 profit expected 2010 All of IPFs operations have developed organically and their results have also followed a consistent J-curve pattern.
