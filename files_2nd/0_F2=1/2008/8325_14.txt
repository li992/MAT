Case study 67 Case study Key agreements, including an offtake tolling Elecgas 830MW greenfield contract and an Engineering Procurement and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Construction EPC agreement, were also signed in March 2008 and construction is now well CCGT project in Portugal underway, with piling works completed and the foundations for both units laid.
In March 2008, International Power This greenfield development is expected to be fully successfully completed the financing operational in 2011 and will be owned and operated of the new Elecgas 830MW CCGT on a 50:50 basis by International Power and Endesa, project in Portugal.
a leading player in the Iberian electricity market.
The facility will further strengthen International Powers position in the attractive Portuguese market, and add to our long-term contracted earnings stream.
The Elecgas project will be located on a site adjacent to our existing 628MW Pego coal-fired power plant and, as a result, will benefit from shared services such as cooling water infrastructure.
This will not only ensure lower operating costs than a stand-alone plant, but will also promote closer working relationships and knowledge sharing between facilities.
The total project cost is estimated to be E580 million, which is being funded by a mix of debt and equity in an 85:15 ratio.
The plant is being constructed by a consortium of Siemens companies, and labour levels on site reached a peak in December 2008 with nearly 200 people working on the project.
The facility is utilising the latest technology to ensure minimum emissions and will operate using Siemens V94.3A turbines in combined cycle mode with a targeted efficiency rating of 58%.
The entire output of the new plant will be sold to Endesa Generacion S. A. a subsidiary of Endesa, under a 25-year tolling contract.
