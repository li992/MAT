it Rome launched in May 2008 The business models of each are based closely on the UK car insurance operation distribution is through direct telephone and internet channels, and there is significant reinsurance support for each operation The combined operations insured 73,700 vehicles at 31 December 2008 and generated 26m of premium for the year Our strategy As we note above, a key element of the Groups strategy is to take what the Group does well in the UK and use this knowledge to establish profitable, sustainable businesses overseas.
We do not expect to do this quickly and we do not target a set market share or revenue within fixed timeframes.
We expect our new car insurance operations to be relatively small, and loss making in their early years how long will depend on the market, until the new business is established and scale is achieved.
Use of proportional reinsurance across the three markets 65% of risks and expenses are underwritten by Munich Re helps reduce the financial impact in the early years The Group Board has also identified the US and France as further key markets in which it plans to launch.
Current expectation is for a launch in the US sometime in late 2009 or early 2010, and in France some time after that.
Our overseas strategy is summarised in the table below, where we also comment on our progress to date.

Such strong reinsurance support is especially valuable in start up operations, as Munich Re also shares the post-launch expenses incurred.
The contracts are long-term in nature and are designed to run for eight years.
The reinsurer does have the option for an early exit, typically after four years, but not before.
The contracts contain profit commission clauses that allow Admiral to participate in the profitability of the business written by Munich Re, when that business reaches profitability on a cumulative basis.
Non-UK car insurance financial commentary The non-UK operations remain a relatively small part of the overall Group result, with total premium accounting for less than 4% of the Groups total.
Net insurance premium revenue net earned premium amounted to just under 8m.
Balumba: Balumba accounted for the majority of the non-UK volume, contributing 80% of the total premium and 75% of the insured vehicles.
Its net insurance premium revenue totalled 7.0m.
The key focus at Balumba during 2008 was improving the loss ratio, and whilst significant progress has been made in this area, management recognise that more improvement is needed.
The rate of growth has been deliberately slowed whilst work continues in this area.
Balumba loss ratio development Underwriting year 2007 2008 After 12 months 137% 102% After 24 months 135% - Numerous measures have been implemented to address the loss ratio, including: Rating increases Improvements to the claims function including resourcing, enhancing the garage network Underwriting control improvements Joining the Spanish knock for knock claims system
