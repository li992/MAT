STRATEGY PayPoint aims to create economic value for its shareholders by profitable expansion in:  Cash payments bill and general payments, mobile top-ups and ATMs :  New payment technologies internet payments, mobile functionality and solutions, debit and credit card payments, ticketing, on line verification : and  International markets in cash payments and new payment technologies Cash payments PayPoint aims to continue to grow profits, market share and enhance its competitive positioning through generating greater economies of scale from a central infrastructure that has a substantially fixed cost.
Fundamental to this proposition is the fact that marginal revenue is transaction driven, but that marginal costs are largely driven by retail agent numbers.
As a result, the strategy focuses on optimizing the combination of retail agent numbers and transaction volumes.
The key strategic objectives focus on growing the retail agent network penetration and coverage, increasing transaction volumes of existing services, improving the range of payments provided by the PayPoint terminal and enhancing customer convenience.
Specifically, PayPoint plans to:  selectively extend coverage to prospective retail agents and continually optimize the retail agent network, facilitated by the use of the PayPoint terminal which allows PayPoint to target agents currently using inferior solutions:  work with clients to increase PayPoints share of their volumes, notably in the light of closures by the Post Office:  add new clients in existing and new sectors to increase the range of payments that can be made by consumers: and  continue to improve service quality to maintain and extend competitive differentiation by investing in technology solutions.
New payment technologies PayPoints existing skills in transaction processing, retail and client management, and developing technology to create new propositions can be leveraged in new payment technologies which complement the existing cash payment business and allow us to offer clients a broader range of services to meet their needs.
International PayPoint has identified key markets overseas which provide opportunities to leverage its existing business capability to roll out cash payment services and, in time, new payment technologies into new geographic locations.
