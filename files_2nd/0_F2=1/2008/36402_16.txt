Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying Directors interests nature have not been noted.
The Companies Act 2006 sets out directors general duties.
Articles which duplicate statutory provisions The provisions largely codify the existing law, but with some Provisions in the current articles which reflect provisions contained changes.
Under the Companies Act 2006, from 1 October 2008, in the Companies Act 1985 are, in the main, amended to bring them a director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct into line with the equivalent provisions contained in the Companies or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Act 2006.
Examples of such provisions, including provisions relating Companys interests.
The requirement is very broad and could apply, to proxies and to convening and notice of general meetings, are for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or detailed below.
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential Convening and notice of general meetings conflicts where the articles of association contain a provision to this It is proposed that the provisions in the current articles dealing with effect.
The Companies Act 2006 also allows the articles of association convening of general meetings and the length of notice required to to contain other provisions for dealing with directors conflicts of convene general meetings be amended to conform to the new interest to avoid a breach of duty.
The new articles, as proposed to provisions in the Companies Act 2006.
In particular, a general be revised with effect on and from 1 October 2008, give the directors meeting other than an Annual General Meeting to consider authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions a special resolution can be convened on 14 days notice whereas to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the previously 21 days notice was required.
Quorum requirements There are safeguards which will apply when directors decide whether The Companies Act 2006 provides that in general terms the quorum to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
These include, firstly, for a general meeting be calculated by reference to the numbers of only independent directors i. e. those who have no interest in the qualifying persons who are present at the meeting, which includes matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision, an individual who is a member of the Company, a person authorised and, secondly, in taking the decision the directors must act in a under section 323 of the Companies Act 2006 to act as the way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the representative of a corporation, and a person appointed as proxy Companys success.
The directors will be able to impose limits or of a member.

These provisions will A proxy has a statutory right under the Companies Act 2006 to speak only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has at any general meeting.

Multiple proxies It is the Boards intention to report annually on the Companys may be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share procedures for ensuring that the Boards powers of authorisation held by the shareholder.
The new articles reflect these new rules, of conflicts are operated effectively and that the procedures have as appropriate.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Report of the directors 45 Directors indemnities The Companies Act 2006 has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of a company to indemnify directors.
In particular, the Companies Act 2006 has clarified that a company can now indemnify a director of a company that is a trustee of an occupational pension scheme against liability incurred in connection with the companys activities as trustee of that scheme.
This is reflected in the new articles.
The opportunity is also being taken to clarify that, subject to the Companies Act 2006, the Company may grant indemnities to directors of associated companies.
Electronic and web communications Provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which came into force in January 2007 enable companies to communicate with shareholders by electronic and or website communications.
The new articles will allow communications with shareholders in electronic form and, in addition, they also permit the Company to take advantage of the new provisions relating to website communications.
However, before the Company can communicate with a shareholder by means of website communication, the relevant shareholder must be asked individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send or supply documents or information to him by means of a website, and the Company must either have received a positive response or have received no response within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the request was sent.
The Company will notify the shareholder either in writing, or by other permitted means when a relevant document or information is placed on the website and a shareholder can always request a hard copy version of the document or information.
