South West Water published its 25 year view of future aims in December 2007 in its Strategic Direction Statement.
This is based on the themes of Pure Water, Pure Service and Pure Environment.
The development of the draft Business Plan for submission by August 2008 is a key activity.
It is supported by extensive studies, analysis and preparation of the many sub-components of the Periodic Review.

statutory obligations on South West Water with regard to, amongst other things, the quantity of water abstracted and the quality and quantity of waste water discharged.
Examples of relevant EU Directives include the Drinking Water Directive, the Habitats Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and the recently updated Bathing Water Directive.
The Water Framework Directive was incorporated into UK law in 2003.
It provides a framework for the protection of and improvement in the quality of water resources, together with the promotion of sustainable water consumption.
To comply with the Water Framework Directive, member states will have to achieve the challenging target of good status for groundwater, rivers, estuarine waters and coastal waters, in three six-year cycles, the first running from 2009 to 2015.
From preliminary findings published by the Environment Agency in March 2008, the expected programmes of measures resulting from the Water Framework Regulations are unlikely to be significant for South West Waters assets at least until 2015, following the successful delivery of a wide range of environmental improvements by the company since 1989.
