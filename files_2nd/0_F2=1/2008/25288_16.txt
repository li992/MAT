Initially ICG assesses whether the opportunity meets ICGs investment criteria.
The deal team will present to the Investment Committee details of pricing, leverage and structure together with the commercial background to the Company.
The Investment Committee will guide the team regarding the focus for due diligence, structure and pricing.

This covers the management, the market, financial and legal review, sustainability and environmental and corporate social responsibility issues.
The due diligence is focused on ensuring the safety of principal and interest and assessing the future value of the equity.
At the conclusion of the due diligence process, a further Investment Committee meeting is held to discuss final structure and pricing at which unanimous approval is required before an investment is made.

Rights Issue In February 2008 ICG completed a two for nine ordinary shares Rights Issue at an Issue Price of 11.5p per ordinary share representing a discount of 27.7 per cent to the closing middle market price per ordinary share on 9 January 2008.
This raised 175m and 15,669,382 new shares were issued.
The number of 20p ordinary shares in issue at the year end amounted to 86,219,156.

Share capital and rights attaching to the Companys shares Under the Companys Articles of Association, any share in the Company may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, transfer, return of capital or otherwise as the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution determine or, in the absence of any such determination, as the Board may determine.
At a general meeting of the Company every member present in person and or as a duly appointed proxy has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll one vote for each share held.
The notice of general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights either by proxy or present in person in relation to resolutions to be passed at a general meeting.
No shareholder is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting or to exercise any other right conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person with an interest in shares has been sent a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 which confers upon public companies the power to require information with respect to interests in their voting shares and he or any interested person failed to supply the Company with the information requested within 14 days after delivery of that notice.
The Board may also decide that no dividend is payable in respect of those default shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be registered.
These restrictions end seven days after receipt by the Company of a notice of an approved transfer of the shares or all the information required by the relevant section 793 notice, whichever is the earlier.
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share, although such discretion may not be exercised in a way which the Financial Services Authority regards as preventing dealings in the shares of the relevant class or classes from taking place on an open and proper basis.
The Directors may likewise refuse to register any transfer of a share in favour of more than four persons jointly.
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than: certain restrictions that may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations for example, insider trading laws : and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain employees of the Company require approval of the Company to deal in the Companys shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Powers of Directors The Companys Articles of Association give power to the Board to appoint Directors, but require Directors to submit themselves for election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and for re election where they have been a Director at each of the preceding two Annual General Meetings and were not appointed or reappointed by the Company at, or since, either such meeting.
Subject to its Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association and relevant statutory law and to such direction as may be given by the Company by special resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the Board, who may exercise all powers of the Company whether relating to the management of the business or not.

References to the 2006 Act are to the Companies Act 2006.

Report of the Remuneration Committee Resolution 2 The Directors are required to seek approval of the shareholders for the Report of the Remuneration Committee.

Re election of Directors Resolution 8 Tom Attwood is retiring by rotation under the Articles of Association of the Company and will be standing for re-election.
Special business Resolutions 9 and 10 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and resolutions 11, 12 and 13 will be proposed as special resolutions.
To pass special resolutions 75 per cent or more of the votes cast must be in favour.
50 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial Accounts Resolution 9 The Company is proposing to increase its authorised share capital by one third from its current level of 18,000,000 to 24,000,000 by the creation of an additional 30,000,000 ordinary shares of 20p each identical to and ranking pari passu with the existing ordinary shares of 20p each in the capital of the Company.
Authority to allot shares Resolutions 10 and 11 The Companys Articles of Association give the Directors general authority to allot or issue unissued shares.
The Companies Act 1985 limits that power by requiring shareholders to give specific prior approval.
At the 2007 AGM, the Directors were given authority to allot ordinary shares and Resolution 10 seeks to renew this authority for a period until the date of the AGM to be held in July 2009.
The authority is limited to a maximum of 28,739,718 shares being approximately one third of the ordinary issued share capital as at 31 March 2008.
If the Directors wish to allot unissued shares for cash, the Companies Act 1985 requires that these shares are offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.
This is known as shareholders pre emption rights.
There may be occasions, however, when, in order to act in the best interests of the Company, the Directors need flexibility to finance business opportunities as they arise without offering securities on a pre emptive basis.
Resolution 11 asks shareholders to renew the Directors authority to allot shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of 862,192 otherwise than in connection with a rights issue or share scheme equivalent to approximately 5 per cent of the ordinary issued share capital as at 31 March 2008 without the shares being offered first to existing shareholders.
The Directors intend that the authorisation conferred by Resolution 10 and Resolution 11 may be used for purposes of equity fundraising or other forms of fundraising during the year 2008 09.
Resolution 12 The Company may buy its own shares with the authority of shareholders.
Resolution 12 seeks to renew the current authority given at the 2007 AGM.
The resolution specifies the maximum number of shares that may be purchased approximately 15 per cent of the Companys issued share capital and the highest and lowest prices at which they may be bought.
Any shares purchased under this authority will either be treated as cancelled or held as treasury shares.
Listed companies, with authorisation from shareholders, may buy and hold their own shares instead of cancelling them immediately.
Shares held as treasury shares can in the future be cancelled, resold or used to provide shares for employee share schemes.
For information, as at 31 March 2008, there were 3,379,486 options outstanding over the Companys shares representing 3.9 per cent of the issued share capital.
If the full authority to buy shares is used, these options will represent 4.6 per cent of the then issued share capital of the Company.
The authority given at the last AGM expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
Resolution 13 During the last year, a number of sections of the 2006 Act have come into force which affect the constitutional documents of UK listed public companies.
Given the number of amendments to be made in connection with this, the Directors consider it prudent to adopt new Articles of Association in order to comply with this new legislation.
An explanation of the changes made to the existing Articles of Association is set out below.
The 2006 Act is being implemented in phases with a further phase expected to come into force on 1 October 2008.
It is proposed therefore that the revision marked 1.7 to the Articles proposed to be adopted under Resolution 13 comes into force with effect on and from 12.01am 1 October 2008, the date upon which Section 175 of the 2006 Act shall be brought into force, to cater for changes being introduced by the 2006 Act relating to Directors conflicts of interest.
An explanation of this change is set out below.
Directors interests Section 175 of the 2006 Act sets out Directors general duties.
The provisions largely codify the existing law, but with some changes.
Under the 2006 Act, a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Companys interests.
The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a Director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
The 2006 Act allows Directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where the Articles of Association contain a provision to this effect.
The 2006 Act also allows the Articles of Association to contain other provisions for dealing with Directors conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
Article 132, which is proposed to come into force with effect on and from 12.01am on 1 October 2008, gives the Directors authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position.
There are safeguards which will apply when Directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
These include, first, only independent Directors i. e. those who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision, and second, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Companys success.
The Directors will be able to impose limits Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 51 Financial Accounts Directors Report continued or conditions when giving authorisation or subsequently if they think this is appropriate.
It is proposed to include provisions relating to confidential information, attendance at Board meetings and availability of Board papers to protect a Director being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises.
These provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been authorised by the Directors.
Summary of material changes contained in the proposed new Articles of Association of the Company The principal changes which your Board recommends be made to the Companys existing Articles of Association are set out below.
Unless otherwise stated, references to article numbers refer to articles in the proposed new articles.
1.1 General: The concept of an extraordinary resolution no longer exists under the 2006 Act and is replaced by special resolution, so the word extraordinary is proposed to be replaced with special or deleted throughout the articles.
1.2 G eneral: References to statutory provisions in the Companies Act 1985 which have now been replaced by corresponding provisions in the 2006 Act are proposed to be amended.
1.3 G eneral: Since certain provisions of both the Companies Act 1985 and the 2006 Act are presently in force, the words the Act is proposed to be replaced with the Statutes or deleted throughout the articles.
1.4 Article 2.1: The addition of 2006 Act to the definition of the Statutes is proposed to enable reference to corresponding provisions in the 2006 Act that have come into effect.
1.5 Former Article 4: With effect from 1 October 2008, the 2006 Act abolishes the current requirement for a company to have and state its authorised share capital in its articles, so we would propose to delete this article.
1.6 Article 10.1: We would propose to redraft this article to bring in more clarity of meaning and to avoid duplication of words.
1.7 F ormer Article 35: With effect from 1 October 2008, the 2006 Act removes the power of companies to close the register, so we would propose to delete this article.
The Company can nonetheless, close the register in accordance with section 358 of the 1985 Act until it is repealed, despite the removal of this article.
1.8 A rticle 46: This amendment is proposed to conform with the exact wording of section 630 variation of class rights of the 2006 Act, applicable as of 1 October 2008.

1.10 Article 52: The 2006 Act abolishes the current requirement for a company to provide 21 days notice to members for passing of special resolutions at general meetings.
Section 307 of the 2006 Act provides that only annual general meetings of the company require 21 clear days notice and all other meetings, regardless of whether a special resolution is to be put, require 14 clear days notice.
We would propose to amend this article accordingly.
1.11 Article 53: This amendment is proposed to expand the wording to track more closely the wording of section 313 of the 2006 Act.
1.12 Article 62: We would propose to redraft this article so that it follows the wording of section 321 right to demand a poll of the 2006 Act more closely, by referring more accurately to the particular resolution rather than generally to the meeting.
1.13 Article 67: Traditionally, articles have contained provisions limiting show of hands voting only to those present in person, and the Companies Act 1985 provided that a proxy can only vote on a poll.
The 2006 Act provides that show of hands voting may now be done not only by members voting in person present at the meeting, but also by duly appointed proxies present at the meeting.
1.14 Former Article 68: The 2006 Act removes the possibility for the Chairmans casting vote at general meetings, so we would propose to delete this article.
1.15 Article 69: A further change has been made by the 2006 Act to improve the rights of proxies, who may now speak at meetings as well as being entitled to attend and vote.
52 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial Accounts 1.16 Article 71: We would propose to make minor changes in this article to reflect the 2006 Act.
1.17 Article 75: We would suggest the amendment of this article to reflect the 2006 Act.

1.20 A rticle 122: This proposed amendment to this article has been inserted to facilitate administration of the Companys affairs.
1.21 Article 126: We would propose to make minor changes in this article to reflect the 2006 Act and market practice.
1.22 N ew Article 132: Section 175 of the 2006 Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts of interest where the articles contain a provision to this effect.
We would propose to insert this new article accordingly, to be effective on and from 12.01am on 1 October 2008.
1.23 Article 134: We would propose to make minor changes in this article to reflect the wording of the 2006 Act.
1.24 Article 155: In order to provide maximum flexibility to the Company, we propose to amend the article so that any agreement or specification by joint holders can be by any of them, with a backup flexibility by stating that this is unless the directors require it to be agreed or specified by all joint holders or by the first named on the register.
