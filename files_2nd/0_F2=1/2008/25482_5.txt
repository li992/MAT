2008 Investec Annual Report 37 Divisional review Private Banking Partner of choice from wealth creation to wealth management Overview and financial analysis Operating profit increased by 7.8% to 166.4 million, contributing 33.3% to group profit.
The division has benefited from increased distribution and greater penetration across all areas of specialisation.
Key earnings drivers: - Core loans and advances increased by 29.9% to 8.9 billion.
- The deposit book increased by 18.8% to 6.6 billion.
- Funds under advice increased by 45.4% to 3.7 billion.
The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: The solid increase in net interest income has been driven by: - Strong growth in loans and advances and deposits see below.
- A strong increase in arrangement and exit fees associated with an increase in lending turnover of 30.9%.
The impact of IAS 18 has resulted in a cumulative R640 million 2007: R506 million of lending fees in the South African business being deferred for future recognition.
Net fees and commissions receivable reflects moderate growth in the South African Structured Property Finance specialisation offset by a reduced contribution from the Australian and European businesses.
The Private Wealth Management and General Banking businesses showed strong growth in all three geographies.
Principal transactions include the revaluations and realisations of equity and warrant positions held these are associated with our lending activities and the manner in which certain of our deals are structured.
The increase in principal transactions reflects the growing maturity of the Growth and Acquisition Finance business in all three geographies.
Impairment losses on loans and advances have increased in all three geographies as a result of the weakened credit environment.
The increase in expenses is mainly as a result of an increase in average headcount, investment in infrastructure and the acquisition of Experien in Australia.

In response to this we have adjusted our appetite for credit risk to be defensive but at the same time nimble and agile in relation to opportunities.
The Growth and Acquisition Finance business has performed strongly, realising substantial profits through the exit of existing investments.
The portfolio of new deals grew during the year.
The skills, brand and market positioning of the team are poised to extract value from current conditions.
The Private Wealth Management business has achieved a healthy degree of scale and made a meaningful contribution to net profit.
Both the advisory and special opportunities units made significant gains throughout the year.
Funds under advice grew well ahead of target and the size of new portfolios taken on continues to increase.
In the General Banking space, progress was made in a number of initiatives: - The Private Client Lending business made good progress into the high net worth mortgage arena.
Product innovation through multi-currency lending and design features aimed at big city earners received good coverage.
- The deposit raising teams performed extraordinarily in tough market conditions.
We expanded our activities into Jersey and bolstered distribution capacity and product development in all jurisdictions.
2008 Investec Annual Report 41 Divisional review Private Banking Partner of choice from wealth creation to wealth management The Specialised Lending team has successfully deepened its penetration in the current year in the strategic shareholder and funds finance space.
The sports finance business is now well positioned in the market with an established client base and good repeat business.
The Trust company has established itself as one of the premier independent but bank owned players in the fiduciary world.
The business was recognised by the industry body, STEP, as the institutional trust company of the year in 2007.
Southern Africa Structured Property Finance has benefited from improved distribution capacity, together with a continued focus on client-led initiatives.
These have shifted strongly from residential to retail, commercial and industrial.
Growth and Acquisition Finance activities continue with a strong emphasis on black economic empowerment.
New investments continue to exceed exits and realisations, which should underpin continuing momentum.
Private Wealth Management continues to grow funds under advice.
Differentiating features are our international reach and delivery of special opportunities.
The General Banking area has significantly increased its client qualifying criteria, allowing a much stronger client focus, and continued success in liability raising.
Australia On 1 October 2007 we concluded the acquisition of Experien, a professional lending business, which adds strategic diversification, increased distribution capability and an expanded client network to the current platform.
The acquisition provided an increase in the loan book of approximately A$700 million.
Structured Property Finance has experienced flat growth year on year impacted by a slowing of property markets in the second half.
The core focus has been on strong portfolio management, attracting and maintaining quality clients and building a stronger brand in regional locations.
We enhanced our revenue capability and lending diversification with the establishment of Specialised Lending, which focuses on providing sophisticated lending solutions to a target client base of high net worth individuals, families and high income earning executives.
We continue to build the private client treasury book through strategic focus and team expansion within identified markets which resulted in a significant increase in both client numbers and book growth.
During the early part of the financial year, the Growth and Acquisition Finance team exited several deals as the environment was conducive to realisations at optimum values.
The existing portfolio continues to maintain a steady growth in value.
Outlook, risks and uncertainties The outlook for the forthcoming twelve months is tempered as the markets navigate through the credit crunch and its impact on the broader economy.
This could have a meaningful impact on pipelines and exits across all jurisdictions.
These conditions could present opportunities which the business and its clients are well placed to take advantage of.
This, combined with the well diversified earnings stream will mitigate, to some extent, the effects of the broader market environment.

The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: The South African Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking business has benefited from higher asset levels and increased volumes.
Alternative products launched in the previous financial year also gained traction and asset swap activity increased as local market volatility led clients to diversify portfolios.
