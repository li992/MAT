INVESTING IN A GROWTH MARKET OUR COMPETITORS AND THE INVESTMENT MARKET Londons growth creates a demand for all types of space, particularly in improving areas where we are well represented.
Workspace Group PLC 14 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Neil House, E1 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 15 OUR COMPETITORS AND THE INVESTMENT MARKET The property investment market and our relative performance The last financial year has been remarkable for the change in sentiment that has taken place within the property investment market.
After a long period of stability and positive returns, the market turned from mid 2007.
IPD, the industry benchmark, has recorded annual All Property Total Returns for the year to March 2008 of -8.5%, caused by a 12.5% fall in value.
The Group has inevitably been impacted, with the value of the portfolio falling by 4.6%.
In relative terms, however, the Group has once again substantially outperformed the sector as a whole.
The main contributor to the outperformance this year has been the growth in rent up 8.7% and in particular rental values up 12.2%.
This growth in rental values has been widely spread across the Patrick Marples, Property Director portfolio, in both our business centres and industrial estates, as Pictured on Brick Lane, E1 illustrated below.
Rental growth has been particularly strong in our Inner London portfolio, particularly around Clerkenwell, where we have been able to achieve record rents.
Industrial estates in Inner London also benefited from strong demand, allowing the Group to achieve higher rents as units became available.
We are seeing many competing industrial estates being redeveloped for other uses.
