Chair mans Statement c ontinued PEOPLE The success of the Group is due to the talent and dedication of colleagues around the world.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend my gratitude and appreciation for their continuing support.
OUTLOOK We enter the new year with healthy order books for our CB businesses.
Despite the temporary disruption from Hurricane Ike, our AEP businesses started with similar sales levels to the end of last year.
There has been a limited initial impact on us from the global financial crisis but we are of course alert to the wider economic effects that are generally expected.
These are more likely to be seen in industrial markets although the niche nature of our businesses and the diversity of our markets provide additional strength and resilience.
The energy markets remain buoyant with a positive outlook, particularly for coal, notwithstanding the recent reduction in the prices of commodities.
The majority of our products and services are consumable supplies and are therefore driven by usage rather than the price of commodities.
Accordingly the output for these remains robust.
Despite the inevitable challenges, we believe we are very strongly placed to out-perform.
For the longer term, our business drivers remain highly positive.
