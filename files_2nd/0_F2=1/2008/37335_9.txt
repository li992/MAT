Absolute sales growth is the single most useful market indicator for our business as it includes the effect of retailers increasing oorspace to win greater market share.
This year absolute retail sales showed positive growth of 5.4% as reported by the Of ce of National Statistics ONS.
This is not the whole story, however.
Pressure on margins has reduced pro tability for many retailers and there has been an increase in insolvencies across the market as a consequence.
Our strong leasing performance in the portfolio and in the development programme has helped to mitigate the effects of White Rose, Leeds a weaker occupational market.
Successful rent reviews at shopping centres such 2008 will see a peak of completions of new shopping centre developments across the UK.
This has as White Rose helped drive up like-for-like rental sharpened competition between providers, with many retailers being offered greater incentives to take income by 5.5%.
However, well-conceived developments are attracting good levels of demand as no retail business can afford to stand still.
Retailers of all sizes know they can work with companies such as Land Securities to enhance their performance through range and format changes, new locations and greater ef ciency.
Our challenge is to be as dynamic as the most successful retailers and that means evolving our portfolio Chart 24 to ensure we provide good space at good rates in the right locations.
Retail Portfolio by value 6.2bn Looking long-term, there will always be winners and losers in the retail sector and internet retailing is certainly a erce competitor for some shops but in our experience people are drawn by the immediacy and experience they get by going shopping.

2 Our leasing and asset management activity has helped us to perform well against key portfolio metrics.
Rent review programmes, particularly at the White Rose Centre in Leeds, drove our like-for-like rental income 0 up by 5.5%.
Asset management activity has helped to create rental value growth of 2.0% in a generally at market, and our strong leasing performance on the investment properties with some 19m of rent secured -2 has enabled us to keep voids at 4.0% across the like-for-like portfolio.

Land Securities Annual Report 2008 Report of the Directors Business review continued 27 Sales The timing of our sales was critical this year.
We had anticipated more challenging conditions early and decided to make no major acquisitions during this financial year.
Instead, we focused on disposals and achieved total sales of 834.8m at 3.1% above valuation.
Important sales this year included: Whitefriars, Canterbury We sold our award-winning shopping centre to Henderson Global Investors and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for 253m, achieving a good return on an investment we completed in 2005.
East Kilbride Shopping Centre The Scottish Retail Property Limited Partnership, our joint venture with British Land Plc, completed a 385m sale of this asset in June 2007.
Victoria Place, SW1 In January 2008 the Metro Shopping Fund LP, our joint venture with Delancey, sold Victoria Place shopping centre, SW1, to Ewart Properties Ltd for 92.5m.
The good price achieved re ects the value we have added to the asset and the surrounding environment.
Coppergate, York In March 2008 we completed the sale of this shopping centre for 42.5m.
Retail warehouses We completed the sale of eight retail warehouse assets for 130m and sold four supermarket assets for more than 125m.
Asset management We maximise rental income from our portfolio through asset management.
This involves us in making long-term improvements to the environment, to services and to the tenant mix.
Rental growth is the reward for our investment in these improvements.
Our approach to our biggest asset the White Rose Centre in Leeds demonstrates the value of our expertise.
Our successful rent review programme coincided with the opening of a new store for Marks & Spencer.
This follows the development of new space for Next, Zara and River Island in 2006.
This enabled us to settle the major round of rent reviews, at an average increase in rent of 40% over the five-year period since the previous reviews.
We also achieved new lettings at even higher levels, further underpinning the success of the centre.
We are working with Hammerson to transform Bristol City centre New of ces into one of the UKs top ten retail and leisure destinations.
Due for House of Fraser Ring road to M32 & M4 completion in autumn 2008, this development will feature restaurants, shops, open spaces and 250 new homes with a breathtaking glass shell-shaped roof covering much of the scheme.

The scheme demonstrates our ability to integrate a new development into an historic city centre, drawing more shoppers from a wider catchment area into the city.
Christs Lane, Cambridge We achieved very strong pre-lettings for this distinctive retail-led scheme of eight shops, a restaurant and 15 apartments.
The retail element opened in December 2007 and is 100% let.
The Christs Lane project sits in a sensitive location within a conservation area between two Cambridge colleges, Christs and Emmanuel.
Our development re-established one of the citys historic streets to create a new, busy retail thoroughfare.
Corby This year we completed the dev elopment of a new mall to complement our existing holdings within the town centre.
The quality of new tenants including Primark, River Island, Jane Norman and Dorothy Perkins has exceeded our original expectations and signi cantly improved the attractiveness of the Whitefriars, Canterbury town as a shopping destination.
By oor area, the scheme is now 85% let.
We achieved a 253m sale this year, generating a good return on our investment in this mixed-use development.

Initially, we contributed a Sainsburys supermarket in our ownership while Sainsburys contributed two freehold stores.
In December we increased the portfolio with the purchase of the Maltings shopping centre in 2 Salisbury for 27.5m.
This 8,830m property includes a Sainsburys store, 27 retail units and a car park.
Our outlook Our experience is that UK retail sales growth is relatively resilient through the economic cycle, but we recognise that the current trading environment is proving challenging for retailers.
The quality and mix of our tenants is excellent, and this will help to reduce and diversify risk if demand from occupiers weakens over the next 12 months.
Our cash ow will continue to be helped by the UKs system of long leases with upward-only rent reviews and also by the reversionary nature of our portfolio.
In the meantime, strong relationships with retailers are enabling us to make sound progress on leasing our developments and we will continue to provide space that meets retailers need for ef ciency and quality.
We have a range of upgrade and development opportunities within our own portfolio and we Christs Lane, Cambridge will focus on bringing a number of these projects forward for delivery over the coming years.
By re-establishing a historic and vibrant thoroughfare we created strong tenant interest, with the retail element 100% let on opening.
