Improved productivity at Ulan Underground in New South Wales, Australia, contributed to the 15% increase in saleable production during 2008 by the Australian thermal coal operations 50 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2008 Coking Coal Markets Coking coal markets experienced significant uctuations in supply and demand throughout 2008.
The first half experienced unprecedented customer demand for available tonnes, following the extreme ooding events in Queensland during the first quarter which severely restricted the availability of prime hard coking coal and reduced Australian coking coal export supply in the first half by 6 million tonnes.
Steel producers looked to US suppliers to cover the supply shortfall, lifting US exports by 9 million tonnes over the full year.
In stark contrast, the second half of 2008 saw the steel and manufacturing industries signicantly impacted by the sudden global financial liquidity crisis, resulting in reduced customer demand for all grades of metallurgical coal.
Full year 2008 data indicates global steel production in coking coal importing countries grew by only 1% over 2007, leading to increased coking coal demand of 8 million tonnes.
Australian and Canadian metallurgical coal exports were marginally below 2007 levels.
In April, term prices of $300 per tonne were agreed with customers for prime hard coking coals for the year ending March 2009 by the leading producer.
This settlement represented an increase of $202 per tonne 206% over the previous year, and in some cases includes the cancellation of some of the carry over arising from the oods in Queensland in early 2008.
With the exception of Xstrata, all other hard coking coal suppliers subsequently settled at an equivalent price level.
Xstrata concluded its 2008 price negotiations with term customers while simultaneously developing a new customer base largely within the rapidly expanding Indian steel industry.
For the contract year commencing April 2008, the average contract price for prime hard coking coal agreed was $360 per tonne.
Asian steel mills and Australian coal producers settled prices for NSW high volatile semi-soft coking coals at approximately $240 per tonne, which applies for the contract year commencing 1 April 2008 representing an increase of 276% over last years term price of $63.90 for Xstrata brands.
Term and annual contracts account for in excess of 70% of Xstratas hard coking coal and semi-soft coking coal sales.
Xstratas hard coking coal is sold into each major market while Japan remains the dominant market for semi-soft coking coal.
Outlook The coking coal market in 2009 is expected to remain heavily affected by the global economic downturn.
In response to low prices, approximately 24 million tonnes of coking coal production curtailments have been announced for 2009 representing approximately 13% of planned production levels prior to the economic downturn in the second half of 2008.
However, until steel consumption begins to recover, all metallurgical coal grades will continue to be in oversupply, although the declining value of the Australian dollar will provide Xstrata with some cost offset to declining prices.
