13 Annual General Meeting In addition to resolutions to adopt the accounts, declare a final dividend, approve the Directors remuneration report, re-elect Directors and reappoint the auditors, four further resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The first is to give the Directors general power to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 224,058 equal to approximately 33.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority, which will lapse at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, but retain the authority to do so.
The second is to disapply the statutory rights of pre-emption contained in section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to rights issues and issues for cash not exceeding 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power which will terminate at the 2009 Annual General Meeting.
The third resolution will renew an existing authority which gives the Company power to purchase its own shares within limits as to number of shares and price.
The Directors will only exercise the authority if they are satisfied that any purchase will increase the earnings per share of the Ordinary share capital in issue and will be in the interests of the shareholders.
Options over 460,699 Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company were outstanding as at 23 June 2008 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report representing 0.7% of the issued share capital of the Company as at that date.
If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under the proposed resolution, the options outstanding as at 23 June 2008 would represent 0.8% of the Ordinary share capital in issue following such exercise.
The fourth resolution is to adopt new Articles of Association to generally update the Companys constitution and to bring it into line with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
