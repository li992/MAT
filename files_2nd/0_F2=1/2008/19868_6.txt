UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 9 Managers Review Continued Property Portfolio Through a combination of asset management activity and sales as outlined above, the company has made significant progress towards its strategic aim of reducing the structural risk and flattening out the percentage of income subject to expiry in 2012 2014 from 28.19% of ERV in December 2007 to 20.33% of ERV in December 2008.
Whilst the average lease length is well above that of the industry, 11 years against the IPD Benchmark of 9.8 years, there is still the capacity to improve the profile further.
Discussions continue on a number of fronts in an effort to extend further the average lease length of the portfolio.
Covenant strength remains a key attribute of the portfolio and, notwithstanding the increasing risk of tenant default in the market, only one tenant has gone into administrative receivership involving a rent of 113,562 - approximately 0.22% of the portfolios rental income as at 27 March 2009.
In addition to the above, the current level of bad debts within The Parade, Swindon, SN1 1BB the portfolio remains extremely low 0.004% of the total rental income.

There are currently no other development projects or major refurbishment projects planned.
The Company has also been successful in retaining income via lease renewal activity.
Over 2008, nine leases were renewed out of a total of eighteen tenant negotiations.
The total passing rent for all lease renewals was 1.075m being broadly in line with ERV.
The retention and improvement of this income stream continues to be at the heart of the Companys policy for the portfolio.
A notable example of this policy during the 2008 was the regear of the lease of an 85,000 sq ft office building at 5-7 Chancery Lane, London.
Negotiations with the tenant resulted in an extension of the lease term by a further 5 years and a revised rent of 3.4m from a passing rent of 2.57m.
The resultant impact of letting and asset management activity has been to move the average lease length in the portfolio from 10 years and eight months to 11 years since December 2007.
