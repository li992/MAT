A N N U A L F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S for the year ended 31 December DIRECTORS REPORT The directors have pleasure in submitting their report on the annual financial statements of the Group and the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008.
In the context of the financial statements, the term Group refers to the Company, its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The directors are of the opinion that stakeholder interests are best served by separately presenting the Groups annual financial statements from those of the Company.
The latter financial statements appear on pages 234 to 239.
FINANCIAL RESULTS AND NATURE OF BUSINESS The financial statements fully set out the financial results of the Company and the Group.
The Company is the holding company of the Group.
The nature of the Groups business is described in the scope at the front of this Business Report.
LISTINGS The abbreviated name under which the Company is listed on the JSE Limited JSE is AngloPlat and the Companys JSE Clearing House Code is AMS for the ordinary shares and AMSP for the preference shares.
The Company, which is the sole listed entity for the Group, also has a secondary listing on The Stock Exchange, London.
International Depositary Receipts in respect of the Companys shares are listed on the Brussels Bourse.
These depositary receipts are issued by SOGS DEWAAY, the issuing company of Bank Brussels Lambert SA.
COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The Groups and the Companys annual financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards, as well as South African Statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, the South African Companies Act and the JSEs Listings Requirements.
REPORTING IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS For the convenience of users, the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the Group have been translated into United States dollars on pages179 to 181.
ORDINARY DIVIDENDS The Companys dividend policy is to consider an interim and a final dividend in respect of each financial year.
At its discretion, the Board may consider a special dividend where appropriate.
Interim dividend On Friday, 25 July 2008, the Board declared an interim cash dividend number 111 of 3,500 cents per ordinary share 2007: 2,900 cents to shareholders reflected in the register of the Company on Friday, 22 August 2008.
This dividend was paid on Monday, 25 August 2008.
ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 144 Final dividend A final dividend was not declared by the Board.
Total dividends for the year in respect of ordinary shares Dividends for the year totalled 3,500 cents per ordinary share 2007: 5,200 cents.
PREFERENCE SHARES On 10 May 2004, a renounceable rights offer was made to shareholders by the Company of 40,000,000 preference shares with a par value of one cent each at an issue price of R100 per preference share, in the ratio of 18.4249 preference shares for every 100 ordinary shares held in the Company at the close of business on Friday, 7 May 2004.
The rights offer was fully taken up.
During the year, a total of 1,164,279 preference shares have been converted to 411,751 ordinary shares 2007: a total of 7,675,824 preference shares were converted to 2,669,952 ordinary shares.
Since the year end, a further 6,018 preference shares have been converted to 2,141 ordinary shares.
As the ordinary dividend cover in respect of the 2008 dividends is not less than 1.4 times, it is not necessary to adjust the conversion price to be used when convertible preference shares are converted into ordinary shares.
Currently the conversion price is R281.05 or 35.58086 ordinary shares for each 100 convertible preference shares converted.
Preference dividends Nos 8 and 9 The JSE granted a ruling allowing the Company to pay preference dividends on the dividend dates, being 31 May and 30 November each year, regardless of which other, later dates would apply if the standard procedures were followed.
This avoids prejudice to the Company or preference shareholders in respect of dividend payments being made before after the calculation date.
Accordingly, on Wednesday, 30 April 2008, the Board declared a preference dividend No 8 of 320 cents per preference share calculated for the period 1 December 2007 to 31 May 2008 2007: 318 cents to preference shareholders reflected in the register of the Company on Friday, 30 May 2008 and paid on Monday, 2 June 2008.
On Monday, 27 October 2008, the Board declared a preference dividend No 9 of 320 cents per preference share calculated for the period 1 June to 30 November 2008 2007: 320 cents to preference shareholders reflected in the register of the Company on Friday, 28 November and paid on Monday, 1 December 2008.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Anglo Platinum maintains sound corporate governance as a core business principle.
The Board reaffirms its commitment to the principles and cornerstones of sound governance.
It ensures that the Groups business is conducted in accordance with high standards of corporate governance, within the predetermined parameters of risk management and control and in accordance with local and internationally accepted corporate practice.
This, in turn, ensures conformance and compliance without impeding business performance and ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 145 A N N U A L F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S for the year ended 31 December DIRECTORS REPORT provides scope and latitude for entrepreneurial flair and innovation within an overarching framework of safety supporting the production of safe, profitable platinum.
These standards are well embedded in the Groups system of internal controls, policies and procedures which echo and reinforce the King II recommendations.
The Board considers that the Company and its subsidiaries complied during the financial year with the principles of the Code of Corporate Practices and Conduct contained in the 2002 King Committee Report on Corporate Governance King II, and that these have been applied appropriately and consistently, except with regard to the composition of the Remuneration and Nomination committees that comprise non-executive directors, not all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
The Board and management actively and continuously review and enhance the systems of control and governance to ensure the Groups business is managed ethically and within prudent risk parameters in line with internationally accepted standards of best practice.
One Anglo Initiative With the objective of providing more efficient services at a lower cost, the Anglo Platinum Group has outsourced a number of its non-core activities to fellow subsidiary companies within the Anglo American plc group.
Service level agreements have been established to ensure that the services provided are of an appropriate quality.
The services transferred include company secretarial, treasury, corporate finance, insurance and certain risk management services.
Certain other services will be transferred in 2009.
Directors responsibilities in respect of annual financial statements It is the responsibility of the directors of the Company in terms of section 286 of the Companies Act, 1973, as amended, to compile annual financial statements and to lay them before the annual general meeting.
These financial statements are drawn up in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and South African Statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and the directors have taken all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act.
The Anglo Platinum Board of directors has appointed an Audit Committee for the year ending 31 December 2009.
The Audit Committee has nominated Deloitte & Touche as the Groups auditors for 2009 and has nominated Graeme Berry as the designated partner.
Particulars relating to the Groups internal controls and audit approach, as well as the role and function of the Audit Committee, are set out in the section on Corporate Governance in Volume 2 of this annual report: the Sustainable Development Report.
The audit approach ensures a thorough understanding of the Groups financial and business objectives, as well as an analysis of the underlying systems and procedures.
The focus of risk management in the Group concentrates on identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring all known forms of risk.
While operating risk cannot be fully eliminated, the Group endeavours to minimise it by ensuring that the appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems and ethics are applied throughout the Group and managed within predetermined procedures and constraints.
The directors are of the opinion, based on the information and explanations given by management and the internal auditors and on comment by the independent auditors on the results of their audit, that the internal controls are adequate for ensuring: the reliability and integrity of financial and operating information: the compliance of established systems with policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations: the safeguarding of the Groups assets against unauthorised use or disposition: the economic, effective and efficient utilisation of resources: and the achievement of established objectives and goals for operations or programmes.
ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 146 Nothing has come to the attention of the directors to indicate that any material breakdown in the functioning of these controls, procedures, or systems occurred during the year under review.
The internal auditors concur with these statements by the directors.
While the external audit is not designed to provide internal control assurance, the external auditors did not identify any material internal control weaknesses during the course of their audit.
Accordingly, the financial records may be relied upon for preparing the financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets and liabilities.
In preparing the financial statements, the Group complied with International Financial Reporting Standards and used appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates.
The directors are of the opinion that the financial statements fairly present the financial position of the Company and of the Group at 31 December 2008, and the results of the operations and cash flow information for the year then ended.
The directors have reviewed the Groups cashflow forecast for the year ending 31 December 2009.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
The Group has R3,607 million of committed facilities which require renewal in the last quarter of 2009.
The Group will commence renewal negotiations with the banks in due course and have at this stage not sought any written commitment that these facilities will be renewed.
The Board is satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next financial year.
For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The directors believe, as a result of the comprehensive structures and controls in place and the ongoing monitoring of the activities of executive and operational management, that the Board maintains effective control over the Groups affairs.
Details of the Groups corporate governance structures and practices are set out in Volume 2 of this annual report: the Sustainable Development Report.

ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 149 A N N U A L F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S for the year ended 31 December DIRECTORS REPORT GENERAL AUTHORITY TO PERMIT THE COMPANY AND OR ITS SUBISIDIARIES TO ACQUIRE SHARES IN THE COMPANY In terms of sections 85 and 89 of the Companies Act, a general authority granted by shareholders, under a special resolution, to acquire shares issued by a company and or its subsidiaries, is only valid until the next annual general meeting of a company, whereafter it must be renewed.
The Board proposes that, at the forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on Monday, 30 March 2009, shareholders approve a special resolution whereby a general authority is granted permitting the Company and or any of its subsidiaries to acquire shares in the Company.
The JSE Listings Requirements require that a repurchase of securities be implemented on the main board of the JSE previously repurchases were required to be made in the open market and permit a company to use derivative transactions to repurchase securities.
The special resolution contains provision for the Company to conclude derivative transactions which may result in the acquisition of its shares.
As required by the JSE Listings Requirements, the Notice to Members convening the annual general meeting contains the required statements by the Board of its intentions regarding: the utilisation of the desired general authority: and the effect of a repurchase of shares up to a maximum of 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital upon the Groups solvency and the adequacy of the working capital and ordinary capital and reserves during the 12 months after the date of the notice convening the annual general meeting.
The maximum general repurchase permitted by the JSE Listings Requirements is 20% of the Companys issued share capital in any one financial year.
Assuming that the general authority to repurchase shares is approved at the annual general meeting, the Board believes that it might be opportune from time to time for the Company and or any of its subsidiaries to acquire up to a maximum of 20% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital in the abovementioned 12-month period.
Accordingly, the proposed general authority provides the Board with flexibility to acquire shares should it deem such acquisition to be in the best interests of the Company and the Group.
At the annual general meeting, which is to be held on Monday, 30 March 2009, members will be requested to consider an ordinary resolution placing the authorised but unissued ordinary shares of the Company, other than those ordinary shares needed to meet the requirements of the Share Option Scheme, under the control of the directors until the 2010 annual general meeting.
DEMATERIALISATION OF SHARES STRATE Shareholders are again requested to note that, as a result of clearing and settlement of trades through the STRATE system, the Companys share certificates are no longer good for delivery for trading.
Dematerialisation of the Companys share certificates is now a prerequisite when dealing in its shares.
PROPERTY The register of land and buildings is available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours.
AUDITORS Deloitte & Touche continued in office as auditors for the Company and its subsidiaries.
At the annual general meeting, shareholders will be requested to reappoint Deloitte & Touche as auditors of Anglo Platinum Limited and to confirm that Graeme Berry will be the designated auditor.
