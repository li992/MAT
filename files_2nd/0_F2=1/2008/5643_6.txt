Skiffy, the European specialist small nylon parts producer, traded satisfactorily in 2008.
A project to install the divisions standard IT system was started and the majority of Skiffy locations will be operating on this platform by the end of 2009.
The business continued to expand its marketing activity and launched its highly effective catalogue in Italian and Bulgarian for the first time.
The Skiffy catalogue is now available in ten languages and internet ordering now accounts for 29.8% of sales.
In January 2009, the Company relocated the manufacturing capability from the Skiffy, Amsterdam facility into the Moss, Kidlington operation which benefits from 24 7 manufacturing and has been in receipt of substantial investment in recent years.
This relocation will provide both cost savings and risk mitigation benefits due to the superior fire protection systems including fireproof storage for business critical tooling at the Kidlington site.
Alliance, the USbased plastic parts supplier, encountered difficult trading conditions but performed in line with 2007 due to effective cost management.
The business continued to expand its proprietary catalogue product offering with the addition of 800 new items.
The Chicago Alliance Express location, opened in 2007, has continued to grow well and the Alliance facility in So Paulo, Brazil has gone from strength to strength as local manufacture has developed.
In January 2008 a freehold warehouse was purchased in Erie, Pennsylvania, contiguous to land previously acquired, in preparation for the future construction of an integrated facility to further drive operating efficiencies.
Duraco, the USbased producer and distributor of adhesive coated foam products, performed in line with expectations in its first full year of Filtrona ownership.
The integration of the business into the division is now complete and the project to install the divisions standard IT system is well advanced and will be completed in 2009.
The Duraco Express operation opened as planned in May and is trading successfully.
Focusing on MSI, the oil country tubular goods thread protector business, had an excellent year despite the interruption to production in expanding September at the Houston, Texas facility, caused by Hurricane Ike.
Strong drilling activity was driven by the high prices of oil and gas.
Sales levels were also assisted by the new contract product wins which developed as anticipated.
Strong volumes helped the business manage the rapid escalation in raw material prices and continued investment in new production machinery and tooling drove unit production costs down.
distribution 22 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Business Review Tony Edwards, Managing Director, Plastic Technologies Coated and Security Products Coated and Security Products The global market leading producer of high quality selfadhesive tear tape and an emerging supplier of products and technologies for brand protection, document authentication, personal identification and track and trace.
Customers in over 100 countries are served from facilities operating in six countries.
Looking forward to 2009, the current recessionary environment Continuing operations in most manufacturing sectors will inevitably impact on the 1 Operating margin division and the MSI business will be affected by a downturn in drilling activity due to recent falls in the price of oil and gas.
Whilst the Protection and Finishing Products division has a robust business model with a broad range of products and 295.4 15.7 120.0 46.0 15.6 14.9 113.9 112.4 services across multiple served markets combined with low 41.6 14.3 265.8 262.4 106.9 248.2 39.0 levels of customer concentration, the scale of the downturn in 36.2 conditions in the global manufacturing industry is expected to negatively affect demand.
The extent of any decline within the division during 2009 is very difficult to predict but the division is responding by continuing to drive efficiencies and reducing costs.
Coated and Security Products 05 06 07 08 05 06 07 08 05 06 07 08 05 06 07 08 The Coated and Security Products division continued to pursue its strategy of developing new security technologies and 15.6% applications for international markets, whilst sustaining its world leadership position in the selfadhesive tear tape market.
The division delivered an improved performance in both revenue and operating profit with the tear tape business, in particular, demonstrating the defensive qualities of its principal end markets in the difficult global environment.
The improved Revenue per employee performance was assisted by the cost, quality and productivity benefits which resulted from the restructuring in 2007.
Sales from recent innovations utilising advanced tear tape technology were encouraging with increased sales of variable data tape for promotions into the tobacco, biscuits and chewing gum markets and strong growth in the product authentication technologies, printed on tear tape.
The Payne Security business, which provides a wide range of 05 06 07 08 05 06 07 08 05 06 07 08 05 06 07 08 product and document authentication and personal identity solutions for the consumer goods, public sector, and security 120.0k 12.3% 1 Before intangible amortisation and exceptional restructuring costs 23 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Our success stems from the ability to develop innovative solutions designed to deliver creative valueadding products and services to our customers who seek to promote and protect their brands, authenticate their identities and secure valuable documents.

printing markets, made satisfactory progress despite some softening in UK passport volumes towards the end of the year.
Significant new orders were secured for the proprietary Payne authentication system and for security labels, the full benefit of which will be realised in 2009.
The business supplied a secure laminate for the press, competitor, coach and officials passes for the summer games in Beijing and secured a share of the cards for the April launch of the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme due to an enhanced smart card encoding and fulfilment capability.
The focus on exploiting proprietary authentication solutions to combat counterfeiting remains a key growth driver along with further improvements to the quality and service offering to customers.
As expected FractureCode made losses in the year and cost reduction actions have been taken due to the failure of the business to secure additional licensees for the technology.
An intellectual property dispute has been resolved, but FractureCodes proprietary technology remains subject to a further challenge in the Danish courts.
During 2009, it is expected that the Coated and Security Products division will benefit both from the defensiveness of its core served markets in tear tapes and from the growth in the market for solutions to combat the global contraband and counterfeit problem.
These factors, combined with the full year effect of business won in 2008 for the proprietary Payne authentication system, provide confidence that 2009 will see the delivery of further progress in this division.
Innovating to make a difference 24 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Business Review Neil Shillingford, President, Plastic Technologies Plastic Profile and Sheet Plastic Profile and Sheet A leading manufacturer of proprietary and customised thermoplastic profiles, sheet and speciality tubes with multiple locations in the US, Mexico and The Netherlands.
The business serves 3,200 customers in 40 countries spread across six principal markets aerospace, point of purchase signs and displays, medical, traffic control, lighting and fence.
Plastic Profile and Sheet Continuing operations The Plastic Profile and Sheet division encountered another Revenue by destination m difficult year in 2008 with a further reduction in operating performance.
Trading was tough in North America throughout the year for the USbased Filtrona extrusion business and, for Enitor in The Netherlands, and demand softness was evident in Europe in the last quarter.
Strong revenue growth was generated in the point of purchase POP market, due to both the capture of new business, with a major US discount retailer and a large grocery chain, and the strengthening of relationships with existing customers.
The businesss profile in this increasingly important market sector has been raised as it has successfully serviced a number of major US national rollouts supported 31.3% Other 119.4 Europe by its national multisite capability.

Sales in the traffic control sector were softer due to the absence of major oneoff projects, as federal road funding was constrained, and sales to the fence and custom product markets were particularly disappointing as the commercial construction, domestic housing and commercial refrigeration markets, upon which these sectors rely, were severely impacted by the economic slowdown.
Enitor had a challenging year and is continuing to focus on cost reduction and productivity improvements.
The difficult end use demand conditions were exacerbated by the rapid escalation of raw material prices which reached all time record highs during the year.
The division had an under recovery of raw material prices of 1.1m at the half year, improving to 0.8m for the full year.
As a result of difficult trading conditions, cost reduction measures were implemented throughout the year, including modifications to shift patterns to match output to demand and an 11.4% reduction in headcount across the division.
Trading conditions in the Plastic Profile and Sheet division are expected to remain difficult throughout 2009.
The aerospace, medical, POP and traffic control markets are expected to remain stable or display low levels of growth, whereas the lighting, fence and custom markets are likely to reduce due to their sensitivity to construction activity levels.
The division will continue its focus on operational efficiencies and cost improvement and it is anticipated that it will benefit from the sharp reductions in polymer prices which occurred at the end of 2008.
