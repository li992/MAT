REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The groups results and financial position for the year ended 31 December 2008 are set out in full in the consolidated income statement, the group and company balance sheets, the statements of recognised income and expense, the statements of cash flows and the related notes.
The Groups loss before taxation was 1,551.1 million 2007 loss 166.8 million.
Net assets attributable to equity shareholders at 31 December 2008 were 279 million 2007 1,839 million.
The result for the year should be considered in the context of the markedly more adverse UK financial and economic background.
The groups results are dominated by the 1,370 million deficit on revaluation of investment properties, an overall reduction of approximately 25 per cent.
This deficit has driven the fall in the groups net assets attributable to equity shareholders from 1,839 million to 279 million.
The result for the year has additionally been adversely affected by a 221.6 million charge arising from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
This is a non-cash charge relating to the groups interest rate swap contracts.
The charge was caused by the reduction in UK interest rates that occurred in 2008, in particular during the last quarter of the year.
Net rental income, a key measure of operational performance fell from 239.6 million in 2007 to 222.8 million in 2008, a reduction of 16.8 million 7.0 per cent.
The most significant factor in the reduction was the higher level of bad and doubtful debts and lease incentive write-offs, as illustrated below, caused by the increased level of tenants entering administration.
