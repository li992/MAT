Baring Emerging Europe PLC REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER continued The Czech economy proved its resilience in a similar manner to the Polish economy as domestic momentum and foreign inflows boosted activity even as Western Europe faltered.
The outlook is deteriorating, however, as the economy is largely dependent on international trade because of its heavy reliance on exports.
Even so, we believe that, with careful stock selection, the high dividend yield and steady cash generation of many Czech companies warrant a sizeable portfolio exposure in this environment.
Finally, the Hungarian economy continued to struggle as domestic consumption remained subdued for a third year running.
The size of the twin deficits in Hungary and lack of substantial foreign exchange reserves to defend its deteriorating position does not bode well for the future.
The combination of low economic growth in Western Europe and lack of any domestic stimulus creates a serious currency and funding risk in Hungary.
Your Company retains a very low exposure, and the current environment suggests that full withdrawal may be necessary as the investment risk is increasing.
In summary, Emerging European equities have been hurt by the global turmoil.
The financial crisis has left nowhere to hide, and those countries with weak finances are still vulnerable to a flight from risk.
Nevertheless, we remain optimistic about the long term outlook for the region although the short term picture remains unpredictable.
We look now to take advantage of the opportunity to buy well managed companies at distressed prices.
The sell-off has been indiscriminate, and with volatility at extreme levels, our research is focused on finding such opportunities.
