Cairn India Exploration Kameshwari Development Area Cairn India 100% During 2008 Cairn India operated four of seven wells in which During 2008 the GoI approved the three discoveries made in it participated, three of which were successful: Kameshwari West 2, 3 and 6 and the new Development Area 2 of 822 km.
The RB-4 well in Ravva encountered additional oil sands that were later put on stream at 500 bopd through the Ravva Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR production facilities.
Cairn has made 25 discoveries in the RJ-ON-90 1 block to date Raageshwari East-1 in Rajasthan flowed 500 bopd and and has established a significant growing resource base in the 0.4 mmscfd on test from Thumbli sands in a separate oil Barmer basin, currently estimated at around 3.7 billion barrels accumulation adjacent to the Raageshwari field.
Cairn continues its efforts to develop this resource The Mangala North-1 well extended the contingent resource base through the application of appropriate cost efficient in the Barmer Hill Formation for the Mangala field.
The initial focus has been to develop the MBA fields which contain over two billion barrels in place in the Fatehgarh Two wells were drilled in CB-ONN-2002 1 and one in each of reservoirs, through primary and secondary recovery schemes.

Cairn is actively planning to are planned.
Drilling is scheduled onshore in the KG basin, with conduct an EOR pilot trial in the Mangala field following very 2 acquisition of 3D seismic totalling 1,800 km to commence encouraging results obtained from the laboratory and simulation offshore India and in Sri Lanka.
The current assessment of the EOR resource base is more than 300 mmbbls of incremental recoverable oil from the MBA fields.
In addition Cairn continues to evaluate the resources and the development options of the other discoveries, of which the Barmer Hill formation over the Mangala and Aishwariya fields contains around 400 mmbbls of oil in place in tighter reservoir rocks lower permeabilities.
This reservoir has tested oil at rates of up to 250 bopd after stimulation.
Analogous fields in the world have been developed with expected ultimate recoveries of 7-20% under primary and secondary recovery schemes.
Cairn is planning to conduct pilot activities to evaluate this additional resource potential and associated development options.
