Front-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:33 Page 9 In the years since our formation as Chaucer Holdings PLC in 1998, we have worked assiduously to build what is now a very strong Lloyds underwriting franchise.
Our business today is well diversified and has the underwriting capability to write over 600m of premium income.
Looking forward, we believe the market offers considerable potential and we expect to benefit from attractive underwriting conditions during 2009 and 2010.
The marine and non-marine rating environment is improving, particularly in the catastrophe exposed US property, energy and marine classes and also in the UK motor market.
eagerly anticipating Rates are beginning to rise again in aviation and, within specialist lines, financial institutions present opportunities because of reaction to the sub-prime situation.
Equally, with the troubles experienced by some major insurers it is likely that commercial clients will seek greater diversification of cover, which favours the Lloyds subscription market model.
Considering all these factors, the hardening market should gather pace through to 2011.
In the immediate future, we anticipate that premium rates will rise by over 5% in 2009.
Chaucer is in a good position to take advantage of the favourable market conditions.
Our business is well structured and the steps we have taken as part of our strategic plan mean that we now have an excellent underwriting team in place to drive business development.
We believe the future for Chaucer is very positive.
