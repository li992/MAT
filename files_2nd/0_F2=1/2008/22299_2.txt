The Chaucer business plan focuses on organic growth.
Our underwriting business has developed consistently and profitably in recent years and, looking forward, we anticipate increasing our underwriting capacity to more than 1 billion by 2012.
Chaucers reputation and strength is firmly anchored in the ability of our underwriting to focus business in those areas offering attractive returns on capital.
Equally, we are very selective about our involvement where rates are under pressure.
strategic planning Whilst maintaining the pragmatism of our approach, our policy for growth is to continue enhancing our team of top class underwriters while also expanding our range of insurance products.
It is our intention to be the lead insurer on more business in the future.
Chaucer undoubtedly benefits from the success of the Lloyds franchise and the unparalleled access it offers to specialist business worldwide.
Responding to this, we will enter new markets and establish further overseas offices as opportunities arise.
There is a general recognition that the market is beginning to harden and that the prospects for the general insurance industry as a whole are healthy.
We believe the steps we are taking to develop our business are well considered and appropriate.
We shall continue to respond to market opportunities as they develop.
