supported by a 4.7% increase in tonnage handled.
The overall increases continued the trend of significant growth at Heathrow more than compensating for weakness at Gatwick.
Accordingly, over the last two years we have added 100,000 tonnes of capacity through a new cargo facility and additional equipment at Heathrow and we have reduced our facilities at Gatwick from 75,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes.
The additional revenue, supplemented by tight cost control in areas such as procurement and overtime, led to a further increase in the operating profit of our cargo operation for the year compared to last year.
Meteor operations Revenue from our Meteor operations increased by 4.0%, supported by a 9.7% increase in transactions.
The full year contribution of security services company Nikaro Limited, acquired in February 2007, added 1.7m of revenue and 0.3m of operating profit.
The improvement in like for like operating profit was due to the airport related businesses, which account for the majority of Meteors operations, and the expanded rail services, which includes car parking and revenue protection.
In the airport division, we extended the car parking contract at Heathrow for five years but did not retain the Stansted contract which now expires in September 2008.
In the rail division, car park capacity is becoming a constraint at a number of railway stations, and Meteor has developed a cost effective way of constructing an additional level of decking for parking at these sites.
