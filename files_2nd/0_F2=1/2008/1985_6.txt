12 Our business continued Reducing our environmental impact We invest considerably to reduce our use of natural resources.
This helps us decrease our environmental impact overall and improve cost efficiency across our business.
One of the ways we do this is by working with our suppliers to identify further opportunities to reduce our use of water, energy and chemicals to enhance the sustainability of our business.
k Transport initiatives We are continually reviewing our distribution arrangements, relocating production to reduce costs, consolidating routes and investing in driver training.
k Chemicals We work closely with our chemical suppliers to optimise our use of detergents, and to reduce the amount that we dispose of in effluent.
Ecolab are one of our major chemical suppliers and providers of energy saving consultancy services.
Following work they have done at our Danish laundries, we recognised opportunities at our Hillerd plant, to reduce energy and water consumption.
Washing temperature o o has been reduced from 75 C to 55 C and water recycling has improved.
This has led to a 17% reduction in energy consumption and a 30% fall in water use.
This technology has now been installed at four other plants in Denmark with further installations planned during quarter 1 2009.
