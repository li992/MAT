HBOS Services provided: cleaning, landscaping and pest control.
Overview Our relationship with HBOS started in 1998 when MITIE was awarded contracts for major employment sites in Aylesbury, London, Scotland and Birmingham as well as the post room in Bristol.
Today, MITIE cleans over 1,000 high street branches around the country and more than 130 HBOS of ces too, employing over 2,000 people overseen by an account director with their own management team.
As a national accounts contract it has direct access to our own 24hr call centre based in Bristol, allowing for instant remedies of cleaning requirements.
Key successes The high street retail network was mobilised in record time nearly 1,000 of the branches were made ready in just over six weeks.
We have also developed our own quality auditing system that uses the latest technology.
Each account manager completes their monthly audit using a handheld device.
Once the audit has been completed, the real-time information sits on a secure website alongside other essential management information which can be accessed by all authorised stakeholders.
This is used extensively on each HBOS site.
We have also worked hard with HBOS to develop an automated computer system which plays an important part in guaranteeing service delivery compliance across the contract.
In addition, the system has the ability to address the issue of MITIEs people who work on their own, often during unsociable hours, allowing us to be sure of their whereabouts for health and safety reasons.
This system is unique and offers a real differentiation in the marketplace.
