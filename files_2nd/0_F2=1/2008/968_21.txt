Both factors resulted in an increase of additional convertible Mineral Resources.
The Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 12.9 Mt.
WBJV where, due to a successful completion of a feasibility study, Mineral Resources were converted to Ore Reserves 6.7 Mt.
A change in the modifying factors at the Rustenburg Mine resulted in an Ore Reserve tonnage increase by 3.2 Mt.
However, these increases are offset by the decrease in Ore Reserve tonnage mainly due to: previously reported tonnages from Northam, which are excluded due to the BEE finalisation with Mvelaphanda Resources -5.5 Mt : and at the BRPM joint venture -2.9 Mt mainly due to production depletion and a re-evaluation of the BRPM Boschkoppie area, which resulted in a confidence decrease.
The Probable Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 10.4% from 117.2 Mt to 129.4 Mt 12.1 Mt and the 4E ounce content increases by 12.6% from 19.2 Moz to 21.7 Moz 2.4 Moz mainly due to higher confidence at Amandelbult Mine 11.3 Mt.

Rustenburg Merensky Reef: The total Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 7.2% from 44.1 Mt to 47.3 Mt 3.2 Mt.
This is mainly due to a change in the modifying factors.
The total Proved Ore Reserves tonnage increases by 9.6% from 29.3Mt to 32.1 Mt 2.8 Mt due to additional converted reserves in the Frank Shaft area.
UG2 Reef: The total Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 6.9% from 249.1 Mt to 266.4 Mt 17.3 Mt.
This is mainly due to a change in the modifying factors and an increase in the minimum stoping width from 0.85 m to 0.95 m due to safety requirements in-stope roof bolting.
The total Proved Ore Reserves increases substantially by 46.7% from 103.1Mt to 152.2 Mt 48.4 Mt.
Two factors are as follows: During 2007 and due to some uncertainties in the modifying factors at the Waterval Shaft some Measured Mineral Resources were converted to Probable Ore Reserves.
During 2008 mining methods have been finalised and defined to certain project areas, together with improved modifying factors resulted in an approximate increase of 27 Mt additional Proved Ore Reserves.
Additionally extensive exploration and re-evaluation resulted in a significant confidence increase from Indicated to Measured Mineral Resources.
Previously reported Probable Ore Reserves mainly at Turffontein, Townlands and Boschfontein were converted to Proved reserves approximately 6.6 Mt at Turffontein, 5.5 Mt at Townlands, 5.2 Mt at Boschfontein.
Amandelbult Merensky Reef: Due to exploration, reinterpretation and re-evaluation, the total Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 16.2% from 79.5 Mt to 92.4 Mt 12.9 Mt.
This is due to a decrease of the geological loss and due to an interpreted decrease of the extent of the uneconomic Transitional Zone between the Normal Merensky Reef and the Pothole Reef.
Increased confidence resulted in an increase of the Proved Ore Reserve tonnage by 6.8% from 22.4 Mt to 23.9 Mt 1.5 Mt, the Probable Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 19.8% from 57.2 Mt to 68.5 Mt 11.3 Mt.
UG2 Reef: Due to exploration, reinterpretation and re-evaluation the total Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 8.2% from 314.5 Mt to 340.2 Mt 25.7 Mt.
This is due to a decrease of the geological loss, a slight increase in the resource cut and a slight increase in the density.
The Proved Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 5.0% from 204.1 Mt to 214.2 Mt 10.2 Mt, the Probable Ore Reserve tonnage increases by 14.1% from 110.4 Mt to 126.0 Mt 15.6 Mt.
Changes in the modifying factors applied in the conversion from Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves resulted in a grade decrease by 0.11 g t from 4.88 g t to 4.77 g t. Union During 2006 the JV with Bakgatla-Ba-Kgafela was finalised.

The head grade decreases by 0.43 g t from 5.87 g t to 5.44 g t. During 2008 a new resource evaluation has been completed.
Based on additional exploration drilling and a re-evaluation especially of the footwall material below the previously reported resource cut reflected economic grade, well above the incremental cut-off grade.
This resulted in an increase of the resource cut by 0.1m from 1.40 m to 1.50 m. Consequently the Ore Reserve stope width increased resulting in a lower head-grade.
UG2 Reef: The total attributable Ore Reserve tonnage decreases by 4.5% from 46.2 Mt to 44.2 Mt -2.0 Mt.
The production depletion of 3.1 Mt is offset by a lower geological loss and a stope width increase.
The total Ore Reserve grade decreases by 0.23 g t from 4.16 g t to 3.93 g t. This is mainly due to an increase in the stoping width from 1.45 m to 1.50 m due to safety requirements in-stope roof bolting.
The Proved Ore Reserves tonnage decreases by 12.2% from 19.7 Mt to 17.2 Mt -2.5 Mt mainly due to production depletion which is offset by a lower geological loss and a stoping width increase.

Rustenburg A new resource evaluation has been completed during 2008.
Merensky Reef: The total Mineral Resource tonnage increases by 10.2% from 53.6 Mt to 59.1 Mt 5.5 Mt mainly due to the inclusion of previously excluded Mineral Resources at Townlands 5 and portions of the TURK project.
The Indicated Mineral Resource tonnage increases by 31.6% from 18.6 Mt to 24.5 Mt 5.9 Mt due to the reasons explained in the paragraph above.
The total Mineral Resource grade decreases by 0.45 g t from 7.16 g t to 6.72 g t. This is due to previously excluded lower-grade Mineral Resources from Townlands 5 and the TURK project.
Additionally due to an extensive drilling programme in the eastern portion of Hoedspruit farm Brakspruit Shaft and in the vicinity of the Brakspruit pothole resulted in a decrease of the reef grade.

Merensky Reef: Due to exploration, reinterpretation and re-evaluation the overall Mineral Resource tonnage increases by 12.0% from 149.0 Mt to 166.9 Mt 17.9 Mt.
This is due to the following: Previously not reported Mineral Resources at portions of Haakdoorndrift 6.0 Mt.
Infill-drilling identified a spatial shifting of the uneconomic Transitional Zone.
This resulted in the reporting of more Normal Merensky Reef than previously reported at a higher resource cut and consequently higher tonnage 5.7 Mt.
The overall dip increased by 2.4 degrees resulting in additional tonnage 4.6 Mt.
The overall geological loss decreased slightly 2.1 Mt.
The increase of the tonnage is offset by a slight decrease in the resource cut -2.2 Mt and production depletion.
Due to increased confidence the Measured Mineral Resource tonnage increases by 1024% from 0.6 Mt to 6.8 Mt 6.2 Mt and the Indicated Mineral Resource tonnage increases by 37.7% from 8.8 Mt to 12.1 Mt 3.3 Mt.
The total Mineral Resource grade increases by 0.36 g t from 6.87 g t to 7.24 g t. This is due to a spatial shifting of the above mentioned uneconomic Transitional Zone resulting in additional reporting of Normal Merensky Reef at an overall higher grade than the Pothole Reef.

Merensky Reef: Additional exploration drilling and a re-evaluation resulted in a total tonnage increase by 0.1% from 83.8 Mt to 83.9 Mt 0.1 Mt.
Regional Pothole reef facies: The footwall material below the previously reported resource cut reflects economic grade.
This resulted in an increase of the resource cut from 1.40 m to 1.50 m. It must be noted that despite the increase in resource cut but due to additional exploration drilling the overall resource grade increases by 0.1g t from 6.22 g t to 6.31 g t. An exploration drilling programme in the structural complex NE portion of Union showed that the Merensky Reef did not extend as far as the original assessment from the aeromagnetic survey suggested.
This resulted in a decrease in Inferred Mineral Resources.
Due to extensive exploration and re-evaluation the confidence increased significantly, especially for the Measured Resource category.
The Measured Mineral Resources increases significantly by 133.6% from 9.9 Mt to 23.2 Mt 13.2 Mt and the Inferred Mineral Resources decreases significantly by 31.5% from 46.8 Mt to 32.1 Mt -14.7 Mt.

Twickenham Merensky Reef: A new resource evaluation has been completed during 2008.
Exploration and re-evaluation of the Merensky Reef resulted in an increase of the total Mineral Resource tonnage by 9.9% from 146.8 Mt to 161.4 Mt 14.6 Mt mainly due to a decrease of the geological loss.
The confidence for the Measured Mineral Resources increases significantly by 483.2% from 4.0 Mt to 23.5 Mt 19.5 Mt.
As a consequence of the increase in the Measured confidence resulted in a decrease of the Indicated Mineral Resource tonnage by 44.7% from 54.0 Mt to 29.9 Mt -24.2 Mt.
The total Mineral Resource grade decreases by 0.5 g t from 5.55 g t to 5.04 g t, but the overall 4E ounce content stays the same 26.2 Moz.
Refinement of the resource cut is ongoing and for this publication the following decision has been used: For Twickenham a resource cut of 1.0 m and for Hackney a resource cut of 0.8 m has been applied based on the spatial distribution of economic grade below the minimum resource cut of 0.8 m.

Der Brochen Special note for the Der Brochen project: During 2008 the Booysendal BEE transaction with Mvelaphanda Resource was finalised.
The Booysendal project lies directly to the South of the Der Brochen project.
During 2008 and after discussions with Mvelaphanda Resources resulted in a boundary change between the Der Brochen and Booysendal projects.
It was agreed that approximately 1.3 km of strike length was added to the final Booysendal area, resulting in a significant decrease of the Der Brochen area and consequently a decrease in total tonnage and content.
Merensky Reef: During 2008 a new resource evaluation was completed.
It was decided to apply a fixed resource cut for the project area instead of a previously used flexi-cut.
This, together with the boundary change as mentioned above, resulted in a significant decrease of the total Mineral Resource tonnage by 25.9% from 223.6 Mt to 165.6 Mt -58.0 Mt.
The resource classification is unchanged.
A drop in the total Mineral Resource grade by 0.5 g t from 4.58 g t to 4.08 g t has resulted due to the selection of a resource cut that references a stratigraphic marker instead of an unreferenced optimal cut.
