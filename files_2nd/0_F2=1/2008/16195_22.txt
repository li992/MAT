The PSP awards made in March 2006 and April 2006 reached the end of their performance period on 31 December 2008.
The Remuneration Committee determined that both parts of the relevant performance condition were met in full, as the Company was ranked in the upper quartile compared to both the relevant comparator groups, and the underlying performance of the Company was determined to be a fair reflection of the Companys TSR.
Accordingly, the Executive Directors will be eligible to receive their awards on 30 March 2009, the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.
