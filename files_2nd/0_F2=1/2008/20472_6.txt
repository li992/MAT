55% of the UK total is underwritten by the Munich Re Group specifically Great Lakes Reinsurance UK Plc through a co-insurance agreement, and 17.5% was reinsured to Swiss Re and Partner Re.
The nature of the co-insurance arrangement is such that 55% of all motor premium and claims for the 2008 year accrues directly to Great Lakes and does not appear in the Groups income statement.
Similarly, Great Lakes reimburses the Group for its proportional share of expenses incurred in acquiring and administering the motor business.
The principal advantages of this significant use of coand reinsurance are the reduced capital requirements and also reduced exposure to underwriting risk.
This creates a high return on shareholder equity and strong cash flows, supporting regular dividends.
The profit commission arrangements in the agreements allow Admiral to participate to a large extent in the profitability of the total underwriting, and the most recent reinsurance contracts allow for a significant proportion of the profit to be remitted back to Admiral.
The underwriting arrangements for 2009 have changed compared to 2008: Admiral will continue to retain a net 27.5%, with Munich Re stepping down to 50% and the remaining 22.5% split between three reinsurers Swiss Re 10.0%, Hannover Re 6.25% and New Re 6.25%.
UK car insurance financial commentary The UK business again grew strongly in 2008, increasing total premiums written by 12% from 617m to 690m and also growing the number of vehicles insured by 15% to 1.59m.
A fall in average premiums accounted for the difference in the growth rates.
Admirals premium rates actually increased by around 4% during 2008, but the continued growth in distribution via price comparison websites partly contributed to a fall in average premiums written.
Also, the mix of the new business and renewal book has shifted very gradually towards slightly lower premium risks.
Our own data on the competitiveness of Admirals rates suggests that market price changes were broadly in line with our own.
The underwriting results of 2008 showed continued improvement, with a combined ratio of 81% coming in two points better than 83% for 2007.
The private motor market reported a combined ratio i. e. including the effect of reserve releases for 2007 of 104% 115% before releases, meaning Admiral enjoyed a 21 point outperformance in reported results for that year.
We do not expect a material change in the markets result for 2008.

The loss ratio improved to 62.0% from 66.7%, partly reflecting a larger impact resulting from prior year reserve surplus releases positively contributing 23.5% in 2008 v 21.0% in 2007, but equally the pure year ratio i. e. the loss ratio without the benefit of releases also improved, to 85.5% from 87.7%, reflecting better claims experience in the 2008 calendar year compared to 2007.
On the Groups own underwriting, we continue to reserve initially on a conservative basis, above actuarial projections of ultimate outcomes.
This results in a significant margin being held in claims reserves to allow for any unforeseen adverse development in open claims.
This creates a position whereby Admiral expects to be able to consistently make well above industry average reserve releases.
In addition to these releases, there is a significant amount of revenue not yet recognised arising from profit commissions earned on the premiums that Admiral does not underwrite itself.
Proportionally these balances have become much more significant at the end of 2008 and consequently we now consider it more appropriate to consider these two parts together when we determine the quantum of reserve releases.
We seek to achieve a consistent level of overall prudence.
The expense ratio increased to 19.0% from 16.7% in 2007.
Part of the increase results from an accounting impact arising from Admiral retaining more of the 2008 premium 27.5% than 2007 22.5%.
A further element of the increase arose due to the commission structures of the quota share reinsurance contracts.
On a like for like basis, the expense ratio for 2008 was in line with 2007.
Aside from the underwriting result for Admirals own account, another notable feature of the 2008 income statement is the significant increase in profit commission income up 70% to 34.7m.
This results from a number of factors, including growth in the overall level of premium written: a higher percentage of business coreinsured in 2007 than previous years and continued improvement in reported loss ratios for previous years.
The main contributor however was the significantly improved profit commission terms to Admiral on coreinsurance contracts for the 2007 year and beyond.
We recognised the first profit commission income on this year during 2008.
The new quota share contracts which came into effect in January 2009 with Hannover Re and New Re include even more favourable terms for Admiral.
Net income from ancillary products and services has for some time been a key source of profit for the Group, and 2008 was no exception.
Ancillary profit increased by around 17% to 89.0m from 75.8m.
Most of the growth came by way of an increase in the number of vehicles insured 15%, whilst there was also a modest increase in the income per vehicle 70.70 v 69.00.
Ancillary income A large number of income streams combine to form what is known as ancillary income.
Most are products or services that complement the core car insurance product including a number of insurance products that are not underwritten by Admiral.
A portion of the total is discretionary.
Although Admiral does not underwrite all the car insurance generated for its own account, it does retain all ancillary income generated.
The major sources, along with a broad categorisation are set out below: Discretionary Breakdown insurance, personal accident insurance, car hire cover, zero exclusion payment protection insurance Other Legal expenses insurance, administration fees Discretionary is defined as a product or service in respect of which a customer makes a decision whether or not to purchase.

Regulatory environment The UK car insurance business operates mainly under the regulation of the UK Financial Services Authority, and also, by virtue of a Gibraltar based insurance company, under the Financial Services Commission in that territory.
The FSA regulates two Group companies involved in this business EUI Limited an insurance intermediary and Admiral Insurance Company Limited AICL, an insurer, whilst the FSC regulates Admiral Insurance Gibraltar Limited AIGL, also an insurer.
All three companies are required to maintain capital to levels prescribed by the home regulator, and all three maintained significant surpluses above those required levels throughout the year.
Treating Customers Fairly TCF : FSA regulations require regulated companies to treat their customers fairly, and this has been an area of significant focus in recent years.
Although the Group had a TCF culture along with management information in place prior to the FSA initiative, improvements have been made to the management information used in the business, and we report some of the data in the Customers section below.
Risks and uncertainties There are a number of factors which could affect the business future results and prospects and the main ones are set out below.
This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks and uncertainties and the business will always be impacted by its competitors and other factors.
The business may be affected by difficult economic conditions There is a risk that the recession in the UK could adversely affect the UK car insurance business in a number of ways: a Ancillary income an element of this income stream is discretionary, and whilst it could be argued that protection products are more important in difficult economic conditions, consumers could choose to reduce the level of non-mandatory products, which would impact the Groups ancillary income b Claims there is a risk of increased fraudulent claims, which would affect the Groups underwriting results and also profit commission income The Groups insurance business faces inherent claims risk As with any insurance business, the value of future claims may be different to current expectations for a number of reasons, many of which are outside the Groups control.
These could include claims frequency shocks resulting from bad weather, higher claims inflation resulting from legislative changes.
Adverse changes would affect the Groups underwriting results and profit commission income.
The business faces operational risk Operational risk arises across the business in a variety of forms, and if business processes do not function effectively and efficiently, losses may arise.
Potential risk areas include: Claims handling: internal or external fraud: computer system failure.
The Group has a well developed risk management framework, including a robust set of internal controls, although these can not be relied upon to completely eliminate the risk of loss.
The business faces regulatory risk The business is subject to a range of regulatory supervision and should any of it change significantly, this could materially affect the Groups operations and the products offered.
Counterparty and other financial risks are discussed in the financial risks section in the notes to the accounts.
