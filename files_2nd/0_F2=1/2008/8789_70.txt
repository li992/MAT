Communication with shareholders Extensive information about the Groups activities is provided in the Annual Report and Accounts and the Half-yearly Report which are sent to shareholders.
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders for which the Board, as a whole, has responsibility, and enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and the business of the Group are welcomed and are dealt with in an informative and timely manner.
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting to discuss the progress of the Group.
Going concern After making inquiries and taking into consideration the Ukrainian and Russian business environments, as detailed in note 29 of the accounts, together with reviewing the Companys budget for 2009 and its medium term plans, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
The going concern basis for the accounts has therefore continued to be adopted.
By order of the Board Rt Hon Lord Fraser of Carmyllie Chairman 6th April 2009
