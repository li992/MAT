Operations Review: Exploration Democratic Republic of Congo Blocks I and II cover more than 6,000 square kilometres in the highly prospective Albert Basin 18 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Map showing licences in the Democratic Republic of Congo In addition to its licences in Uganda, Heritage holds a 39.5% non-operated interest in two blocks in the Albert Basin on the DRC side of Lake Albert Blocks I and II.
These blocks, which include the entire DRC side of Lake Albert, cover more than 6,000 square kilometres and are adjacent to Block 3A and Block 2 in Uganda.
The combination of licences in both the DRC and Uganda gives the Group a very strong acreage position in this highly prolific sedimentary basin.
In 2006 the Group, with its partners in these licences, executed a PSA with the government of the DRC.
The initial exploration term is five years, during which seismic data will be acquired and exploration wells drilled.
However, work will only commence following the receipt of a Presidential Decree, the timing of which is still uncertain.
The validity of the licences was disputed during 2008, however, Heritage and the operator are working closely with the government of the DRC and both continue to be confident that title will be confirmed.
Given the proximity of the DRC licences to the Ugandan licences in the Albert Basin, management anticipates being able to realise cost benefits in operating, capital and infrastructure development costs.
