8 Our business continued A winning formula We provide service solutions to source, clean and maintain the textiles our customers need to make sure their business keeps running and they meet their obligations to their employees and customers.
k Broadening our service to hospitals Our Healthcare businesses provide a wide range of textiles for the needs of hospitals and other care facilities from traditional ward linen products through to specialist operating theatre services.
k Outsourcing opportunities The opportunities for new outsourcing continues, even in developed markets, while in newer markets, such as Poland, the number of customers outsourcing our mats or garments for the first time is above 75% of sales.
A key performance indictor of our business is in the level of new sales we make each year.
We have invested in our salesforces in many of our markets in recent years which has driven good levels of growth.
As we enter a period of economic slowdown in 2009 we expect to consolidate on these investments and to continue to demonstrate the value of our outsourced services.
Our growth in the Polish market has been strong and our market focus has been supported operationally with the opening of, or substantial expansion to, three plants since 2005.
We set out below the progress we have made in new sales in this market since 2005.
There has been some easing of new sales orders in 2008 compared to 2007, but overall we are still showing increased new sales order intake leading to continued organic revenue growth.
