In addition, certain Advisors believe that merger arbitrage will be a less prominent strategy in 2009 as fewer mergers and acquisitions should occur given the general unavailabilityof credit.
The increase in equity correlation and volatility during the fourth quarter of 2008 created a challenging environment for fundamentally based equity long short Advisors, and as a result many of the Companys equity long short Advisors are currently operating at historically low levels of exposure given the uncertainty in markets.
These Advisors are choosing to protect capital and remain on the sidelines until more clarity starts toappear in global equity markets and companies once again start trading based on fundamental value.
On the short side, those Advisors are taking a more cautious stance than in 2008 given single-stock volatility and indiscriminate market rallies.
However, with the sharp drop in equity prices during 2008 and into 2009, Advisors are alsostarting tosee what they believe tobe significant value in parts of the market and have cautiously been adding long positions in defensive companies with strong cash flows and unleveraged balance sheets to their portfolios.
The Investment Manager believes that tactical trading could continue to benefit from potential fundamental and technical opportunities in liquid markets given the uncertain economic environment and that trendfollowers may also continue to benefit amidst the higher volatility in markets, although the magnitude of many of the 2008 market trends is unlikely to be repeated.
As a result of the Continuation Resolutions, which were completed on 17 April 2009, the Directors will put forward a voluntary redemption offer for up to 25% of the Shares together with mandatory redemption proposals for all of the Shares and US$ Shares.
