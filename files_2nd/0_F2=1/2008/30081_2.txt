Statement of Investment Objective and Policy Ordinary Shares Objective The objective of the Ordinary share class is to maximise shareholders total returns by investing in property shares and property on an international basis.
Investment Although the Investment Objective allows for investment on an international basis, the Policies benchmark is a Pan-European Index and the majority of the investments will be located in that geographical area.
Direct property investments will be located in the UK only.
The Fund Manager currently applies the following guidelines for asset allocation: UK listed equities 35 55% European listed equities 35 55% Other listed equities 0 5% Direct property UK 10 30% The investment selection process seeks to identify well managed companies of all sizes, especially those with a focus on a particular type of real estate business.
The Manager generally regards future growth and capital appreciation potential more highly than immediate initial yield or discount to asset value.
As a dedicated investor in the property sector the fund cannot offer diversification outside that sector, however within the portfolio there are limitations on the size of individual investments held to ensure diversification within the portfolio.
To deliver a spread of investment risk, the maximum holding in the stock of any one issuer or of a single asset is limited to 15% of the portfolio.
In addition, any holdings in excess of 5% of the portfolio must not in aggregate exceed 40% of the portfolio.
These limits are set at the point of acquisition, however if they were materially exceeded for a significant length of time through market movements, the Manager would seek to remedy the position.
Gearing The fund may utilise gearing with the purpose of enhancing shareholder returns.
The maximum gearing level permitted is 40%, however, the current guideline is 10% net cash to 25% gearing.
The Trust invests in the shares of property companies which themselves employ leverage.
The total level of gearing the Trust is exposed to through the balance sheets of investee companies together with the borrowings of the Trust itself is referred to as the seethrough gearing.
The Manager comments on the level of see-through gearing in the Managers Report.

Dividend Due to its focus on smaller market capitalisation companies, some of which are development companies, the dividend yield of Sigma shares is likely to be lower than that of the Ordinary shares.
In addition, the dividend is also likely to be more volatile.
A special dividend of 1.10p per Sigma share was paid on 12 October 2007 to shareholders on the register at 5 October 2007.
The special dividend arose as a result of accrued earnings included in the Calculation Date NAV for the Conversion of Ordinary shares into Sigma shares on creation of the Sigma share class.
The special dividend was a non-recurring payment.
An interim dividend of 0.20p per Sigma share was paid on 9 January 2008 to shareholders on the register on 7 December 2007.
Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 29 July 2008, a final dividend of 0.65p per Sigma share has been declared payable on 5 August 2008 to shareholders on the register on 4 July 2008.
The shares will be quoted exdividend on 2 July 2008.
