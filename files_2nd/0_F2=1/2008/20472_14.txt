The survey includes questions relating to a wide range of topics including staff morale, staff development, management, communication and social aspects of working at Admiral.
The table below sets out a number of key results from the survey over the last three years and clearly shows that staff feel morale is high within the Company and their own departments and that management listen to their issues.
They also feel that Admiral is truly customer oriented and treats its customers fairly.

Customers The Group has always regarded its customers as central to the success of the business.
As at 31 December 2008 the Group had 1.75m customers, up 17% from 1.49m the year before.
We focus on open communication with our customers providing high standards of service at all points in the customer cycle from new business, customer service, renewals, claims and complaints.
The Groups commitment to quality is demonstrated through its Quality Measures Programme.
Everyone in the organisation has a part to play in ensuring a high standard of quality.
Every department in the Group has a unique set of quality measures to gauge performance.
The measures are updated each year to challenge staff to make continual improvements.
The programme is reported every month in the internal company magazine and awards are presented each year for the best departments.
The annual measures bonus provides a financial incentive for staff to drive incremental change throughout the business and was paid out in full for the 2008 year.
As well as this programme, quality representatives throughout the Group monitor the service the Company provides through the thousands of comment forms it receives back from customers every month.
By listening to customer comments, Admiral can improve the quality of service it provides.
The Groups Compliance department has completed a Treating Customers Fairly Management Information pack pulling together specific measures that demonstrate that we are consistently treating our customers fairly.
A detailed report is produced each month together with a summary providing details of measures that have been graded red.
The report is discussed at the The Risk Management Committee RMC - see Corporate Governance section of this report and process or behavioural changes agreed where appropriate.
