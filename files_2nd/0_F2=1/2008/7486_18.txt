The performance share plan and re-investment plan - The total shareholder return performance condition is considered a market-based performance condition under IFRS 2.
These schemes have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three-year period preceding valuation.
The grant date for the co-investment plan and the long-term incentive plan is the start of the financial year in which performance is assessed.
This may be up to one year before the quantity of shares awarded is determined.
The underlying value of the award is known at grant date, subject to the outcome of the performance condition.
The value of awarded shares re ects the performance outcome at the date of issue to participants.
Information relating to share grant valuation techniques The value of the awards is determined as the observed market closing rate on the date awarded grants are issued to participants.
For the co-investment plan, this occurs after the first year of performance is assessed.
The performance share plans and the re-investment plans market-based performance condition is included in the fair value measurement on grant date and is not revised for actual performance.
Under the share awards, the participants have an entitlement to dividend distributions from issue date until point of vesting.
The observed market rate on the day of valuation is considered inclusive of future dividend distributions.
There were 3,962,197 ordinary share awards 2007: 8,879,440 granted during the period with a weighted average fair value of 3.14 2007: 3.57.
