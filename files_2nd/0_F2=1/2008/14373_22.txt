BUSINESS OVERVIEW Smith & Nephews operations are organised into three business units that operate globally: Orthopaedics, Endoscopy and Advanced Wound Management.
Smith & Nephew believes that its businesses have the opportunities for strong growth due to its markets benefiting from an ageing population, an increase in active lifestyles andtrends towardless .
The Group formed a single Orthopaedics business by combining its Reconstruction and Trauma businesses in July 2008 in an effort to increase the efficiency of its management and operational structure.

This is achieved by adjusting for the impact both of sales of products acquired in business combinations and for movements in exchange rates.
The Groups management uses this non-GAAP measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business segment and a .
Underlying growth in revenue reconciles to growth in revenue reported in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the constant currencyexchange effect and the acquisitionseffect, described below.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure is that it excludes certain factors, described above, which do ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues.
The Group measures the performance of local managers using underlying growth in revenue whilst the Groups management additionally considers GAAP  theexcluded items bymonitoringagainst internalbudget amounts.
The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales.
This is measured as the difference between the increase in revenue translated into US Dollars on a GAAP basis i. e. current year revenue translated at the current year average rate, prior year revenue translated at the prior year average rate and the increase measured by   rate.
The acquisitions effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired business combinations.
This is calculated by excludingthe revenue from sales of products acquired as a result of a business combination consummated in the current year, with non-US Dollar sales translated at the prior year average rate.
Additionally, prior year revenue is adjusted to include a full year of revenue from the sales of products acquired in those 28 business combinations consummated in the previous year, calculated by adding back revenue from sales of products in the period prior to the Groups ownership.
These sales are separately tracked in the Groups internal reportingsystems .

Smith & Nephews principal geographic markets are in the well-developed healthcare economiesoftheUS, Europe, Japan andAustralia.
These markets are characterised by an increase in the average age of the population caused by the immediate post-World War II baby boomer generation approaching retirement, increased longevity, more active lifestyles, obesity and increased affluence.
Together these factors have created significant demand for more effective healthcare products which deliver improved outcomes through technology advances.
Furthermore pressure to resist increases in overall healthcare spending has led healthcare providers to demand products which minimise  .
A recent trend has been increasing consumer awareness of available healthcare treatments through the Internet and direct-to-customer advertising.
This has led to increased consumer influence over product purchasing decisions.
In orthopaedic reconstruction, improvements in technology have lengthened the effective life of implants and have facilitated the implantation of knees and hips in relatively young patients thereby improving the quality of life for a new generation.
Both the orthopaedic trauma and clinical therapies markets are expected to continue to grow due to a global population increasingly at risk from fractures due to age, osteoporosis, obesity and diabetes and also due to continuous advancements in the surgical treatment of fractures, and the need to manage pain in younger, moreactivepatients.
The endoscopy market is benefiting from the continued trend worldwide towards less invasive surgery but with particular focus on arthroscopic repair of the knee and shoulder using a broad range of technology.
The Group alsoexpects tobenefit fromthedemandforless .
The advanced wound management market is focused on the treatment of chronicwounds of the older population and other hard-to-heal wounds such as burns and certain surgical wounds and is therefore also expected to benefit from demographic trends.
The market for advanced wound treatments is relatively unpenetrated and it is estimated that the potential market is significantly larger than the current market.
This increased penetration is expected to be driven by improved outcomes from new technology, health economic benefits, increasing nursing shortages, quality of life expectations and education of healthcare providers to convert from traditional to advanced treatments.
In order to take advantage of the expanding markets the Group must continually develop its existing and new technologies and bring new products to its customers.
Expenditure on research and development in 2008 represented approximately 4%ofGrouprevenue.
30 Currency Movements Smith & Nephews results of operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from revenue in a currency different from the related costs and expenses.
The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on cost of goods sold by a policy of purchasing forward foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed.
In addition, the Groups policy is for firm commitments to be fully covered and forecast transactions to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year.
The Groups revenues, profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes.
This exposure is offset partly because the Group incurs interest in currencies other than US Dollars on its indebtedness denominated in  Dollars.
Other Other than national governments seeking to control or reduce healthcare expenditure, see Risk Factors Dependence on Government and Other Funding management is not aware of any governmental economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have materially affected, directly or indirectly, the Groups operations or .
Critical Accounting Policies The Groups significant accounting policies and those elective exemptions taken by the Group on the adoption of IFRS in accordance with IFRS 1 are set out in Note 2 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
Of those, the policies  judgmentareas follows: Inventories A feature of the Orthopaedics business whose finished goods inventory makes up approximately 75% of the Group total finished goods stock is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated inaccordancewith a formula based onlevels of .
Thisformula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience, but it does involve management judgements on effectiveness of inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old .
Impairment In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment a number of .
 growth, , , levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ or changes in expectationsarise, .
Retirement Benefits A number of key judgements have to be made in calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the Balance Sheet liability, operating profit and finance income costs.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
For example a 0.5% increase in discount rate would reduce the combined UK and US pension plan deficit by $76m whilst a 0.5% decrease would increase the combined deficit by $81m.
A 0.5% increase in discount rate would decrease profit before taxation by $2m whilst a 0.5% decrease would increase it by $3m.
A one year increase in the assumed life expectancy of the average 60 year old male pension plan member in both the UK and US would increase the combined deficit by $24m.
In making these judgements, management takes   assumptionsagainst external data.
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
The Group selects its discount rate by benchmarking against published indices and by consultation with its actuaries.
The principal index used for benchmarking is the iBOXX Corporate AA index for bonds with terms  defined benefit payments.
See Note 35 of the Notes to the Group Accounts for a summary of how the assumptions selected in the last five years .
31 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects Contingenciesand Provisions The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the  .
The estimation of the liability for the costs of the macrotextured product withdrawal for which coverage has been declined is dependent upon two main variables.
These are the number of implant revisions that will ultimately be  of settlements withpatients.
 double the current estimate the cost would increase by approximately $30m.

The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.
Although it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take several years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge management takes into account the views of internal and .
2008YEAR The following discussion and analysis is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the Group AccountsofSmith& inthisAnnualReport.
Financial Highlightsof 2008 Group revenue was $3,801m for the year ended 31 December 2008, representing 13% growth compared to 2007.
Profit before taxation was $564m, compared with $469m in 2007.
Attributable profit was $377m compared with $316m in2007.
Adjusted attributable profit calculated as set out inSelected FinancialData, rose 3% to $493m in2008from$480min2007.
Basic earnings per Ordinary Share were 42.6 compared to 34.2 for 2007.
EPSA as set out in Selected FinancialData was , representinga7%increase.

iv 2008 includes $31m of acquisition related costs, $13m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses and $51m of amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles 2007 $29m of acquisition related costs, $31m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, $30m oflegalsettlement, and $30m .
Transactional and Translational Exchange The Groups principal markets outside the US are, in order of significance, Continental Europe, UK, Australia and Japan.
Revenues in these markets fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on consolidation.
During the year the average rates of exchange against the US Dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro strengthened from $1.37 to $1.46 7%, Sterling weakened from $2.00 to $1.84 -8%, the Swiss Franc strengthened from $0.83 to $0.92 11%, the Australian Dollarwas flat at $0.84andtheJapanese Yenstrengthened from118to103 13%.
The Groups principal manufacturing locations are in the US Orthopaedics and Endoscopy, Switzerland Orthopaedics and in the UK Advanced Wound Management and Orthopaedics.
The majority of the Groups selling and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase finished products from these locations.
As a result of currency movements compared with the previous year, purchases from the US and Switzerland became relatively less expensive.
The Groups policy of purchasing forward a proportion of its currency requirements mitigates theimpactofthese movements.
Underlying revenue growth was 6%, an additional 5% as a result of acquisitions and 2% attributable to favourable currency translation.
Orthopaedics revenues increased by $300m or 16%, of which 5% was attributable to underlying growth, 9% due to the acquisition of Plus and 2% due to favourable currencytranslation.
Endoscopy revenues increased by $68m or 9%, of which 8% was attributable to underlying growth and 1% due to favourable currency translation.
Advanced Wound Management revenues increased by $64m or 8%, of which 7% was attributable to underlying growthand1%duetofavourable currencytranslation.
A more detailed analysis is included within the Revenue sections of the individual business segments that follow onpages 36and37.
33 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects Cost of goodssold Cost of goods sold increased by $83m to $1,077m from $994m in2007.
The maindriver of this increase was the growth in revenues across the Group.
Other factors contributing to the movement were the decrease of $49m in the utilisation of the Plus inventory stepped up to fair value on the acquisition, offset by an increase of $2m in  costs andanincreaseof$.
Further margin analysis is included within the Trading Profit sections of the individual business segments that followonpages 36to37.
Marketing, sellingand distribution expenses These expenses increased by $158m to $1,436m from $1,278m in 2007.
The increase was largely a result of increasedmarketing,  .
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses increased by $46m to $533m from $487m in 2007, largely as a result of the growth in the business.
This increase includes $14m relating to impairment of acquisition intangibles, $7m due to a full years amortisation charge on Plus intangibles in comparison to 2007, $18m reduction in restructuring and  $ settlement.
Research and developmentexpenses Expenditure as a percentage of revenue fell from 4.2% in 2007 to 4.0% in 2008.
The Group continues to invest in  itself fromcompetitors.
BSN agency and management fees Agency and management fees of $27m 2007 $25m were received in respect of services provided to BSN Medical for sales force resource, physical distribution and logistics and administration in certain countries.

Operating profit Operating profit increased by $137m to $630m from $493m in 2007 comprising increases of $139m in Orthopaedicsand$5minEndoscopy, offset byadeclineof$7minAdvanced WoundManagement.
Net interest payable Net interest payable increased by $36m from $30m in2007 to $66m in2008.
Other finance costs income Other finance costs in 2008 were $1m down from $6m income in 2007.
This is attributable to an increase in interest costs onpensionliabilities.
Taxation The taxation charge increased by $34m to $187m from $153m in 2007.
The effective rate of tax before discontinued operations was 33.2%, compared with 32.6% in 2007.
The tax charge was reduced by $30m in 2008 2007 $49m as a consequence of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, acquisition related costs, the legal settlement and amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles.
The effective tax rate was 30.6% 200729.6% after adjusting forthese items andthetax thereon.
Intangible assets and goodwill decreased by $79m of which $42m related to currency translation, $69m to amortisation and impairment and a $2m adjustment to contingent consideration offset by an increase of $33m relating to additions and $1m relating to acquisitions.
Property, plant and equipment decreased by $17m comprising additions of $259m, less currency translation of $57m, depreciation of $204m and disposals of $15m.
Deferred tax assets increased by $78m in theyear,  .
Current assets increased by $66m to $1,985m from $1,919m in 2007.
This was due to an increase in inventory of $45m and an increase in trade and other receivables of $46m.
These increases were partially offset by a reductionincashat bankof$25m.
Non-current liabilities increased by $1,484m from $357m in 2007 to $1,841m in 2008.
$1,322m of this increase was predominantly due to the reclassification of long-term borrowings from short-term borrowings following the Groups decision to exercise its option to extend the multicurrency loan facility for a further four years in May 2008.
The retirement benefit obligation increased by $166m, which was mainly as a result of a reduction in asset values, in line with falling share prices offset by an increase in the corporate bond rate.
Deferred tax liabilities decreased by$11m, otherpayables decreased by$$18m.
Current liabilities decreased by $1,320m from $2,288m in 2007 to $968m in 2008.
The primary cause of this decrease was the reclassification of borrowings to long-term following the Groups decision to exercise its option  inMay2008.
The principal movements were an increase of $377m in attributable profit offset by $99m from translation losses, $215m actuarial losses on defined benefit pension plans which was offset by $71m of taxation charged to equity, $109m of equity $.
Of this increase, 5% is attributable to underlying growth, 2% is due to favourable currency movements and 9% is due to the effect of the acquisition of Plus.
The principal factors in the underlying growth in revenue were the continuing expansion in global orthopaedic markets, the growth of   forces.
In the US, revenue increased by $95m to $1,127m 9% of which8% was underlyinggrowthand 1% as a result of the Plus acquisition effected in 2007.
The main factors were the continued growth of products launched in recent years includingtheLEGION andJOURNEY knees, andBHR.

Trading Profit Trading profit rose by $58m 14% to $481m from $423min2007.
This decrease reflects the consolidation of lower margin Plus sales, the margin impact of Plus lost sales and increased compliance costs, together exceeding the operational improvements the business has been making.
36 Operating Profit Operating profit increased by $139m.
This largely comprises the $58m increase in trading profit, a $50m decrease inacquisitionrelated costs anda$30mlegal settlement in2007.

This included $12m of acquisition related costs and $4m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses.
A further $78m was due to the inclusion of seven months of Plus expenditure with the remaining increase a result of increased selling and marketingcosts .
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses increased by $201m to $487m in 2007 from $286m in 2006.
This includes an increase in acquisition related costs and amortisation of acquisition intangibles of $9m and $16m respectively, due to the acquisitions of Plus and BlueSky.
In 2007, there were also restructuring and rationalisation expenses of $31m and costs of $30m from the legal settlement.
A further $21m increase arose due to the inclusion of the expenditure of the Plusbusiness.
Research and Developmentexpenses Expenditure as a percentage of revenue fell from 4.3% to 4.2%.
The Group continues to invest in innovative  itself fromcompetitors.
BSN agency and management fees Agency and management fees of $25m 2006 $25m were received in respect of services provided to BSN Medical for sales force resource, physical distribution and logistics and administration in certain countries.

Net interest payable receivable Net interest decreased by $40m from $10m receivable in 2006 to $30m payable in 2007.
This was a direct consequence of the additional borrowings put in place to finance the Plus acquisition and the share buy-back programme.
39 OFR, Liquidity & Prospects Other finance income Other finance income increased by $3m to $6m in 2007 from $3m in 2006.
This is mainly due to the fact that 2006 included a loss of $3m on a financial instrument purchased to hedge the anticipated proceeds of the BSN Medicaldisposal fromEurosintoUS Dollars.
Taxation The taxation charge decreased by $3m to $153m in 2007 from $156m in 2006.
The effective rate of tax before discontinued operations was 32.6%, compared with 28.9% in 2006.
The tax charge was reduced by $49m in 2007 as a consequence of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, acquisition related costs, the legal settlement and amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
The effective tax rate was 29.6% after adjusting for these items andthetax thereon.
Discontinued operations net profit on disposal of the Joint Venture On 23 February 2006 the Group sold its 50% interest in the BSN Medical joint venture for cash consideration of $562m.
The net profit of $351m on the disposal of the joint venture is after a credit of $14m for cumulative translation adjustments, charges of $27m for transaction and associated costs, provision for indemnity of $3m  ofunutilisedtaxation provisionsof$23m.
Intangible assets and goodwill increased by $813m of which $771m related to the acquisitions of Plus and BlueSky, $16m came from additions to other intangibles, currency translation added $72m and amortisation reduced the balance by $46m.
Property, plant and equipment increased by $107m comprising $78m relating to acquisitions, additions of $202m, $23mless depreciationof$ of$15m.
This was mainly due to the Plus acquisition which was the principal cause of the increase in inventory of $215m and the increase in trade and otherreceivables of$235m.
Non-current liabilities increased by $116m from $241m in 2006 to $357m in 2007.
$21m of this increase was due to increases in long term borrowings.
The retirement benefit obligation increased by $30m, $22m of which was due to the Plus acquisition.
Deferred tax liabilities increased by $22m and other payables increased by $44m as a result of additional long term acquisition consideration.
These increases were partially offset by an decrease inprovisionsof$1m.
Current liabilities increased by $1,472m from $816m in 2006 to $2,288m in 2007.
The main cause of this increase was the $1,323m increase in borrowings arising from the acquisition of Plus and the share buy-back programme.
The principal movements were an increase of $316m from attributable profit and $47m from transactional exchange offset by $104m of equity $.
Of this movement, 13% is attributable to underlying growth, 4% due to favourable currency movements and 13% due to the effect of the acquisition of Plus.
The principal factors in the underlying growth in revenues were the continuing expansion in global orthopaedic markets and the growth of .
In the US, revenue increased by $149m to $1,032m 17% of which 16% was underlying growth and 1% as a result of acquisitions.
The main factors were the continued growth of products launched in recent years including the LEGION and JOURNEY knees and BHR.
An increase in the Clinical Therapies sales force also contributed towards increasedEXOGEN andSUPARTZ revenuesof22%and10%respectively.
