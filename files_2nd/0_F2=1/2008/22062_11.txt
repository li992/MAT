Annual dividends are based on the years to which they relate, rather than the years in which they are recognised as required under IFRS.
The elective special dividends paid in July 2004 and July 2006 and consequent cancellations of shares are not included above.
Net asset value includes deductions for dividends on the ex-dividend date.
