Regulation Our discussions with the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York USAO are continuing in line with the Boards expectations.
These discussions have made good progress and the Company continues to negotiate the terms of a possible settlement with the USAO.
However, the terms of any settlement have not yet been finalised and there can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached between the Company and the USAO.
The fact that certain online gaming businesses continue to offer real money games to customers in the US is a frustration, particularly given their ability to deploy USgenerated profits into competitive international markets.
However, we hope that this is a situation that will not last and believe that the US enforcement agencies will ultimately take action in this area.
In Europe, after some early progress with letters of formal notice being sent by the European Commission EC to both Sweden and Germany and reasoned opinions being sent to both Greece and the Netherlands during the first half of 2008, the process of taking Member States to task for suspected breaches of EU law appears to have hit political obstacles, with little progress being made in the second half of the year.
