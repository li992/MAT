The arrangements also require partners to undertake development work and or supply components for use in the programme at their own expense.
No accounting entries are recorded where partners undertake such development work or where programme components are supplied by partners because no obligation arises unless and until programme sales are made: instead, payments to partners for their share in the programme are charged to cost of sales as programme revenues arise.

Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine the tax charge included in the financial statements.
If the tax eventually payable or reclaimable differs from the amounts originally estimated then the difference will be charged or credited in the financial statements for the year in which it is determined.

The principles adopted are: Underlying revenues Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, these exclude the release of the foreign exchange transition hedging reserve and reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
Underlying profit before financing Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, this excludes the release of the foreign exchange transition hedging reserve and reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts.
In 2007, this also excluded 130m of past service post-retirement costs.
Underlying profit before taxation In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing: Includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts.
Excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changes in value of financial RRSP contracts arising from changes in forecast payments and the net impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.

3 During 2007, as part of its ongoing discussions with the Trustees of its UK pension schemes, the Group agreed to reect changes in HM Revenue & Customs practice and increase the size of the lump sum payment retirees are able to receive by commuting part of the pension.
Like many other employers, the Group also increased the amount of the lump sum payment for the pension commuted.
Updating the commutation arrangements to reect these factors increased the post-retirement liability by 100m.
The Group also agreed a 2 per cent discretionary increase applicable to pensions that do not benefit from any guaranteed increase, which increased the liability by 30m.

Energy 73 54 Other Various 28 30 1,008 801 Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2008 on the following basis: The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash ows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions.
Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Groups products product lives are often measured in decades, these typically forecast the next ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates that reect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash ow projections for the most recent forecast are based are discount rates, growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
The pre-tax cash ow projections have been discounted at 12.75 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The principal value in use assumptions for significant goodwill balances are: Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG volume of engine deliveries, ying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation, based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customerseet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash ows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent.
The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
A doubling of the discount rate would not lead to an impairment of this balance.
Vinters plc volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation, based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash ows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 4 per cent.
It would require a doubling of the discount rate to cause an impairment of this balance.

Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
2 These primarily comprise floating rate convertible loan stock.
The conversion conditions are such that fair value approximates to the book value.
3 Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
4 Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not readily available principally in respect of derivatives, borrowings and financial RRSPs, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash ows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.

The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
From January 1, 2005, the Group has not included foreign exchange or commodity financial instruments in any cash ow hedging relationships for accounting purposes.

These financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost method.
This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash ows of the arrangements using the internal rate of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate.

Risk management policies and hedging activities The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash ows most signicantly US dollars, followed by the euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash ows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The profile of the maturity of the Groups committed facilities is discussed in the Finance Directors review.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Groups risk management activities.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with single A or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its xed rate borrowings fair value risk, oating rate borrowings, cash and cash equivalents cash ow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate prole within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
These are designated as either fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash ow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to one month.
The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.

Some of the Groups borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants.
If the Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities.
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Groups facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a given movement in the Groups credit rating.
In addition, the Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available as follows: 2008 2007 m m Expiring within one year Expiring in one to two years Expiring thereafter 650 450 650 450 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 124 16 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies.
The most significant transactional currency exposures are US dollar with sterling and US dollar with euro.
At December 31, 2008 if sterling had weakened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 890m lower 2007 329m.
If sterling had strengthened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 728m higher 2007 269m.
There would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives.
At December 31, 2008 if the euro had weakened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity for the year would have been 102m lower 2007 73m.
If the euro had strengthened ten per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 84m higher 2007 60m.
At December 31, 2008 if the price of commodities had been ten per cent lower, with all other variables remaining constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 13m lower 2007 16m, arising mainly as the result of lower fair value gains on derivative contracts.
If the price of commodities had been ten per cent higher, with all other variables remaining constant, profit after tax and equity would have been 13m higher 2007 16m, arising mainly as the result of higher fair value gains on derivatives.
There would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
At December 31, 2008 the Group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date.
The main interest rate sensitivity for the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 61 and 62.
B Shares and payments to shareholders From July 2004 to July 2008, the Company issued non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares B Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
B Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders were able to redeem any number of their B Shares for cash or convert them into ordinary shares.
Any B Shares retained attracted a dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and had limited voting rights.
In certain circumstances the Company had the option to compulsorily redeem the B Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of B Shares in issue was less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of B Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
The Company exercised this option in September 2008 and redeemed all B Shares then in issue.
Since January 2009, following approval by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting, the Company has issued non-cumulative redeemable preference shares C Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
The only significant difference is that C Shares, unlike B Shares, will not carry the right to convert into ordinary shares.
Movements in the B Shares during the year were as follows: 2008 2007 B Shares of Nominal B Shares of Nominal 0.1p each value 0.1p each value Millions m Millions m Authorised At January 1, and December 31 1,000,000 1,000 1,000,000 1,000 Issued and fully paid At January 1 15,859 16 12,616 13 Issued 236,740 237 172,006 172 Converted into ordinary shares 52,524 53 71,819 72 Redeemed 200,075 200 96,944 97 At December 31 15,859 16 Payments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of B Shares or C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.

The Groups captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
significant delays occur in the notication and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.
Customer nancing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and or nancing.
These guarantees are considered to be insurance contracts in nature and provision is made in accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These guarantees, the risks arising and the process used to assess the extent of the risk are described under the headingSales nancingin the Finance Directors review on page 62.
The related contingent liabilities arising from these guarantees and the sensitivity to movements in the value of the underlying security are discussed in note 23.
Based on the assumptions used to estimate the customer finance provision, it is estimated that the provision will be utilised as follows: 2008 2007 m m Potential claims with specific claim dates: In one year or less 1 In more than one year but less than five years 6 3 In more than five years 27 14 Potential claims that may arise at any time by date of expiry of the guarantee: Up to one year 31 16 Up to five years 4 4 Thereafter 5 6 73 44 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 126 18 Post-retirement benets The Group operates a number of dened benefit and dened contribution schemes.
For the UK dened benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and employees are entitled to retirement benets based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service.
Overseas dened benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benets for retired employees.
The valuations of the dened benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, updated by the scheme actuaries to December 31, 2008.
The most recent funding valuations of the main UK schemes were: Scheme Valuation date Rolls-Royce Pension Fund March 31, 2006 Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme April 5, 2007 Vickers Group Pension Scheme March 31, 2007 Amounts recognised in the income statement 2008 2007 UK Overseas UK Overseas schemes schemes Total schemes schemes Total m m m m m m Dened benefit schemes: Current service cost 127 27 154 100 25 125 Past service cost 53 8 131 2 133 Ex-gratia payment paid directly by the Group 8 8 140 30 170 231 27 258 Dened contribution schemes 6 20 26 3 17 20 Operating cost 146 50 196 234 44 278 Financing income costs in respect of dened benefit schemes: Expected return on assets 352 21 373 367 17 384 Interest on liabilities 358 37 395 323 31 354 6 16 22 44 14 30 Total income statement charge 152 66 218 190 58 248 The operating cost is charged as follows: Dened benefit Dened contribution Total 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m m m Cost of sales 124 223 19 15 143 238 Commercial and administrative costs 33 26 5 4 38 30 Research and development 13 9 2 1 15 10 170 258 26 20 196 278 Amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 2008 2007 m m Actuarial gain on scheme assets 178 161 Experience gains on scheme liabilities 766 350 Movement in unrecognised surplus 928 112 16 399 In December 2007, PaySave was introduced in the UK.
This a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result, there has been a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 38m 2007 3m in the year.
Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 127 18 Post-retirement benets continued Dened benefit schemes Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2008 2007 UK Overseas UK Overseas schemes schemes schemes schemes %% %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 3.9 5.0 3.8 1 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.9 0.5 3.5 0.4 Discount rate 6.4 6.1 5.8 6.0 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 4.1 6.9 5.4 7.5 Inflation assumption 3.0 2.6 3.5 2.5 1 Benets accruing after April 5, 2005 are assumed to increase in payment at a rate of 2.1 per cent.
The discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
For the main UK schemes, the rate is determined by using the prole of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
For less significant UK schemes and overseas schemes, the rate is determined as the market yield at the average duration of the forecast benefit payments.
The discount rates above are the weighted average of those for each scheme, based on the value of their respective liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual returns expected from each asset class see below in accordance with the actual asset balance in the schemesinvestment portfolios.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 actuarial tables, with medium cohort, published by the Institute of Actuaries, projected forward and, where appropriate, adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
The resulting range of life expectancies in the principal UK schemes are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 Current pensioner 17.5 years to 22.2 years Future pensioner 19.5 years to 23.9 years Other demographic assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the schemes.
Assumptions in respect of overseas schemes are also set in accordance with advice from local actuaries.
The future costs of healthcare benets are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of 8.9 per cent grading down to 5.0 per cent over seven years.

The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rate of return for LDI portfolios is determined by the implicit yield on the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
The expected rates of return on other individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to gilt yields.
In the UK, equities and corporate bonds are assumed to generate returns that exceed the return from gilts by 3.25 per cent and 1.75 per cent per annum respectively.
The expected rates of return above are the weighted average of the rates for each scheme.
Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 129 18 Post-retirement benets continued Future contributions The Group expects to contribute approximately 292m to its dened benefit schemes in 2009.
Sensitivities The revised investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation on an economic basis.
A reduction of 0.25 per cent in the discount rate would increase the obligations of the principal UK defined benefit schemes by approximately 220m.
An equivalent movement in interest rates would increase the fair value of the assets by approximately 320m.
The difference arises largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting and economic purposes.
On an economic basis the correlation is in excess of 85 per cent.
The principal remaining risks relate to the assumptions for mortality and increases in salaries.
If the age ratings in respect of the principal UK defined benefit schemes were increased by one year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 118m.
If the rate of increase in salaries were 0.5 per cent higher, scheme liabilities would increase by 100m.
The dened benefit obligation relating to post-retirement medical benets would increase by 50m if the healthcare trend rate increases by one per cent, and reduce by 41m if it decreases by one per cent.
The pension expense relating to post-retirement medical benets, comprising service cost and interest cost, would increase by 5m if the healthcare trend increases by one per cent, and reduce by 4m if it decreases by one per cent.

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 131 21 Share-based payments Share-based payment plans in operation during the year The Group had the following share-based payment plans in operation during the year: Performance Share Plan PSP This plan involves the award of shares to participants subject to performance conditions.
Vesting of the performance shares is based on the achievement of both non-market based conditions EPS and Cash Flow Per Share and a market based performance condition Total Shareholder Return TSR.
ShareSave share option plan Based on a three or five year monthly savings contract, eligible employees are granted share options with an exercise price of up to 20 per cent below the share price when the contract is entered into.
Vesting of the options is not subject to the achievement of a performance target.
In the UK, the plan is HM Revenue & Customs approved.
Overseas, employees in 33 countries participate in ShareSave plans through arrangements which provide broadly comparable benets to the UK plan.
From 2007 onwards, the overseas plans are cash-settled schemes.
Executive Share Option Plan ESOP This plan involves the grant of market value share options to participants.
The options are subject to a non-market based performance condition growth in EPS.
The options have a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Following the introduction of the PSP, it is not intended to grant any further executive share options.
Annual Performance Related Award APRA plan deferred shares Deferred shares are awarded as part of the APRA plan.
One third of the value of any annual bonus is delivered in the form of a deferred share award.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for two years from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares.
During the two year deferral period, participants are entitled to receive dividends, or equivalent, on the deferred shares.
Share Incentive Plan SIP There is aFree Shareelement of the UK Share Incentive Plan.
Eligible employees may receive shares with a value of up to one and a half weekssalary as part of any bonus paid.
There are no conditions attached to the shares.
Further information regarding the operation of the plans can be found on pages 71 and 72 of the  report.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants under these plans made after November 7, 2002 and unvested at January 1, 2005.
During the year the Group recognised a total expense of 40m 2007 36m, of which 0.4m 2007 0.1m related to cash-settled arrangements.
At December 31, 2008, the Group had a liability of 0.6m 2007 0.2m relating to cash-settled arrangements.

The average share price during the year was 382p 2007 510p.
Fair values The weighted average fair values per share for PSP awards, ShareSave grants, APRA deferred share awards, and SIP Free Share awards included in the expense for the year were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Pence Pence Pence Pence Pence PSP awards 458p 557p 494p 282p 249p ShareSave 3 year grants 230p 131p ShareSave 5 year grants 264p 154p APRA deferred share awards 440p 502p 448p 260p 220p SIP Free Share awards 439p 499p 462p 257p 231p Details of the assumptions used in the calculation of these fair values are set out below.
Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the seven years prior to the grant or award date.
Until 2007, expected dividends were based on the Companys payments to shareholders over the five years prior to the grant or award date.
From 2008, expected dividends were based on the Company's payments to shareholders in respect of 2007. Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 133 21 Share-based payments continued PSP awards The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP are calculated using the market value of shares at the time of the award adjusted to take into account non-entitlement to dividends or equivalent during the vesting period and the TSR performance condition.
The PSP fair values were calculated using the following assumptions: 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 430p 501p 444p 262p 233p Expected dividends 13.00p 8.30p 7.92p 7.81p 7.61p Volatility 29% 29% 32% 34% 35% Correlation 29% 26% 19% 19% 22% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk free interest rate 4.1% 5.2% 4.3% 4.9% 5.2% As explained on page 71 of the  report, the PSP has a TSR market-based performance condition, such that the Companys TSR over the performance period will be compared with the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index on the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR exceeds the median TSR of the FTSE 100, the number of shares that vest will be increased by 25 per cent.
The fair value of an award of shares under the PSP has been adjusted to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave awards The fair value of options granted under the ShareSave plan are calculated using a binomial pricing model with the following assumptions: 2007 2005 2003 Weighted average share price 553p 351p 173p Exercise price 416p 298p 142p Volatility 37% 40% 43% Expected dividends 8.80p 7.86p 7.61p 1 Expected life 3 year ShareSave 3.3-3.8 years 3.3-3.8 years 3.2-3.7 years 5 year ShareSave 5.3-5.8 years 5.3-5.8 years 5.2-5.7 years Close periods: From January 1 6 weeks 6 weeks 6 weeks From July 1 1 month 1 month 1 month Risk free interest rate 5.0% 4.4% 4.6% 1 The binomial pricing model assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
Deferred shares under APRA and Free Shares under SIP The fair value of shares awarded under these plans is calculated as the share price on the date of the award.

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 Financial statements Corporate governance Business review Rolls-Royce Group plc | Annual report 2008 135 23 Contingent liabilities In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide nancing support for its customers.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to nancing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed on a discounted basis.
As the directors consider the likelihood of these contingent liabilities crystallising to be remote, this amount does not represent a value that is expected to crystalise.
However, the amounts are discounted at the Groups borrowing rate to reect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
The contingent liabilities are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not adopt cash flow hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The discounted values of contingent liabilities relating to delivered aircraft and other arrangements where financing is in place, less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions, were: 2008 2007 m US$m m US$m Gross contingent liabilities 755 1,086 616 1,227 1 Contingent liabilities net of relevant security 155 222 140 279 2 Contingent liabilities net of relevant security reduced by 20% 246 354 218 434 1 Security includes unrestricted cash collateral of: 85 123 60 120 2 Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20 per cent illustrates the sensitivity of the contingent liability to changes in this assumption.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant nancing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.
