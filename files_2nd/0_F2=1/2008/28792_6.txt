STATUS OF COMPANY The Company is registered as a public company and is incorporated in England and Wales.
The Company conducts its affairs so as to qualify for approval as an investment trust for tax purposes, confirmation of which has been received from HM Revenue & Customs for the year ended 31 March 2007.
Approval for the year ended 31 March 2007 is subject to no subsequent enquiry being made under the Corporation Tax Self Assessment legislation.
The Directors are of the opinion that, since that date, the Company has conducted its affairs in a manner which will satisfy the conditions for continued approval as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Taxes Act 1988.
The Company is not a close company within the meaning of the Taxes Act 1988.
The Companys subsidiaries are engaged in investment activities and the activities of the Group are principally undertaken in the UK.
DIRECTORS Biographies of the Directors holding office at the date of this report are shown on pages 18 and 19.
Mr Christopher Hohn resigned as a director on 19 July 2007 and Mr John Cornish was appointed as a director on 1 January 2008.
There were no other changes in the Companys directorate during the year ended 31 March 2008.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS After taxation, the Group made a capital profit of 10.0 million and a revenue profit of 68.6 million during the year ended 31 March 2008.
The Board recommends the payment of a final dividend of 4.0p per share in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008 year ended 31 March 2007: 3.1p, payable on 23 July 2008 to shareholders on the register at 13 June 2008.
This dividend will reduce the Companys distributable reserves by 6.2 million.
The movements on capital reserve and consolidated revenue reserve are shown in notes 22 and 23 on pages 67 and 68.
SHARE CAPITAL Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 20 on page 67 of the accounts.
During the year ended 31 March 2008, no ordinary shares were issued and a total of 1,355,585 ordinary shares were repurchased and cancelled in accordance with the shareholders authority granted on 19 July 2007.
The shares were repurchased at prices between 988p and 1,040p per ordinary share.
The existing authority for the repurchase of shares expires on 30 September 2008 and a replacement authority is to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting, as explained in the Notice and Explanatory Notes on pages 90 and 95.
NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value of one ordinary share at 31 March 2008, before deducting the proposed dividend, was 1,091.6p.
INVESTMENT POLICY The Companys Corporate Objective is: to deliver long-term capital growth, while preserving shareholders capital: to invest without the constraints of a formal benchmark, but to deliver for shareholders increases in capital value in excess of the relevant indices over time.
The Companys Investment Policy is: to invest in a widely diversified, international portfolio across a range of asset classes, both quoted and unquoted: to allocate part of the portfolio to exceptional managers in order to ensure access to the best external talent available.
The Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority require closed-ended investment funds to publish information about the policies that the fund will follow relating to asset allocation, risk diversification and gearing, including maximum exposures.
212016 RIT R&A pp20-pp39 29 5 08 19:20 Page 21 21 Asset allocation The Board currently intends to continue to allocate the Groups assets predominantly amongst quoted equities, hedge funds, long equity funds, unquoted investments, private equity partnerships, government securities and money market funds, and properties.
There are no restrictions in the relative allocation of assets amongst these classes and the maximum exposure of any single asset class is therefore 100%, subject to the investment trust restrictions incumbent upon the Company, which require that the Companys income from shares and securities must be at least 70% of its total income, thus automatically limiting the allocation of assets to areas such as property.
In addition the Group uses derivatives to hedge various risk exposures and also to increase exposure to movements in individual securities, markets and currencies where desired.
The allocation amongst these asset classes at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2008 is shown on page 3.
Risk diversification The Groups investment portfolio is highly diversified by asset class, geography and currency.
The portfolio is further diversified through the selection of external managers with different mandates.
At 31 March 2008, 62.4% of the quoted portfolio was delegated to external managers, themselves under obligations to maintain appropriate risk diversification.
The names of these external managers who manage segregated investment accounts for the Group are listed on page 23.
The remainder of the quoted portfolio is managed internally by the executive management under the supervision of the Board.
The Groups investments in hedge funds, long equity funds, private equity partnerships and certain of the investments in money market funds are also externally managed and provide additional diversification.
The Company also complies with the requirements of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
Gearing The Company maintains structural gearing principally through three term loans.
At 31 March 2008, the Sterling equivalent of the indebtedness under the term loans was 360.4 million, against total assets of 2,171.2 million, or 16.6%.
This percentage may fluctuate between 0% and 45%, which is the approximate equivalent of the maximum total indebtedness of the Company currently permitted under the financial covenants of the senior lender.
Were it not for these, the maximum indebtedness that the Company is empowered to incur under its Articles of Association is five times its adjusted capital and reserves, as defined.
Cross holdings The UKLA Listing Rules also require closed-ended investment companies to disclose quarterly all of their investments in other closed-ended investment funds which themselves do not have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds.
RIT Capital Partners plc has made no such statement, but complies with the separate UKLA Listing Rule limiting the aggregate of such investments to 10% of its total assets.
BUSINESS REVIEW The Company invests with the object of achieving long-term capital growth.
The investment portfolio was valued at 1,911.2 million at 31 March 2008.
An analysis of these investments is contained in the Investment Review on pages 6 to 17 and note 11 on pages 58 to 61.
The Group holds both listed and unlisted investments, mainly in the USA, the UK, Europe and the Far East.
The Chairmans Statement on pages 4 and 5 of this annual report and the Investment Review contain a review of the Groups business in the year to 31 March 2008.
Financial Highlights and Performance information is set out on page 2, and the portfolio and currency exposure is analysed on page 3.
The principal risks are as set out in note 26 on pages 70 to 83.
The Directors consider that the Key Performance indicators most relevant to the Group are the three indices as set out under Performance on page 2, compared with the movement in the Groups net asset value per share, also as set out on that page.
At the present time, the portfolio meets the requirements to enable the shares of the Company to be included as an investment within an Individual Savings Account ISA.

Additional details of the fees payable to Atticus Global and Sofaer Capital are shown below, as members of those firms senior management are Directors of the Company.
The other investment managers charge fees based on a percentage of the funds under management in the range from 0% to 1.5% per annum and, in certain cases, performance fees are charged where the increase in the value of the funds exceeds specified hurdles.
The assets in the segregated account managed by Martin Currie at 31 March 2008 included other funds separately managed by Martin Currie, but the fees charged by these funds were deducted from the investment management fee which would otherwise have been payable to Martin Currie.
The Companys managed account arrangements with Martin Currie have been exchanged since the year-end for direct investments in certain funds under Martin Curries management.
The Company acquired an equity stake in Martin Currie during the year ended 31 March 2008.
None of the other amounts listed in the table above is invested in other funds managed by the investment managers themselves and therefore there is no double-counting of investment management fees.
The investment management agreements can be terminated with notice periods of between one and six months.
Apart from the right to receive accrued fees, the investment management agreements do not provide for any other payment on termination.
The performance of each of the investment managers is reviewed regularly by the executive Directors and the Board as a whole.
The terms of the contracts between the Company and those managers are also reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate.
In the opinion of the Directors, the continuing appointment of the investment managers listed above gives the Company access to the expertise of managers who specialise in particular asset classes or geographical areas and is therefore in the best interests of shareholders.
The majority of the remainder of the investment portfolio is managed by the Companys executive management.
