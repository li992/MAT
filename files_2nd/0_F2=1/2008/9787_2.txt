This known footfall is analysed so that we can establish the ratios between the visits and sales, and then apply this to stores without cameras.
A total average footfall gure can then be calculated.
In 2007 08 there was a change in methodology and an upgrade in technology that means we are more accurately capturing customer footfall.
Previously we were under-stating our customer ow.
We switched to enhanced technology thermal image cameras that are more sensitive in picking up ow of individuals and separating groups of people as they walk into the store.
We also increased the sample of annualised stores from 33 to 260, weighted to represent the whole chain.
