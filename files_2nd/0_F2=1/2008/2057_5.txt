Australia: QGC Brazil: Santos Basin exploration In February 2008, BG Group announced an alliance with Queensland During 2008, there were very significant successes for BG Group Gas Company Limited QGC, a leading Australian coal seam gas and partners operating in the Santos Basin pre-salt, offshore CSG company supplying the Queensland market.
BG Group initially Brazil, with the Guar and Iara wells providing two further world acquired 20% of QGCs assets in the Surat Basin, south-west class discoveries.
These followed the super-giant Tupi discovery, Queensland, and a 9.9% stake in QGC.
In October 2008, BG Group announced in 2006, and the Carioca and Parati discoveries.
announced a recommended takeover bid for the company and now BG Groups net share of resources from these five discoveries has acquired control of QGC and Queensland Curtis LNG QCLNG.
amounts to more than 3 billion barrels oil equivalent.
In just one year, the Group is already close to the top of the range of its previous During 2008, material progress was achieved in exploration and net resources estimate of 2 to 3.5 billion barrels oil equivalent, first appraisal, increasing proved and probable reserves to 3.7 tcf and set out in February 2008. total resources to more than 11 tcf.
By 2015, BG Group intends to produce 225 000 boed of CSG, destined for both domestic markets BG Group and partners have sanctioned the first 100 000 bopd and for the QCLNG facility.

Production from the initial development phase on Guar Rapid progress has been made with the development of the QCLNG of up to 100 000 bopd is planned to commence in 2012.
A similar Project on Curtis Island, near Gladstone on the Queensland coast.
initial development phase of up to 100 000 bopd is planned for A 380 kilometre trunkline will bring the bulk of the gas to QCLNG, Iara in 2013. where the Group plans to manufacture around 7.4 mtpa of LNG, beginning in 2014.
There has been good progress with studies on BG Groups net production from the Santos Basin is planned to gas gathering and compression alternatives, ramp-up and water rise to more than 400 000 boed by 2020.
The Group estimates management options, and the design, routing and permitting of that Tupi, Guar and Iara meet their cost of capital at oil prices the trunkline to Curtis Island.
In February 2009, agreement was below US$40 per barrel, with scope for further technical innovation reached to acquire the QCLNG site.
