08 The Capita Group Plc A robust business Creating long term partnerships We create close, mutually beneficial working relationships and consistently deliver what we promise.
This establishes a strong platform on which to build long term, sustainable partnerships with our clients, employees and suppliers.
From day one of a new contract, we ensure there is no disruption to service and that all employees are supported through their transition to Capita.
Our focus then shifts to progressively improving processes, introducing IT and innovation, building a motivated and productive workforce and transforming the way services are delivered.
We select our suppliers with care, choosing those that fit best with our business needs and share our belief in quality service delivered through responsible business practices.
