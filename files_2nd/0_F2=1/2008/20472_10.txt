Share scheme charges have continued to increase, as additional awards are made under the Groups schemes, and the share price on which the charges are based has also increased over time.
2008 was also the first period in which existing awards vested.
Refer to note 25 for further detail on the Groups share schemes.
Expansion costs relate to pre-launch expenses incurred in the development of the international businesses.
Investments and cash Investment strategy The Groups conservative approach to investment was maintained during 2008, with no change in overall strategy, and little change in where funds were invested.
The key element of Group-wide investment strategy is capital preservation, with additional priorities focusing on low volatility in returns and high levels of liquidity.
The majority of insurance funds continue to be invested in AAA-rated money market funds, offering cash-like returns, same day liquidity, low risk and good diversification.

The significant fall in interest rates in the UK and Europe towards the end of 2008 explains this anomaly.
The average rate of return on the Groups invested sterling funds in 2008 was around 5.1%, compared to 5.6% in 2007.
The nature of the investments means that returns are closely linked to central bank target interest rates.
The significant cuts in these to date along with expectation of further cuts will mean that the Groups investment and interest income is expected to be materially lower in 2009.
The Group continues to believe that capital preservation and low volatility are the most critical investment objectives, and there are no current plans to materially change investment strategy.
The Group continues to generate significant amounts of cash, enabling the Group to pay a large portion of after-tax profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.
No debt financing is required to fund these payments.

Cash generated from nonunderwriting activities tends to match profits recognised.
Net cash declined in both 2007 and 2008, though this is offset by large flows into financial investments.
All years show net increases in combined cash and financial investments.
The main items contributing to the significant operating cash inflow are as follows:
