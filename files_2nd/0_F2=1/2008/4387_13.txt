Business review delivery of development projects A highly active year in 2007 set the scene for important development work and 2008 saw Danas experienced team focusing on three projects in the Groups core area of the North Sea.
On 29th December, the Grouse oil field Dana 50% in Central North Sea block 21 19 in GKA was brought into production.
The single subsea production well tied back to the Kittiwake platform delivered initial gross production of approximately 10,000 boepd.
As one of the more substantial remaining gas developments in the UK North Sea, Babbage Dana 40% continues to be the focus of major investment for Dana and its co-venturers.
Development plans received project sanction in April 2008, at a projected cost of 254 million.
The field lies in block 48 2a in the UK Southern North Sea, and will be produced via an unmanned platform, with gas exported via the existing West Sole pipeline to the Dimlington gas terminal.
Drilling of five horizontal multi-fractured wells will start in Spring 2009, with first gas expected early in 2010.
In the Netherlands, the E18-A development Dana 5% was sanctioned in April 2008 at an overall projected cost of 100 million.
The development, which will target reserves of approximately 200 billion cubic feet bcf, consists of a six slot satellite platform tied back to the F16-E field Dana 1.2% approximately 5km to the east.
Initial production will be from two existing suspended wells at approximately 80 mmscfd.
All the major contracts have been let and the project is on schedule to deliver first gas in 4Q 2009.
Good progress has also been made on the Barbara development project in the UK Central North Sea.
With Dana as operator, the partners Shell, Exxon, Eon Ruhrgas and Dyas have agreed on a unitised joint development with the neighbouring Phyllis field, which is owned by Shell and Esso.
Both of the gas-condensate fields have similar hydrocarbon and reservoir properties and neither requires further appraisal before development.
The joint development will share the costs of the pipeline to the host platform, share any host modifications, remove the requirement for separately metering the two fields, and reduce risk due to the increased number of wells.
The joint venture group is currently seeking commercial terms from potential host platforms and intends to choose a single host for detailed engineering work by mid 2009.
The project is planned to be sanctioned early in 2010 with first gas in 2011 dependant on availability of ullage in the host platforms and the timing and scope of host platform modifications.
In addition to the new developments, a number of infill drilling targets have been identified within Danas producing fields and these are currently being evaluated and prioritised relative to the Groups existing development and exploration programme.
The focus of further work is on potential drilling in the Cavendish and Johnston gas fields in the UK Southern North Sea, in the GKA oil area in the Central North Sea, on Otter in the Northern North Sea, in East Zeit and on each of the non-operated concessions in Egypt.
The Group ended 2008 with interests in 31 producing fields.
