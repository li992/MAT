Managers Report Ordinary Share Class Chris Turner MRICS Fund Manager 5 June 2008 I was caught off guard by the severity of the downturn in the property share market in the summer and autumn of 2007.
When I wrote my managers report in last years annual report the market was already cooling and I was expecting a relatively soft landing.
This proved to be false optimism to which the banking crisis put paid.
In my interim report my musings were far more pessimistic than those of the early summer, and, as it has turned out, a bit nearer the subsequent outcome.
I reported then that I had virtually eliminated gearing in the Ordinary share portfolio and sold down many of our higher leveraged stocks.
Since November I have made more net sales to take the balance sheet into modest net cash at the year end.
Performance In total return terms the Ordinary share NAV beat the FTSE EPRA NAREIT European Property Index by a whisker, falling 22.9% versus the benchmark return of minus 23.0%.
This very modest outperformance would not have occurred at all without the positive input of some 4.5m from share repurchases.
My two biggest mistakes were of timing and portfolio distribution.
I failed to spot the severity of the downturn early enough and was geared into the first series of share price falls.
I stayed with the UK overweight on value grounds when I should have switched more capital onto the Continent, particularly into France, Netherlands and Switzerland, and so benefited from the perceived prospect of a milder economic downturn and from Sterlings recent weakness.
Worse, the UK overweight is in effect a London 16 TR Property Investment Trust ORDINARY SHARES Managers Report continued See-Through Portfolio by Market % end March 2008 overweight, and here the credit problems have had an especially depressing impact on the Central London EPRA Index Ordinary Share 31 March 2008 Class Portfolio property specialist companies.

It was completed in 2002 at a time when the Slough office market was suffering from over-supply due to over-development and a reduction in demand as a result of the bursting of the dotcom bubble.
Having conducted detailed analysis of the market we considered that the building offered good potential returns given appropriate management and investment.
We purchased the property for 11.2 million 179 per sq ft including acquisition costs, well below the cost of replacement.
At this time the building was in considerable need of attention following a long period of neglect by the previous owner.
Over the first 6 months of ownership, the Trust spent approximately 1 million overhauling and re-commissioning all of the mechanical and electrical systems.
We also rebranded the building which had previously been known as New Century House and embarked on an active marketing campaign offering high quality office space to smaller companies on flexible terms.
