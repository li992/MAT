These markets create a total opportunity worth some two trillion US dollars over the next 20 years and: have very high barriers to entry: oer the opportunity for organic growth: feature extraordinarily long programme lives, usually measured in decades: can only be addressed through significant investments in technology, infrastructure and capability: and create a significant opportunity for extended customer relationships, with revenues from aftermarket services similar in size to original equipment revenues.
The size of these markets is generally related to world Gross Domestic Product GDP growth, or in the case of the defence markets, global security and the scale of defence budgets.

In such circumstances, even though there 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 may be no alternative engine choice available to the customer, only the contracted business is included in the order book.
Only the first seven years revenue of long-term aftermarket contracts is included.
Training and development Training is a core element of the Groups investment in its capability and is measured as the expenditure on the training and 0m Annual investment development of employees, customers and suppliers.
Eectiveness is ensured by using a range of external and internal sources, and by gathering user feedback.
