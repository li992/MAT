BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Performance review In terms of the continued renewal of our oil and natural gas resource Exploration and Production base, 2008 was one of our best years this decade for new discoveries.

Our performance in 2008 Profit before interest and tax for 2008 was $37.9 billion, an increase of 37% compared with 2007.
The increase was primarily driven by higher oil and gas realizations.
Our financial results are discussed in more detail on pages 52-53.
In 2008, nine major projects came onstream.
Production commenced at the Thunder Horse field, with four wells in operation by the end of the year, producing around 200,000boe d gross making us the largest producer in the Gulf of Mexico.
We also started oil production on our Deepwater Gunashli platform in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea.
Other significant successes included the start of oil and gas production at the Saqqara and Taurt fields in Egypt.
Production from our established centres including the North Sea, Alaska, North America Gas and Trinidad & Tobago, was on plan.
We are also increasing our ability to get more from fields by improving our overall recovery rates through developing and applying new technology.

By their nature, there is always some risk involved in the ultimate development and production of reserves, including, but not limited to, final regulatory approval, the installation of new or additional infrastructure as well as changes in oil and gas prices, changes in operating and development costs and the continued availability of additional development capital.

BP manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect inventory, non-proved resources and proved reserves.

This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and At the point of sanction, all booked reserves will be categorized as includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, proved undeveloped PUD.

Major development projects these proved reserve estimates are based on prices and costs as of the typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking of PUD date the estimate is made.
There was a rapid and substantial decline in reserves to the start of production.
Changes to reserves bookings may oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 that was not matched by a similar be made due to analysis of new or existing data concerning production, reduction in operating costs by the end of the year.

The principal reserves additions were in the US Arkoma, without the need for flow tests.
The general method of reserves assessment to determine Thunder Horse, Wamsutter, Trinidad Mango, Asia-Pacific Tangguh, reasonable certainty of commercial recovery which BP employs relies on the integration of three Angola Pluto, Saturno, Vnus and Marte, and Angola LNG and types of data: 1 well data used to assess the local characteristics and conditions of reservoirs and Azerbaijan ACG.
fluids: 2 field scale seismic data to allow the interpolation and extrapolation of these characteristics outside the immediate area of the local well control: and 3 data from relevant analogous fields.
Production Well data includes appraisal wells or sidetrack holes, full logging suites, core data and fluid samples.
BP considers the integration of this data in certain cases to be superior to a flow test in providing a Our total hydrocarbon production during 2008 averaged 2,517 thousand better understanding of the overall reservoir performance.
