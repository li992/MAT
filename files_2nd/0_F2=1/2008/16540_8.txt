Two brown field smelter projects, which will increase the production capacities of zinc and lead by 210,000 kt and 100,000 kt respectively, will be undertaken at Rajpura Dariba in Rajasthan, India.
We also expect to increase our silver Ore production at the Sindesar Khurd expansions at the Sindesar Khurd and production from the current levels of mine will be increased from 0.3 mtpa to Kayar mines will be completed in nearly 2.6 million ounces per year to a 1.5 mtpa.

Out of the total shipments, exports account for nearly 82.0% of total with the remainder being sold in the domestic market on an ex-mine basis primarily from Goa and Orissa.
The global market for iron ore continues to remain tight in the shortto mediumterm primarily due to new supply constraints, robust steel demand and logistical constraints associated with rail and port facilities and vessel shortages.
As a result of these market conditions, spot prices of iron ore are expected to remain tight, in the shortto medium-term.
We sold 266,000 tonnes pig iron in the full year FY 2008 consistent with the production, primarily in the domestic market.
Financial perFormance Revenues for post acquisition period of 11 months in FY 2008 were $888.9 million with an EBITDA of $585.6 million.
The revenues and EBITDA were higher quarter-on-quarter due to higher sales volumes, improved spot sales-to-long-term contract mix and higher sales realisation despite inflationary cost pressures.
