Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Making progress Making Speedy progress means never forgetting the basics, whilst carefully extending a valuable and trusted brand.
It means building the best company to work for, to do business with, to hire from and to invest in whenever and wherever we operate.
And whilst this year marks yet another year of profit growth, we never get complacent.
We continually strive for improvement.

Its cheaper to hire than it is to own, due to the costs of servicing an asset regularly, storing, transporting and repairing it.
Legislation is getting more onerous and complicated, further increasing the risk of ownership in terms of liability, compliance and obsolescence.
Hire allows for greater exibility of demand and availability.

qxd:Layout 1 13 6 08 10:17 Page 9 Crucial to our success is our depot footprint the largest in the UK.
Youre never far from a Speedy depot.
And weve taken this tried and tested business model overseas to Ireland.
In time, maybe well expand to other countries if our customers take us there.
In the UK and Republic of Ireland theres still work to be done though.
For example, in the UK were opening Multi-Service Centres where large and complex hire deals will take place, whilst still driving hard to grow the call and deliver and call and collect depots.
Over 95% of the UKs population are within one hours travel of a Speedy depot.
Wherever our customers go... well go too.
