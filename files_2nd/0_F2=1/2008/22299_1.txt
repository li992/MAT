Forward thinking and building for the future underpin the way we manage our business.
With a tradition in insurance dating back to 1922, Chaucer today has the underwriting capability to write over 600 million of premium income and is one of the ten largest managing agents at Lloyds.
2008 was a year of mixed fortunes for us.
Looking at the positives, even allowing for major market catastrophe losses such as Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, our underwriting performed well and generated 33 million profit.
Our gross written premiums increased by 27% to 741 million and our net earned premiums by 23% to 547 million.
how were doing In the past five years, we have produced an average annual return on equity of 18.7%.
Our total dividend of 5.5p for 2008 reflects the Boards on-going commitment to deliver optimum shareholder value across the insurance cycle.
However, there was also a significant downside to the year.
The global economic upheaval badly affected the investment part of our business, which made a loss of 71 million.
This resulted in Chaucer presenting a loss before tax of 26 million.
We have subsequently fide-risked our investment portfolio by exiting from equities and absolute return bond funds and by submitting redemptions for all our hedge fund investments.
Whilst acknowledging the impact of our investment performance, the strength of Chaucer as an underwriter provides a solid foundation for continued implementation of our plan to become one of the leading Lloyds insurers.
