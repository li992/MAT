The main factors in the reduction in fair value Impairments recognised at 31 December 2008 of these securities over the period were the effects from assets held directly or within Solitaire in of reduced market liquidity and negative market recognition of the first loss protection of sentiment.
The level of actual credit losses US$1.2 billion provided by HSBC through credit experienced was low in 2008, notwithstanding the enhancement were US$279 million 2007: nil, deterioration in the performance of the underlying based on a notional principal value of securities mortgages in the period as US house prices fell and which were impaired of US$570 million 2007: nil.
The absence of material credit The low level of impairment recognised in losses is judged to be attributable to the seniority of comparison with the deficit in the available-for-sale the tranches held by HSBC as well as the priority for cash flow held by these tranches.
