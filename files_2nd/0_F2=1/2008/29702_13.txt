The last accounting period for which the Company has been treated as approved by HM Revenue & Customs as meeting the qualifying criteria for investment trust status is the year ended 31 December 2007 and the Company has subsequently conducted its affairs so as to enable it to continue to qualify for such approval.

Accordingly, any dividends paid by the Company will be funded out of its revenue account.
The Companys investment objective is one of capital growth and it is anticipated that returns for shareholders will derive primarily from capital.
No final dividend is recommended for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: dividend of 6.5p per share.
Policy for payment of creditors It is the policy of the Company to settle all investment transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant markets in which it operates.
All other expenses are paid on a timely basis in the ordinary course of business.
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 December 2008 2007: Nil.
Purchase of shares for cancellation The Directors have not used the authority given to them at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 7 May 2008 to purchase any of the ordinary shares of the Company.
The total number of shares in issue on 1 April 2009 was 310,407,923 shares.
To provide maximum exibility, the Directors wish to renew the authority to purchase shares for cancellation.
A resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to 14.99% of the share capital in issue on 1 April 2009 will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for which notice is given on pages 83 to 85.
This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2010, unless revoked or varied earlier.
As at 1 April 2009, the Company held no shares in treasury.
Accordingly, the percentage gures in this and other sections of the report are all calculated exclusive of treasury shares.
The Directors believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to have a general authority for the Company to buy-back its ordinary shares in the market as they keep under review the share price discount to net asset value and the purchase of ordinary shares.
Purchases will only be made if they enhance net asset value and if the Directors consider that any purchase would be for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders, taking into account relevant factors and circumstances at the time.
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding at 1 April 2009 was 7,555,836, which represented approximately 2.4% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the Company were to purchase the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted by this resolution and by the existing buy-back authority given on 7 May 2008 for 20,845,758 shares then the options outstanding at 1 April 2009 would represent approximately 3.1% of the issued ordinary share capital.
However, the Directors do not presently intend to exercise the existing authority prior to its expiry on 6 May 2009.

If passed, Resolution 11 will give the Directors the power to allot equity securities as if the pre-emption provisions in Section 89 1 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply a up to an aggregate nominal amount of 3,104,079 equivalent to 1% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 1 April 2009 in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan 2001 and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan: b pursuant to rights issues and other pre-emptive issues: and c up to an aggregate nominal amount of 15,520,396 equivalent to 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 1 April 2009.
The Directors are seeking the authority referred to in paragraph c of Resolution 11 in order to provide exibility in raising monies and for general corporate purposes.
It is the intention of the Board that any equity securities allotted under this authority will be allotted at an effective premium to the estimated net asset value per ordinary share at the date of pricing of the issue of the relevant equity securities.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph b of Resolution 11 generally to issue relevant securities whenever they believe it is advantageous to shareholders to do so.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph a of Resolution 10 and paragraph a of Resolution 11 to grant options under part D of the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan to individuals seconded to the Company or its subsidiaries which, for this purpose, include joint ventures.
Options granted pursuant to this authority will nevertheless count towards limits on the number of new ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options.
