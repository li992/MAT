qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 20 3 09 19:09 Page 1 Serco is an international service company that combines commercial know-how with a deep public service ethos.
We improve services by managing people, processes, technology and assets more effectively.
National and local governments, which represent 90% of Sercos business, face profound challenges.
Despite intense budget pressures, they must continue to improve vital services and address rising public concerns over sustainability, security and service quality.
In todays economic climate, major private companies also face issues of cost, efficiency and quality.
The result is a growing demand for Sercos skills in redesigning organisations, improving processes and enabling people to deliver their best.
This expertise is rooted in a values-led culture and over 40 years experience in delivering public services, which has enabled us to build strong capabilities across different sectors.
Our Governing Principles underpin consistent delivery and customer satisfaction and our Management System allows us to react to changing times with innovation and agility.
