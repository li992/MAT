We enter the new financial year facing slowing global GDP growth and more challenging global economic trends, but given the strength and diversity of Diageos business, we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7% to 9%.
Together with the expected positive impact of exchange rate movements on reported results and our share buyback programme, this means we expect to deliver double-digit reported eps growth.

These funds have generally been used to fund acquisitions, share repurchases, to pay interest, dividends and taxes, and to fund capital expenditure.
Free cash flow decreased by 113 million to 1,252 million in the year ended 30 June 2008.
Cash generated from operations increased from 2,272 million to 2,305 million in the year ended 30 June 2008.
This 33 million increase primarily arose from an increase of 67 million in operating profit, an increase of 22 million in the dividend received from Mot Hennessy and a decrease of 38 million in property profits included in operating profit, partly offset by an incremental increase of 102 million in working capital.
