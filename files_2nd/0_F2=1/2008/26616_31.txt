FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Financial Performance Key performance indicators and financial objectives To measure our progress against our strategy we have selected four key performance indicators KPIs : growth in funds under management: growth in revenue: growth in diluted earnings per share: and post-tax return on equity.
Growing earnings per share and maintaining a high level of post-tax return on equity continue to be the basis for the Groups financial objectives and are also the performance criteria used for the Groups long-term incentive schemes, KPIs: as the Board believes that long-term shareholder value will be achieved through continued delivery of these objectives.
growth in funds under management Financial objectives Earnings per share is a measure that encapsulates the primary growth in revenue drivers of financial performance for the Group.
The earnings metric includes the measure of revenue that results from growth in diluted growing funds under management and the performance fee earnings per share income from the investment performance of the funds.
The maintenance of pre-tax margins as we grow demonstrates pos t-tax return our control over our expense base.
The denominator of on equity average shares outstanding reflects our policy of share repurchases and cancellation.
Return on equity is the measure to enable us to assess whether we are utilising shareholders equity efficiently.
Earnings per share Diluted earnings per share on continuing operations for the year increased 63% to 90.2 cents, compared to 55.4 cents for the prior year.
