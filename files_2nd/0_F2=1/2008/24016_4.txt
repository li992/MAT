Fund Managers Review making dramatic changes in strategy, as what looks right one day can look totally wrong the next day.
Managing gearing was the most important priority throughout the year.
Before the market turmoil began in August 2007 we had reduced gearing to the lowest level since 2000.
We kept gearing around the 10% level until the collapse of Lehman Brothers, then responded to sharply falling prices by buying shares in October 2008.
Gearing reached a peak level of 13.0% before returning to 12.2% by the year end.
The second priority was not to be a forced seller, but to be able to take advantage of those who were forced sellers.
We increased our committed bank facilities to 200m and in October 2008 bought 16m of shares when markets were awash with forced selling from investors who were over-extended.
Our third priority was to pre-empt the anticipated falls in the value of our private equity portfolio.
