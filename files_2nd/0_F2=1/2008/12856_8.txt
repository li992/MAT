QNA then provides the Army with timely and accurate logistics data for comprehensive studies and analyses.

we will take statistically valid samples of, say, a group of vehicles or other equipment: for instance, a sample of 100 vehicles of the same model used in different locations worldwide.
This enables us to show how the same model of vehicle performs in different areas, under different conditions in different terrains, whether in the US or overseas.
