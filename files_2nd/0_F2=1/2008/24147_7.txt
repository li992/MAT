REVIEW OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIs COMMENTARY ON KPIs We carry out an annual assessment of whether our KPIs continue Commentary on the KPIs is provided in the Financial Review, to remain appropriate.
Most of the KPIs that we reported last commencing on page 32.
Definitions for the KPIs are provided year remain unchanged.
However, return on embedded value on page 202. has replaced embedded value as a KPI because our focus is on improving returns rather than on the absolute value.
IFRS underlying dividend cover is also no longer considered a KPI because we believe dividend paying capacity is measured by shareholder cash generation and IFRS underlying profit before tax.
Although they are no longer KPIs, embedded value and IFRS underlying dividend cover remain important measures and are disclosed on pages 48 and 41 respectively.
