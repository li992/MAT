Employees We believe the happier our staff are, the better they will do their job.
This means that we constantly work to improve our staffs working environment.
We also try to make sure that the working day for our staff is as fun and rewarding as we can make it.
It is important for employees to understand the Companys goals and objectives.
We work to communicate this in as many ways as possible.
As an example, we encourage staff to attend our Annual Staff General Meeting SGM.
The SGM is arranged to enable staff to hear the views of the executive directors and some of the non-executive directors on a wide range of subjects including the performance of the Group and the market within which we operate: the experiences of nonexecutive directors within and outside of the Group: and the Groups share plans.
We believe that employing well-informed staff will improve motivation and make Admiral a better place to work.
The best measures of our staffs assessment of their working environment are the surveys that they have completed.
Following independent measurement by the organisations involved Admiral has received the following awards: The Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For Admiral has been included in all nine years of the publication one of only two Companies to achieve this and was ranked 37th overall in the last list published.
