Who we are Who we are Arriva is a public transport operator with more than 43,500 employees and operations across 12 European countries.
We run many modes of transport including buses, trains, coaches and waterbuses.
Amongst our related successful activities are a bus and coach distribution business, a highly-regarded sightseeing tour bus business and airport-related transport services.
Originally floated in 1965 under the Cowie name, as a motor retailer, we entered the public transport market in 1980.
With around 6,000 buses and two UK rail franchises we are now one of the largest transport operators in the UK.
The present Arriva identity was created in 1997, bringing together many different company backgrounds under the Arriva name.
Also in that year Arriva acquired its first business on the European mainland.
What distinguishes us most strongly from the other major UK-listed bus and rail operators is our geographical and market spread.
In 1999 we recognised the long-term growth opportunities that would be presented by the historic opening of transport markets across Europe, and refocused our strategy to concentrate on public transport.
We started a disposal programme of our contract hire, motor retailing and vehicle rental businesses.
In their place, we carefully and patiently built up a network of operations in mainland Europe, through targeted acquisitions and contract wins, and today we operate around 9,000 buses and 350 train sets.
Our vision is to be the leading transport services organisation in Europe.
We are now well positioned as a leading privately owned pan-European public transport operator with bus and rail operations in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.
