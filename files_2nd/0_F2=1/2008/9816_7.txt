The Pedigree People Programme resulted in all 50 participants achieving the BII Advanced Certificate in Licensed Hospitality, all of whom have gone on to achieve the Diploma level.
The programme has not only raised the expertise of our operational staff but has also benefited our tenants and lessees, who can now turn to a team of true business advisers for help and assistance.
The programme has been shortlisted for a National Training Award in recognition of its effectiveness.

This is a robust tenants and lessees to develop their food offers, and this is reflected in a performance in a difficult trading environment, reflecting the high quality lower proportion of drinks sales and gaming machine income consistent of our pub estate: a long term strategy of setting sustainable rents on with market trends.

The pub market is polarising rapidly, as evidenced by the fact that the 83% of our estate which is let on the basis of substantive agreements is in growth, whilst the remainder is in decline overall.
2 million Management of pubs which are not let on substantive agreements Investment in supporting tenants represents a significant challenge.
These pubs are likely to be less well positioned and to have been most affected by the smoking ban, the economy and price competition from other retailers.
As described earlier in the Business Review, we intend to introduce more flexible agreements which will reduce risk for capable operators of such pubs.
We are already investing in a significant level of support for all tenants and lessees.
In 2008 this included continued development of online ordering: licensee training days through the Skills Bar programme: access to Marstons payroll bureau to pay employees: and a web-builder designed to enable retailers to design their own websites.
More recently we launched an accommodation website specifically for tenants and lessees www.
During 2008 we also invested around 2 million in rent alleviation and additional discounts where appropriate.
We expect at least a similar level of support to be provided in 2009.
Each Business Development Manager BDM is responsible for around 48 pubs.
This level of resource is above that of most other operators as we believe that sound business relationships are based on giving tenants and lessees more time and attention and better quality advice as a result.
Our BDMs are also trained using external programmes from the British Institute of Innkeeping and our Pedigree People Programme.
We continue to develop a wider range of value adding services for tenants and lessees, with the objective of making Marstons Pub Company the pre-eminent tenanted and leased pub operator in the market.
