Capital structure, financial position The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns and also to ensure that regulated entities comfortably meet regulatory requirements Excess capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a regular basis.
At Group level, capital is managed in conjunction with dividend policy.
As noted above, the policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held for regulatory purposes, for expansion activities and also holding a further prudent buffer for unseen events.
This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the capital requirements of the Group.
