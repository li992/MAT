34 IHG Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Directors report continued Going concern The wider economic climate currently creates trading uncertainty for the hotel industry and IHG.
The key business risks for IHG are outlined on pages 26 to 28 of the Business Review but, in particular over the relatively short term, the main risks are falling consumer demand, restrictions on the availability of debt for owners, and a fall in the pace of new room openings.
As highlighted in note 20 to the Group financial statements, the Group refinanced its debt in May 2008 and meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through this facility.
At the end of 2008, the Group was trading significantly within its banking covenants and debt facilities.
$500m of the facility expires in November 2010 and, as at the date of this Report, the Group is not aware of any matters which may preclude this element being refinanced on acceptable terms in an appropriate timeframe.
The Groups fee-based model and wide geographic spread means that it is well placed to manage through the current downturn, and our forecasts and sensitivity projections, based on a range of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors The Directors who held office as at the date of approval of this report confirm that they have taken steps to make themselves aware of relevant audit information.
None of the Directors is aware of any relevant audit information which has not been disclosed to the auditors.
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company and their reappointment will be put to members at the Annual General Meeting.
