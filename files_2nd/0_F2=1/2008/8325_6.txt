Case study 17 Case study The T-Power project will be co-owned by T-Power 420MW Combined Cycle International Power, Siemens Project Ventures Gas Turbine CCGT greenfield and Tessenderlo Chemie, and operated by International Power under a 15-year operations project in Belgium and maintenance agreement.
The plant will be constructed by Siemens under In December 2008 some E391 million a full turnkey Engineering, Procurement and was successfully raised to finance T-Power, Construction EPC contract, and will utilise a 420MW CCGT greenfield project in Siemens V94.3A turbines with an efficiency of Tessenderlo, eastern Belgium.
This, along with using the latest technology throughout the plant, will make it cheaper and more efficient than other plants currently operating in the region.
The overriding effect of this will be a reduction in Belgiums overall emissions intensity.
Being a greenfield project, the construction of T-Power will be of great benefit to the local community, creating up to 800 jobs during the construction phase.
Following construction, the plant will require 27 full-time staff for operation, many of whom will come from the local area.
Once operational in 2011, output from the new plant will be sold, under a 15-year tolling agreement with a five-year extension option, to Essent Trading International S. A. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Essent NV, which is the largest energy supplier in the Netherlands.
The plants output will make a significant contribution towards assuring Belgiums power supply.
The development and successful financing of this project total project costs are estimated to be 448 million in challenging financial market conditions demonstrates the availability of non-recourse debt for high quality projects.
