In addition to tight credit market conditions, consumers and investors alike are facing various new and ongoing challenges in the form of a weak Rand, power outages, high interest and inflation rates and weakening house prices.
These factors have, and will most likely continue to erode investor confidence going forward.
As a result, we expect trading, particularly speculative related revenues, to soften in the near term.
We are relatively confident that, as a result of the diverse business mix and strong annuity income from discretionary funds under management, the negative impact on trading related activity should be partially offset.
Newly implemented client service strategy initiatives are showing early signs of increased market penetration which is expected to gain momentum as the implementation phase matures.
This strategy is also designed to improve overall yield on assets under management with an increased focus on clients broader investment requirements and the ability of the business to provide specialised and sophisticated solutions around those requirements.
Overall the macroeconomic environment is expected to remain challenging and this will impact on general investor confidence.
The business has however, become more resilient to volatility over time through its annuity based specialist portfolio management and alternative investment services and is also ideally placed to capitalise on current asset allocation investment rotation trends.

2008 Investec Annual Report 46 Divisional review Capital Markets Specialist structuring and advisory business Overview and financial analysis Operating profit decreased 1.3% to 115.8 million, contributing 23.1% to group profit.
Our advisory, structuring and asset creation activities continued to perform well.
The Australian business continued to build on the Rothschilds platform and introduced a number of new initiatives.
Core loans and advances grew by 22.6% to 3.8 billion.
The results of the division were adversely affected by a poor performance from the US Principal Finance division which has been negatively affected by the credit crisis refer below.
Investec plc acquired Kensington with effect from 8 August 2007.
The businesses of Kensington now form part of the Capital Markets business in the UK.
Salient information with respect to Kensington is provided below and should be taken into account when assessing the variance analysis provided.
The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: Net interest income has benefited from an increase in average advances across all three geographies, a strong performance from the treasury businesses in South Africa and the acquisition of Kensington.
Net fees and commissions reflect a good performance from the advisory and structuring businesses with a number of mandates successfully closed.
The decrease in principal transactions primarily reflects losses made in the US Principal Finance division as a result of write downs of 48.9 million on US structured credit investments largely as a result of rating agency downgrades and US house price performance related to these portfolios.
If we had to adjust for these write downs, principal transaction revenue would have increased by 40% largely as a result of revaluations and realisations of investments in the Structured Finance and Resource Finance businesses and a solid performance from the trading businesses off the back of volatile markets.
Further analysis is provided below.
Excluding the impact from the acquisition of Kensington 55.4 million, impairment losses on loans and advances increased primarily as a result of additional write offs in the South African business.
Expenses have increased largely due to the acquisition of Kensington, an increase in average headcount to support new initiatives notably UK and Australia, the investment in product development and IT infrastructure and costs associated with complying with regulatory requirements.

We are not writing any business within the adverse product range.
- Appropriate pricing for current market conditions.
Further efficiencies to be gained through increased automation across the operating model.

We are considered one of the top 10 European banks in aircraft finance, with particular success in the origination of transactions in India where we have completed the first ever sale and leaseback transactions for the two Indian State owned airlines.
The trading desks showed an improved performance benefiting from market volatility, the introduction of new products and increased staff in certain areas.

The Commodities and Resource Finance business continues to grow and we are now considered a top name in the mid and junior mining project finance sector and are growing our name in the commodities arena.
The US Principal Finance activities were negatively impacted by the credit issues and subsequently by the liquidity crisis that arose off the back of the US sub-prime issues.
We have taken a mark to market write down of 48.9 million against the US positions largely as a result of rating agency downgrades and US house price performance related to these portfolios.
As at 31 March 2008 the on balance sheet value of the US portfolio is 71 million of which 16 million is dependent on the performance of the US sub-prime market.
