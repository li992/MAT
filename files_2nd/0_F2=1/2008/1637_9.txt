Authority to repurchase ordinary shares Resolution 9 set out in the notice convening the Annual General Meeting gives authority to the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares up to a maximum of 6,751,732 ordinary shares until the earlier of 9 October 2009 and the date of the next Annual General Meeting.
This represents 10% of the ordinary shares in issue at 27 May 2008 and the Companys exercise of this authority is subject to the stated upper and lower limits on the price payable which reects the requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Shares will only be repurchased if earnings per share are expected to be enhanced as a result and the Directors believe it is in the best interests of shareholders generally.
To the extent that any shares so purchased are held in treasury, earnings per share will be enhanced until such time, if any, as such shares are resold or transferred out of treasury.
The Company has the choice of cancelling shares which have been repurchased or holding them as treasury shares or a combination of both.
Treasury shares are essentially shares which have been repurchased by the Company and which it is allowed to hold pending either reselling them for cash, cancelling them or, if authorised, using them for the purposes of its employee share plans.
The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice.
Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares would give the Company the ability to reissue them quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional exibility in the management of its capital base.
No dividends will be paid on, and no voting rights will be exercised, in respect of treasury shares.
As at 27 May 2008 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the notice of the Annual General Meeting, there were 488,624 outstanding options granted under all share option plans operated by the Company which, if exercised, would represent 0.72% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
If this authority were exercised in full and the shares repurchased were to be cancelled, such options if exercised would represent 0.80% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
