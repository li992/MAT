This has enabled us to further increase our focus on meeting the needs of our customers and has supported improved productivity in the branch network sales effort.
These improvements have supported a further improvement in the retail banking cost:income ratio to 44.4 per cent, from 46.4 per cent last year.
Average sales by staff in the branch network have shown good growth on the levels achieved in 2007.
Telephone banking has continued to improve the quality of the service which it provides to customers, allowing us to focus on better meeting the needs of our customers whilst also improving efficiency.
ARReARS PeRfoRmAnCe RemAInS SATISfACToRy Impairment losses on loans and advances were 20 per cent higher at 1,472 million, particularly reflecting the impact of lower house values on the mortgage impairment charge.
The impairment charge as a percentage of average lending was higher at 1.22 per cent, compared to 1.10 per cent in 2007.
Over 99 per cent of new personal loans and 90 per cent of new credit cards sold during 2008 were to existing customers.
The level of arrears in the credit card and personal loan portfolios increased by 26 per cent and 15 per cent respectively reflecting the impact of the slowdown in the UK economic environment.
In terms of unsecured lending, our arrears performance remains satisfactory.
However, in the context of the uncertain UK economic environment and the potential for increased consumer arrears and insolvencies, we are continuing to enhance our underwriting, collections and fraud prevention procedures.
We currently expect retail impairment levels to rise significantly in 2009, largely reflecting the expected increase in unemployment levels in the UK and the impact of further house price falls.
Mortgage credit quality remains good although the slowdown in economic activity and rising unemployment in the UK has led to arrears rising by 44 per cent over the last 12 months.
This compares to a rise of 72 per cent in Council of Mortgage Lenders CML industry averages in the 12 months to 31 December 2008.
The fall in the house price index over the last 12 months has however led to an increase of approximately 150 million in the secured impairment charge during the year.
Looking forward, our view is for a further fall of similar magnitude in house price index during 2009.
In Cheltenham & Gloucester, the average indexed loan-to-value ratio on the mortgage portfolio was 56 per cent, and the average loan-tovalue ratio for new mortgages and further advances written during 2008 was 63 per cent.
At 31 December 2008, 15 per cent of balances had an indexed loan-to-value ratio in excess of 100 per cent reflecting the significant fall in house prices during the year.
Compared to the CML industry averages at 31 December 2008, UK Retail Banking had less than half the industry average for properties in possession and new repossessions as a percentage of total cases in 2008.
In addition, arrears in the Groups buy-to-let portfolio represent only a small fraction of our prime portfolio and CML industry averages.
We extensively stress-test our lending to changes in macroeconomic conditions and we remain confident in the quality of our mortgage portfolio.
