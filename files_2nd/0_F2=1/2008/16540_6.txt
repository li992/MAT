The in CY 2006, primarily due to increased Indian demand for primary aluminium demand in India is likely to be robust on demand from China which accounted for increased at a compound annual growth the back of strong GDP growth and will over 30.0% of global consumption in this rate of 13.0% between CY 20022007 on grow at similar levels.
Consumption is expected to grow the back of high demand from the at similar levels in the coming year due electrical, construction and copper to higher levels of demand from China transportation sector.

approximately 22.0% of demand, 19.4 million tonnes in CY 2008 on the back of strong demand from Asia.
Asia is currently the fastest growing copper market in the world and is expected to grow even more strongly, dominated by use of copper in electric wires and cables.
Global refined copper production increased to 18.1 million tonnes in CY 2007 or 4.6%, from 17.3 million tonnes in CY 2006.
Global production is expected to further increase to 18.9 million tonnes in CY 2008, primarily due to the commissioning of new smelters mainly in China, Africa, India and Japan.
In India, refined copper consumption increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11.0% between CY 20022007.
It was supported by strong growth in user segments such as winding wires, power cables and other applications in construction, infrastructure and alloy VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC 22 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Job: 10808 VED 08 front AW.

Galvanising is primarily from 11.2 million tonnes in CY 2006, applicable for sheet, tube and structural fuelled by strong demand growth in products.
Applications in the construction Asia which accounted for almost half and infrastructure sector are also of global demand and grew 7.7% in increasing which will boost the overall CY 2007.
