Group Chief Executives review Barclays delivered a resilient financial performance in 2007 in a year of contrasting market conditions.
The excellent results of the first half were achieved in a relatively benign environment: in the second half we were not immune from the impact of the credit market turbulence, but profit before business disposals for the year still increased 3%.
I am pleased to report profits again above 7bn, which is well ahead of the average level of the previous three years.
At a time of significant market turbulence, it is important to be clear and confident about strategy.
The strategy of Barclays is to achieve superior growth through time by diversifying our profit base.
The precondition of successful growth is relevance to customers.
We seek to maximise the alignment between the sources of growth in the financial services industry in particular anticipating what customers want and need with what we have in Barclays in terms of brand, capability and physical footprint.
We recommit to our strategy following our bid for ABN AMRO, and in the light of the market volatility and because of our confidence that our Barclays delivered a resilient strategy offers the best route to strong growth in the years ahead.
The structure of the Group, which comprises two business groupings, performance in 2007, with profits Global Retail and Commercial Banking GRCB and Investment Banking and Investment Management IBIM, is designed both to enable us to be broadly in line with the record well positioned for the significant growth which we anticipate in the global financial services industry and to help us serve customers and clients well.
The strength of We continued to invest heavily across the Group in 2007, increasing the number of employees who serve customers and clients and developing our diversified businesses gives us our distribution networks.
In IBIM I believe that we handled well the stress test of market turbulence confidence for the period ahead in the second half of 2007.
Both Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors ended 2007 with profits ahead of 2006, which was a year of rapid growth and record profitability for both.
We have benefited significantly from the business diversification that we have pursued in recent years: the development of capabilities by Barclays Capital in commodities, foreign exchange and equity products enabled us to deliver excellent income growth in those areas.
The cost flexibility that we have built into the business model here has also served shareholders well, enabling us to reduce expenses year on year, and improve the cost:net income and compensation ratios.
In Barclays Global Investors, iShares assets under management grew over $100bn to $408bn, and this growth illustrates the significant diversification of Barclays Global Investors earnings base that we have engineered in recent years.
Meanwhile Barclays Wealth is making good progress towards the achievement of its profit goal of 500m in the medium term, benefiting as it is from proximity to the structuring and manufacturing capabilities of Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors.

This growth is feeding through powerfully into activity levels.
Income Our new goal is to generate a cumulative total of between 9.3bn and increased 28% in International Retail and Commercial Banking excluding 10.6bn of economic profit between 2008 and 2011.
This represents an Absa in 2007.
Absa performed well, including delivering on its synergy annual growth rate in economic profit of 5% to 10%.
We estimate that target 18 months ahead of schedule.

This is an important part of over three years compared with our target of six percentage points.
The our long term plans to develop a more significant presence in emerging turnaround of UK Retail Banking continued during 2007, with strong markets, particularly Asia where group profits more than doubled in 2007, income growth in core product areas, including mortgages.

In Barclaycard, we have made excellent progress towards our goal of re-establishing This has been a challenging year for our staff, and we have them to thank a leadership position in the United Kingdom and in the aggressive for delivering the results we have achieved despite multiple distractions in expansion of our International Cards business.
Profits in Barclaycard grew difficult market circumstances.

In reviewing our use of capital and assets, our principal focus has been on What is the outlook for 2008?
We see another year in which global the risk weighted balance sheet rather than the nominal balance sheet.

The emerging Whilst we monitor internally a range of different ratios, our publicly economies account for about a third of global GDP, but they account for expressed target has been to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk two thirds of global GDP growth and they continue to perform strongly.
At the end of 2007 we were comfortably ahead However, in many economies of the developed world, there will be a slowof that target under both Basel I and Basel II measurement bases.

We expect the rate of growth in risk weighted assets in 2008 to approach to lending.

The maintenance of our policy of growing dividends broadly in line with the rate of underlying earnings over time reflects the Boards confidence in the future.
Our dividend remains more than twice covered by earnings, which we believe is consistent with the funding requirements of our organic growth plans.
We have announced new multi-year performance goals.
These are designed to stretch us, and we see them as reflective of the potential that John Varley exists within our businesses and our people.

EP is profit after tax and minorities less a capital charge average shareholders equity and goodwill excluding minority interests multiplied by the Group cost of capital.
Barclays uses EP, a nonIFRS measure, as a key indicator of performance because it believes that it provides important discipline in decision making.
Barclays believes that EP encourages both profitable growth and the efficient use of capital.
At the time of setting the TSR goal, we estimated that achieving top quartile TSR would require the achievement of compound annual growth in economic profit in the range of 10% to 13% per annum 6.5bn to 7.0bn of cumulative economic profit over the 2004 to 2007 goal period.
Economic profit for 2007 was 2.3bn, which, added to the 6.0bn generated in 2004, 2005 and 2006, delivered a cumulative total of 8.3bn for the goal period.
Therefore Barclays has delivered 128% of the minimum range and 119% of the upper range of the cumulative economic profit goal in the goal period.
