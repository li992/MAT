I have taken on this position at an extremely interesting time in the Groups development.
Despite the difficult conditions we have conditions in certain markets, the Continuing Group delivered revenue growth of 4%, with operating profit down 1% in our 2007 continued to reshape the financial year.
Normalised pre-tax profit was down 13% with EPS down 7%.
The strong cash flow of the Group is behind the Board Group to strengthen our recommending a final dividend of 22.1p, giving a total dividend of 31.0p per share, up 3% over last year.
The main factor currently affecting Emap is the proliferation of new media channels.
We are responding to this by changing the work we do and the way we work.
Our strategic priorities are outlined in the Our strategy section and their successful delivery will create a Group that is more aligned with the digital world.
We have undertaken operational efficiency reviews across the Group to maintain innovation around our brands while improving our strategic focus.
We have only been able to undertake these initiatives with the co-operation of our people and I would like to thank all our employees for remaining focused and committed through this time of change.
I am very happy to welcome Derek Carter, who is in charge of our business division, to the Board.
I am also delighted to welcome Jonathan Howell to the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
Tom Moloney resigned as Group Chief Executive by mutual agreement in May 2007 and a formal process is underway to find a successor.
We have rearranged the Annual Report this year to help provide a clear analysis of our performance and strategy, moving in line with the revised requirements under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and Enhanced Business Review which will apply to our disclosures for the next financial year.
The trends we experienced during 2007 are continuing into 2008.
However, we believe that the actions we have taken during the year, the strength of our brands and the quality of our people should enable us to deliver stronger growth in the future.
As part of our efforts to reduce our impact on the environment, we are adopting certain provisions that will enable us to communicate with shareholders electronically.
I hope that you will support us and vote in favour of the relevant resolution.
I look forward to welcoming you to our forthcoming AGM and would encourage all shareholders to vote, either by post, in person or electronically, on the resolutions being put forward at the meeting.
Yours faithfully Alun Cathcart Executive Chairman 05 Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
