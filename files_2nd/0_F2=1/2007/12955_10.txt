PROJECT TONGON PROJECT The Tongon project is located in northern Cte dIvoire, 628 kilometres north of Abidjan within the Nielle permit.
Improvement of the political situation in the country and completion of the feasibility Type 3 study, led the board in January 2008 to approve the development of the mine.
CTE DIVOIRE: LOCALITY OF TONGON PROJECT Nielle Permit: Tongon Development Project 300km Randgold Resources exploration permits A 30 000 metre drilling programme designed project information as at September 2007 and on the back of this, in January 2008, to advance the project to a final feasibility the board approved the development of the study started at Tongon in the first quarter mine.
