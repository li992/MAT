cairns current entitlement interest production is 63% gas, 37% oil.
India reserves the average price per boe realised in the net entitlement 2p reserves for 2007 was $39.70, compared with mangala, saraswati and raageshwari $31.84 in 2006. the average price were booked in 2005 following the Hatia, Bangladesh realised by cairn india for oil was approval by the goi of the fdps.
$73.56 bbl 2006: $66.32 bbl and that since submission of the original mangala for gas was $23.39 boe 2006: $21.03 fdp, two additional wells have been boe.
the average realised price for drilled and extensive reservoir studies gas in capricorn was $17.60 boe completed.
volumes in mangala and aishwariya have been updated based on the results of on commencement of oil production remapping, more accurate water from rajasthan, the vast majority of saturation determination and a group production will be oil and, as a comprehensive petrophysical review.
consequence, the group will become eor studies establishing its feasibility to much more highly geared to prevailing augment secondary recovery have also oil prices.
a reserves report was submitted to the goi in december 2007 Group entitlement reserves with the higher stoiip estimate of just the table above shows reserves under 1.3 billion boe and recommending information at the end of 2007 on an an increase in the mangala field plateau entitlement basis for the group production rate to 125,000 bopd and including 100% of cairn india reserves.

for accounting and reserves purposes, the group has used an oil price of $60 the proposed development sequence per bbl real 2006: $30 per bbl real.
for the rajasthan northern fields remains mangala, bhagyam and aishwariya.
the bhagyam fdp was submitted to the jv and the goi in may 2007. as at the 2007 year end, the goi approval for bhagyam was outstanding and the associated reserves were therefore not booked.
fdps for other fields including shakti and guda are currently in preparation.
Hatia, Bangladesh 22 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Cambay Basin, India bangladesh reserves sangu gross 2p remaining reserves have been reduced by 70.1 billion standard cubic feet of gas bscf to 15.6 bscf.
this reduction is attributable to the disappointing results from the sangu-10 infill development well drilled in 2007, despite gas being found in a shallower reservoir and poorer than predicted performance from existing production wells.
well intervention work has been completed during q1 2008 as a result of which production has been recovered to 75 mmscfd thus ameliorating the production decline.
sangu net entitlement 2p reserves are now 0.8 mmboe, which represents less than 0.5% of total booked group reserves.
