14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 17 SURFACE MINES Our surface mining business had a very successful year, despite poor weather in the summer with the resultant flooding problems affecting parts of the business.
Significantly we more than doubled production from 0.6 million tonnes in 2006 to 1.5 million tonnes last year.
Principally, this reflected the opening of 3 new sites during the year.
Surface mining profits increased over 15 times to 8.5 million, reflecting the increased production volumes and the higher market price of coal.
SHALLOW-LAYING COAL SEAMS BEING RECOVERED ON THE SHARLSTON SITE IN WEST YORKSHIRE WHERE RESTORATION PLANS INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, WOODLAND, HEATHLAND, MEADOWS AND WATER FEATURES, WITH INCREASED PUBLIC ACCESS.
Key Performance Indicators KPIs 2007 2006 Coal mined million tonnes 1.5 0.6 Revenue m 52.9 21.7 Operating cost m 41.2 17.3 excluding non-trading exceptional items and depreciation costs Operating profit before non-trading exceptional items m 8.5 0.5 Sites with consent number 7 5 Reserves on sites with planning consent million tonnes 4.3 4.1 Operating cost per Gigajoule GJ 1.11 1.23 excluding non-trading exceptional items and depreciation costs Surface mines have a more variable cost base than deep mines.
The site by site cost per GJ will vary according to the nature of each site.
The costs of planning gains and the coal yield at each site, along with variations associated to operating cost, efficiencies and weather, make year to year direct comparisons difficult.
Surface mine operating costs stated above are after charging amortisation of mine development and restoration assets.

Accessing these reserves requires planning consents and we therefore remain cautious in estimating the likely proportion of this total that will ultimately be extracted.
We are now seeing a marked change in the success rate for surface mining consents with the various Local Authorities.
Recognition is being given not only to the need for an indigenous supply of coal for both national and local requirements but also to the fact that the schemes are meeting high environmental standards both in design and operation.
We currently have planning consents in place for 7 sites equivalent to 4.3 million tonnes, and applications already submitted for a further 4 sites equivalent to 4.7 million tonnes.
We expect during 2008 to submit planning applications for a further 6 sites equivalent to 5.1 million tonnes.
A summary of estimated remaining reserves through the various stages of planning is set out in the table below, in thousand tonnes: Applications Applications submitted to be for submitted Sites with planning, in the planning decision following consent awaited 12 months Maidens Hall Extension 90 Cutacre 765 North Stobswood 395 Steadsburn 1,088 Long Moor 686 Sharlston 307 Lodge House 1,000 Potland Burn 2,000 Park Wall North 1,275 Bradley 550 Huntington Lane 900 Blair House 700 Butterwell 1,000 Minorca 1,250 Chesterfield Canal 530 Stockley Hill 1,000 Field House 600 Total reserves in process 2007 4,331 4,725 5,080 Total reserves in process 2006 4,103 5,350 4,600 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 19 EARLY PRODUCTION DAYS ON THE NEW SHARLSTON SURFACE MINE SITE IN WEST YORKSHIRE, WHERE COAL, FIRECLAY AND RED SHALE WILL BE RECOVERED IN A RECLAMATION AND RE-DEVELOPMENT SCHEME.
