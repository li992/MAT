It is the Groups policy to give full consideration to suitable applications for employment from people with disabilities.
In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training and rehabilitation is provided.
It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical with that of other employees.
36 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 The Group is committed to a policy of equal opportunities and ensures that country of origin, colour, gender, religious belief, sexual orientation, age or disability, are not barriers to working at Drax.

Charitable donations Drax Group has continued to support community initiatives and charitable causes.
The total charitable donations made by the Group in the year were 73,754 2006: 45,872.
More information on the charitable donations made is contained within the Corporate and social responsibility review on page 30.
Political donations No political donations were made in the UK or elsewhere during the year 2006: nil.
It is the Boards policy not to make donations to political organisations or for political causes.
The Corporate and social responsibility review explains that the Groups activities in the political sphere are aimed only at the promotion of its business interests.
However, the definitions of EU political expenditure are broad and there is widespread doubt about the extent to which normal business activities, which might not be thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could be considered to be political expenditure within the meaning of the legislation.
The Board wishes to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the legislation and is therefore seeking the authority of shareholders to incur expenditure, for the Company and its subsidiaries, for such purposes of 100,000 during the next 12 months.
A resolution to that effect is contained within the Notice of Meeting for the AGM.
The Board does not believe that the Group has incurred any political expenditure in the past year.
Creditor payment policy and practice Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers when negotiating each transaction and the policy is to abide by those terms and pay creditors when sums owing fall due for payment, provided that the suppliers also comply with all relevant terms and conditions.
Drax Group plc, the holding Company of the Group, has no trade creditors.
In respect of Group activities, the amounts due to trade creditors at 31 December 2007, represented approximately 22 days of average daily purchases through the year 2006: 26 days.
Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditors So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being information needed by the auditors in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditors are unaware.
Having made enquiries of fellow directors and the Companys auditors, each director has taken all the steps that he she is obliged to take as a director in order to make himself herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
In accordance with Section 385 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution is to be proposed at the AGM for the reappointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors of the Company.
A resolution will also be proposed authorising the directors to determine the auditors remuneration.
The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditors, the auditors effectiveness and relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditors.
