We assess the ability of the Group to convert sales into profit before tax and interest by analysing the operating and EBITDA margins.
Ongoing challenging markets, particularly within our Building Products group, have impacted on returns over the past two years, but lean initiatives and strong growth in emerging markets have allowed management to protect the margins to some degree.
The operating margin has fallen from 9.4% in 2006 to 9.0% in 2007, and the EBITDA margin has decreased slightly from 13.1% to 12.9%.
Capital expenditure The Groups capital allocation strategy is monitored using a measure of net capital expenditure to depreciation providing an insight into the utilisation versus replacement of capital expenditure and capital expenditure as a percentage of sales assessing the extent to which sales are used to fund the expansion and replacement of the capital assets that produce the sales.
2007 saw the net capital expenditure to depreciation ratio fall below 1.0, largely due to a focus on sustaining capital through restructuring and lean initiatives.
3.9% of continuing sales were spent on capital expenditure during 2007 which is consistent with 2006.
Cash ow We assess the cash ow performance of each of our businesses and the Group based on the percentage of profit from operations before gains losses on disposal and exit of businesses converted to operating cash ow cash conversion.
Cash ow after interest, tax and dividends indicates the after-tax cash available to the Group after internal investment excluding acquisitions, finance costs and dividends paid to equity shareholders.
During 2007, both of these metrics have shown strong improvements, demonstrating managements continued focus on cash management.
Cash conversion increased from 80.1% in 2006 to 89.5% in 2007, while cash ow after interest, tax and dividends improved from an outow of 15.1 million in 2006 to an inow of 22.9 million in 2007.
Trends in cash ow metrics are used to assess the allocation of capital over the long term.
