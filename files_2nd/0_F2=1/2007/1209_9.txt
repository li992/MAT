uk Titanium Sponge Joint Venture Proposal to Construct Titanium Sponge Plant in China Titanium Sponge Titanium Sponge Highlights 2007 Heads of Agreement signed in May 2007 Project site selected Full Feasibility Study completed in December 2007 Terms of titanium sponge offtake agreed with Chinalco in December 2007 Proposed location for titanium sponge plant 2007 Progress Background In May 2007 Aricom and Chinalco signed a In order to capture additional profit margins Heads of Agreements setting out the general available in the processing of ilmenite to be conditions of the proposed joint venture.
The produced by Kuranakh, in June 2006 Aricom parties have agreed the equity proportion in signed a Memorandum of Understanding the proposed joint venture at the initial stage with Chinalco, the largest nonferrous metal will be 65% to Aricom, 35% to Chinalco.
It has company in China and the owner of Chinas also been agreed that ilmenite feedstock for largest titanium metal processing plant, for the plant is to be sourced exclusively from the design and development of a titanium Aricoms Kuranakh mine, and that Chinalco sponge production plant in China.
will off-take the titanium sponge to be produced by the joint venture.
It is envisaged that Aricom will provide the joint venture with capital, production of During 2007, Aricom and Chinalco have ilmenite from Aricoms Kuranakh project, carried out significant work on development expertise in titanium resources and of the technical and design documentation technology: Chinalco will provide capital, required for the projects approval and technologies, proficiency in engineering registration of the joint venture in China.
design, construction and metal production, and ensure off-take of the titanium sponge In July 2007 Aricom and Chinalco agreed to be produced by the plant.
the location of the titanium sponge plant in Jiamusi city, Heilongjiang province.

Chinalco intends to recommend this In 2007, the State Titanium Research and cement plant in the southern part of Jiamusi proposal to their existing relationship Chinese Design Institute of Ukraine STI continued city, and the Jiamusi Municipal Government banking group.
The equity component of the close cooperation with SAMI on the titanium fully supports the project.
capital expenditure will be paid according to sponge project.
STI had completed the joint ventures proposed shareholders development of initial data for the plants In December 2007 Shenyang Aluminium split: 65% by Aricom and 35% by Chinalco.
design and passed it to SAMI for further and Magnesium Institute SAMI, Chinalcos On this basis Aricoms equity funding development.
STI and SAMI also jointly subsidiary, completed a comprehensive requirement will be c. US$58 million, which agreed on the general layout plan of Feasibility Study for producing up to could be funded out of existing cash the plant.
also allows an increase in production capacity Aricom believes that the achievements of up to 30,000tpa and production of up to In December 2007, Aricom and Chinalco the year 2007 favourable results of the 10,000tpa of titanium ingots a higher margin signed a binding Memorandum of feasibility study and agreement of the terms product.
Understanding MoU stipulating that the of titanium sponge off-take established a joint venture parties procure 100% of the stable foundation for the The Feasibility Study confirmed the technical plants ilmenite requirements from Aricoms future success of the project.
and economic viability of the project.
The Kuranakh project for 15 years, the first five study utilised a conservative selling price years being set at a fixed price based on the Future Developments estimate of titanium sponge in comparison current market.
In addition, the MoU also sets The main milestones of the development with the current market price and estimated out Chinalcos commitment to off-take 100% of the titanium sponge project in 2008 will that the project would yield a post-tax of the titanium sponge produced by the plant include finalising of all approval procedures, Internal Rate of Return of 21% and a post-tax for the first 15 years on agreed pricing terms.
