History Murray Income Trust is an investment trust traded on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE All-Share Index.
The Caledonian Trust Company Limited as Murray Income Trust PLC was originally called was formed in 1923 to invest in growth areas of the day.
It was very highly geared, borrowing at 3% and investing at 5%, almost entirely in fixed income securities.
In January 1930, after a year which saw substantial profits, there were 497 holdings: 52.5% were bonds, loans and debentures, 28.5% preferred stocks and shares and only 19% equities.
The portfolio spread was huge 31% Home, 10.5% British Colonies and Dependencies, 18% Europe, 15% USA, 7% Argentina, and so on down to 1% each in Cuba and Mexico and 5.5% in other countries.
The big move into equities came after the 1930s slump, when bond defaults forced the purchase of higher yielding equities to fund the costs of the Companys gearing.
After a number of amalgamations and reorganisations, Caledonian Trust Company emerged as a generalist investment trust under the management of Murray Johnstone Ltd which is now part of the Aberdeen Asset Management group.
However, many trusts had a similar broad remit and there was a glut, so in 1979 the Board defined the investment brief more narrowly as income growth and changed the name of the Company to Murray Caledonian Investment Trust.
Symbolised by the name change to Murray Income Trust in 1984, the focus has since been on a relatively high yielding portfolio of UK blue chip equities.
Capital Structure The Companys issued share capital as at 30 June 2007 consisted of 65,138,908 Ordinary shares of 25p and 1,277,550 Ordinary shares held in treasury.
At 19 September 2007, the issued share capital consisted of 65,028,958 Ordinary shares of 25p and 1,387,550 Treasury shares of 25p.
Total Assets and Net Asset Value At 30 June 2007, the Company had Total Assets see definition on page 62 of 552.6m and a Net Asset Value per Ordinary share of 802.3p.
2 Murray Income Trust PLC Borrowings The borrowings at 30 June 2007 of 30 million represent 5.7% of Net Assets.
Borrowing facilities of 45 million are committed to the Company until 1 October 2009 and borrowing facilities of 30 million are committed to the Company until 13 September 2008.
Financial covenants contained within the relevant loan agreements provide, inter alia, that borrowings shall at no time exceed 45% of Net Assets and that the Net Assets must exceed 225 million.
The Net Assets were 522.6 million at 30 June 2007.
If any of the financial covenants are breached the Lender is entitled, following the serving of notice to the Company, to declare the loans and all accrued interest, fees and other sums owed under the agreements to be immediately due and repayable.
Duration The Company does not have a fixed life.
Risk The UK equity market is volatile and short-term movements may therefore be greater than justified by longer term trends.
The use of gearing is likely to lead to an increase in the volatility of the portfolio so that any movements in the Companys Net Asset Value will be magnified.
Currently, 50% of the investment management fees and interest costs are charged to capital.
This increases distributable income at the expense of capital growth which will be reduced to the same extent.
The policy of investing in higher-yielding shares may also diminish capital growth.
There is no guarantee that the market price of investment trust shares will accurately reflect their underlying Net Asset Value or move in line with it.
