32 ITV plc Report and accounts 2007 Business review Key Performance Indicators ITVs Key Performance Indicators KPIs are the core measures used by the Company to assess its own performance and allow shareholders and other ITV stakeholders to see how the business is doing.
ITV has revised its KPI framework to reflect the Turnaround strategy, allowing stakeholders to assess ITVs progress towards the targets it has set itself.
The new framework provides more granularity in terms of financial KPIs, together with a more comprehensive set of non-financial indicators.
Financial KPIs The financial performance of the Company depends on our ability to sustain growth in the revenues we can attract and the profits we are able to earn on those revenues.
This dual focus is reflected in ITVs financial KPIs, which provide more detail of the performance of the Company across its major areas of activity and are consistent with the long-term targets set out in the Turnaround strategy.
Further detail on our performance in these areas is set out in the Operating and Financial Reviews.
Revenues The Turnaround strategy sets out the Companys target of growing revenues adjusted for disposals by 35% to 2010 and 5% in 20112012.
Achieving this target will depend on ITVs ability to maximise its television advertising revenues across all its channels.
In addition, ITV has adopted strategic targets for total Global Content annual revenue including internal revenues of 1.2 billion by 2012 and for Online annual revenue of 150 million by 2010.
