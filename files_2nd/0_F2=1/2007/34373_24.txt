We calculate that we are the largest owner of UK superstore properties, other than the occupiers themselves.
In an increasingly restrictive planning environment and with limited new supply, the retailers continue to require more and larger stores and are prepared to commit to full lease lengths of over 20 years.
These investments, acquired over some 17 years, have been enlarged by 49 extensions and redevelopments, adding a total of 727,000 sq ft.
In addition to these, British Land also owns, directly or 50% in joint ventures, a further 12 superstores which are included in other sectors of the portfolio such as retail warehouse parks, and total a further 1 million sq ft. 48 The British Land Company PLC
