The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
The Group selects its discount rate by benchmarking against published indices and by consultation with its actuaries.
The principal index used for benchmarking is the iBOXX Corporate AA index for bonds with terms consistentwiththe estimated defined benefit payments.
See Note 35 of the Notes to the Group Accounts for a summary of how the assumptions selected in the last five years have comparedwithactual results.
Contingenciesand Provisions The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcomewill occurand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the  settlement negotiationsorif .
The estimation of the liability for the costs of the macrotextured product withdrawal for which coverage has been declined is dependent upon two main variables.
These are the number of implant revisions that will ultimately be required and the average cost of settlements with patients.
The estimate of the remaining number of implant revisions is based on trends to date and the advice of external statistical and other advisors.
If the actual number remainingwas doublethe currentestimate the cost wouldincreaseby approximately $40m.
If the average costof settlement of the estimated claims outstanding or not yet notified should rise by 10% the cost would increase by $4m.
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.
Although it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take several years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amountof anytax chargemanagement takes intoaccountthe views ofinternaland external advisors and updates the amount of provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
