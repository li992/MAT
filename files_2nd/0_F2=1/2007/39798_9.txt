Whilst concerns remain about a potential slowdown in the global economy, our occupier demand across all of our key markets is currently holding up well.
We are staying close to our customers and watching developments carefully so that appropriate action can be taken swiftly if conditions start to weaken.
SEGRO has a strong balance sheet and resilient business model the year-end debt to equity ratio of 56 per cent, and loan to value ratio of 34 per cent and available funds of 1.1 billion with no significant debt maturities before mid 2010, mean we have significant financial resources at our disposal.
We serve a broad diversity of customers and industries and have relatively long average remaining lease lengths.
These factors, combined with the flexibility we have to adjust the pace of speculative development relatively quickly, mean that SEGRO is well placed to face any challenges the market may present and to capitalise on suitable opportunities that may lie ahead.
