The of strong demand from China and other emerging markets progressive increase in volumes coupled with our low cost including India.
India demonstrated a GDP growth of of production provides us with an excellent opportunity to slightly over 9% in FY 2007 with corresponding industrial take advantage of global demand growth and relatively growth at 11% and is poised to grow at similar levels in insulate us from a downside in the commodity cycle.
FY 2008, with a focus on infrastructure development, faster industrialisation and other growth initiatives Aluminium Business including a deregulation of power sector.
At current Demand and Markets estimates of longerterm metal demand growth, the world World primary aluminium consumption increased from will need an additional 2.0 million tonnes of aluminium, 32.0 million tonnes in CY 2005 to 34.7 million tonnes in 0.75 million tonnes of copper and 0.5 million tonnes of CY 2006, an increase of 8.4%, and is expected to grow at zinc approximately per year, which augers well for our similar levels in the coming year primarily due to increased growth initiatives.
Global production of primary aluminium increased from 32.0 million tonnes in CY 2005 to Metal production across all our operations will improve 34.0 million tonnes in CY 2006, an increase of 6.3%, and is in FY 2008 as a result of full capacity utilisation of the expected to reach c. 38.0 million tonnes in CY 2007 due to expansion and debottlenecking initiatives completed in rapid implementation of new capacity projects, rampup FY 2007.
With the improvement in productivity consequently of idle capacities in China, smelter restarts in USA and to improvement in volumes and procurement and supply Germany and further expansions in India, Middle East, management initiatives, unit costs of production are also Russia and South America.
expected to reduce, towards our vision of achieving top decile costs of production in each of our metals.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 BUSINESS REVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW 11 Our engineers in discussion with technical consultants at the Jharsuguda aluminium project The majority of aluminium produced in India is consumed in In India, refined copper consumption increased at a the building and construction, transport, electrical appliance compound annual growth rate of 8.9% between CY 2001 and equipment and packaging industries.
It was supported by strong growth in user segments primary aluminium increased at a compound annual growth such as winding wires, power cables and other applications rate of 12.0% between CY20012006 on the back of high in construction, infrastructure and alloy segments, offset demand from the electrical, construction and transportation by a decline in demand for copper used in jelly filled sector.
Electrical applications continue to be the largest telecom cables.
Refined copper consumption in India is enduse sector in India, consuming approximately 35% of expected to grow in line with GDP growth.
aluminium production in CY 2006 as a result of the continuing drive to provide electricity throughout the country.
Transport Zinc Business is also a major consumer, contributing approximately 22% of Demand and Markets demand, although the average aluminium use in Indianmade Global zinc consumption increased from 10.6 million tonnes automobiles is still approximately onethird of that in in CY 2005 to 11.3 million tonnes in CY2006, an increase of westernmade automobiles.
The demand in India is likely to 6.6%, and is expected to grow at similar rates fuelled by be robust on the back of strong GDP growth and will grow at doubledigit growth in China, India and other emerging similar levels.
The key growth driver is demand from the steel galvanizing market, which is growing primarily due to Copper Business robust demand from the automotive and automotive Demand and Markets parts industries.
Global refined copper consumption increased from 16.9 million tonnes in CY 2005 to 17.5 million tonnes in Global zinc production increased from 10.1 million tonnes CY2006, an increase of 3.5% and is expected to grow at the in CY 2005 to 10.6 million tonnes in CY 2006, an increase of same rate in CY 2007, driven mainly by demand from the 4.9%, and is expected to further increase to 11.6 million construction and power sectors.
Asia, including China, and tonnes in CY 2007 due to commissioning of new smelters.
Western Europe together account for nearly 72% of global refined copper consumption.
With a compound annual Consumption of refined zinc in India increased at a growth rate of 7.6% between CY 20012006, Asia is compound annual growth rate of 9% between CY2003 currently the fastest growing copper market in the world 2006, primarily by the galvanising sector, which currently and is expected to grow even more strongly, dominated accounts for an estimated 70% of total consumption.
by its use in electric wires and cables.
Galvanising is primarily applicable for sheet, tube and structural products.
Applications in the construction and Global refined copper production increased from infrastructure sector are also increasing which will boost 16.6 million tonnes in CY 2005 to 17.4 million tonnes in the overall growth of the market.
Global production is expected to further increase to 19.2 million in CY 2007, primarily due to the commissioning of new smelters mainly in China, Africa, India and Japan.
