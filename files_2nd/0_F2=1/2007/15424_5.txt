Delivering actionable insight Making a difference Market information companies have too often engaged in validating what clients already know, or what they think they know.
Now, clients are looking for companies with the capability to advise them, to respond proactively to their marketing issues, to predict how their markets will develop and uncover that nugget of information that leads to a change in marketing strategy.
A new model for client relationships Clients are increasingly seeking to develop a new type of relationship with their suppliers.
They are looking for dedicated resources and longer-term partnerships.
They want larger suppliers to draw on the depth of sector and research experience to provide new learnings.
They are allocating budget to more advisory and consultative services that will impact their bottom line.
The requirement for talent In todays market, therefore, delivering actionable insight and managing client relationships are key.
But they are not easily achieved.
Both require highly-skilled people to make them truly effective.
They need people who go beyond the traditional notion of an account director.
People who can make recommendations, build commercial relationships and lead accounts.
This requires the recruitment of the best people from within and outside of the market information industry, as well as the development of existing talent.
We are looking for someone on the account with a good brainwho can drive in on the issues where we need it and who has the presence and credibility to be rolled out in front of the MD.
