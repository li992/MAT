qxd 27 3 08 03:01 Page 2 SUMMARY REVIEW OF THE YEAR Executive Chairmans Statement The company is refocused, with the prospect of becoming self-financing, and capable of funding further investment, particularly in profitable international territories.
2007 started with a good deal of promise.
The A year of two halves... economic environment was on an improving trend, enabling us to remove the last remaining market value reductions for our customers with unitised with-profits investments.
Over the first half of the year, we extended the Groups international reach by launching our first product into the Singaporean market, and built on our recently-established foothold in the German pensions market.
In the UK we were attracting record levels of new pensions business, consolidating our position as a leading provider.
We were also delighted to have secured the acquisition of two successful and profitable intermediary businesses the Sesame Group and Pantheon Financial representing sound financial investments as well as bringing us closer to the needs and aspirations of customers and professional financial advisers in their respective markets.
In contrast, the second half of the year could not have been more different, becoming extremely challenging for global economies in general, for financial services as a whole and for the ongoing advance of the Friends Provident Group.
