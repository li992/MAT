Pensions Pension costs charged to profit from operations in 2007 for dened benefit plans were 4.0 million 2006: 7.4 million for continuing operations.
The Group operates retirement plans covering most employees.
A proportion of these are dened benefit plans funded by contributions from both employers and employees, at rates determined by independent actuaries through regular valuations, except where legislation prevents pre-funding.
The remainder are money purchase plans funded by contributions from both employers and employees.
The funds are held independently of the Groups nances and are administered by trustees.
Risk management Management of the Groups dened benefit pension risks is the responsibility of our Group treasury function.
A primary objective is to identify and manage the risk of both the assets and liabilities of the dened benefit pension plans and we continue to work with the trustees of our pension plans to improve the management of our dened benefit pension risks.
As part of this risk management process, we continue to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in 269.7 million of the total US dollar projected benefit obligation of 310.0 million of our US dened benefit pension plans.
This is achieved by investing 91.1 million in xed income assets and through the use of US dollar denominated interest rate swaps with a combined average duration of 12.7 years.
During the year, the hedging arrangement was effective.
As at 29 December 2007, the value of the Groups dened benefit pension liabilities was 600.4 million 2006: 648.9 million.
The graph above shows the attribution of the decrease in the liabilities during the year of 48.5 million.

In the US, the funding objective has 2.8 0.9 0.3 564.5 previously been to remain above the ERISA required minimum funding levels.
Accordingly, most of the US plans have been funded 532.3 on the basis of reaching or exceeding a 90% funded level on a current liability basis.

In future, Tomkins will adapt its funding policy to meet the requirements of the Pension Protection Act.
Tomkins recognises its responsibility to fund dened benefit pension plan deficits and views these deficits as being debt-like in nature.
Accordingly, where beneficial, Tomkins plc issues guarantees in respect of certain UK dened benefit pension plan deficits in order to improve the credit standing of these plans.
This also has the effect of minimising the cost of the Pension Protection Funds risk-based levy.
Cash contributions to the dened benefit pension plans in 2007 were 34.0 million 2006: 33.3 million.
In 2008, the cash contributions to the dened benefit pension plans are expected to be signicantly lower than in 2007 due to the higher funding levels that currently exist in our US plans.
The market value of the related assets was 564.5 million 2006: 532.3 million, resulting in net dened benefit pension liabilities before the effect of the asset ceiling and before tax of 35.9 million 2006: 116.6 million.
The graph above shows the attribution of the increase in the market value of assets during the year of 32.2 million.
Tomkins Annual Report 2007 43 Financial review continued Actuarial assumptions Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and updated where appropriate.
Tomkins believes that all dened benefit pension plans reect appropriate mortality assumptions.
Of our total dened benefit pension plan liabilities of 600.4 million, 469.7 million relates to benets that are deferred or currently being drawn, 8.2 million relates to benets for active participants that have been frozen in respect of future service or pay-related accruals, and a further 12.9 million relates to plans with benets based on length of service rather than changes in salary scale.
Therefore, 490.8 million of liabilities are not sensitive to changes in salary scale.
The majority of dened benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants and therefore the impact of changes in salary scale is limited.
109.6 million, or 18.3%, of the total dened benefit pension plans liabilities are sensitive to salary scale.
The table below shows the estimated sensitivity of the liabilities of the dened benefit pension plans to changes in the mortality and salary scale.
The impact of changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets is shown in note 33 to the financial statements.
Assumption Assumption change Impact on Estimated impact Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Liabilities Increase by 2.0% Service cost Increase by 1.5% Interest cost Increase by 2.1% Salary scale Increase by 0.5% Liabilities Increase by 0.6% Investment policy Investment of assets within the dened benefit pension plans is the responsibility of independent trustee boards over which Tomkins has varying degrees of influence based on national regulations.
In order to clarify its preferences regarding the investment of assets by the trustee boards, Tomkins plc has set out a statement of its investment preferences.
This has been communicated to the North American Retirement Board, which oversees our largest dened benefit pension plans, and to the Retirement Board of our Canadian dened benefit pension plans.
The statement of investment preferences is based on an underlying philosophy that assets should first be used to hedge risks implicit in the associated pension liabilities and, to the extent that assets are not invested for this purpose, it is the preference of Tomkins plc that the assets are invested in investment grade bonds and or a broad-based local equity index.
The performance of assets and liabilities in dened benefit pension plans is measured and reported to Tomkins Board and used as the basis for dialogue between Tomkins and trustee boards.
