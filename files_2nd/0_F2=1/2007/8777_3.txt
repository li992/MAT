JJB Sports plc Property review During the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007, we opened 13 sites and closed 35 sites.
The openings included 7 combined health clubs superstores, 3 standalone superstores and 3 football stores acquired from Glasgow Rangers and Everton.
The closures included 21 stores which formerly traded as Icon stores and 6 superstores which closed as a result of relocations to newly opened sites.
At 28 January 2007, we operated from 416 retail stores comprising 192 out-of-town superstores, 107 high street superstores, 103 smaller high street stores, 2 icon stores, 4 golf stores and 8 football club stores.
The retail selling space totalled approximately 4,295,000 square feet, a decrease of 2 per cent compared to the retail selling space in operation at 29 January 2006.
The number of superstores referred to above includes 37 combined health club superstores which are part of the Leisure Division.
These retail stores compare to 438 stores in operation at 29 January 2006, comprising 194 out of town superstores, 109 high street superstores, 108 smaller high street stores, 23 icon stores and 4 small golf stores, representing 4,398,000 square feet of selling space.
We have continued to pursue a policy of migrating from smaller high street stores to both high street superstores and outof-town superstores where a more complete range of clothing, footwear and equipment can be displayed.
Most of our outof-town openings will in future be of combined health club superstores.
Our store migration strategy provides customers with a more pleasant shopping experience and we expect this policy to maximise store profitability.
A further advantage of the continuing roll-out of combined health club superstores is that by negotiation with the landlords, we place a cap upon the cost of future rent-reviews, our experience of which on stand-alone superstores, is often double the current rate of inflation.
Agreements are in place with adidas and Nike to roll out up to 600 in-store areas for these brands over the next 2 years.
This programme was piloted towards the close of the accounting period just ended and is being rapidly implemented.
