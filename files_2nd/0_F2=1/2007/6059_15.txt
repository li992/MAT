Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
50 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 Significant accounting policies continued Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories: Fair value through the income statement This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the income statement, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either fair value through the income statement or Available For Sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
51 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Sterling bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and collars, fuel swaps and collars, and cross currency interest rate swaps and currency forwards.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk on certain floating rate debt, and fair value hedges for fair value risk relating to the LIBOR element of a fixed rate financial liability.
The fuel swaps and collars are designated as cash flow hedges of fuel price risks or otherwise used as economic hedges of such risks.
The cross currency swaps are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk relating to part of the Groups net investment in US Dollar assets.
The currency forwards are designated as a cash flow hedge of foreign exchange risk relating to US Dollar denominated fuel purchases in the UK.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made under IAS 37 for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
52 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 Significant accounting policies continued Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with effective dates starting after 1 April 2006: International Accounting Standard IAS International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised March 2007 1 January 2009 IFRIC IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 Under IFRS 7 the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specifically, the Group will need to disclose the fair values of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the above standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups Accounts in the period of initial application.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 468.8m 2006: 503.1m as set out in note 13 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at balance sheet date was 60.8m 2006: 30.0m as set out in note 14.
Defined benefit pension arrangements Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of future salary and pension increases along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these assumptions is the discount rate.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate applied would impact operating profit and the balance sheet deficit by approximately 1.0m and 23.0m respectively.
The net pension surplus as at the balance sheet date was 23.8m 2006: net deficit of 132.0m as set out in note 36.
Self-insurance Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as required.
The Groups total insurance reserves as at the balance sheet date was 70.9m 2006: 80.7m as set out in note 27.

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cash-generating unit.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent five year plan for the next four years and extrapolates cash flows for the following six years based on estimated growth rates of 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% for North America.
A discount rate of 10.0% was used in arriving at the value in use for each of the cash-generating units.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on historic performance of each cash-generating unit and are realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.
The goodwill is split as follows: 2007 2006 m m Carrying amount UK Bus 87.4 87.4 UK Rail 19.8 19.8 First Student 255.3 281.0 First Transit 54.7 57.3 First Services 51.6 57.6 468.8 503.1 The reduction in the carrying value of goodwill is mainly as a result of foreign exchange movements, as the balance sheet rate was $1.96 1 at 31 March 2007 compared with $1.74 1 at 31 March 2006, net of additions made during the year.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are short-term bank balances and cash, derivative financial instruments and short-term trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its short-term trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 2.3m 2006: 2.1m.
The credit risk on short-term cash assets and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
19 Non-current assets classified as held for sale Non-current assets held for sale comprise North American yellow school buses which are surplus to requirement and are being actively marketed on the Internet.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of such assets are included in arriving at operating profit in the income statement.
The Group expects to sell such yellow school buses within 12 months of them going onto the for sale list.

Financial risks and management In addition to certain pension risks, the most material financial risks faced by the Group are the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal treasury policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Group Finance Director.
66 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2007 25 Derivative financial instruments continued Foreign currency The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in retranslating net assets and earnings in US Dollars and Canadian Dollars to Sterling for reporting purposes.
The Groups objective is to hedge at a minimum of 30% for US Dollar net assets and 75% for other currencies.
As at 31 March 2007 there was a net investment hedge of 33% 2006: 34% of US net assets which were hedged with currency swaps and US Dollar debt.
The currency swaps expire in March 2011.
Any exchange gain or loss realised in cash on the swaps at expiry would remain in equity.
Retranslation risk on US Dollar earnings are substantially hedged through natural offset by US Dollar denominated costs, principally UK fuel costs and Dollar interest costs.
With the exception of UK fuel, transactional currency exposures are minimal.
Currency forward contracts from April 2007 to March 2008 have been entered into as a cash flow hedge of US Dollar denominated fuel costs in the UK.
Interest rate risk The Group has interest bearing cash and debt and therefore is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year.
The main floating rate benchmarks are UK LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Group achieves the policy objective through fixed rate debt and cash flow hedge financial instruments, being interest rate swaps and collars.
The interest rate swaps expire in the year ending 31 March 2008, with no material impact anticipated either to the cash flow or income statement.
The US interest rate collars expire in March 2009 and carry a floor of 3.6% and a ceiling of 5.75%.
They provide a partial economic hedge each year up to March 2009 on US Dollar LIBOR risk over this period.
They are not anticipated to have a material impact on either cash flow or income statement over this period as long as the LIBOR rate remains within the collar range.
At 31 March 2007, 81% 2006: 85% of net debt was fixed with an average duration of 3.4 years 2006: 4.1 years.
It is Board policy to hedge 100% of interest rate risk in finance leases.
Fair value changes in the 250m Sterling bond relating to the LIBOR element is hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps match the fair value movements of the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bond.
Interest income is received in January and payments made in March and September each year.
Commodity price risk fuel prices The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term, so that the businesses have time to prepare and adjust for prices after the current hedge period expires.
The Group uses a range of cash flow hedge financial instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty, mainly swaps and collars.
During the year to 31 March 2007, the Group hedged 100% of crude price risk in the UK and 76% of crude price risk in the US.
The Group also entered into swaps for periods from April 2007 to March 2011 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31 March 2008.
The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.
Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs.
Credit risk The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of the financial assets as disclosed above, and trade receivables as disclosed in note 18.
Most of trade receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies, principally the UK DfT, Network Rail, Transport for London, UK city councils: School Bus Boards and city councils in North America.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant risk.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board and it is Board policy to require institutions to have a credit rating of at least A from an international rating agency.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed bank facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
At 31 March 2007, the total amount of committed facilities stood at 520m 2006: 527m.
It is Group policy to maintain a minimum of 100m of committed borrowing headroom, to support financial flexibility.
At 31 March 2007, committed borrowing headroom stood at 201.3m 2006: 211.0m under the Groups 520m syndicated bank facility.
This bank facility expires in March 2010.
67 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Derivative financial instruments continued The Group has an average debt duration at 31 March 2007 of 6.4 years 2006: 7.8 years, principally provided by its two Sterling bonds, expiring in 2013 and 2019.
26 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods.
Accelerated Other tax temporary Tax depreciation differences losses Total Assets liabilities m m m m At 1 April 2005 134.3 53.1 40.5 40.7 Charge credit to income 32.9 32.0 21.6 43.3 Charge to equity 2.6 2.6 Acquisition of subsidiary 3.6 3.6 Exchange differences 4.9 0.3 3.0 1.6 At 31 March 2006 172.1 22.4 65.1 84.6 Charge to income note 10 4.0 20.7 7.9 32.6 Charge to equity 30.4 30.4 Exchange differences 11.0 1.1 7.2 4.9 At 31 March 2007 165.1 27.6 50.0 142.7 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 177m 2006: 148m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It has been announced that the UK corporation tax rate is to reduce from 30% to 28% on 1 April 2008 and that Industrial Buildings Allowances will be abolished.
These changes in tax law are not expected to be enacted until during the year ended 31 March 2009 and are expected to affect the carrying value of deferred tax at 31 March 2009.
The effect of the reduction in the UK Corporation tax rate will be to reduce the deferred tax liability on UK temporary differences at 31 March 2009.
The deferred tax liability on UK property will increase at 31 March 2009 because there will be a reduction in the tax base of property that would have qualified for Industrial Buildings Allowances prior to abolition.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 10m 2006: 10m of capital losses.

The amount included within provisions above represents the estimate of amounts due after more than one year.
The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that the majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years.
The pension provision relates to certain un-funded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies.
It is anticipated that this will be utilised over several decades.

The inputs into the Black-Scholes model were as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price pence : DBS 402.0 326.0 SAYE April 2006 406.2 Dean Finch options 402.0 SAYE December 2006 555.0 Weighted average exercise price pence : DBS SAYE April 2006 325.0 Dean Finch options SAYE December 2006 444.0 Expected volatility all options 35% 35% Expected life Dean Finch options 5 years SAYE schemes 3 years Deferred share bonus plans 5 years 3 years Risk-free rate of interest DBS 4.4% 4.99% SAYE April 2006 4.4% SAYE December 2006 5.0% Dean Finch options 4.4% Expected dividend yield DBS 4.5% 4.5% SAYE April 2006 4.5% SAYE December 2006 3.5% Dean Finch options 4.5% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.
Fair values for the SAYE include a 10% p. a. pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for pre-vesting forfeitures.
The Group used the inputs noted above to measure the fair value of the new share options.
d Buy As You Earn BAYE scheme BAYE enables eligible employees to purchase shares from their gross income.
The Company provides two matching shares for every three shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 per employee per month.
If the shares are held in trust for five years or more, no income tax and national insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 31 March 2007 there were 6,609 2006: 4,576 participants in the BAYE scheme who have cumulatively purchased 2,264,621 2006: 1,781,489 shares with the Company contributing 679,416 2006: 553,009 matching shares on a cumulative basis.

36 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 3.1m 2006: 2.8m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally defined benefit schemes under which benefits provided are based on employees number of years of service and either career average or final salary.
The scope of benefits varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups finances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
The various defined benefit schemes include five UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
First Greater Western Limited, First Capital Connect Limited, First ScotRail Limited, GB Rail and TransPennine Express have sections in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, which is an industry-wide arrangement.
Under the terms of the RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40%.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 76.0% and 99.6% 2006: 69.0% and 99.6%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2007 for all defined benefit schemes totalled 2,507m 2006: 1,993m.
Contributions are paid to all defined benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The valuations are made using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.
