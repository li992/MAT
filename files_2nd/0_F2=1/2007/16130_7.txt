the resulting new audiences have proved very attractive to advertisers.

notably, the Scotcareers brand has achieved a strong position in the recruitment market in Scotland and we will continue to focus on developing share in this marketplace.
this has provided a firm base for the launch of Scotwheels in 2006 and Scotthelot during 2007.
Other digital activities have also seen a significant improvement in performance, reflecting the benefit of focused investment to drive incremental revenues to supplement the core circulation and print advertising revenues.
the strong revenue performance coupled with tight cost management has contributed to operating profit increasing by 17.6% to 94.3 million.

CENTRAl COSTS during the year central costs increased by 1.4 million, from 16.1 million to 17.5 million.
this increase is predominately driven by the costs associated with the aborted sale of the regional newspapers in the midlands and two sub-regions in the South.
