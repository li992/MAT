Assurance activities A profit of 1.6 million 2006: 11.5 million was generated from Assurance Activities, which represents the residual earnings from the businesses that were retained following the reinsurance of the group risk business on 31 December 2004.
Central costs We have a policy of allocating costs that are housed in the centre that are, in effect, performing a function for the divisions of the group.
There are certain costs that are strategic in nature which have not been allocated for pure segmental disclosure, amounting to 74.6 million.
However, a portion thereof 61.6 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Refer to page 27 for further details.
Central costs increased from 57.9 million to 74.6 million, largely as a result of an increase in variable remuneration given increased profitability.
Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained.
Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the specific financial and strategic requirements the group faces at the relevant point in time.
The funds raised are applied towards making acquisitions, funding central services and debt obligations, and purchasing corporate 70 assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

The decline in other income reflects: - A lower level of return on certain of the assets in the South African portfolio.
- A loss of 3.4 million arising on the derivative hedging of the preferred securities issued by a subsidiary of Investec plc from Euros into Pounds Sterling.
This exposure is hedged with the equal and opposite impact reflected in earnings attributable to minorities.
