The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and Group keep accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards, the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulations.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

It is accepted that legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
GOING CONCERN In forming its opinion as to going concern, the Board prepares a working capital forecast based upon its assumptions as to trading as well as taking into account the available borrowing facilities in line with the Treasury Policy above.
The Board also prepares a number of alternative scenarios modelling the business variables and key risks and uncertainties, both as summarised in the Operating and Financial Review.
Based upon these, the Board has concluded that the Group has adequate working capital and therefore confirm their belief that, it is appropriate to use the going concern basis of preparation for the financial statements of the Company and the Group.
