Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Remuneration policy The Board as a whole establishes the remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to the Board the framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Chief Executives remuneration proposals for the members of the Executive Committee and for other senior executives reporting directly to him are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and recommendations are made to the Board.
The Remuneration Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy as detailed by the Chief Executive in respect of other levels of management in the Company and makes such recommendations to the Chief Executive as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and Chairman is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
No Director is involved in determining or voting on their own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committees objective is to ensure that those individuals are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner having regard to the performance of the Company, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a competitive form and amount to attract, retain and motivate high quality management.
The importance of aligning the interests of Executive Directors and senior executives with shareholders is carefully considered, particularly in the design of the performance-related elements of their remuneration packages.
Key developments The Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy in 2007 and has recommended amendments to the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP which, if approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM, are to be effective from 1 January 2008.
In conducting this review the Committee considered current market and competitive practice, UK Institutional Shareholders guidance and best practice.
Shareholder approval will be sought at the forthcoming AGM for the introduction of an earnings per share performance target to determine the level of vesting of half of the performance shares granted in the future under the LTIP Part B, with the other half continuing to be subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance condition.
Assuming shareholder approval is obtained to the proposed amendment to the LTIP performance condition policy, it is intended that future LTIP Part A share option grants for Executive Directors and nominated senior executives, will be replaced with substitute grants of performance shares, under the LTIP Part B, worth up to 50% of salary for Executive Directors and up to 37.5% of salary for nominated senior executives.
In addition, as part of the review of the LTIP and having regard to comments received from shareholders, the Company is to amend the rules to bring the treatment of awards in the event of a change in control in line with best practice.
For future performance share awards the extent to which awards may vest in the event of a takeover or winding-up of the Company will be subject to: i the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied at that time: and ii pro-rating to reflect the reduced time period between grant and vesting, although the Remuneration Committee retains the flexibility not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.
The rules of the LTIP in their current form provide that in the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company a participants performance share award may vest in full if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the performance of the Company has been satisfactory over the curtailed performance period.
As the proposed changes are not to the advantage of future participants, the Remuneration Committee will rely on its authority under the rules of the LTIP to make such changes without shareholder consent.
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee intends to review the remuneration policy with particular regard to the impact of environmental, social and governance issues on executive remuneration within Filtrona.

40 Filtrona plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements The Remuneration Committee structures senior executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of cash and deferred share bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable performance-related pay element forms a significant portion of each Directors package.
The majority of Executive Directors total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive from the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to the Companys strategic objective to secure longterm shareholder value creation.
Following the announcement on 4 December 2007 regarding his departure, Steve Dryden will resign from the Board of Directors on 19 March 2008 and his employment with the Company will cease on 31 March 2008.
Steve will continue to receive his salary and benefits in the usual course up to 31 March 2008 and will receive the bonus due to him for the year ended 31 December 2007.
No ex-gratia termination payments will be made to him and, in accordance with the applicable scheme rules and the remuneration policy, all LTIP and DASB awards which have not vested as at the date of his departure will lapse.
Components of Directors remuneration for 2007 The emoluments of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2007 were as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 2007 2006 Fees Salary Bonus Benefits Total Fees Salary Bonus Benefits Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Executive Directors Mark Harper 455 217 22 694 420 147 21 588 Steve Dryden 302 129 4 435 278 88 13 379 Non-executive Directors Jeff Harris 156 156 150 150 Paul Drechsler 42 42 40 40 Adrian Auer 42 42 40 40 Lars Emilson 23 23 Warren Knowlton 11 11 19 19 Includes a supplementary payment of 32,000 in respect of pension provision above the scheme specific earnings cap Includes a supplementary payment of 28,430 in respect of pension provision above the notional HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap Appointed 1 May 2007 Resigned 30 April 2007 Salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual and pay conditions elsewhere in the Company.

com Corporate Governance Report of the Remuneration Committee Annual bonuses Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2007, Mark Harper and Steve Dryden were each potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 100% of basic salary 50% in cash and 50% in shares in the Company the entitlement to such shares being deferred for three years, in accordance with the rules of the DASB.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the performance targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee and based upon Filtronas adjusted earnings per share.
Company performance was required to reach a minimum adjusted EPS target of 15.7p for a bonus of 30% of basic salary to be payable 15% in cash and 15% in deferred shares under the DASB.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the Companys performance exceeded the minimum target and the Remuneration Committee approved a bonus of 95.5% of basic salary for Mark Harper 47.75% in cash and 47.75% in deferred shares under the DASB.
Steve Dryden was awarded a cash bonus of 47.75% of basic salary but was not entitled to a DASB award.
When approving the bonus awards, the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the impact of certain exceptional items upon the Companys earnings per share performance and, having regard to the interests of shareholders, made certain adjustments and specifically excluded the impact during the year of the Duraco acquisition and the Globalpack disposal.
Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan The DASB provides for Executive Directors and nominated senior executives to receive existing issued ordinary shares in the Company for nil payment.
The number of shares subject to an award is determined at the time the award is granted, based upon the performance in Filtronas preceding financial year of the participant and or the Company and or the division in which the participant works.
Under the Rules of the DASB the aggregate value of shares made subject to awards granted to a participant in any one financial year may not exceed 100% of their basic salary as at the award date.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that, in accordance with the Companys bonus arrangements, awards under DASB will not normally exceed 50% of basic salary.
Shares awarded under the DASB are held in trust until 1 March in the third calendar year after the year in which the award was made, at which point they are transferred to the participant subject to the participants continued employment within the Group.
Details of the awards granted to the Executive Directors under the DASB in 2007 are shown in the table on page 44.
Executive LTIP share-based incentive plans The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that offering Executive Directors and nominated senior executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating, rewarding and retaining key employees so that they may drive and participate in the future growth of the Company.
It is also of the view that the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives should be encouraged to invest directly in the Company through the purchase of shares.
The Companys DASB and LTIP are both intended to support these objectives.
On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee the Company has adopted shareholding guidelines for both Executive Directors and nominated senior executives.
The award of shares or options under the Executive share-based incentive plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account, inter alia, the role of the individual, and other such criteria as they may determine from time to time.
The current policy is that participation in the DASB and the LTIP Part B is restricted to Executive Directors, and nominated senior executives.
Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM to the proposed changes to the LTIP Part B performance condition policy, is intended that going forward no further awards will be made under the LTIP Part A to the Executive Directors and such nominated senior executives, and participation in the LTIP Part A will be limited to other designated employees.
Awards under the Companys share-based incentive plans will be satisfied using market purchases, new issue shares and or shares held in treasury.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan Part A The LTIP Part A provides for participants to receive share option awards over shares worth up to two times basic salary or 250,000 whichever is the greatest in any financial year, subject to performance conditions.
42 Filtrona plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements During 2007 the Executive Directors received share option awards over shares worth up to 100% of basic salary, with lesser awards made to other participants and the exercise price set equal to the share price at the date of the grant.
A share option award will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following its grant, but only if the specified performance condition has been satisfied.
The performance conditions attached to the LTIP Part A awards made in 2007 were based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation relative to inflation over three financial years, requiring such earnings per share growth to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum.
The performance condition will be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for re-testing.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant share option awards will lapse.
The awards granted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 under the LTIP Part A are subject to EPS targets.
At the end of 2007 the annual performance targets had been met and the 2005 awards would vest.
The remaining awards may vest dependent upon the Companys performance over the remainder of the relevant three year testing period.
Save As You Earn Scheme In addition to the LTIP, the Company operates a Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE.
During the year the Company made its second award under the rules of the SAYE.
The Executive Directors joined the SAYE in 2006 contributing the statutory maximum monthly amount of 250, and thus they were not eligible to participate in the 2007 invitation.
Details of the awards granted and outstanding during the year to Executive Directors under the LTIP Part A and the SAYE are as follows: At 1 Jan Awarded At 31 Dec Exercise Earliest Executive Director Scheme 2007 in year 2007 price vesting date Expiry date Mark Harper LTIP Part A 156,903 156,903 239.00p 23 June 2008 22 June 2015 LTIP Part A 148,380 148,380 254.75p 8 Sept 2009 7 Sept 2016 LTIP Part A 190,376 190,376 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,793 6,793 237.00p 1 April 2011 30 Sept 2011 Steve Dryden LTIP Part A 96,234 96,234 239.00p 23 June 2008 22 June 2015 LTIP Part A 88,321 88,321 254.75p 8 Sept 2009 7 Sept 2016 LTIP Part A 106,694 106,694 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,793 6,793 237.00p 1 April 2011 30 Sept 2011 The Long-Term Incentive Plan Part B A performance share award under the LTIP Part B consists of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to performance conditions, on the basis described below.
Participants make no payment for the grant and exercise of performance share awards.
Participants may receive performance share awards over shares worth up to two times their basic salary in any financial year.
In June 2005, following the demerger, the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives were granted a once-off matching share award linked to their investment in the Companys shares.
43 Filtrona plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 www.
com Corporate Governance Report of the Remuneration Committee A performance share award, including any matching share award, will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
For employees based outside the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth anniversary of grant.
For employees based in the US, once the performance conditions have been satisfied the options must be exercised within 30 days of vesting.
In the case of the vesting of the matching share awards granted by reference to shares purchased by participants, not only will applicable performance conditions have to be satisfied but those awards will only vest to the extent that participants have retained the shares they bought in June 2005.
For awards granted prior to 2008, the extent to which performance share awards vest is subject to the Companys TSR performance over a fixed three year period relative to the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts at the start of the three year performance period.
Identical conditions were attached to the matching share awards.
A performance share award, including any matching share award, will vest in full only if the Companys TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the peer group over the performance period.
For median performance one quarter of such awards vests, rising proportionally up to full vesting thereafter.
For below median performance, no such awards will vest.
The performance condition will be tested after three years and there is no provision for re-testing.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three years, the relevant performance or matching share awards will lapse.
For awards granted in 2008 and beyond it is intended that, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, 50% of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition as set out above and 50% of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards will require the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation over three financial years to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum for 12.5% of the awards to vest.
The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight line basis, and for 50% of the awards to vest such adjusted EPS growth must exceed inflation by an average of at least 8% per annum.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant awards will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions each time performance share awards are granted under the LTIP Part B in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share awards granted in subsequent years.

At the end of 2007 the Company was ranked below median and the performance target had not been met.

In accordance with best practice, letters of appointment have been issued for all Non-executive Directors for an initial period of three years.
These letters are available for inspection by members at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Companys registered office.

Pension schemes Mark Harper is a member of the Filtrona Senior Pension Scheme FSPS which entitles him to a pension at the date of retirement based on final salary.
His pension is calculated as the lower of an accrual rate of 3% per annum or uniform accrual so that the pension at his normal retirement date is equivalent to 66.67% of final pensionable salary.
The uniform accrual calculation is based on a normal retirement age of 60 and is equivalent to an accrual rate of 2.2% per annum.
Mark Harper contributes 9% of pensionable salary to the scheme.
Steve Dryden is a member of the BRIS section of the Filtrona Pension Plan FPP which entitles him to a pension at the date of retirement based on final salary.
He accrues pension at the rate of 1.9% of final salary for each year of membership of the plan and he contributes 7% of pensionable salary to the plan.
