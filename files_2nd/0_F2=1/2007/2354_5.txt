The Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act received Royal Assent in November 2006.
The 2006 Act represents a major reform of UK companies legislation.
Some provisions of the 2006 Act are already in force with further provisions currently scheduled to be implemented in October 2008 and October 2009.
The Board therefore proposes that, at this years Annual General Meeting, the Company amend its Articles of Association the Articles to reflect certain changes in the law, in particular governing electronic communications and directors conflicts of interest, which have or will come into force as a result of the 2006 Act.
However, over the coming year, the Company intends to conduct a further review of the Articles, incorporating any further changes which are necessary or desirable following the full implementation of the 2006 Act.
Any proposed amendments as a result of this second review will be put to members at the 2009 Annual General Meeting.
In addition, since the adoption of the current Articles on 7 May 2002, the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003 the Regulations came into force on 1 December 2003.
It is proposed that the Company amends its Articles in line with the Regulations to allow shares repurchased by the Company to be held as treasury shares, should it wish to do so.
The material differences between the current and the amended Articles are summarised in the explanatory notes to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting at the back of this annual report and accounts.
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of shareholders at a general meeting, unless expressly specified to the contrary therein.
At a meeting on 7 March 2008, the Board resolved that a resolution be submitted to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting proposing the renewal of the authority to enable the Company to purchase up to 10% of its own shares.
At the present time, the directors have no wish to exercise the authority to purchase any of the shares of the Company, but consider that it is appropriate to have the flexibility to do so.
Any shares so purchased would be cancelled.
The directors believe that all the resolutions proposed to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, unanimously recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their own shares in the Company.
Auditors Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that: so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware: and each director has taken all the steps that he she ought to have taken as a director to make himself herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
The auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, have indicated their willingness to continue in office and, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, resolutions concerning their re-appointment and remuneration will be placed before the Annual General Meeting.
