As transport markets open up to competitive tendering across mainland Europe we have a host of opportunities to establish and grow our operations.

Our different networks work in different ways, according to whether we operate contracted, or non-contracted business.
As a result, revenue across the group is derived from a combination of passenger revenue, and non-passenger revenue, which can include support payments from governments.
