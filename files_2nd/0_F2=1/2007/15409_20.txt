03 How we performed Operating and financial review Net finance expense The net finance expense from continuing operations was 38 million compared with 33 million in the year to 31 March 2006, due principally to higher net debt to fund both investments in capital and acquisitions during the year.
This includes a net credit of 2 million 2006 net charge of 3 million relating to retirement benefits.
The interest rate in the year, calculated as net finance expense on total operations divided by average net debt, was 4.6% 2006 5.2%.
Interest cover based on total operations was 10.1 times 2006 9.9 times.
Taxation The taxation charge from continuing businesses was 105 million 2006 60 million.
The increase in the charge is due mainly to tax credits in the prior year relating to exceptional charges.
The effective rate of tax on profit excluding exceptional items and amortisation was 29.0% 2006 30.0%.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the utilisation of previously unrecognised losses in Europe.
Dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of 15.3p as an ordinary dividend to be paid on 26 July 2007 to shareholders on the Register of Members on 29 June 2007.
This represents an increase in the total dividend for the year of 1.5p per share.
An interim dividend of 6.2p 2006 5.9p was paid on 9 January 2007.
Total earnings before exceptional items and amortisation covered the proposed total dividend 2.3 times.
Retirement benefits The Group income statement contains two main elements: a service charge to operating profit, representing the annual ongoing cost of providing benefits to active members: and a net finance cost or credit, representing the difference between the expected return on the assets in the funds and interest on servicing future liabilities, calculated using a corporate bond yield.
The charge to operating profit before exceptional items for retirement benefits in the year to 31 March 2007 for the total Group was 21 million 2006 20 million.
Under IAS19 the net pension deficit decreased by 25 million to 52 million, and the US healthcare provision decreased by 18 million to 77 million.
Contributions to the Groups pension funds, both regular and supplementary, totalled 40 million 2006 40 million.
Supplementary payments totalled 16 million 2006 17 million.
Net debt and cash flow The Groups net debt increased from 866 million to 900 million.
The adoption of IFRIC4 increased opening net debt of 858 million at 31 March 2006 as previously reported by 8 million due to the reclassification of arrangements previously treated as operating leases to finance leases.
The increase in net debt comprised a strong operating cash flow, which was more than offset by continued investment in the Groups capital programme, dividends and taxation.
Exchange translation reduced net debt by 58 million.
Operating cash flow before working capital totalled 298 million compared with 307 million in the previous year.
There was a working capital outflow from continuing operations of 71 million 2006 220 million outflow.
This was principally caused by increased inventory in Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas partially offset by inflows in the sugar trading operations as lower world sugar prices resulted in lower stock values compared to the high values at 31 March 2006.
Net interest paid totalled 44 million 2006 27 million.
Net taxation paid from continuing operations was 87 million 2006 90 million.
44 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2007 Capital expenditure was 251 million 2006 273 million.
Free cash inflow representing cash generated from operations after interest, taxation and capital expenditure totalled 9 million 2006 outflow 148 million.
Equity dividends were 98 million 2006 93 million.
In total, a net 142 million 2006 120 million was paid to providers of finance as dividends and interest.
A net inflow of 16 million was received relating to employees exercising share options during the year 2006 16 million.
The ratio of net debt to total earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and total amortisation EBITDA was 1.9 times, the same as in the prior year.
During the year net debt peaked at 900 million in March 2007 in the prior year it peaked at 866 million in March 2006.
The average net debt was 804 million, an increase of 166 million from 638 million in the prior year.
Shareholders equity Shareholders equity at 31 March 2007 was 995 million, 55 million higher than at 31 March 2006.
The increase is due mainly to the retained profit in the year offset by the impact of exchange translation on US dollar net assets.
Funding and liquidity The Group funds its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowing management facilities, including capital markets and bank borrowings.
In order to ensure maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs, the Group seeks to maintain access to a wide range of funding sources.
In June 2006, Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC issued a dual tranche US$550 million 144A bond with US$300 million at 6.125% maturing in June 2011 and US$250 million at 6.625% maturing in June 2016.
The proceeds of this issue have been used to repay certain maturing debt obligations and for general corporate purposes.
Other capital market borrowings outstanding at 31 March 2007 include the 200 million 6.50% bond maturing in 2012 and the US$500 million 5.00% 144A bond maturing in 2014.
At 31 March 2007 the Groups long-term credit ratings from Moodys and Standard & Poors were Baa2 and BBB respectively.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities to provide liquidity back-up for its US commercial paper programme and other short-term money market borrowing for the foreseeable future.
The Group has committed bank facilities of US$615 million which mature in 2009 with a core of highly rated banks.
These facilities are unsecured and contain common financial covenants for Tate & Lyle and its subsidiary companies that the pre-exceptional and amortisation interest cover ratio should not be less than 2.5 times and the multiple of net debt to EBITDA, as defined in our financial covenants, should not be greater than 4.0 times.
The internal targets for these items are a minimum of 5.0 times and a maximum of 2.5 times, respectively.
The Group monitors compliance against all its financial obligations and it is Group policy to manage the consolidated balance sheet so as to operate well within covenanted restrictions at all times.
The majority of the Groups borrowings are raised through the Group treasury company, Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC, and are then on-lent to the business units on an arms length basis.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2007 45 STATUTORY INFORMATION HOW WE RUN THE BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED WHAT WE DO OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR 03 How we performed Operating and financial review The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities.
Group policy is to ensure that, after subtracting the total of undrawn committed facilities, no more than 30% of gross debt matures within 12 months and at least 50% has a maturity of more than two and a half years.
At the year end, after subtracting total undrawn committed facilities, there was no debt maturing within 12 months and 75% of debt had a maturity of two and a half years or more 2006 10% and 90%.
The average maturity of the Groups gross debt was 6.2 years 2006 4.8 years.
At the year end the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 189 million 2006 158 million and committed facilities of 312 million 2006 354 million, of which 236 million 2006 354 million were undrawn.
These resources are maintained to provide liquidity back-up and to meet the projected maximum cash outflow from debt repayment, capital expenditure and seasonal working capital needs foreseen for at least a year into the future at any one time.
Funding not treated as debt The Group seeks to optimise its financing costs in respect of all financing transactions.
Where it is economically beneficial, operating leases are undertaken in preference to purchasing assets.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the lessor assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are treated as operating leases with annual rentals charged to the income statement over the term of the lease.
Commitments under operating leases to pay rentals in future years totalled 201 million 2006 229 million and related primarily to railcar leases in the US.
Financial risk controls Management of financial risk The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and certain commodity price risks.
Tate & Lyle also faces risks which are non-financial or non-quantifiable, for example country and credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves written policies covering the use of financial instruments to manage these risks and sets overall risk limits.
All the Groups material financial instruments are categorised as being held either for trading or risk management.
Financial instruments held for trading within the Group are severely limited, confined only to tightly controlled areas within the sugar and corn pricing operations and reinsurance activities.
The derivative financial instruments approved by the Board to manage financial risks include swaps, both interest rate and currency, swaptions, caps, forward rate agreements, financial and commodity forward contracts and options, and commodity futures.
Control and direction of treasury Tate & Lyles Group treasury function operates within a framework of clearly defined Board-approved policies and procedures setting out permissible funding and hedging instruments, exposure limits and a system of authorities for the approval of transactions.
Most of the Groups financing, interest rate and foreign exchange risks and other treasury activities are managed through the Group treasury company, Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC, whose operations are controlled by its Board.
The treasury company is chaired by the Group Finance Director and has other Board members independent of the treasury function.
Group interest rate and currency exposures are concentrated either in the treasury company or in appropriate holding companies through market-related transactions with Group subsidiaries.
These acquired positions are managed by the treasury company within its authorised limits.
46 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2007 Interest rate risk The exposure to fluctuating interest rates is managed by fixing or capping portions of debt using interest rate derivatives to achieve a target level of fixed floating rate net debt, which aims to optimise net finance expense and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups policy is that between 30% and 75% of Group net debt excluding the Groups share of joint venture net debt is fixed or capped excluding out-of-the-money caps for more than one year and that no interest rate fixings are undertaken for more than 12 years.
At 31 March 2007 the longest term of any fixed rate debt held by the Group was until June 2016.
The proportion of net debt excluding the Groups share of joint venture net debt that was fixed or capped for more than one year was 58% 2006 35%.
If the interest rates applicable to the Groups floating rate debt rise from the levels at the end of March 2007 by an average of 1% over the year to 31 March 2008, this would reduce Group profit before tax by approximately 3 million.
Management of foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional foreign currency exposures arising from sales and purchases by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currencies.
The Groups foreign currency exposure management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge transactional currency exposures against their functional currency once they are committed or highly probable, mainly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups accounting policy is to translate profits of overseas companies using average exchange rates.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from profit translation.
The Group has significant investment in overseas operations, particularly in the Americas and Europe.
Movements in exchange rates between balance sheet dates can affect the sterling value of the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
The currency profile of net debt is managed, where practicable and cost effective, to mitigate the effect of these translational exposures arising on the Groups net investment in overseas operations.
This is achieved by borrowing principally in US dollars and euros, which provide a match for the Groups major foreign currency assets.
At the year end, net debt excluding the Groups share of joint venture net debt was held in the following currencies: net borrowings of US and Canadian dollars 72% 2006 72%, euro 20% 2006 37%, other currencies 5% 2006 0% and sterling of 3% 2006 deposits of 9%.
The weighted average exchange rate used to translate US dollar profits was US$1.89 2006 US$1.79, compared with the year-end rate of US$1.97 2006 US$1.74.
The only material risks from economic foreign currency exposures are to the UK sugar refining business from sterling appreciation against the euro.
Credit risk The Group controls credit risk by entering into financial instruments only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties which are reviewed and approved regularly by the Board.
Counterparty positions are monitored on a regular basis.
Price risk Derivatives are used to hedge movements in the future prices of commodities in those domestic and international markets where the Group buys and sells sugar, corn and wheat.
Commodity futures and options are used to hedge inventories and the costs of raw materials for unpriced and prospective contracts not covered by forward product sales.
The options and futures hedging contracts generally mature within one year and all are with organised exchanges.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2007 47 STATUTORY INFORMATION HOW WE RUN THE BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED WHAT WE DO OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR 03 How we performed Operating and financial review Use and fair value of In the normal course of business the Group uses derivative financial instruments and financial instruments non-derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of Group net borrowings at the year end was 950 million against a book value of 900 million 2006 fair value 877 million: book value 866 million.
Derivative financial instruments used to manage the interest rate and currency of borrowings had a fair value of 24 million asset 2006 12 million asset.
The main types of instrument used are interest rate swaps, interest rate options caps or floors and cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The fair value of other derivative financial instruments hedging future currency and commodity transactions was 1 million asset 2006 3 million liability.
In currency exposure management the instruments used are spot and forward purchases and sales, and options.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments held for trading was 27 million liability 2006 71 million asset arising in the commodity trading and reinsurance operations.
The net gain included in operating profit from trading financial instruments was 5 million 2006 7 million loss.
Fair value estimation The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date if they are publicly traded.
The fair value of the forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, receivables, payables, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate their book values.
The fair values of bonds, bank and other loans, including finance lease liabilities due in more than one year, are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments, adjusted for the fair valuation effects of currency and interest rate risk exposures where those instruments form part of a related hedging relationship agreements, financial and commodity forward contracts and options, and commodity futures.
The value of certain items of merchandisable agricultural commodities that are included in inventories are based on market prices.
Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
