Statement of corporate governance Application of principles of good corporate governance There is, and historically there has been, throughout the company and the group, a commitment to high standards of corporate governance.
The directors continue to develop procedures which ensure that, where the board considers it appropriate, the Beazley group will comply with the Combined Code on corporate governance.
Compliance with code provisions The board confirms that the company and the group have, save for the composition of the board, complied with the provisions set out in the Combined Code for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The board is accountable to the companys shareholders for good governance and the statements set out below describe how the principles identied in the revised Combined Code have been applied by the group.
The board The board consists of a non-executive chairman, Jonathan Agnew, together with five independent non-executive directors, of which Andy Pomfret is the senior non-executive director, and seven executive directors, of which Andrew Beazley is chief executive.
All five of the non-executive directors, who have been appointed for specified terms, are considered by the board to be independent of management and free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Given that the business of the group is insurance underwriting organised by line of business in divisions, the board continues to consider it appropriate that some of the underwriting heads of the major divisions should be executive directors.
Notwithstanding that the company is included in the FTSE 250 index, it does not consider it desirable to increase the number of non-executive directors to outnumber the executive directors since the range of skills and experience of the existing non-executive directors is sufficient and the increased size of the board would make it unwieldy.
Indeed the board intends over the medium term to reduce its size to some extent, provided that this can be achieved without signicantly impairing the underwriting experience represented on it.
Biographies of board members appear on pages 38 to 39 of this report.
These indicate the high levels and range of business experience that are essential to manage a business of this size and complexity.
A well dened operational and management structure is in place, and terms of reference exist for all board committees.
The roles and responsibilities of senior executives and key members of staff are clearly dened.
The full board meets at least four times each year and more frequently where business needs require.
The board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decision including, inter alia: statutory matters: approval of financial statements and dividends: appointments and terminations of directors, ofcers and auditors: appointments of committees and setting of terms of reference: review of group performance against budgets: approving of risk management strategy and material contracts: and the determining of authority levels within which management is required to operate.
There is an agreed principle that directors may take independent professional advice if necessary at the companys expense, on the basis that the expense is reasonable.
This is in addition to the access which every director has to the company secretary.
The secretary is charged by the board with ensuring that board procedures are followed.
To enable the board to function effectively and directors to discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all relevant information.
In the case of board meetings, this consists of a comprehensive set of papers, including regular business progress reports and discussion documents regarding specic matters.
The composition of and appointments to the board of both executive and non-executive directors are considered by the nomination committee.
The recommendations of the nomination committee are ultimately made to the full board, which considers them before any change is made.
The remuneration committee considers any remuneration package of executive directors before it is offered to a potential appointee.
The members of the audit, remuneration, nomination and investment committees are set out below.
Any director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions of the companys articles of association, to retire and seek re-election by shareholders at the next annual general meeting.
The articles also require that one third of the directors retire by rotation each year and seek re-election at the annual general meeting, and the directors required to retire are those in ofce longest since their previous re-election.
In addition, each director is required to retire at least once in any three-year period.
Full details of directors remuneration and a statement of the companys remuneration policy are set out in the directors remuneration report on pages 44 to 54.
The members of the remuneration committee and the principal terms of reference of the committee appear on page 42.
com Meetings with non-executive directors The chairman holds meetings as required with the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present.
Board performance evaluation In accordance with the requirements of the Combined Code, the board undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors in 2007 and the issues identied and recommendations from the evaluation, in particular in relation to the composition of the board are to be implemented.

Risk management provides reports to the audit committee on the risk assessment and the self-certication from risk owners of the operating effectiveness of internal controls.
In respect of any rm of external auditors and consulting actuaries which may be appointed by any group company, the audit committee is also responsible for recommending their appointment and termination: recommending their terms of reference: receiving regular reports, independently of management where necessary: determining their independence: monitoring their performance: and approving their fees.
Beazley Annual Report 2007 41 Statement of corporate governance continued Following a recommendation from the audit committee, the board has adopted a policy in relation to the provision of non-audit services by the auditors.
The objective is to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the external auditors objectivity.
The policy specifically disallows certain activities to be provided by the auditor such as bookkeeping and accounting services, internal actuarial service, internal audit outsourcing services and executive remuneration services.
The policy requires preapproval for all material other services such as due diligence assistance, tax services and advice on accounting and audit matters.
The aim is to limit the total spend on non-audit services to a maximum of the annual audit fee unless it is deemed to be in the shareholders interest from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view.
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year under review is disclosed on page 82.
All of these are considered by the audit committee not to affect the auditors independence or objectivity.
Following publication of the Combined Code on corporate governance, the terms of reference of the audit committee have been expanded.
These are published on the companys website.
Remuneration committee The remuneration committee comprise Dudley Fishburn as chairman, together with Andy Pomfret, Dan Jones and Gordon Hamilton.

Audit and internal control The respective responsibilities of the directors and the auditors in connection with the accounts are explained on pages 55 to 59, and the statement of directors on going concern on page 58.
The board confirms that there is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing any compliance issues and significant risks faced by the group.
The internal capital assessment ICA process maps risks to capital requirements through review and challenge and sign-off by the board.
com The directors are responsible for the groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives within parameters set by the board.
The key procedures that the directors have established to ensure that internal controls are effective and commensurate with a group of this size include the day-to-day supervision of the business by the executive directors.
Other internal control procedures and reviews for effectiveness by the board include the: Preparation of standard monthly, quarterly and periodic reporting as prescribed by the board for review by the various group committees: Review of financial, operational and compliance reports from management: and Review of any significant issues arising from the external audits.
