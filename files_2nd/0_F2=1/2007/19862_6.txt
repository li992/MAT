14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 10 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS MINING AND POWER Overall, our Mining and Power operations improved their financial performance from an operating loss before non-trading exceptional items of 26.8 million in 2006 to 1.8 million in 2007.
This overview reflects a strongly improved underlying performance from deep mining and strongly improved results from both surface mining and power business.
The period of non production during the early part of last year at Daw Mill represented a loss of some 20 million of profits against expectations.
In addition, Daw Mill managed a face change in the second half and, as previously announced, production at Kellingley will remain lower whilst it negotiates adverse geological conditions.
In the light of this, deep mining performed well to produce a full year loss before non-trading exceptional items of 14.6 million 2006: 30.4 million, and operated profitably in the second half of the year.
Operating profits before non-trading exceptional items from our surface mines increased from 0.5 million in 2006 to 8.5 million and similarly profits from our power business increased from 3.1 million to 4.3 million.
Key Performance Indicators KPIs 2007 2006 Sales price per Gigajoule GJ 1.62 1.41 Tonnage sold million tonnes 8.0 9.7 Tonnage produced million tonnes 8.1 9.5 MARKET OVERVIEW The UK burned an estimated total of 55 million tonnes of coal last year, the vast majority of this being used to generate electricity.
Our own production, last year some 8.1 million tonnes, can only meet a portion of this demand, making the UK a substantial importer of coal.
Whilst we intend to increase our production of both deep and surface mined coal, demand will continue substantially to exceed our supply capacity.
The mining business operates in a commodity market where the basic cost of production in a crowded and economically prosperous country and the cost of transporting a bulk product limits its economic market.
Balancing this, we believe that the benefits to our customers of having a local supply helps them to mitigate the risks inherent from importing all their requirements from thousands of miles away, from areas of potential political change, in a global climate where demand for fuels and the availability and security of energy supply will become ever more important.

14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 11 Given the nature of the UK electricity supply industry, our predominant market, we have a very limited number of significant customers, although the retro-fitting of flue gas desulphurisation equipment onto more power stations will expand the number of sites able to burn coal mined in the UK, where coal seams typically have a higher sulphur content than coalfields generally around the world.
Also affecting the demand for, and economics of, coal burn for electricity is the increasing focus on reducing the output of greenhouse gases.
The UK Government is encouraging the development of carbon capture technology to achieve this aim.
The cost of carbon on marginal power station burn will offer a financial incentive to develop and install this technology, under the umbrella of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme which is currently being reviewed, although this will inevitably increase the cost of energy to the country.
Given both the availability of other sources of energy and power station capacity and the lead times involved in developing such new capacity and sources, we believe that UK coal burn is unlikely to reduce significantly in the mid term, but the risk of market change remains.
In the UK, 2007 saw the coal burn at power stations fall back to 2005 levels from the peak in 2006.
This normalisation was due to an increased availability of gas from Russia, coupled with the construction in the UK of Liquefied Natural Gas facilities creating an economical method of transporting gas to the UK.
World demand for coal continued to increase through 2007, with the bulk of the increased demand coming from China and India together with other developing countries such as Brazil.
There was no noticeable increase in the world bulk carrier shipping fleet, which sent freight rates to all-time highs in the year.
NW Europe Steam Coal Price Reflecting the increased global demand for coal and increased freight costs, both international and NW European coal prices rose steadily throughout the year, from their initial start point of $68 per tonne in January to finish the year around the $128 per tonne, an increase of almost 90%.
The forward curve for 2008 and 2009 show prices remaining well above $100 per tonne for coal delivered into Europe equivalent to approximately 2 GJ at $2:1, before UK delivery costs.
Actual steam coal prices together with the January 2008 forward market prices for Amsterdam Rotterdam Antwerp ARA landed coal are shown below.

The average forward price for 2008 on the ARA market at 31 December 2007 was $118 per tonne.
Converted into sterling at $2:1 and into its calorific value by dividing the tonnes by 25.121, this equates to a forward price of 2.35 GJ.
The additional cost of delivery to the UK brings this to a UK delivered price of around 2.60 GJ.

The table also highlights the increase in Russian imports into the UK over recent years.
As the table below shows, the coal used in electricity generating has fallen back from the unusually high 2006 levels, and usage is now broadly in line with gas in the overall UK fuel mix.
Coal Contracts Contractual supply obligations to all customers increased to 24.0 million tonnes at 31 December 2007 2006: 17.9 million tonnes.
Of the contracted tonnage, approximately 13 million tonnes is considered to have been contracted at historic lower fixed prices of circa 1.55 GJ.
The balance is at higher and or more variable prices having been contracted more recently.
Overall, assuming a 2.60 GJ UK delivered price for 2008, and dependent upon expected tonnages, we have estimated a 2008 realised sale price of 1.751.80 GJ.
In 2007, UK COAL secured new contracts with E. ON and EDF Energy.
These new contracts will allow UK COAL to recover the investment needed to mine the coal and develop further coal reserves.
The Group has adopted the strategy of moving towards a more diverse mix of long term contracts with customers, with shorter term contracts or spot sales to balance security of supply contracts, with the ability to take advantage of current coal prices.
Our contracts position now includes an element of sales negotiated at market rates, along with contracts priced at capped and collared or fixed prices, which may also be subject to inflation adjustments.
