This was principally the result of a successful completion of a new generating station at Stillingfleet in North Yorkshire and the installation of new engines at Harworth.
From a safety standpoint we need to extract methane from operating mines.
Its use as a fuel source both contributes to our operations providing an economic fuel source and reduces the impact on the environment of venting methane, a greenhouse gas with approximately 21 times the environmental impact of CO. 2 We have also continued to progress a series of planning applications to install wind turbines on Group property sites where this is economic and represents the best use for the properties concerned, or can be combined with a sustainable property development.
The planning process for wind farms remains challenging, balancing local consideration against national needs.
During 2007, a planning application for a wind farm consisting of 5 turbines at Stonish Hill, Nottinghamshire which was previously turned down, was resubmitted and refused against officers recommendations.
This decision will be appealed.
A new planning application was submitted in 2007 for a 3 turbine wind project at Bleak House in Staffordshire with the determination expected in the second half of 2008.
In February 2008, UK COAL received planning consent to build three wind turbines on land at the former Lynemouth coal handling site near Ellington, Northumberland.
The turbines are expected to have a generating capacity of 9 MW, providing an annual electricity output of around 23,000 MWh and generating sufficient renewable electricity to meet the needs of over 5,500 households.
6 further projects are at varying stages of development for submission, with the potential for further applications subject to removal of key constraints on development.
THIS NEW GENERATING STATION BURNING METHANE GAS AT THE STILLINGFLEET MINE SITE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE AND COMMISSIONED IN 2007, HELPED UK COALS HARWORTH POWER TO PRODUCE 181,835 MWh OF ELECTRICITY, AN INCREASE OF 52% ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR.
