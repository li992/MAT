The difference in transfer values reflects the difference between the two transfer values calculated using relevant information on the respective dates and is not necessarily the actuarial increase of the underlying pension.
The figures set out in the table above provide information as required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Listing Rules require the change in accrued pension to be shown excluding the effects of inflation and the transfer value of this increase.
These figures are shown in the notes below.
The accrued pension figures shown are the annual amounts of members pension payable from normal retirement age.
Increases to pensions when in payment are applied in accordance with the relevant scheme rules.
On the death of the member leaving a surviving spouse and or children, spouses and or childrens pensions are payable in accordance with scheme rules.
The benefits shown above in respect of Andy Haste relate to his membership of a defined benefit pension scheme up to the earnings cap.

Neither voluntary contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the UK Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
The transfer value of the accrued benefits represents the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of Andy Hastes pension benefits.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to Andy Haste.

One retest is allowed at the end of the fourth business year, but if the performance criterion has not been met over the full four year period, the options lapse.
Options granted between September 1998 and May 2003 are also subject to a performance condition that the Group must achieve a ROC of at least 6% when averaged over a consecutive three year period, but if the measure is not satisfied at the end of the third business year following the date of grant, the test can be repeated on an annual basis over the 10 year life of the option.
Options granted between April 1997 and September 1998 were subject to a different performance condition linked to TSR.
For options to be eligible for exercise, the Groups TSR has to be at or above the median of companies in the FTSE 100 Index over a consecutive period of three years, between the year of grant and the completion of the 10 year life of the option.
The test is conducted twice per year, at the end of March and September, by independent external specialists.
None of the terms or conditions of any of the existing options over shares of the Group were varied during the year.
Full details of all directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares are recorded in the Groups Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection in accordance with the provisions of the UKLA Listing Rules.
The official closing middle market price at its highest during the year was 172.1p per share and at its lowest was 128.3p per share: on the last dealing day of the year it was 148.2p per share.
Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2007 | RSA | 55 Long term incentive schemes audited part Long term incentive scheme interests held during 2007 in respect of the ordinary shares of the Company are as follows: Share Matching Plan Share awards Share awards Share awards Share awards Share awards Share awards Dates by held at granted vested and vested but not lapsed held at which qualifying 1 January during exercised during exercised during during 31 December conditions must Notes 2007 the year the year the year the year 2007 be fulfilled George Culmer 1,3, 4 Deferred Share awards 128,938 128,938 08.04.08 Matching Share awards 386,814 386,814 08.04.08 Andy Haste 1,3, 4 Deferred Share awards 462,182 197,046 462,182 08.04.08 Matching Share awards 1,017,281 221,873 1,017,281 08.04.08 Simon Lee 1,3, 4 Deferred Share awards 139,409 43,327 96,082 08.04.08 Matching Share awards 337,042 48,786 288,246 08.04.08 Bridget McIntyre 1,2, 4 Deferred Share awards 150,000 150,000 01.11.08 Matching Share awards 450,000 450,000 01.11.08 Notes 1.
The market price of ordinary shares on 14 June 2004, 8 April 2005 and 1 November 2005, the dates on which the above long term incentive scheme interests were granted, was 79.25p, 81.25p and 100p respectively.
Bridget McIntyres award of Deferred and Matching shares was approved prior to her appointment on 1 November 2005.
Due to dealing restrictions in accordance with the Model Code, these awards could not be granted until 12 June 2006.
The number of shares was calculated with reference to the share price on 1 November 2005.
Subject to performance as described below, these awards may vest on the third anniversary of her appointment.
In all other respects these awards are subject to the same rules as other awards granted in 2005.
Matching Share awards are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of TSR targets over a single two year period.
TSR performance is measured relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For awards granted in 2004 and 2005, TSR was measured partly relative to FTSE 100 companies and partly relative to the following financial services comparator group companies: Aegon, Legal & General Group, Allianz Group, Old Mutual, AXA, Prudential, AVIVA, RAS, Generali and Zurich Financial Services Group.
For 50% of the Matching Share awards, where TSR is measured against the FTSE 100, full vesting will only occur at upper decile performance, vesting will occur in the ratio of shares under Matching Share awards to shares under Deferred Share awards of 2:1 at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
For the other 50% of the Matching Share awards, where TSR is measured against the financial services comparator group, full vesting will occur if TSR is highest in the comparator group, vesting in the ratio 2:1 will occur at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
Matching Share awards will not vest at below median performance.
For awards granted in 2004, the targets were measured over the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2006.
For awards granted in 2005, the targets were measured over the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007.
The relevant TSR figures were averaged over the three months before the beginning and end of this performance period.
Additionally, no Matching Shares vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
Awards made in 2004 vested on 14 June 2007.
Andy Hastes 2004 awards were shown in the Annual Report and Accounts 2006 as having vested in that year in order to clarify the lapse of the proportion of the Matching Share awards that failed to meet performance targets.
Simon Lee was the only executive director to have exercised awards made in 2004 during the year.
The performance condition attaching to Matching Share awards granted in 2005 was met to the extent that three Matching Shares vested for each Deferred Share.
Awards made in 2005 are due to vest in 2008.
The market price of ordinary shares on 16 April 2007, the date on which long term incentive scheme interests were granted during the year, was 164.66p.
Deferred Shares are inclusive of voluntary Deferred Shares and compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by Lloyds TSB Offshore Trust Company Limited on behalf of each participant using part of the net annual bonus paid to them and are held in trust for three years.
These Deferred Shares are not at risk of forfeiture and may be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but the related Matching Share awards would lapse if the voluntary Deferred Shares are withdrawn within three years of acquisition.
Compulsory Deferred Shares are awarded as part of the annual bonus.
These Deferred Shares will normally vest in three years from the date of grant subject to continuous employment with the Group.
Matching Shares are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of 2.5 times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three year period.
One half of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares and all of the Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares are subject to TSR performance relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For awards granted in 2006 and 2007 TSR will be measured relative to the following comparator group companies: Aegon, Alleanza, Allianz, AVIVA, AXA, Baloise, Fortis, Generali, Legal & General, Munich Re, QBE, Swiss Re, and Zurich Financial Services.
Full vesting will only occur at upper quintile performance: at median performance 25% of the Matching Shares will vest.
Vesting will be on a straight line basis in between.
The remaining half of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a ROE performance condition.
If underlying ROE over three years commencing on the year of grant is below 10%, no part of the award subject to ROE performance will vest.
If underlying ROE over three years is 10%, 25% of the award will vest.
If underlying average annual ROE over three years is 16% or higher, 100% of the awards will vest.
For the purpose of establishing the number of Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares that may be awarded, the gross value of that part of the annual bonus payment that a participant elects to voluntarily defer is used.
Performance conditions relating to awards of Performance Shares are the same as those relating to compulsory Deferred Shares as described above.
One half of an award of Performance Shares may vest subject to the TSR performance condition and one half may vest subject to the ROE performance condition.
The above table shows the date by which qualifying conditions for awards made on 16 April 2007 must be fulfilled.
For awards made on 12 June 2006, the date by which qualifying conditions must be fulfilled is 12 June 2009.
No other directors of the Company held long term incentive scheme interests during 2007.
