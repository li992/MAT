Forward looking market projections continue to predict robust conditions in both the Business & General Aviation B&GA and ommercial markets.
Forecasts from leading business and general aviation sector OEMs anticipate more than 14,000 new business jets will enter service globally over the next 10 years.
Primary market drivers include the continued growth of both fractional programmes and traditional corporate flight department operations and increased demand outside the USA, with international buyers estimated to account for as much as 50% of projected new aircraft deliveries over the next five years.
Although the Very Light Jet VLJ market remains nascent and the air taxi model has yet to develop as projected, the segment is expected to enjoy success going forward and will contribute to the overall growth in the market.
Overall we anticipate that the B&GA market will grow 4% to 6% through the cycle.
Over the period 2007 2020, the commercial aircraft fleet is expected to grow about % p. a. led by the continuing growth of regional and low cost carriers, strong demand in Asia-Pacific markets and airline requirements for increased aircraft range, capacity and operating efficiency.
7 DirectorsReport BusinessReview:OurStrategy OurStrategy Our objective is to create long-term sustainable value for all our shareholders.
We are a focused aviation services and systems support group, operating mainly, but not exclusively, in the Business and General Aviation market.
We have five businesses with leading market positions and continuing opportunities for value creative growth.
The key elements of our strategy as it relates to each of the businesses are as follows: Flight Support Signature Strong organic growth Acquisitive network expansion ASIG Organic growth whilst exiting from uneconomic lines of business ontinued operational improvement Aftermarket Services and Systems Engine Repair and Overhaul ERO Organic growth Operational and productivity improvement Legacy Support Organic and acquisitive growth APPH Organic and acquisitive growth ontinued operational improvement 8 BBA Aviation Annual Report 2007 DirectorsReport BusinessReview: BBA Aviation is ultimately exposed to the amount of flying activity undertaken principally by business and general aviation aircraft and to a lesser extent by commercial and military aircraft.
The number of hours flown directly impacts our flight support organisation but also, over the longer term, our aftermarket services businesses.
The key risks that impact the level of flying activity are: Terrorist attacks and threats of attacks together with recent international conflicts have impacted regional and international air travel.
There can be no absolute assurance that we will avoid adverse consequences of any future attacks or threats, notwithstanding the preventative measures that we undertake in co-operation with airport authorities and other government agencies A very high price per barrel for crude and a corresponding rise in jet fuel prices for a prolonged period General economic conditions and business and consumer confidence Legislation impacting air travel The Group has significant operations in the USA with approximately 74% of pre tax profits being denominated in US dollars.
Although we are seeking to expand our operations in Europe and the rest of the world the majority of all business and general aviation aircraft are located in North America and it will remain the dominant market in the years ahead.
onsequently our financial performance in sterling terms is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, in particular the rate of exchange between US dollar and sterling.
The Group has a number of contingent liabilities that might impact its future performance.
These are analysed in note 28 to the onsolidated Financial Statements.
Retaining our key management is of critical importance to the Group.
To aid this, work is in hand to improve our performance and talent management processes and give sharper focus to ensuring that our compensation and benefits offerings remain competitive.

In 2006 the average dollar rate used in the Group was $1.84 and in 2007 was $2.00 and this has distorted the comparison with the financial results of the prior period.
On the table above the key financial data is shown as reported and also on a constant currency basis.
This was another set of strong results for BBA Aviation.
Despite the exchange rate headwind, revenue and underlying operating profit from continuing operations increased by 3% to 979.4 million and 105.7 million respectively.
At constant exchange rates the increase in sales and operating profit was 10%.
Organic sales growth was 8% reflecting the strong market conditions experienced during the year and market share gains.
Total operating profit increased by 37% to 130.1 million principally as a result of the profit recorded on the sale of the Oxford businesses of 38.4 million.
Profit before tax increased significantly to 110.8 million 2006: 70.2 million and adjusted earnings per share rose to 15.4p from 11.4p in 2006, an increase of 35%.
At constant exchange rates and also assuming that Fiberweb had been demerged from 1 January 2006 the eps increase would have been 12%.
In the prior period there was a significant after tax loss from discontinued operations of 76.2 million and this related to the results of Fiberweb prior to its demerger on 17 November 2006.
Consequently there was a sharp recovery in the overall profit for the period of 87.2 million compared to a loss in 2006 of 10.2 million.
Free cash flow from continuing operations was 41.8 million 2006: 48.1 million with lower capital expenditure of 39.8 million being offset by higher cash tax payments and an outflow in working capital.
The Group invested 76.0 million on acquisitions, principally to extend the Signature network, and raised 71.1 million from the sale of its businesses at Oxford airport.
There was a small net cash outflow of 19.3 million after paying a dividend of 29.9 million and pension other costs associated with the demerger of 23.7 million.
As a result net debt increased to 375.2 million 2006: 356.9 million.
