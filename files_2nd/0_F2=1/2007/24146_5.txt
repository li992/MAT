qxd 27 3 08 03:10 Page 7 OPERATIONAL REVIEW KEY RISKS SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK FINANCIAL REVIEW Financial Key Performance Indicators IFRS UNDERLYING LOSS PROFIT BEFORE TAX As part of the strategic review, a new range of financial metrics has been introduced to measure future -46m 2007 Dividend cover -0.2 performance.
These measures focus on the Companys 2006 Dividend cover 2.3 400m financial priorities and these are: profitability, cash 2005 Dividend cover 1.1 224m generation, dividend paying capacity, shareholder value 2004 Dividend cover 1.2 171m and financial strength.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT IFRS is the primary accounting basis.
It includes the cash surplus earned during the period but differs from the EEV basis in that, with limited exceptions, it does not recognise future cash flows in profit, although it does allow for the deferral of some acquisition costs.
Dividend cover is a measure of dividend paying capacity.
COMMENTARY ON PERFORMANCE The decrease from 2006 is due to several factors: the inclusion of 156m of reserving basis changes in 2006 not repeated: the effect of widening credit spreads on reserving: expense assumption changes: and the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs on protection business.
CALCULATION BASIS IFRS underlying loss profit is based on longer-term investment return and excludes policyholder tax, returns attributable to minority interests in policyholder funds, non-recurring items, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and present value of acquired in-force business.
It is stated after deducting interest payable on STICS.
Dividend cover is the ratio of IFRS underlying loss profit after tax and minority interest to the cost of dividend.
SHAREHOLDER CASH GENERATION 2007 177m 2006 340m 2005 206m 2004 -1m WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT Shareholder cash generation is a measure of cash generated in the year available to cover dividends, increases in regulatory capital requirements and other capital items.
COMMENTARY ON PERFORMANCE The lower overall cash generation arises from lower one-off reserving changes in 2007 compared to 2006.
The life and pensions net cash operating surplus is largely unchanged from the 2006 level, with an improved UK position offset by a net cash outflow in our international business.
The latter is due to increased new business strain as a result of higher sales in Friends Provident International.
CALCULATION BASIS Shareholder cash generation includes in-force surplus less new business strain, investment return, other operating surplus, and is stated net of tax.

CALCULATION BASIS Group solvency is the Insurance Groups Directive surplus capital as defined by the FSA.
It is calculated as the surplus of the available capital resources over the capital resources requirement.
It excludes surplus capital held within the long-term funds.
