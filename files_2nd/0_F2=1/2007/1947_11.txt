This Report, together with the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration, as detailed on pages 42 to 49, describes how the Principles of Good Governance, which are set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code, are applied by the Group.
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice The Board considers that it has complied with the detailed provisions of the Combined Code throughout the year to 31 July 2007.
The Board also considers that up to the date of this report it has complied with the revised Combined Code which applies to the current financial year which commenced on 1 August 2007.
Statement about applying the Principles of Good Governance The Group has applied the Principles of Good Governance, including both the Main Principles and the Supporting Principles, by complying with the Code as reported above.
Further explanations of how the Main Principles and Supporting Principles have been applied are set out below and, in connection with the directors remuneration, in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
The Chairmans Statement, the Chief Executives Operating Review and the Financial Review present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Groups position and prospects.
The Board The Board consists of seven directors whose names, responsibilities and other details appear on pages 9 and 10.
Three of the directors are executive and four of the directors, including the Chairman, are non-executive.
The Board discharges its responsibilities by providing entrepreneurial leadership of the Company within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed.
It sets the Companys strategic aims, ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its objectives, and reviews management performance.
It also defines the Companys values and standards and ensures that its obligations to its shareholders are understood and met.
36 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Directors The Board has adopted a schedule of matters which are specifically reserved for its decision which includes various matters to do with Companies Act and other legal requirements, listing requirements, Board membership and Board Committees, management, corporate governance, employment, financial and other miscellaneous items.
In addition, it has a series of matters that are dealt with at regular Board meetings including an operational review, a financial review, land purchased, major projects, senior appointments, corporate governance, internal control and health and safety.
It has also adopted a framework of delegated commercial and operational authorities which define the scope of powers delegated to management below Board level.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive, which are recorded in writing and approved by the Board, are separate with a clear division of responsibilities, ensuring a balance of responsibility and authority at the head of the Group.
The senior independent non-executive director is Mr Finn.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary and all the directors may take independent professional advice at the Groups expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibility as directors.
Board effectiveness The directors possess an appropriate balance of skills and experience for the requirements of the business.
During the year there were ten Board meetings, three Audit Committee meetings, three meetings of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration, one meeting of the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration and two Nomination Committee meetings.
There were no absences from any Board or Committee meetings by any director, with the exception that Mr Johnson was unable to attend one Board meeting and one meeting of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration.
The non-executive directors met without the executive directors on one occasion, and also met once during the year without the Chairman present to evaluate his performance.
Each of the non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, has at all times acted independently of management and has no relationship which would materially affect the exercise of his independent judgement and decision making.
The Company considers all of its non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, to be independent, as defined in the Combined Code.
In the case of Mr Finn however, he has served on the Board and its Committees for more than nine years.
In April 2004, the Company consulted with its major shareholders, setting out the reasons why it considered it appropriate for Mr Finn to remain as senior independent non-executive director beyond the nine year period.
The Company received a positive response and consequently he remains as the Groups senior independent non-executive director subject, of course, to re-election each year at the AGM, in line with the recommendations contained in the Combined Code.
The Board considers that Mr Finn continues to be independent in character and judgement.
He has experience of running a large and complex public limited company and understands the needs of institutional shareholders.
The Board considers this to be vital for the role of senior independent non-executive director.
His independence is evidenced by his work in the public and voluntary sector, particularly in housing related matters.
One third of the directors offer themselves for re-election each year at the AGM and all directors seek re-election every three years in accordance with the Articles.
Mr Finn and Mr Perry are excluded from the foregoing for the reasons set out on page 35.
New directors appointed since the last AGM are required to offer themselves for re-appointment at the next AGM.
Training and development The Board receives appropriate training and updates on various matters relevant to its role, as and when required.
Board balance and independence Appointments to the Board are made on merit through a formal, rigorous and transparent process against objective criteria recommended by the Nomination Committee which also guides the whole Board in arranging orderly succession for appointments to the Board.
The appointment of a non-executive director is for a specified term and re-appointment is not automatic and is made on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee.
The Board has reviewed and reaffirmed that it considers all of the non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman, to be independent as defined in the Combined Code.
Whenever any director considers that he is interested in any contract or arrangement to which the Group is or may be a party, due notice is given to the Board.
No such instances of any significance have arisen during the year.
Board evaluation During the year the directors undertook an evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual directors.
The evaluation was performed using a self-assessment framework.
This involved the Chairman, acting on behalf of the Board, evaluating the performance of the other individual directors, and the non-executive directors, led by the senior independent non-executive director, assessing the performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive directors.
The Board, led by the Chairman, evaluated its own performance, and the Committees, led by the Chairman of each, evaluated their own performance.
As part of the process of ensuring Board effectiveness, the non-executive directors, led by the senior independent non-executive director, met without the Chairman present.
Additionally, the Chairman held a meeting with the non-executive directors without the executives present.
The Chairman also had meetings with each of the executive directors.
37 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Directors The Board and its Committees reviewed the results of these evaluations and are satisfied with the evidence it provided about the balance, effectiveness and performance of the Board and its Committees and the effectiveness and commitment of each director.
In coming to these conclusions, the Board can confirm that it has carried out a particularly rigorous review in relation to the effectiveness and commitment of both Mr Finn and Mr Perry who are due for re-election at the forthcoming AGM, because they have both served in excess of six years as non-executive directors at that date.

The terms of reference for the Committees are available either on request, at the AGM or on the Companys website: www.
Audit Committee The Audit Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Mr Johnson Chairman, Mr Finn and Mr Perry, who were members of the Committee throughout the year.
