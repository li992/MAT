FOCuS ON: Copper expansion at Los Bronces The $1.7 billion Los Bronces development project in Chile will nearly double the mines current annual production of copper by 2011.
The investment will make Los Bronces one of the worlds largest copper mines and marks another important stage in the Groups pipeline of copper expansion projects, which aims to increase attributable copper production to approximately 1.6 million tonnes per annum by 2016.
Los Bronces is an open pit copper mine located in the Andes, 65 kilometres northeast of Santiago and more than 3,500 metres above sea level.
The mine is connected to the treatment plants via a 56-kilometre slurry pipeline and includes copper and molybdenum flotation plants and two solvent-extraction electro-winning SX-EW plants for the lowgrade ore dump leaching process.
The project will involve the construction of new grinding facilities and a flotation plant.
In addition to the 3,700 new jobs created in the construction period, 400 permanent employees will be taken on once the project is completed.
It is estimated that about 55% of the total investment $935 million will be spent in the Chilean economy.
The project is expected to be completed in three years and have a mine life of more than 30 years.
