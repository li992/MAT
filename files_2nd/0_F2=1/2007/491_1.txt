Page 1 A new focus We have achieved a great deal since we became Aga Foodservice Group in 2001 and we are already building on that progress.
We are also laying the foundations for future growth with a new focus on our family of strong consumer brands.
Our aim is to be a more customerdriven, more responsive and more efficient business, offering the most desirable products and services across all of our brands.
And with our new focus, everything we do has one objective: building a sustainable business for the long term, generating shareholder value through consistent, profitable growth.
We put Aga firmly centre stage in 2001 and we can continue to build rapidly on the brands product development successes.
And to harness the strong emotional connection owners have to their Aga, we have launched Love Aga, our largest campaign ever, to track down every owner in the world and attract new ones into the Aga family.
The growth of Rangemaster following the radical repositioning of the business in 2002 is sustained and substantial and is set to continue.
To have become the UKs number one brand in premium range cooking is an outstanding example of our people at their finest.
We are excited about the future for all our brands, led by Aga and Rangemaster with passion and expertise.
We are now Aga Rangemaster.
