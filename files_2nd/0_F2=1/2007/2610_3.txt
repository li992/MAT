6891 Report 2006-07 1 6 07 17:36 Page 16 INTENSIFY NON-APPAREL DEVELOPMENT Intensify focus on, and invest in, non-apparel categories.
At 25% of revenue, Burberrys non-apparel business has substantial room for growth.
In several product categories some of which are growing explosively our presence is small relative to the total market.
Non-apparel offers opportunity to leverage further Burberrys unique positioning and brand: in handbags, small leather goods and shoes.
The Group is intensifying its focus on these categories through investment in product development, people, marketing and supply chain.
These principles were applied to the launch of The Burberry Icons Collection in conjunction with our 150th anniversary celebration in September 2006.
The design team concentrated on the luxe segment of the market, creating a limited-edition handbag group featuring authentic Burberry icons quilting, D-rings and signature script from the Groups archives.
To support the introduction, a dedicated marketing programme was structured, providing a more consistent, synchronised message across the many consumer touch points, including fashion show, print and stores from runway to reality.
Intensified efforts in non-apparel extend equally to licensed categories.
For example, Spring 2007 saw the launch of Burberrys first eyewear collection under a new agreement with Luxottica, the worlds leading premium eyewear developer and distributor.
While executed by our partner, Burberry is integrally involved in product design, as well as marketing and distribution strategy.
