Firstly, the Group has invested in major strategic land sites, ahead of their conversion into land with residential planning permission and subsequent generation of returns.
Secondly, the Group acquired Elite Homes towards the end of the financial year for a total consideration of 72.3 million: of which 25.7 million was paid to the shareholders of Elite, with the Group assuming 46.2 million of debt.
Allied to these decisions, the performance of the Group in terms of its volume of legal completions has impacted ROCE during 2007.
The operating margin remained strong in 2007, given prevailing market conditions.
The reported operating margin at 22.4% was adversely impacted by the one-off restructuring costs and fair value adjustments associated with the acquisition of Elite Homes.
Adjusting for these, the underlying operating margin at 22.8% was ahead of that at the half year, only marginally reduced versus 23.1% achieved in 2006.
The reduction in the Groups volume has understandably had an adverse impact on the year over year movement in profit before tax and earnings per share.

Report of the directors Business review 17 Sustainable development is critical to long term value creation The conversion of strategic land relies on excellent design, engineering and town planning skills.
Bovis Homes uses experienced planning teams, who can lead complex planning applications, ensuring that design and engineering skills can be harnessed effectively.
The Group also uses a range of internal and external experts to ensure that schemes with a sense of place and a high quality living environment are designed and implemented.
Value for shareholders is also added through a focused and effective supply chain, together with efficient production.
During 2007, the Group typically used traditional brick & block to construct houses and apartments, but also used thin-joint masonry where appropriate, a modern method of construction, to speed up construction, saving time and money.
With competitive tendering for sub-contract work, procurement of bulk materials through national agreements, and a process of on-site cost control, Bovis Homes maintained its focus on costs during the year.
The environment and sustainability Given the continuing focus on climate change, the role of the housebuilding industry is highly important in terms of both the mitigation of the impact of its near term building developments on the local environment, and in playing its part in the evolution of building techniques and advances which reduce the carbon output from new housebuilding developments.
With regard to the local impact of development on the environment, the Group works with consultants, local government and interest groups to ensure that conservation and development are not mutually exclusive.
Typically, the Group will remediate pre-existing pollution which may include the removal or rehabilitation of contaminated soil, agree and implement protection plans for sites of special scientific interest in the vicinity of production, agree and implement management plans to protect trees through buffer zones and protection fencing, retain historic or ancient trees and hedgerows as part of the overall site design, agree timing of works to reduce the Sustainability impact on migratory birds and bats, relocate existing populations of Year ended 31 December 2007 2006 reptiles, establish appropriate drainage strategies which may involve sustainable urban drainage systems, establish acoustic bunds, fund Number of homes built with EcoHomes rating 590 379 more sustainable transport links including bus routes and provide Legal completions on brown land 43% 39% communities with landscaped park and recreational areas.
