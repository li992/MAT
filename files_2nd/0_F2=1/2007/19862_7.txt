Coal sales to the domestic market are carried out through sales to the Groups joint venture with Hargreaves Services PLC, Coal4Energy Limited.
DEEP MINES Our deep mines business consists of Daw Mill Warwickshire, Kellingley Yorkshire and Thoresby and Welbeck Nottinghamshire.
The key performance indicators for this business are: Key Performance Indicators KPIs 2007 2006 Coal mined million tonnes 6.6 8.9 Revenue m 265.8 310.9 Operating cost m 246.2 301.7 excluding non-trading exceptional items and depreciation costs Loss before non-trading exceptional items m 14.6 30.4 Face gap times weeks 34.0 26.0 Development drivage metres 15,484 24,432 Reserves and resources ongoing mines million tonnes 105 110 Deep mining has largely a fixed cost base, and therefore the KPIs for the business focus on the output tonnage achieved from this cost base, together with other indicators which highlight the risk of future production being achieved.
In this latter regard, the development metreage achieved, being the investment in future coal panels, and the total length of time of face gaps, when production is shifted onto new coal panels is monitored.
As in other businesses, the realised sales price and the costs of operating the business, are also monitored as KPIs.

Daw Mill As previously announced, following the fatality at Daw Mill in January 2007 the mine ceased production for a month.
Production remained very low for 2 further months whilst additional safety work was carried out.
The costs incurred in this period can be measured at approximately 11.5 million, including the additional costs of 3.5 million reinforcing the entries to the coal face, to take into account the knowledge learnt following the fatality.
In addition to these costs was the significant value of lost output, bringing the total impact to the income statement of an estimated 20 million against original expectations.
In the second half of 2007, as planned, Daw Mill had to manage a face change and encountered delays and difficulties in ramping up production, further reducing output against original expectations for the year.
However, Daw Mill is now working well on this new panel, which given the thickness of its large seams, consists of over 5 million tonnes of coal.
With the new face now in full production and no further face changes until late in 2009, the outlook for Daw Mill is robust.
Kellingley As expected, Kellingley output fell, as a result of encountering adverse geological conditions on both its coal faces.
The colliery continues to be strongly productive in an area of difficult geological conditions, although production will remain lower than its previous performance until the move is made to a new area of reserves in the Beeston seam, with coal production due to start in mid 2009.
The Beeston seam and related areas being accessed at a cost of circa 55 million consist of estimated reserves and resources of around 18 million tonnes and extend the life of the mine to at least 2017.
Thoresby Thoresbys output for the year was slightly better than envisaged at the start of the year as a result of the planned face change at the colliery being achieved 2 weeks earlier than scheduled.
Production in the existing Parkgate seam will continue until late 2009, during which time the geology will be difficult and production restrained.
As a result of new customer contracts, we have been able to commit to a major investment of circa 55 million and therefore, in late 2009, production will transfer to the Deep Soft seam with its estimated reserves and resources of circa 12 million tonnes.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 15 Welbeck Welbeck was originally due to close during 2007, but the identification of 4 further coal panels together with the improvement in coal prices have extended the life of the mine until at least 2009.
Operations were affected by a fatality caused by a fall of rock on a coal face being salvaged in November.
This greatly slowed down a face transfer and has delayed the start date of the new coal face in 2008.
Closed mines Production ceased at Rossington Colliery in April 2006 and, following a period of equipment salvage, the mine closed and the shafts were filled.
At Harworth Colliery, during the year, we also moved the mine from its previous mothballed status to a closure.
We have investigated the requirements for investment to access new coal at Welbeck Colliery.
Unfortunately the level of investment required, coupled especially with the coal potential, the timescales involved and the level of assurance needed in terms of contracted customer demand, all militate against the investment.
Welbeck Colliery may, therefore, have to close when the current workable reserves are exhausted in 2009.
Costs relating to this closure would be incurred as exceptional items in 2008 and 2009.
Improved coal prices do encourage a further review of the potential of the Groups assets however.
To this end we are considering again the opportunity to reopen Harworth Colliery, in conjunction with a mixed use development of the site, although any decision in this regard is not likely in the immediate future.
Productivity and Face Gaps There were 5 face changes in the year, incurring face gaps of 34 weeks 2006: 26 weeks.
Face gaps comprise 21 weeks lost in the Welbeck face changes, 4 weeks at Daw Mill, and 9 weeks at Thoresby.
Centechnology Also included in our deep mines business is our Centechnology labour contracting business.
Historically focused on supplying labour into the mining business, it is now also performing both mining and other non-mining work for a number of third parties.

15 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 16 Reserves and Resources The reserves and resources available in the deep mine operations are critical to the long term prospects of the Group.
We estimate that we have approximately 105 million tonnes of reserves and resources at our ongoing mines of which 45 million tonnes of coal are accessible under existing 5 year mining and investment plans.
The additional resources will become accessible with future investment required as current mining plans approach completion.
UK COAL continues to utilise the latest technology in seismic exploration, including 3-D representations of seams, to provide better definition of the reserves at the remaining mines.
These techniques have been used successfully at Daw Mill, Kellingley and Thoresby to assess the reserves more effectively.
Our estimates as at 31 December 2007 of our deep mine coal reserves are set out in the following table, in million tonnes: Total Ongoing reserves and Mineral colliery Reserves Resources resources potential Total Daw Mill 22 22 41 63 Kellingley 10 45 55 5 60 Thoresby 11 12 23 2 25 Welbeck 23 5 16 21 Total 45 60 105 64 169 2006 40 70 110 63 173 Reserve Reserves which are accessible using the broad infrastructure in place at the current time and which are in the current 5 year mining plan.
Resource Reserves which may require substantial development and other costs to allow accessibility and are not currently in the 5 year mining plan.
Mineral Coal that has been assessed although possibly not to the same extent as Reserve and Resource coal Potential but UK COAL does not have any licences or planning permission to extract the deposits.
These figures must be treated with caution, being based on the Groups best estimates at the current time.
A number of factors may cause the actual production to vary significantly from these estimates.
These factors include, but are not limited to: Ongoing seismic surveying of reserves these could result in either an increase or a decrease to the production estimates Geological problems despite the improved seismic surveying being carried out, there remains a risk that a coal panel is subject to unforeseen geological problems that make production difficult Sales price of future coal and cost increases these could render production plans uneconomic or could allow extraction from areas previously believed to be unviable 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705
