6891 Report 2006-07 1 6 07 17:37 Page 28 INVEST IN UNDER-PENETRATED MARKETS Concentrate resources in under-penetrated markets, utilising Burberrys three distribution channels retail, wholesale and licensing to address the opportunity.
For Burberry, under-penetrated markets exist in both developed and newly emerging economies.
North America is today a 200m market for the Group.
With only 39 Burberry stores, North America presents significant opportunity to expand this base.
At the same time, the importance of large, high-end department stores in this market indicates substantial capacity for future growth of our wholesale channel.
Emerging consumer economies, including China, Eastern Europe, Russia and the Middle East, offer rapid growth, potentially with significant scale.
In many of these markets, Burberry develops its business through franchise structures which operate retail stores a retail wholesale hybrid model.
The future in these markets will be addressed both through direct retailing and franchise structures.
Under-penetrated markets also refers to geographies in which specific segments or product categories of our business are underdeveloped even within a large Burberry market.
