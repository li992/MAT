Business and financial review Howden Howdens core products include centrifugal and axial fans, air and gas rotary preheaters and compressors.
Howdens fans and heaters are integral parts of the coal-fired boiler and emission control systems used by the power industry.
Howden also makes significant sales to the oil and gas, mining, iron and steel and other process industries.
Howdens sales are split broadly equally between the developed economies of Europe and North America, and emerging economies, in particular China, the rest of Asia and South Africa.
Howden derives approximately one-quarter of its revenues through aftermarket sales, which benefit from its extensive installed product base.
As Howden has increasingly concentrated on the higher value-added parts of its activities, the manufacture of  components has increasingly been outsourced to sub-contractors in low cost locations.
Howdens strategy envisages increased sales to the power and oil and gas industries, where Howden has an established presence and the long-term dynamics remain extremely positive, and to other industries where Howdens applications engineering expertise offers significant opportunities.
Aftermarket sales are expected to increase reflecting recent sales of new equipment.

There is also some evidence to suggest that older generating capacity will also be replaced sooner than previously expected.
This underlines that China will remain an important market for Howden.
In other emerging economies, such as India and Central Eastern Europe, and in more mature economies, such as Western Europe and North America, Howden expects increasing new build of coal-fired power plants, accompanied by the refurbishment and upgrading of existing plant.
Charter plc Annual Report 2007 21 Business and financial review Howden continued Howden and the environment Howden technology and know-how helps the power generation, oil and gas, mining and other industries that it supplies to operate in a less environmentally harmful manner.
Howden products increase the efficiency of each unit of production into which they are incorporated and thereby help to minimise emissions.
Howden equipment is also used in emission abatement, with, for example, Howden fans, blowers and heat exchangers being key components in the flue gas desulphurisation process.
