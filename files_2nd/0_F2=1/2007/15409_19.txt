The sweetener and ethanol businesses both performed strongly with operating profits well ahead of the prior year.
Overall sweetener volumes were similar to the prior year, but Contribution to total margins increased due to improved selling prices.
Ethanol margins benefited from higher operating profit prices for gasoline.
Value added food ingredients had a good year with higher sales to 44% major food manufacturing customers.
Net corn costs increased as the corn price rose to over US$4.00 per bushel due to the growing demand for corn as a raw material to produce ethanol.
Manufacturing expenses also increased due to higher costs of energy.
Our main plants continued to operate at capacity for most of the year.
At Almex, our joint venture in Mexico, profits continued to improve primarily due to higher selling prices.
High fructose corn syrup HFCS volumes to soft drink customers also increased.
On 1 January 2007 the tax on beverages containing HFCS was repealed.
Before exceptional items and amortisation The tariff rate quota TRQ programme, which allows a cane sugar HFCS exchange between the US and Mexico, continued in place.
Additional TRQ volume for the October December 2007 period was also negotiated.
Free market access is anticipated for HFCS under the North American Free Trade Agreement from 1 January 2008.
Citric acid profits were below the prior year.
Although selling prices were in line with expectations, sales volumes were lower as a result of increased Chinese competition.
The high cost of raw materials and energy also impacted profits.
Production ceased at our UK plant in Selby, Yorkshire due to extreme cost pressures and oversupply in the world market.
The market for Aquasta astaxanthin, a natural nutrient and pigment for farm-raised fish, remained difficult.
While sales volumes increased over the year to plant capacity levels, selling prices decreased.
Production continued to operate at capacity, but manufacturing costs were impacted by higher energy and raw material costs.
As a result of the underperformance of the UK citric acid and astaxanthin businesses an exceptional charge of 33 million has been recognised in the year to 31 March 2007 comprising closure costs of the citric acid line at Selby, UK, and an impairment charge on our investment in astaxanthin.

Food ingredient sales volumes and product mix improved following the commissioning of recent investments, but liquid sweetener volumes were slightly lower as capacity was used for higher-margin products.
Selling prices improved throughout the year and there were significant increases in the 2007 calendar year pricing round across most product lines.
Prices for isoglucose were only modestly higher as increases were constrained by the price of the alternative, sugar.
Current prices should recover the higher raw material and energy costs that were experienced in the year to 31 March 2007.
Before exceptional items and amortisation Raw material costs increased significantly after very hot weather shortly before the 2006 EU harvest, but also due to increased global demand for biofuels and some supply constraints, particularly the low Australian crop following a drought.

During the year we continued to expand the business with a number of product launches by our major multinational customers and we have continued to work with our customers Contribution to total both in the US and internationally to broaden their pipeline of food and beverage products operating profit using SPLENDA Sucralose.
Outside the US we have seen particular success in Mexico, 19% where we estimate that SPLENDA Sucralose has already become the market leader, and in Europe where leading UK retailers J Sainsbury and Asda have announced they are reformulating a range of their own-label products to include SPLENDA Sucralose.
The expansion of the McIntosh, Alabama, plant and construction of the new Singapore facility were completed during the year on schedule.
A new pilot plant facility is under construction in Alabama that will facilitate process improvements that have been demonstrated in the laboratory and forms part of our strategy to maintain leadership in sucralose manufacturing technology.
The Singapore facility is being commissioned and production will be ramped up over the next 12 months.
In response to customer demand, Before exceptional items and amortisation a new, improved dry form of pure SPLENDA Sucralose is now being produced in Singapore.
The new form is easier for our customers to handle and is packaged in a new re-sealable pouch.

The proceedings allege infringement of patented sucralose manufacturing technology in respect of sucralose manufactured in China and imported to the US by the defendants named in the case.
The ITC has the right to exclude products from importation into the US that are shown to infringe a US patent.
The ITC announced on 7 May 2007 that it has formally instituted its investigation of the infringements alleged in our claim.
This action follows the filing with the US Federal District Court in May 2006, which so far has resulted in favourable settlements with three of the ten defendants cited in that case.
As part of the realignment with McNeil Nutritionals, LLC McNeil in April 2004, a provision was set up for deferred consideration payable to McNeil based on the growth in sales of SPLENDA Sucralose by Tate & Lyle over a period of five years to 31 March 2009.
It is anticipated that this provision will not now be fully utilised and consequently 20 million has been released to the income statement in the year.
This has been shown as an exceptional item.
New granular form In Singapore, we are now producing a new granular form of SPLENDA Sucralose that is easier for our customers to use, and is packaged in a re-sealable pouch.

Contribution to total Occidente, Mexico, reported higher profits due to strong domestic demand replacing operating profit lower-margin exports.
5% In Vietnam, following a steady decline in international sugar prices and increased payments to farmers, Nghe An Tate & Lyles profits fell from the previous years peak.
Nevertheless the business continued to make an acceptable return in the growing Vietnamese market and a dividend was paid to shareholders for the first time.
Cane volumes increased substantially as the region recovered from drought.
Discontinued operations Redpath was sold to American Sugar Refining, Inc. on 21 April 2007 for a net consideration of 131 million.
It is expected that the sale will generate a profit on Before exceptional items and amortisation disposal in the year ending 31 March 2008 of approximately 55 million.
Profit after tax of nil million 2006 10 million in the year to 31 March 2007 was lower due to a mark-to-market loss on raw sugar stocks of 5 million 2006 gain of 7 million as the world raw sugar price eased following the highs in the prior year.
Excluding this impact, the underlying business performed broadly in line with the prior year.
The assets and liabilities of Redpath are shown as Held for Sale in the consolidated balance sheet.

Contribution to total The UK refining businesses reported profits significantly lower than the prior year whilst operating profit 13% the Portuguese operation was broadly in line.
In common with other EU sugar producers, the UK refining business has been faced with lower market prices as a result of the slower than expected pace of quota surrender and limited availability and high competition for export licences making world market exports uneconomic.
In the short term, the EU has announced the withdrawal of at least two million tonnes of quota for the sugar year starting on 1 October 2007.
This should improve market sentiment for the next pricing round but the extent cannot be evaluated at this time.
Cane refineries are included in this quota cut although the EU Commissions most recent proposals, which remain subject to consultation, reverse this and exclude the refiners from the cut.
Before exceptional items and amortisation As part of the drive to develop new markets in response to the EU sugar regime reform, a joint venture with Eridania Sadam Eridania, the Italian sugar producer, was formed.

Tate & Lyle holds 35% of the joint venture, for which it has invested 2 million 2.8 million, with Eridania holding the remaining 65%.
Eridania is a beet sugar processor and is the market leader in the Italian sugar sector.
Profits from the sugar trading and molasses businesses before Group central costs at 28 million 2006 33 million remained strong.
The impact of less volatile world sugar markets reduced trading activity, although this was partially offset by a good performance from physical sugar trading in Brazil where profits and volumes were significantly higher than the prior year.
Molasses trading maintained its performance at similar levels to last year with weaker results from London-based trading being offset by a strong performance from the UK storage activities.
Discontinued operations In November 2006 Eastern Sugar, our European beet sugar joint venture operation in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, announced the surrender of its quota to the EU Restructuring Fund.
Manufacturing operations in all three countries ceased by 31 March 2007.
