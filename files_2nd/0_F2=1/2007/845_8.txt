Natural Resources Description of business Principal activities: Natural Resources comprises AMECs activities in Oil and Gas Services, Oil Sands project management, engineering and infrastructure and Minerals and Metals Mining.
Asset development Capex and asset support Opex services are provided in the upstream sector, which accounts for some 85 per cent of revenues, with the balance being in the midstream and downstream sectors.
EBITA margins vary according to the nature of activities, ranging from around six per cent on average for Opex services in mature markets to 12 per cent or more with good performance on Capex contracts with performance incentives.
Some 50 per cent of revenues in 2007 were generated by each of Capex and Opex services.
Principal locations: Aberdeen, London UK : Aksai Kazakhstan : Baku Azerbaijan : Calgary, Vancouver Canada : Houston US : Kuala Lumpur Malaysia : Kuwait: Perth Australia : Shanghai China.
Customers include: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, fide Beers, ExxonMobil, Fairfield Energy, Imperial Oil, Kuwait Oil Company, PetroChina, PotashCorp, Shell, Suncor, Syncrude, Teck Cominco, Total, Woodside Energy.
Significant contracts in 2007 included: ConocoPhillips Australia: 15 month extension to the joint venture operations and maintenance contract on the Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea: Kuwait National Petroleum Company: refurbishment and modifications on Kuwaits three existing refineries: PotashCorp, Canada: engineering, procurement and construction management services on the Cory mine expansion and Picadilly project: Shenhua Ningxia Coal Group, China: initial engineering design on a coal-to-chemical production complex in northwest China.

Resource constraints Natural Resources operates in a resource constrained environment and all parts of the business suffer from some degree of overheating.
This is most pronounced in the Canadian oil sands, where double-digit labour cost inflation was evident during 2007.
