INVESTMENT Investment return and other mainly comprises: RETURN AND  The positive impact of 164m of marking to market our long-term debt OTHER  The negative impact of 90 m of widening of bond spreads on our life book  Positive equity returns, before we reduced our shareholder equity exposure in August 2007, offset by the impact of increasing yields on fixed interest security values.
SECURITISATION The amount to be repaid on our securitisation notes is 22m and is lower than expected because widening corporate bond spreads have reduced the surplus generated by the defined book.
