Ultimately, we will have the option to develop this important West End commercial site.
Detailed negotiations are ongoing with a wide range of organisations to take this complex project forward, and we are in an ideal position with a controlling role in the regeneration of this location.
One of the difficulties with the planning process is that even with the planning officers recommendation for approval, consent is not always automatic.
These were the circumstances in which planning permission was refused for an office and residential scheme on our City Road Estate in July 2007.
However, we are now working on a revised proposal with the intention of resubmitting a planning application in 2008.
The existing buildings continue to provide an annual income of 1.0 million and we are confident that we will deliver an exciting development in this prominent and improving location.
