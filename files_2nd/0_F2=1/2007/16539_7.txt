The landmark moment was disrupted by a shutdown that very month, brought about by a power failure on account of a rainstorm.
The unfortunate event led to a great disappointment among the BALCO team, who undeterred by the odds, did not leave any stone unturned to overcome this challenge.
To overcome the crisis, BALCOs young and enthusiastic team worked with their technology partners to restore and realign the operations.
A total of 126 pots with frozen bath and metal pads as thick as 2628 cm were to be dugout, repaired, relined and restarted.
The synergized efforts of the all-functional teams led to the successful revival of the entire pot line in a record time of 100 days and BALCO could achieve full capacity output from October 2006 onwards.
