A further revaluation gain of 6.7 million was taken directly to reserves, being the gains recognised on former Operating Properties transferred to Investment Property status on their ceasing to be operational sites.
Key Performance Indicators KPIs 2007 2006 RICS valuation of the property portfolio m 410.7 343.9 Number of sites in Project Worth 76 60 2012 estimate of Project Worth m 935 800 2013 estimate of Project Worth m 1,000 N A The principal objective of Harworth Estates is to maximise the value of the Groups property portfolio over the long term.
To this end, the changes in values of the estate, as planning consents are obtained or become more likely, are measured as KPIs.
Harworth Estates controls and manages approximately 46,500 acres of freehold land, which is predominantly in England, on behalf of the Group.
We announced, in 2006, our intention to enhance the value of this land bank, and, in particular, a portfolio of largely Brownfield sites, with the target of attaining a gross worth by 2012 of 800 million.
During the course of 2007, our estimate of worth, and the number of sites, have both been raised, such that it is our objective to deliver to shareholders 935 million of gross worth by 2012, through the gaining of planning consents on 76 sites, representing 13,800 gross acres of this land of which a net acreage of 3,696 will be developed.
There will remain, beyond this initial 5 year horizon, further significant value to be obtained from our land bank.
We have therefore announced an estimate for 2013 of circa 1 billion of gross worth on these same 76 sites.
Much of this enhancement of value will come through ONE OF 5 FURTHER BUILDINGS the obtaining of planning consents for development, CONSTRUCTED BY OCCUPIERS ON UK and the subsequent, or conditional, sale of parts of sites COALS ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PARK for development.
We would intend that, in the case of ON THE WAVERLEY ORGREAVE SITE NEAR residential land, we will strive to obtain planning ROTHERHAM.
consent, and would then invest in the major infrastructure, e. g. roads, utilities and section 106 planning gain, then sell off smaller economically viable plots to house builders for development.
In the case of commercial land, a more varied set of models would be employed, often involving the use of co-operation agreements or joint ventures with third parties where these parties bring particular expertise to the development of individual sites.
PROPERTY VALUATIONS A full independent valuation of all our properties has been undertaken as at the 31 December 2007 in accordance with the RICS appraisal and valuation standards published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 23 The valuation of non-agricultural properties was undertaken by Atisreal, acting in the capacity of external valuers.
The majority of the agricultural portfolio was valued by Smiths Gore with some additional land in the North of England and Scotland valued by Bell Ingram.
Agricultural valuations are at market value subject to existing tenancies and existing use.
The Harworth Estates portfolio RICS valuation at the year end is summarised in the table below: Like-for-like Dec 07 Dec 06 percentage m m change Business Parks 54.0 48.3 9.4% Commercials with planning 37.5 41.4 4.1% Other commercial and residential 212.0 152.7 34.9% Agricultural 107.2 101.5 12.4% Total 410.7 343.9 21.0% The like-for-like percentage change takes account of properties reclassified from Agricultural to Other commercial and residential together with an adjustment for asset sales and development expenditure.
Surface mine sites currently being mined are included in the value above based on their restored land value of 26.4 million 2006: 32.2 million.
While sites, otherwise being held for their long term investment potential, are being used by the Group for its mining and other activities, changes in valuations are not reflected in the balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2007 a total of 11.1 million 2006: 17.6 million has not been included in the balance sheet as a result.
Operating deep mine sites are not included in the above valuation.
The basis of valuations is described in note 13 to the Financial Statements.
PRINCIPAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES DURING 2007 Waverley Orgreave, Rotherham The Advance Manufacturing Park AMP continues to develop at pace with 5 further buildings constructed by occupiers and the commencement on site of a 100,000 sq ft part pre-let, part speculative development of hybrid industrial units in a joint venture with Strategic Sites Limited.
In the final quarter of the year we announced that the Highfield Commercial Business Park, which gained outline planning consent in 2006 for 650,000 sq ft of mixed commercial space, would change its focus and that we would promote it as a 645,000 sq ft Government relocation office campus.
We will develop this through a joint venture with development and relocation investment specialist, Helical Governetz Limited.
This announcement has been well received nationally and locally.
Marketing to potential Government department occupiers and to organisations in their supply chain has started and major infrastructure works will commence later in 2008.
Harworth Estates also continues to pursue planning for the new community of 3,800 homes with associated leisure, retail, social, health, education and country park elements on the Waverley site.
The project has received the public backing of the Local Authority and other key stakeholders, although the delay in the implementation of the Local Authorities Local Development Framework LDF has meant that, by agreement with the Local Authority, the Group will now be submitting a planning application for the entire site masterplan during the middle of the year, whilst still pursuing designation through the LDF in parallel.

Prince of Wales, Pontefract Having had a frustrating year in 2007, progress on the planning application for the first 913 homes and 250,000 sq ft of employment space continues and should shortly be successfully completed.
The delay has principally centred on resolving highway access issues both within the congested local network and on the adjoining M62 motorway junction, issues which, we believe, have now been addressed.
As a technical departure from an old adopted plan showing the site as an operating colliery and part greenbelt the application will, when approved by the Council, be referred to the Government for confirmation that the Local Authority may proceed with the granting of the consent.
That approval is expected as the scheme wholly accords with Government policy.

G Park Distribution Development, Lounge, Ashby-fide-la-Zouch In August 2007, we submitted a planning application for the first phase development of a 850,000 sq ft distribution hub, which we will develop as a joint venture with Gazeley PLC.
Negotiations continue with the Local Authority and other stakeholders, and we become progressively more confident of approval as the negotiations continue.
We are targeting a fully implementable planning consent being obtained by the joint venture by the end of the year.
South Leicester Industrial Development, Ellis Town In July 2007, we submitted, in joint venture with Graftongate Developments and Legal & General, a 2 phase planning application with a 300,000 sq ft distribution unit and 250,000 sq ft of small and medium sized industrial units on this former coal preparation and disposal site.
We expect a determination on this site in the first half of 2008 and work is targeted to commence on the site by the year end.

In January 2008 the consent for 250 residential units and 150,000 sq ft of industrial development was granted.
Marketing of the residential element and construction of the industrial element is to commence by the year end.
Gascoigne Wood Following a Call In by the Secretary of State, as a result of a single objection from a local major landowner, in August 2007, we received planning consent for the reuse of the buildings and sidings.
The third party then sought High Court review of the Secretary of States decision.
In the meantime, we have entered into a lease with rail operator EWS to service a major gypsum contract between our customer at Drax and British Gypsum.
We intend to proceed with lettings on the site and are confident that the High Court challenge will ultimately be dismissed.
Business Parks Our first generation Business Parks are generally reused former mine buildings with some new build infill.
They continue to be well tenanted and attract strong demand when units become available.
During the year, we obtained planning consent for a further Business Park at Riccall in the Selby area and we are pursuing planning approval on 3 similar additional sites in Yorkshire.
The Riccall site is already 47% let with good enquiries for the balance of the space.

14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 27 Property Disposals During the year we disposed of 1,106 acres of surplus agricultural land which had no further development opportunities.
In addition, we completed sales of 2 sites at Tetron and Denby where we determined that the maximum value and minimum risk generated optimum returns by sale rather than development.
In June, we sold the final development plot at Denby to DEB Limited for them to construct a purpose-built world HQ and manufacturing unit, and in November we sold the final 10 acres of the current development phase at Tetron to LSP Limited to construct a distribution warehouse for medical supplies.
Development and Market Conditions While we have some Greenfield sites, the majority of our development land is classified as Brownfield or Previously Developed Land.
The latter part of 2007 saw significant softening of yields and reductions in value especially in the commercial property sectors.
However, the valuation of our own portfolio increased, reflecting the increase in the number of development projects, the progress with the planning consent process and the fact that little of our estate is built out.
Looking ahead, we believe the longer term outlook for property in the UK, with its structural shortage of land for development, continues to be positive.
Rental income from our existing Business Parks and agricultural estate increased last year and is expected to continue to grow.
Our primary opportunity to create value, however, remains the securing of planning consents for our progressively evolving development programme and the subsequent participation in development phase profits.
Both of these will impact the RICS valuation of our portfolio, with changes in portfolio valuations being predominantly recognised in the Groups income statement.
It is clear, from both Government publications and from meetings with Ministers and Senior Civil Servants, that the Government recognises our portfolio has the potential to contribute very substantially to its achieving challenging housing and regeneration targets.
PROJECT WORTH Through the development programme, Project Worth, the Group is currently managing 76 projects covering approximately 3,696 net developable acres.
We expect that approximately one third of these acres will ultimately become residential land supporting approximately 25,000 plots, with the balance of the land supporting circa 35 million sq ft of commercial employment space.
We continue to seek additional opportunities, though progressively these will come from the non-Brownfield estate and will be delivered in the long term, beyond 2013.
The macro-economics of the UK, particularly around the need for additional housing units over the next 1020 years, means that the prospects for reclassifying potentially significant additional areas of land into the development programme remain good.
