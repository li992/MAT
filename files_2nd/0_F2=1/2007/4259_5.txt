DIRECTORS REPORT QUALITY PRODUCTS WE ARE CHANGING THE WAY THE WORLD CONNECTS BY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS FOR LEADING MANUFACTURERS IN TWO DISTINCT MARKETS: CELLULAR HANDSETS AND HEADSETS: AND NON CELLULAR SUCH AS GAMES, AUTOMOTIVE AND MP3 PLAYERS.

Our chips deliver many major technical advantages.
Size and cost are critical commercial battlegrounds, particularly with HIGHLIGHTS handsets and headsets.
We are able to put more capability into a smaller area of silicon, so our customers can offer more powerful INDUSTRY-LEADING yet smaller products.
The size of chip is also the biggest factor in cost.
So by designing smaller we reduce overall costs.
PERFORMANCE Power consumption is a vital consideration.
Manufacturers have to strike a balance between the size of battery and the ATTACH RATE FOR capability of the device.
Our chips typically require 20% to 50% less power than our competitors so customers can specify smaller BLUETOOTH IN CELLULAR and lighter batteries.
HANDSETS NOW 50% We also provide improved coexistence.
Customers and consumers want multiple technologies in the same product.
AND RISING We can overcome the technical challenges of coexistence and incorporate both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in the same device.
LEADING THE CELLULAR Interoperability is a key CSR advantage.
Our customers trust us HEADSET MARKET to provide connections between many different sorts of products, from cellular handsets and headsets to MP3 players.
OVER 50% GROWTH IN NON It is also easy to design CSR chips into products.
We supply chips and software together, so customers can design with confidence.
CELLULAR REVENUES Finally, we lead the industry in terms of functionality.
We continue to add functionality to our connectivity products, such as FM transmit, FM receive, Ultra Low Power Bluetooth and GPS.
12 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 Cellular Handsets Half of all handsets sold now incorporate Bluetooth technology.
QUALITY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF CSRS SUCCESS TO DATE In 2007, we believe that the attach rate for Bluetooth in handsets was between 45% and 50%: it was just 14% in 2004.
We expect AND THE FOUNDATION FOR that figure will continue to rise in 2008 to between 55% and 60% as Bluetooth penetrates further down the phone tiers into less THE COMPANYS FUTURE.
WORLDWIDE MAJOR CSR maintained a strong position in this growing segment through 2007 and we expect 2008 to be another strong year for CSR, CUSTOMERS TRUST CSRS despite the loss of some market share at a top tier phone OEM, HIGH QUALITY TECHNOLOGY TO share we expect to recover in 2009.
During 2007, we made substantial shipments to the top mobile phone manufacturers, again demonstrating the quality of our James Collier products and the reputation we hold with the most demanding customers.
We made good progress on design wins in the Korean market with important successes with both Samsung and LG.
We also recorded strong shipments into China.
In automotive, Bluetooth penetration has increased to 10% and continues to grow.
Our technology is at the heart of Ford Sync, We have always been strong in GSM handsets, but in 2007 we Fords fully integrated, voice-activated in-car communications complemented this with significant design wins in the CDMA and entertainment system.

BlueCore5 Multimedia, is now also being incorporated in new For example, in Japan we shipped to Sanyo, Toshiba and for build cars, with Toyota using the chip for their newly released the first time Sony Ericsson.
G-BOOK integrated telematics and navigation systems.
We also continue to lead the industry in aftermarket car-kit solutions.
Cellular Headsets 2007 saw us retain leadership of the headset market, with a UWB increases the speed of data transmission and is increasingly market share of around 80%.

We are on track to provide a low power UWB solution designed specifically for mobile phones The majority of our business is in mono headsets, working in and other portable devices in 2008. tandem with a phone handset for hands-free activity.
Demand for stereo headsets is currently relatively small: but we believe In gaming, the category leader, Sony, specified CSR for the this is set to rise rapidly.
We believe that the pull-through rate of PlayStation 3.
Bluetooth means that controllers no longer headsets to Bluetooth handsets will increase from the high teens require wires, adding to the gaming experience.
CSR remains level seen today.
Underpinning this confidence of increased very well placed in the gaming segment and expects to see pull-through is our view that 2008 will be characterised by growth strong growth in 2008. at the high end, building on the success of the Jawbone headset: an increase in stereo headset markets as many new phones now incorporate stereo profiles: interesting new headset approaches for adoption, as well as the continued development of the low end headset segment.
Non cellular Our non cellular segment saw over 50% revenue growth in 2007 to over $180 million and now comprises over 22% of total revenue.

Chips into the non cellular market are generally 3 CSR MAKES GAMING MORE FUN of higher specification with more value add to our customers and consequently in some applications have a higher average selling price ASP.
Wireless connectivity is now a clear differentiator in the music 1 segment and many leading Personal Media Players including MP3 players incorporate CSRs Bluetooth technology, including Sonys new Rolly player and Panasonics D-Snap.
Our new BlueCore Player has the industrys lowest bill of materials and allows manufacturers to have a low cost wireless MP3 player on the market within weeks.
Towards the end of the year we launched RadioPro, a radical new hardware and software solution for internet radio products, which give consumers a choice of over 12,000 different channels.
