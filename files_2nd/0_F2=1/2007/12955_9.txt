OPERATIONS MORILA MINE Randgold Resources major gold producing asset since October 2000 has been the Morila Gold mine.
Morila was discovered by the company in 1996 and is owned by a Malian company, Morila SA which in turn is owned 80% by Morila Limited and 20% by the State of Mali.
Morila Limited is jointly owned by Randgold Morila had a difficult 2007, failing to meet Resources and AngloGold Ashanti.

to December 2007, Morila has produced approximately 4.75 million ounces of gold at a total cash cost of US$161 per ounce Costs remained under pressure due to continued world-wide inflation in the key and Morila SA has distributed to its stakeholders an amount in excess of inputs of fuel, steel and transport.
