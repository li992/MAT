It is currently estimated that the Background project could be in full production by 2011.
In October 2006 Rosnedra the Federal Subsoil Service, Russian Federation initiated As magnetite is the predominant source of a tender for the licence to mine iron ore on iron at Garinskoye it could be concentrated the Garinskoye deposit.
The supporting using a simple magnetic separation that will documentation estimated that the deposit result in an initial production of standard contained iron ore reserves and resources of iron ore fines averaging approximately 388.8 million tonnes in the Russian 65% iron.
This could then be developed categories A, B, and C with an average into a number of premium products grade of 41.3%.
Of the A, B and C1 category including standard pellets, direct reduced reserves, 39% 82.5 million tonnes were iron DRI, or pig iron.
defined as rich ore and contained an average grade in excess of 50% Fe.
Following the acquisition of an initial 70.22% interest in Garinskoye in September 2007, In December 2006 Garinsky received the pursuant to an agreement dated March 2007, licence and commenced exploration works in December 2007 Aricom conditionally and studies with the initial work focusing on agreed to increase its ownership in a comprehensive programme of Garinskoye to 99.58%.
Following suitable owned by Olis Constructions Limited Olis.
positive results from this, a feasibility study In February 2008, Olis sold its entire 29.26% should be completed in the first half of stake to Aricom.
