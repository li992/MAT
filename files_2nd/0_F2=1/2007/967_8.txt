Operating and financial review Key performance indicators KPIs In order to realise its strategic aims, Anglo American identified areas of strategic focus and has put in place a number of key performance indicators to measure and assess progress against them.
These encompass both financial and non-financial indicators as well as quantitative and qualitative measures.
While these KPIs are helpful in measuring the Groups performance, it should be stressed that they are not exhaustive and that many additional performance measures are used to monitor progress.

2006 results include data from Mondi and Highveld for the full year.
Excludes discontinued operations unless otherwise stated.
The Group believes the Corporate social investment KPI reflects neither the strategic value of the initiative nor is it sufficiently reflective of the value of the outcome of the initiative.
We are in the process of developing new KPIs which seek to address some of these issues.
