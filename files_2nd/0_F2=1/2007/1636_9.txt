Authority to repurchase ordinary shares Resolution 8 set out in the notice convening the Annual General Meeting gives authority to the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares up to a maximum of 6,736,702 ordinary shares until the earlier of 11 October 2008 and the date of the next Annual General Meeting.
This represents 10% of the ordinary shares in issue at 22 May 2007 and the Companys exercise of this authority is subject to the stated upper and lower limits on the price payable which reects the requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Shares will only be repurchased if earnings per share are expected to be enhanced as a result and the Directors believe it is in the best interests of shareholders generally.
To the extent that any shares so purchased are held in treasury, earnings per share will be enhanced until such time, if any, as such shares are resold or transferred out of treasury.
The Company has the choice of cancelling shares which have been repurchased or holding them as treasury shares or a combination of both.
Treasury shares are essentially shares which have been repurchased by the Company and which it is allowed to hold pending either reselling them for cash, cancelling them or, if authorised, using them for the purposes of its employee share plans.
The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice.
Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares would give the Company the ability to reissue them quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional exibility in the management of its capital base.
No dividends will be paid on, and no voting rights will be exercised, in respect of treasury shares.
As at 22 May 2007 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the notice of the Annual General Meeting, there were 579,261 outstanding options granted under all share option plans operated by the Company which, if exercised, would represent 0.86% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
If this authority were exercised in full and the shares repurchased were to be cancelled, such options if exercised would represent 0.96% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
Authorities to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights Resolution 9 set out in the notice convening the Annual General Meeting contains authority for the Directors to allot relevant securities until the earlier of 11 October 2008 and the date of the next Annual General Meeting up to a maximum nominal amount of 748,522 representing 33.33% of the total issued ordinary share capital as at 22 May 2007.
At that date, no treasury shares were held by the Company.
Resolution 10 gives the Directors the power to allot equity securities for cash pursuant to this authority, disapplying the pre-emption provisions contained in Section 89 1 of the Companies Act 1985.
This power is valid for the same period and is limited to the allotment of equity securities up to a nominal amount of 112,278 approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital at 22 May 2007 or in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer.
The Directors have no present intention of issuing further shares other than to satisfy the exercise of option holders rights under the Companys share option schemes or long-term incentive plan or in relation to any appropriate acquisition opportunities which may become available to the Company.
This authority will also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash.
