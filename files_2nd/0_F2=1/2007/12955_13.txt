EXPLORATION 1 A team of 70 geologists examine our prospective REVIEW portfolio of exploration projects in some of the most prospective gold belts of West and East Africa.
In 2007, exploration activities concentrated on the extension of known orebodies and the discovery of new orebodies at producing mines and exploration sites.
We have a portfolio of projects within some of the most prospective gold belts of both West and East Africa and have operations in six African countries, with 171 targets on 12 623 square kilometres of groundholding, supported by a team of 70 geologists.
HIGHLIGHTS At Loulo, we continue to build the resource base, which is now at 11.94 million ounces.
As well as the resource conversion work, exploration is focused on the next discovery by systematically evaluating targets within the lease area.
Of these, Faraba and Baboto are showing the most promise.
A 1 400 square kilometres land package has been consolidated in the Loulo district, straddling the highly prospective Senegal-Mali shear zone.
A helicopter borne VTEM electromagnetic survey has been flown over this entire land package to help with geological and structural interpretation and target prioritisation.
At Morila, research concluded that a specific lithological horizon hosts the ore deposit: this is a mafic volcanic unit which marks a change in sedimentation from fine to coarse.
The extrapolation of this unit is the focus of follow-up work.
In south Mali, generative work continues to prioritise areas of interest.
This has led to a joint venture agreement being signed with a Canadian junior over two prospective permits in the Morila region.
Randgold Resources also continues to work on early stage exploration projects in its search for new deposits.
In the Cte dIvoire, at Tongon, we completed more than 30 000 metres of diamond drilling and increased the resource base by 41% to 4.39 million ounces.
In addition to the feasibility drilling, a review of 19 targets within the Nielle permit has been completed which highlighted 12 targets for follow-up work.
In Senegal, encouraging RAB drill results have been returned along 2.8 kilometres of strike at Massawa, which is now a high priority target for diamond drilling.
This together with the targets of Sofia, Bakan corridor and Bambadji, will be the focus of work in 2008.
In Burkina Faso, a review of all the geological and structural data indicates that a northeast plunging anticline hosts the Kiaka main zone.
The last diamond hole drilled to the north returned 166 metres at 1.26g t indicating the system is open.
A syncline hosts a narrow zone of hangingwall mineralisation, which has not been fully tested.
An additional programme of diamond drilling is being planned to test these two targets.
Elsewhere in the permit portfolio the team are developing targets for drilling in the 2008 field season.
In Ghana, early stage exploration activities on the Bole permit have highlighted a 14 kilometre long gold in soil anomaly associated with a large regional fold closure, adjacent to a granite greenstone belt contact and major regional shear.
In Tanzania, generative work is the driver to build a new portfolio of projects, while work continues on the Miyabi project, a joint venture with African Eagle, who previously identified 520 000 ounces at 1.3g t. In summary, we have a prospective portfolio of exploration projects in both West and East Africa.
This reflects our strategic focus on organic growth through exploration success.
