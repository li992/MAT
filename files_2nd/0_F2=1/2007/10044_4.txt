Alan Kaufman Business Development Director, Engine Sensors & Ignition, Meggitt Sensing Systems There are more ways than one to meet customers requirements.
Its what I enjoy mostbalancing cost and performance criteria and helping shape product development to get the best for the customer and Meggitt.
Logistics, procurement and programme management expertise come into it too, hence our engine sensors and ignition award from Rolls-Royce last year.
We have most of the products and technologies needed to provide our customers with the complete packageand what it takes to procure the rest.
Meggitt has ticked most of the boxes needed for successful supply chain integration in this area, including acquiring a top three ignition company.
But the masterstroke is our ability to include low-cost ingredients.
Meggitts group manufacturing strategy includes an established facility in China on which our companies can draw selectively.
This has put us years ahead of the competition in this market segment.
