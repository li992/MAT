Its the oldest, most respected name in the travel business.
Now, as the newly-formed Thomas Cook Group, we are building on our unrivalled heritage.
We are creating an international company that our 30,000 employees are proud to work for and one that is ideally placed to serve a world of discerning customers and deliver outstanding growth to our shareholders.
It is less than a year since we began the merger with MyTravel to form the Thomas Cook Group.
In that brief time, we have announced higher than anticipated operating pro ts of 375.3 million, fully integrated the two businesses, identi ed at least 200 million in synergies, laid the groundwork for a major share buy-back programme and been elevated to the ranks of the FTSE 100.
Clearly, the merger that began on 12 February, 2007 and saw completion just four months later was the right decision for all concerned.
In this, our first Annual Report, we provide the background to those events and explain how well maintain the momentum of our first year by building on the Thomas Cook Groups early and demonstrable success.
