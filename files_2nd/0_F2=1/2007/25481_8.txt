The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: The solid increase in net interest income has been driven by: - Strong growth in loans and advances and deposits.
- A strong increase in arrangement and exit fees associated with an 18% increase in lending turnover.
The impact of IAS 18 resulted in a cumulative R506 million 2006: R345 million of lending fees in the South African business being deferred for recognition as margin by 31 March 2010.
Net fees and commissions receivable principally include fees in relation to trust and fiduciary services, investment management, banking and treasury activities, as well as profit shares arising out of lending transactions.
The growth in net fees and commissions receivable has been driven by strong activity levels in the majority of these areas of specialisation.
Principal transactions include the revaluations and realisations of equity and warrant positions held these are associated with our lending activities and the manner in which certain of our deals are structured.
The increase in principal transactions reflects the increasing contribution made by the Growth and Acquisition Finance business.
Impairment losses on loans and advances, after adjusting for 5.6 million of recoveries in the prior year, increased from 3.8 million to 6.9 million.
This increase is the result of impairments held against certain transactions in South Africa.
The increase in expenses is mainly as a result of an increase in variable remuneration in line with growth in profitability, a 22% rise in average headcount, and investment in product development and infrastructure.

Outlook South Africa 44 Market conditions were strong over the past year, encouraging many private clients to enter or remain in the stock market.
This was partly driven by the flow of funds into emerging economies, given their favourable valuation fundamentals compared to developed economies.
Although valuations can be supported by local underlying fundamentals, there are concerns that given the record price and index levels, driven by strong performances from resource counters, the South African market remains vulnerable to external shocks that will affect emerging economies.
Revenue from stockbroking advisory and execution activities is expected to increase above that of the prior year, although at a modest rate.
This is dependent on current market conditions remaining benign.
Revenue from portfolio management activities is expected to increase, given the base effect of higher portfolio values.
