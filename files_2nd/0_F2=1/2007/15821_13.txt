Adjusted operating profit excludes restructuring initiatives in order to present a more consistent measure of underlying year-on-year performance.

Tomkins Annual Report 2007 33 Financial review continued Tax rates Taxation The overall objective of the Group tax function is to plan and manage 40 the tax affairs of the Group efficiently within the various local tax jurisdictions in which we operate, so as to achieve the lowest tax cash 30 cost consistent with compliance with the local tax regulations.
20 The tax charge attributable to continuing operations of 69.9 million for 2007 2006: 35.8 million represents an effective tax rate of 26.6% 10 2006: 14.6% applied to profit before tax from continuing operations of 262.6 million 2006: 244.7 million.
0 2005 2006 2007 During 2007, the effective tax rate was impacted by non-recurring tax Underlying tax rate benets of 12.9 million.
Prior to these adjustments the total tax charge Effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 82.8 million representing an effective tax rate of 31.5% applied to profit before tax from continuing operations.
In 2006 the effective tax rate was impacted by the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions of 50.6 million.
This followed the successful resolution of outstanding tax issues in the US, the change in certain tax laws and the change in views on the likely outcome of challenges of the various tax authorities.
In addition during 2006 there were other non-recurring tax charges of 7.2 million included in arriving at the overall charge for the Group.
Prior to these adjustments the total tax charge for 2006 would have been 79.2 million representing an effective tax rate of 32.4% applied to profit before tax from continuing operations.
We will continue to plan the Groups tax affairs efficiently to minimise the tax cash cost but a gradual increase over time is likely as countries around the world increase their focus on taxation as a means of raising revenue for their local economies.
The effective tax rate for 2008 is expected to be around 31%.
