Business Review Key Performance Indicators The delivery of Filtronas strategic goals is underpinned by focusing on key performance indicators which measure the Companys progress in the delivery of long-term growth and shareholder value.
To assess the overall performance of Filtrona, the Company uses five financial key performance indicators KPIs as described below, in addition to the non-financial KPIs set out on pages 8 and 9.

Given the diversity of Filtronas range of businesses operating across international boundaries, a number of other business measures, both financial and non-financial and tailored to the individual requirements and characteristics of each business, are monitored and assessed on a regular basis to evaluate how individual divisions are performing in response to their key objectives and challenges.
