BY MARSHALLING AN EXTENSIVE HOPPER OF DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, BY DELIVERING BUILT-OUT SCHEMES ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF THE PROPERTY MARKET, AND BY REGULARLY RECYCLING CAPITAL INTO THE ACQUISITION OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES, THE COMPANY HAS CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDED THIS TARGET OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS.
2 MARSHALLING MARSHALLING The companys own team, supplemented with skilled external professionals, has a proven track record in marshalling a wide range of projects through the complex and lengthy planning and development processes.
It has particular expertise in site assembly, assessing and managing remediation risks, masterplanning and undertaking public consultation.
DELIVERY 3 DELIVERY Schemes once marshalled are built-out in response to market conditions, with a mixture of pre-let and speculative buildings forming the companys substantial annual construction programme.
Where the use requires a specialist developer such as a housebuilder, land may be sold under tight development control principles.
Assets are disposed of once no further signi cant value can be added, and the capital is then recycled into new schemes, enabling the entire process to begin again.
