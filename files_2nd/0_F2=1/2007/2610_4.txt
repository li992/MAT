Culturally, Burberry is moving from the relatively static wholesale structure of its origins to a more contemporary, dynamic, retail mindset as evidenced in recent initiatives: A new design cycle that ensures a more frequent flow of fresh merchandise to stores Implementation of a basic replenishment programme A marketing programme synchronised with in-store presentation capsules By creating a more responsive operation, this paradigm shift benefits wholesale customers as well.
Looking to the stores, we are focusing on: Enhancing store productivity: Through enhanced aesthetic cohesion across product groups, improved in-store service and a more targeted marketing strategy, we look to drive traffic, increase customer conversion and build average transaction size.
Accelerating our new store opening programme: This includes franchise opportunities.
Developing new store concepts: With the opening of a Prague store in March 2007 we are testing a new, smaller format with an assortment led by accessories and outerwear.
