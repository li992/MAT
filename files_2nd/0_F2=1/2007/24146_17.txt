This profit measure takes into account the impacts of investment return variances, economic assumption changes, non-recurring items and other charges.
In total these were 64 m loss in 2007 compared to 111 m loss in 2006.
2006 included 58m impairment of Asset Management intangibles which did not recur.
Underlying profit before tax is 16m 2006: 509m.
Within this total, basis changes and one-off items amount to 461 m negative 2006: 26m positive, as follows: EEV 2007 2006 UNDERLYING m m PROFIT EEV underlying profit before tax 16 509 Capitalisation of UK development and corporate expenses 306 - UK persistency 158 53 Mortality, morbidity, longevity 9 27 Annuity reinsurance 12 - Total basis changes and one-off items 461 26 EEV underlying profit before basis changes and one-off items 477 535 The underlying profit before basis changes and one-off items was 58m lower than 2006.
The benefits of improved contribution from new business and from International persistency, are offset by lower burnthrough in underlying profit, higher development and International expenses and lower Asset Management profits.
The expenses impact of 306m has arisen due to the reallocation of 20m annual expenses previously classified as development to maintenance, and the inclusion of additional costs within the provision for corporate costs.
The impacts arise within UK Life & Pensions 238m and Corporate items 68m.

New business BUSINESS on a PVNBP basis was up 7% as the increase in sales volume was offset by higher lapse assumptions in pensions.
Contribution from UK new business was down 11% from 108m to 96m primarily as a result of the mix of business.
UK IRR AND In the UK, IRR increased from 10.3% to 11.7% as a result of favourable regulatory reserve changes CASH PAYBACK following completion of the implementation of PS06 14, which was particularly helpful for protection.
UK cash payback was unchanged at 12 years.
Protection payback fell from 9 years to 8 years as a result of lower reserving requirements but savings & investments increased from 16 years to 24 years as a result of increased lapse assumptions.
The main savings & investments product was replaced in October.
IMPACT OF EXPENSE In reporting on the outcome of our strategic review we announced our intention to recategorise RECATEGORISATION around 20m of costs, previously shown as development costs, as maintenance.
The contribution from UK new business as reported above would reduce by 16m due to the change in treatment of development costs.
The UK IRR would reduce by 0.8% and cash payback would increase by two years.

qxd 27 3 08 03:11 Page 39 OPERATIONAL REVIEW KEY RISKS SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK FINANCIAL REVIEW The main factors are as follows:  Increased lapses in the year have resulted in an assumption change of 133m.
This comprises: 65m from our Investment Portfolio Bond and With-Profits Bonds, 53m from Group Pensions and 15m other products.
 The expense assumption changes recognise there will always be a recurring level of development costs not related to new markets or products.
20m of additional annual costs have been capitalised as maintenance costs resulting in a charge of 238m.
 The mortality and morbidity charge of 9m arises mainly from strengthening assumed future annuitant mortality.
 The annuity reassurance treaty entered into with Swiss Re early in 2007 produced a 12m EEV profit and has significantly reduced the exposure to longevity risk.
 The burnthrough provision has remained largely unchanged at 48m 2006: 50m, with the underlying profit impact offset by investment return related variances reported below underlying profit.
UK OTHER NET Other net expense of 5 m 2006: nil includes the income from the IFA businesses since their EXPENSE acquisition offset by the costs of developing the Wrap platform.
UK DEVELOPMENT Development costs increased to 41 m 2006: 26 m. In 2007, as in previous years, development COSTS costs were treated as investment in the business in order to improve future EEV profits.
The main increase in 2007 relates to the development of a Wrap platform, The Asset Hub.
In January 2008, in line with our new strategy, we announced we would cease development of this project.
We also announced that in future development costs would only include costs related to developing wholly new products or entering wholly new markets.
UK EXPECTED The expected return on shareholders net assets has increased by 26% to 63m 2006: 50m, because RETURN ON of a 16% increase in the weighted average value of Life & Pensions shareholder assets during the year SHAREHOLDER and higher expected returns.
In August we largely eliminated the shareholder equity exposure, the NET ASSETS majority of which took place at a FTSE level of 6,250.

International cash payback was unchanged at 4 years.

Adverse persistency experience for International With-Profits Bonds led to revised persistency assumptions.
This charge was more than offset by positive experience variances for Lombard and other product lines within FPI.
INTERNATIONAL Development costs within our International business increased as we have invested for growth.
The DEVELOPMENT 7m in respect of FPI represents our investment into the German pensions market and establishing COSTS capability in new markets.

 Non-recurring items are discussed on page 34.
 There is no impairment charge in respect of F&Cs acquired intangible assets.
The charge in 2006 related to the write down in value of management contracts following fund outflows notified in the year.
