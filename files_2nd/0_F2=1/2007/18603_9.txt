STRATEGY 53 advisers statement Upstream has assessed Graingers achievement against the 2006 07 targets based on: meetings and telephone interviews with Grainger individuals responsible for specic CR areas and for target delivery: and detailed review of documentation and information submitted as evidence against the targets.
On this basis we can provide assurance that Grainger plc has made some progress on 86% of its 22 applicable CR targets, with eight of these being fully achieved by the year end.
A number became not applicable due to circumstances beyond Graingers control, a change in responsibility for other targets unfortunately slowed progress.
Nevertheless, Upstream believes that Grainger retains a genuine commitment to improving its CSR credentials, and we note that several of the targets that were not fully achieved in the past year have been carried forward for completion during the 2007 08 period.
Graingers successes this year include: a baseline review of environmental aspects and impacts to prioritise those that pose the most significant risk to Graingers business: an initiative to engage with contractors requiring them to provide environmental performance data for individual construction sites for monitoring purposes: and Graingers work with the homeless, along with its commitment to staff, should be celebrated as particular areas of success.
Grainger has set some challenging targets for the year ahead and, for the first time, the company has committed to a number of longer-term goals.
This demonstrates a more strategic approach to CR.
The gathering of environmental performance data across key business activities will represent a real challenge in the coming year, but internal monitoring systems are already being developed and work is under way with a number of external organisations to facilitate this important task.
At Upstream, we look forward to continuing to work with Grainger as it continues to address its material impacts and further develops its CR strategy.
