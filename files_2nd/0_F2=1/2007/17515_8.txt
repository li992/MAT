Early indications point to stronger first-quarter stainless steel Yngvar Finne seals anodes at the Nikkelverk refinery, Norway production in Europe and the US, while China, Japan and Korea have yet to respond.
This is due to the level of inventory destocking, which was exaggerated in the second half of 2007.
It is expected that the price of nickel will remain in a tighter trading range accompanied by less volatility, due to the change in the nickel alloy surcharge system from three to one month pricing.
The high marginal cost of low grade nickel pig iron production is also likely to restrict nickel prices to a tighter range, effectively acting as a swing producer when the price covers the cost of production of nickel pig iron.
