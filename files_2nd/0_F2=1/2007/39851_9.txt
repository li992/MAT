2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the 2001 Scheme, performance is measured in terms of growth in net asset value per Ordinary Share prior to distributions compared with that of a Peer Group of listed real estate companies set out below: The British Land Company PLC Helical Bar plc Brixton PLC Land Securities PLC Capital & Regional plc Liberty International plc Daejan Holdings PLC Minerva plc Derwent London PLC Quintain Estates and Development PLC Great Portland Estates plc Calculations of performance are reviewed by the Groups auditors prior to the vesting of any options.
The following sliding scale range applies: Proportion of Net Asset Value Performance options exercisable Upper quartile 100% Median 30% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 30% and 100% Below median Nil For options granted under the 2001 Scheme during the period 2001 to 2003, if the performance target is not met in full after three years, it is retested at the end of the fourth and fifth financial years from the original base date and, to the extent the target has not been met by the end of the fifth year, the relevant options will lapse.
For options granted in 2004, there is no retesting of the performance condition.
Following the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards and following the Groups conversion to a REIT, the Committee calculates adjusted net asset value performance with the overriding objective of achieving a fair measurement of the Groups relative performance against its Peer Group.
2007 Long Term Incentive Plan The performance conditions described in the Long Term Incentive Plan apply to the vesting of awards granted in February and December 2006, each applying to one half of the shares awarded: - The performance condition attached to one half of an award will require average annual net asset value NAV growth of between RPI plus 3% to RPI plus 7% per annum over three financial years for between 30% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
- The performance condition attached to the other half will require total shareholder return TSR performance against the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index to match or exceed it by up to 5.5% per annum over three financial years for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 10% and 50% of the total award.
For the purposes of calculating TSR, share price plus dividends reinvested will be averaged over the three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.

Directors remuneration report AnnualReport2007 55 Total Shareholder Return The graphs below show the Total Shareholder Return for the Company compared with the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index and the Committee uses this index as one measure of performance for awards of shares under the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, it considers this is an appropriate benchmark against which the relative performance of the Company should be compared for the purposes of considering executive Directors remuneration.
The graphs below show relative Total Shareholder Return performance over the last five and ten financial years.
The Committee considers the ten year period gives a better indication of the Groups long term performance.
This graph shows the value, by 30 September 2007, of 100 invested in Total Shareholder Return - 5 years Shaftesbury PLC on 30 September 2002 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 350 350 Real Estate Index.
2007 This graph shows the value, by 30 September 2007, of 100 invested in Total Shareholder Return - 10 years Shaftesbury PLC on 30 September 1997 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
