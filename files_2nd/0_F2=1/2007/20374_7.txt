MANAGERS REPORT The price falls experienced by the asset class in the final quarter of 2007 were frequently severe and indiscriminate.
They left many benchmark constituents, particularly towards the smaller end of the spectrum, on extremely low valuations that have not been evident for some years.
It would thus seem that, if we are experiencing a cyclical fide-rating of small companies, a significant portion of that process may already have taken place for a large number of companies within the benchmark.
While some of these companies will inevitably feel the effects of a more difficult economic environment, should it indeed be forthcoming, your Managers consider that, consistent with previous cycles, some represent excellent opportunities.
Indeed, your Managers are optimistic that these opportunities will provide the basis for a recovery in ASCoTs relative performance as and when the stockmarkets irtation with growth and momentum ends.
As always, the precise timing is difficult to call, but in the meantime the task is to ensure that ASCoTs resources are appropriately directed to those companies about which your Managers, through their value investment disciplines, have conviction.
