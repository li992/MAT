PREMIER FARNELL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 REMUNERATION REPORT 47 The main terms applying to Andrew Fishers final salary pension are: Payable from normal retirement age of 60 Andrew Fisher does not make any contribution to the final salary pension arrangements Spouses pension of 50% of Andrew Fishers pension payable on death Pensions in payment increase in line with inflation, to a maximum of 5% each year.
The accrued final salary pension shown at 28 January 2007 is the combined figure for the UK Scheme and US Plan defined benefit accruals and is the estimated amount that Andrew Fisher would have been entitled to from normal retirement age.
The increase in final salary pension during the year is the increase over the figure disclosed in last years accounts both including and excluding an allowance for inflation up to 16 May 2006.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
The table above shows transfer values at the beginning and the end of the year.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the Directors final salary pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore they cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
As the transfer values are linked to investment market conditions, a slight fall in investment yields over the year has been a factor in the increase in transfer values which is shown.
Members contributions paid during the year were paid into the money purchase arrangement within the UK Scheme and as such are not included in the transfer value.
