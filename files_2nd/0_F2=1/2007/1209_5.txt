This feasibility study is considering a mining rate of 10 million tonnes per annum of ore and using a conveyor belt to transport a dry screened pre-concentrate from Sutara to the process plant at Kimkan.
Exploration Dalgeophysica continued with the confirmation drilling and trenching of Sutarskoye using two core drills.
Some 3 3,753 linear metres of drilling and 18,384m of trenches were completed by the end of May 2007, the end of the drilling season.
During the summer months, when the Sutara river overlying the Sutarskoye deposit was in flood, access to the drilling positions was most difficult, even with assistance from the bulldozers.
Consequently Dalgeophysica relocated the drills to Kimkanskoye in order to carry out geotechnical drilling at possible infrastructure sites.
