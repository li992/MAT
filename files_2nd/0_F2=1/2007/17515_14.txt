Xstrata plc Annual Report 2007 | 77 Xstrata Nickel achieved record financial results and production in 2007.
Revenues of nickel per year respectively, at full for the period rose to $5,252 million, 56% or approximately $1.9 billion higher production capacity and significantly XNi than the comparative period in 2006, on a pro forma basis.
The significant increase reduce unit costs.
The amount of mined Nickel was primarily due to the robust performance of nickel commodity prices during the ore processed in 2007 through Sudburys period and record nickel sales, leading to a 133% increase in EBIT from $931 million to $2,172 Strathcona mill declined by 1% to million in 2007.

Araguaia The Araguaia project, located in the north-western Brazilian state of Para, is currently in a scoping stage, with prefeasibility scheduled to commence in 2008.
Araguaia benefits from substantial existing resources, a highly prospective land position and well developed regional infrastructure including rail, road, power generation and power transmission.
Continued exploration success in 2007 led to substantial additional mineralisation being added to the Araguaia resource base.
During the year, 46,300 metres of Xstrata plc Annual Report 2007 | 81 diamond drilling were completed resulting in revised mineral resource estimates at Serra do Tapa, Vale dos Sonhos and Pau Preto.
