Overview SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 30 Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2007 The Directors submit their report and the audited accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Companys business The Company carries on business as an investment trust and is an investment company within the meaning of Section 266 of the Companies Act 1985.
In order to obtain exemption from corporation tax on capital gains, the Company has conducted itself with a view to being an approved investment trust for the purposes of Section 842 of the United Kingdom Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 as amended.
The last accounting period for which the Company has been treated as approved by HM Revenue & Customs as meeting the qualifying criteria for investment trust status is the year ended 31 December 2006 and the Company has subsequently conducted its affairs so as to enable it to continue to qualify for such approval.
The Company is not a close company for taxation purposes.
A review of the Companys business and its likely future development is given in the Chairmans statement on pages 6 and 7, the Chief Executives review on pages 8 and 9 and the Business review on pages 10 to 23.
Revenue and earnings As an investment trust and an investment company, it is important to distinguish between revenue profits and capital profits.
The consolidated revenue profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was 20,970,000 2006: 21,957,000.
The Companys revenue profit for the year was 9,950,000 2006: 14,851,000.
The consolidated capital profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was 131,124,000 2006: 190,026,000.
Taking revenue and capital returns into account, the consolidated profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was 152,094,000 2006: 211,983,000.
The Companys profit for the year was 139,522,000 2006: 204,108,000. Dividend The Company is prohibited by its Articles of Association from distributing as dividends any capital surpluses that arise from the realisation of investments.
Accordingly, any dividends paid by the Company will be funded out of its revenue account.
The Companys investment objective is one of capital growth and it is anticipated that returns for shareholders will derive primarily from capital.
However, the Directors recommend that the Company should declare the payment of a final dividend of 6.5p per share for the year ended 31 December 2007 in order to meet the requirements to ensure that the Company continues to qualify as an investment trust.
Charitable donations The amount paid by the Group to charitable organisations during 2007 was 26,410.
Further information on the Groups charitable activities and donations policy can be found in the section on Corporate Social Responsibility on page 41.
No political donations or contributions were made or expenditure incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries during 2007.
Policy for payment of creditors It is the policy of the Company to settle all investment transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant markets in which it operates.
All other expenses are paid on a timely basis in the ordinary course of business.
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 December 2007.
Purchase of shares for cancellation The Directors have not used the authority given to them at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 10 May 2007 to purchase any of the ordinary shares of the Company.
The total number of shares in issue on 2 April 2008 was 139,064,434 shares.
To provide maximum flexibility, the Directors wish to renew the authority to purchase shares for cancellation.
A resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to 14.99% of the share capital in issue on 2 April 2008 will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for which notice is given on pages 80 to 81.
This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2009, unless revoked or varied earlier.
As at 2 April 2008, the Company held no shares in treasury.
Accordingly, the percentage figures in this and other sections of the report are all calculated exclusive of treasury shares.
The total number of options and performance shares to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding at 2 April 2008 was 10,364,217, which represented approximately 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the Company were to purchase the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted by this resolution and by the existing buy-back authority given on 10 May 2007 for 20,808,187 shares then the options and performance shares outstanding at 2 April 2008 would represent approximately 10.6% of the issued ordinary share capital.
However, the Directors do not presently intend to exercise the existing authority prior to its expiry on 7 May 2008.
Issue of new shares At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 10 May 2007, the Directors were given powers in substitution for the powers taken at the Annual General Meeting of the Company in April 2006 to allot relevant securities as if the pre-emption provisions in Section 89 1 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply.
A total of 254,297 shares were issued during the year in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and no further shares were issued after the year end.
The Directors wish to renew these powers at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Therefore, Resolutions 10 and 11 set out in the notice of the Annual General Meeting on pages 80 to 81 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
If passed, Resolution 10 will give the Directors the power to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of a 1,390,644 equivalent to 1% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 2 April 2008 in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan: and b 46,354,811 equivalent to one-third of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 2 April 2008.
If passed, Resolution 11 will give the Directors the power to allot equity securities as if the pre-emption provisions in Section 89 1 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply a up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,390,644 equivalent to 1% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 2 April 2008 in connection with the Companys Executive Share Option Plan 2001 and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan: b pursuant to rights issues and other pre-emptive issues: and c up to an aggregate nominal amount of 13,906,443 equivalent to 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 2 April 2008.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 31 The Directors are seeking the authority referred to in paragraph c of Resolution 11 in order to provide flexibility in raising monies to take advantage of opportunities arising through the launch of new funds, and for general corporate purposes.
It is the intention of the Board that any equity securities allotted under this authority will be allotted at an effective premium to the estimated net asset value per ordinary share at the date of pricing of the issue of the relevant equity securities.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph b of Resolution 11 generally to issue relevant securities whenever they believe it is advantageous to shareholders to do so.
The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph a of Resolution 10 and paragraph a of Resolution 11 to grant options under part D of the Companys Executive Share Option Plan 2001 and the SVG Capital 2007 Performance Share Plan to individuals seconded to the Company or its subsidiaries which, for this purpose, include joint ventures.
Options granted pursuant to this authority will nevertheless count towards limits on the number of new ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options.
The authorities proposed to be taken under Resolutions 10 and 11 will lapse at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2009, unless renewed, revoked or varied earlier.
