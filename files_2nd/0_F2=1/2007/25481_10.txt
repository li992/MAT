The Institutional Stockbroking operations in South Africa were positively affected by increased volumes over the period.
In the UK, commissions were negatively affected by regulatory changes and consequent competitive pressures.
Principal transaction income reflects a solid performance by the dual listed arbitrage and SA UK hedge book activities in South Africa and the Equity Trading business in the UK, partially offset by a weaker performance by the UK market making activities.
The increase in expenses largely relates to a rise in headcount in certain businesses and an increase in variable remuneration.
Divisional review Corporate Finance UK and Europe We benefited from good levels of merger and acquisition M&A activity.
The IPO market was subdued at the beginning of the year but activity levels improved significantly during the second half.
Eight IPOs were concluded during the period, the most significant being Southern Cross Healthcare PLC, Clinphone PLC and Styles & Wood PLC.
We completed 24 M&A transactions with a value of 2.5 billion 2006: 14 transactions with a value of 1.1 billion.
We completed 21 fundraisings during the year, raising in aggregate 597 million 2006: 21 transactions, raising 634 million.
We continue to build the quality and size of the corporate client list, gaining 25 new brokerships, with the total number of quoted clients now at 91.
The average market capitalisation of these clients is 272 million.
South Africa We maintained our strong positioning with a good level of activity.
Our focus was on M&As, corporate restructuring activities, IPOs and black economic empowerment transactions.
We retained all our major clients and gained several new mandates during the period, particularly for black economic empowerment transactions and IPOs.
Corporate Finance transactions during the period increased to 140 2006: 119, with a value of R52 billion 2006: R31.2 billion.
Sponsor broker deals completed during the period increased to 161 2006: 128, with the value increasing substantially to R70.1 billion 2006: R28.6 billion.

The Sponsor and Corporate Finance divisions were also ranked first and second respectively in volume of M&A transactions in the 54 Ernst & Young review for M&A 2006 calendar year.
Australia There is increasing awareness and recognition of the Investec brand within the Australian market.

We focused on building our capabilities in Brisbane and strengthening our presence in Melbourne.
We continue to expand our sector specialisation and launched our resource advisory capability leveraging off opportunities in Western Australia.
We experienced strong cross-border activity, particularly in the resources and renewable energy sectors, between Australia and the rest of the group.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading UK and Europe While volatile markets and unbundling affected the growth of secondary commissions compared to the prior year, trading revenues reflected upward momentum.
Our sector build out is now complete with the introduction of two new sectors during the year, namely Speciality and Other Financials and Construction and Building.
The quality of our research was highlighted in the Sunday Times Starmine Survey published in January 2007, in which we were placed first across all UK brokers for FTSE 250 recommendations in the UK.
We also achieved the number one ranking in the Investors Chronicle AIM survey.
We recently established a sales desk in New York to accelerate our UK offering in that market.
We continued to make substantial investments in our trading and execution capacity.
South Africa Strong agency performance was driven by active market volumes and greater international penetration.
We broadened our stock coverage and filled key gaps in our research offering to underpin our South African distinctiveness.
Further to our stock association initiative, leading market share positions were achieved in the key dual listed shares.
Our Prime Broking operation performed well, exceeding expectations in the growth of funds on the system and new client mandates.
Good progress was made across our key product offerings.

Further analysis is provided below.
Other operating income relates to the operating results of two investments held within the Private Equity portfolio, which have been consolidated with the respective income and expenses reflected in other operating income and administration expenses.
These investments generated a net loss after tax and minority interest of 2.3 million.
Any realisation of these investments in excess of their carrying values will be recognised as income from principal transactions.
The two investments are Global Ethanol Holdings Limited and Idatech LLC see page 204 for further information.
55 The increase in expenses largely relates to the consolidation of the two investments mentioned above expenses amounted to 25 million, partially offset by a decrease in variable remuneration given lower profitability in certain of the divisions.

South Africa The Direct Investments portfolio increased significantly from R697 million at 31 March 2006 to R1 012 million at 31 March 2007.
This was driven by a good performance from the underlying investments and further investment acquisitions.
The opportunistic investment side of Direct Investments was not as active this year compared to previous years because opportunities in this part of the business tend to arise in weaker stock market conditions.
We continued to expand the capacity of our Private Equity investments through acquisitions and capital expenditure.
The Private Equity portfolio was approximately R1 266 million at 31 March 2007 March 2006: R922 million.
56 Australia We completed the equity raising of A$200 million for Investec Wentworth Private Equity Fund 3.
The total size of the Private Equity Funds is A$480 million.
We successfully completed three new investments.
The investment portfolio continued to perform strongly.
Outlook Corporate Finance Black economic empowerment, IPOs and M&A transactions are expected to continue to drive activity in South Africa.
The pipeline looks positive across all geographies and we continue to build our client base.
An enhanced team structure, together with increased brand awareness and national reach, provides a solid platform for future growth opportunities across all areas of the Australian business.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading The UK business has strengthened its positioning in the market, while further growth is expected to come from hedge funds and increased distribution into the US and Europe.
The South African business remains well positioned to capitalise on current market conditions.
The focus on broadening the research product, combined with increased international leverage, the stock association programme and improved traction from new initiatives, has improved the outlook for the operation.
Direct Investments and Private Equity We remain active in seeking direct investment opportunities, while continuing to unlock further value from the portfolio and building quality black economic empowerment platforms.
The companies in our Private Equity portfolio are all trading in line with expectations and the outlook remains positive.

Divisional review Asset Management Investment specialist focused on performance and client needs Overview and financial analysis Operating profit increased by 14.7% to 68.1 million, contributing 14.6% to group profit.
Assets under management decreased by 5.6% to 29.9 billion.
Includes Silica third party administration business.
The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: UK and international Operating profit grew by 65.5% to 17.6 million.
Growth was underpinned by the general momentum of the business and strong mutual fund sales.
Assets under management increased to 13.1 billion on the back of net flows in excess of 1 billion for the reporting period.
Southern Africa Operating profit grew by 3.7% to 50.6 million 2007: R676.8 million: 2006: R522.2 million, an increase of 22.6%.
Investment performance generally remained good, resulting in a rise in performance fee revenue from R210 million to R263 million.
Assets under management benefited from strong mutual fund sales however on the institutional side, client restructures and rebalances and structural outflows from the ex-Fedsure book resulted in net outflows for the period.
The final transfer of the ex-Fedsure book R11.9 billion to Liberty took place in the second half of the year.
Costs The increase in expenses is largely due to a rise in variable remuneration in line with the strong growth in profitability and an increase in headcount to drive future growth opportunities.
