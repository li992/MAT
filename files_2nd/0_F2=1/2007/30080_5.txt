Managers Report Introduction It is hard to know where to begin to give you the good news that I dont think we have seen the end to rising commercial property values, or the bad news that from here on its going to be much harder work for property companies, and for the Trust to make 15% per annum returns, and probably impossible to repeat the 30% pa total returns we have been able to deliver to you over the last five years.
Chris Turner Fund Manager 7 June 2007 Those returns have been driven by the fall in the initial yield of all types of property in most countries in the world what is now termed yield compression.
Effectively global property has been revalued as an asset class, relative to bonds and equities.
I think that this is probably a semi-permanent re-rating, but permanent or not this re-rating is a oneoff event.
Here in the UK and in the USA that re-rating is now coming to an end.
It started later in Europe and is still in full swing there, but it is logical to expect the European markets to follow their US and UK counterparts in due course.
In the meantime we have to worry about inflation and its impact on global base rates and borrowing costs not forgetting that the surge in investor demand for property these past four years has been occasioned by a desire to invest for income in an asset class that offers better inflation protection than bonds.
Performance Over the year the net asset value total return was 31.8% and this figure compares with a total return from the Benchmark of 27.5%.
Performance was strong in the July to December period, but we had two short periods in the first and last quarters of the financial year when our gearing and our large shareholdings in the large UK property companies worked against us.
The Benchmark total returns were 23.9% for the UK and 30.9% for Europe ex UK, so as a consequence, our UK overweight hurt our performance.
I thought that the arrival of REITs in the UK would stimulate share prices in the first thee months of 2007.
It has actually had the opposite effect to date.

Average initial yields and 10% of the Benchmark worked slightly against us, but are stable and rental growth, running at around 3.8% pa is we will continue with this position.
Stock selection was again the main source of capital growth.
The immediate cause of a positive contributor to performance.
Noteworthy amongst this change in sentiment has been the increase in base rates stock movements was again Big Yellow, whose shares rose and fixed interest yields occasioned by the recent surge in 80%.
Our only stocks to double in the year were both new UK inflation.
This has deterred some buyers and increased issues last summer Icade in France and Riofisa in Spain, the potential for sales by highly leveraged investors whose the latter holding being sold before the year end.
Our duds loan renewal terms are not to their liking.
In addition there were mercifully few and were small holdings.
The worst was are elements of both investor fatigue in the UK and of Queens Walk, a highly leveraged investor in sub prime grade investors selling to switch into Continental Europe.
UK and European house mortgages where we lost half our In Europe, where yield compression started later than in the 1.2m investment over the year.
New investments in the UK, the market is still very buoyant.
However in the most year were concentrated in internally managed companies desirable locations, especially Paris and Madrid, initial yields mainly with a focus on office property and with share prices are down below 4% and therefore below Euro borrowing in touch with the underlying asset value.
Sales were mainly costs, and those chasing high yields are having to go to less from holdings where bids were made or where we judged attractive locations, such as East Germany or Southern Italy that the premium to the asset value was unjustified by the to find reasonably stable 7% plus income returns.
Tenant Demand Property Investment Market Background Tenant demand has slowly improved in many European In the last three years I have reported little else under this locations, though there remain weak spots.

Breaking this down, the picture is patchy.
In Spain the danger is oversupply with average Continental premium was 30% and the average over 600,000 new homes a year being built for a UK premium was 4%.
As in the year to March 2006, the population of 40 million while in the UK we build UK average was dragged down by the five largest UK 200,000 homes a year for a population of 60 million.

Management fees will usually be based on average underlying portfolio growth of around 13%, and gross assets, not net assets, and have significant sector average gearing, which fell to around 80%, boosted performance fee rights when total returns exceed 10% or the average net asset value NAV growth to about 23%.

Fourthly, I expected the arrival of the UK investment in Eastern Europe.
We have stayed away from REIT regime to lower or remove the discounts to NAV at almost all these companies.

In Spain there were cash bids for inherent capital gains tax, they would be takeover targets all the main property companies in which we were invested.

Lastly I said that with our direct merger of Unibail and Rodamco coming after the year end.

All these comments still apply.

The comparative figures at March 2006 were is therefore comparatively very low, reflecting both my 459m and 52.0%.
Towards the end of the year we reticence towards short term trading and my general reduced our investment in Hammerson selling over philosophy that, what I hope are well judged investments 1 million shares in a period of bid speculation.
We also should be left alone to prove their worth.
If nothing else, it sold about 24% of our holding in Big Yellow at the 660p saves us a lot of stamp duty and broking commissions!

These results are more noteworthy because the TR Property Investment Trust 15 Managers Report continued correction.
Less often do they level out onto a new and potentially stable value plain.
Last November, in my interim report, I said for sure, one day property values and property share prices will have become so overheated that the inevitable occurs.
When I wrote that I was visualising that we would see a further climax of buying before this commercial property market peaked a climax strong enough, amongst other attributes, as to carry the shares of the largest UK property companies onto the sort of premium ratings enjoyed by their Continental counterparts.
This has not happened and I am grateful for not having to run the portfolio through the hostile market conditions that might follow such a peak.
While yields are falling high leverage is the key to high returns.
When values are relatively stable, the highest total returns usually come from property companies with high levels of skill in buying, managing, developing and trading property.
These latter are the businesses whose shares we prefer to hold in your portfolio.
