With no previous railway experience within ingenious people who go thebusiness to speak of, we expected to relyheavily on specialist sub-contractors.
However, not fully comfortable with the the extra mile to solve them.
proposed designs by them and the unavailability of components from local suppliers, we took direct charge of the engineering and procurement.
The team quickly identied railway industry experts from around the world and sought their advice to develop the front end engineering and design.
Later, alternative designs were developed by Petrofacs own team, selecting equivalent European components that met theproject specications and schedule.
Bit-by-bit, they convinced the Turkmen authorities to sign-off their specications andthey kept a close eye on the construction and commissioning.
The entire package was commissioned well ahead of schedule, with substantial efficiencies.
Meanwhile, with rail rapidly becoming the preferred mode of transport for the regions oil and gas industry, Petrofac nowbenets from having created its own in-house expertise.
As an extra accolade, the team was named the 2014 winner of a Petrofac EVE Award in the driven to deliver category held annually to celebrate employees who embody our values.
