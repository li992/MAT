Investment Objective The Companys investment objective is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends, at levels that are sustainable, whilst preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio, utilising the investment skills of the Investment Manager and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager the AIFM.
Investment Policy To pursue its investment objective, the Company invests mainly in floating rate senior secured loans issued in U. S. Dollars, Sterling and Euros by primarily North American and European Union corporations, partnerships and other business issuers.
These loans are at the time of investment often non-investment grade.
The Company considers debt instruments to be non-investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories Aaa, Aa, A and Baa by at least two independent credit ratings agencies or, if unrated, are deemed by the Investment Manager to be of comparable quality.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2014 7 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 ANNUAL REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT CONTINUED Investment Policy continued The coupon received when investing in floating rate loans varies with, and is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in, a generally recognised base interest rate such as LIBOR.
The Company generally seeks to focus on loans of issuers that the Investment Manager believes have the ability to generate cash flow through a full business cycle, maintain adequate liquidity, possess an enterprise value in excess of senior debt and have access to both debt and equity capital.
The Company also makes investments in senior bonds on an opportunistic basis if the Investment Manager believes that such investments are attractively valued, up to a maximum in aggregate of 20% of the Net Asset Value at the time of investment, provided that no more than 10% of Net Asset Value may be invested in unsecured senior bonds at the time of investment.
Diversification The Investment Manager seeks to manage risk through in-depth credit research utilising proprietary analytic processes, diversifying across industries, companies and investment size and adjusting sector weightings based on economic and market analysis.
The Companys portfolio of investments is intended to represent at least 100 investments across a minimum of 20 industries, with a focus on those industries regarded as defensive.
Defensive industries are those the Investment Manager believes are less affected by changes in economic conditions and likely to demonstrate the strongest capital preservation.
Typically, no industry will represent more than 15% of Net Asset Value at the time of investment.
No single investment will, at the time such investment is made, represent more than 5% of Net Asset Value.
Gearing and Derivatives The Company does not normally employ gearing or derivatives for investment purposes.
The Company may, from time to time, use borrowings for share buy backs and short-term liquidity purposes.
The Directors will restrict borrowing to an amount not exceeding 20% of the Net Asset Value at the time of drawdown.
Derivatives are used for foreign exchange hedging purposes and the US Dollar exposure for sterling shareholders is explained in Note 2 of the financial statements.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Board is responsible for the Companys system of internal financial and operating controls and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board also monitors the investment limits and restrictions set out in the Companys investment objective and policy.
The principal risks and uncertainties that have been identified and the steps taken by the Board to mitigate these areas are as follows: Credit Risk The key risk for the Company remains Credit Risk i. e. that the Investment Manager buys a loan or bond of a particular Issuer and it does not perform as expected and either defaults on a payment or experiences a significant drop in the secondary market value.
To mitigate this risk, the Investment Manager carries out extensive, independent due diligence on each borrower, and has a particular focus on stable, performing credits that evidence strong track records through previous economic cycles.
Additionally, the size of an Issuer is also considered and the Investment Manager continues to favour the larger issuers in the market, defined by having debt issuance greater than $500m or equivalent in sterling or euros.
These issuers tend to have broader syndicates, which can aid liquidity in the secondary market.
As well as screening out the smaller issuers, the Investment Manager also excludes highly cyclical industries and companies with limited earning visibility from its Investment Process.
8 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC REPORT CONTINUED Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued Credit Risk continued Once a particular investment has been made, the Investment Manager is very focused on the monitoring of it.
A range of relevant data is reviewed on an ongoing basis for each investment, including, but not limited to, key financial drivers, commodity prices, stock prices, regulatory developments, financial results, press releases and management commentary to identify any indicators of credit deterioration.
To manage this risk further, the Board ensures a diversification of investments with the Investment Manager operating in accordance with the investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the Board.
The Directors monitor the implementation and results of the investment process with the Investment Manager at each quarterly Board meeting and monitor risk factors in respect of the portfolio.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations as and when these fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by the Investment Manager to ensure that the Company maintains sufficient working capital in cash or near cash form so as to be able to meet the Companys ongoing requirements as these are budgeted for.
Level of Discount or Premium A discount or premium to NAV can occur for a variety of reasons, including market conditions or to the extent investors undervalue the management activities of the Investment Manager or discount their valuation methodology and judgment.
While the Directors may seek to mitigate any discount to NAV per Share through the discount management mechanisms set out in the Prospectus, there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful.
