Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 41 Mineral resources N currently consists of Mineral resources the remaining stockpile and ore reserves material, pushback ore material from pit 4S and a portion of the tailings storage facility TSF.
MALI MAURITANIA Mineralised waste stockpiles and open pit material along with the higher grade portion of the TSF are reported as ore reserves and form the bulk of the feed for the current LoM SENEGAL plan.
Bamako BURKINA FASO 2014 gold production of 110 272oz GUINEA was 22% down on the prior year Operations CTE due to lower grade ore milled and LIBERIA DIVOIRE lower throughput as the mine progressed through remaining stockpiles.
The reduction in throughput resulted from the planned change in the milling configuration with the Morila mine shutdown of the SAG mill in July 2013.
TSF mineral resources are reported at a $1 500 oz reported at a 0.33g t cut-off.
Open pit mineral resources were generated by Miss Paula Ogilvie, independent consultant, under the supervision of Mr Jonathan Kleynhans, an officer of the company and competent person.
TSF mineral resources were generated by BMRE independent consultants, under the supervision of Mr Jonathan Kleynhans, an officer of the company and competent person.
2 Open pit ore reserves are located within a $1 300 oz pit shell, but reported at a $1 000 oz cut-off grade of 0.87g t. Stockpile ore reserves are reported at $1 000 oz cut-off grade of 0.85g t. TSF ore reserves are reported at a $1 000 oz cut-off grade of 0.50g t. Ore reserves were calculated by Mr Shaun Gillespie, an officer of the company and competent person.
3 Attributable gold Moz refers to the quantity attributed to Randgold based in its 40% interest in Morila.
Mineral resource and ore reserve numbers are reported as per JORC 2012 and as such reported to the second significant digit.

Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 42 Pit 4S pushback project Processing, plant During 2014, the pit 4S pushback mining operation Processing continued with waste stripping and ore mining.
Waste was and engineering hauled and dumped in both Pit4N and Pit5, the designated In 2014, the throughput rate decreased to 402tph from in-pit dumping areas, while ore was fed to the plant.
Tonnes 436tph in 2013, after taking the SAG mill offline in July 2013, mined of 18.4Mt was 8% above plan.
This included 1.0Mt as per the business plan.
The milling and crushing circuits at 2.26g t of ore and 17.4Mt of waste material.
Ore grade were reconfigured along with an upgraded three stage mined was lower than plan due to the low grade gains crushing plant.
The current oxygenation plant production is achieved during the year and the inability to achieve the plan sustaining the recovery rate despite the lower grade ore in the final quarter of the year due to flooding of the pit.
This, however, will result in more ore being available for mining in processed.
The installation of a new oxygen unit including the Aachen TSF project reactors, designed to improve recovery rates as well as cyanide consumption during the TSF treatment, is expected In 2014, the TSF project model and feasibility study were to be completed early in 2015. updated to reflect a selective mining approach.

Further progress was made on the agribusiness feasibility projects as highlighted later.
This aims to: Provide an alternative income source to former mineworkers and the surrounding communities: Contribute towards ensuring food security in the community and the country: Promote local economic development: and Improve the communitys economic welfare.
The poultry project comprises 7 000 laying chickens in a facility which has the capacity to house 10 000 chickens.
Six new fish ponds have been constructed to breed tilapia in addition to the seven existing tilapia ponds.
One test floating cage has been installed in the Morila fresh water dam and an additional 11 floating cages are planned.
The focus is on: Expanding the current poultry project: Expanding the current fish project: Expanding the current mango project: Establishing a honey producing unit with a partner: Establishing a juice pulp producing unit with a partner: Investigating the possibility of ecotourism with a partner: Establishing greenhouse tomato production with a partner: and Improving community food production.
