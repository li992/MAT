It consists of a group of both in the oxide and sulphide zones, and converting inferred resources volcanic hosted epithermal veins, including the famous Veta Madre into the indicated category.
This information is being used to prepare a vein, which is mineralised along 12 kilometres reaching widths up to preliminary economic assessment that is expected to be concluded in the 40 metres.
The Fresnillo holdings in this district comprise several areas first half of 2015, and then become a pre-feasibility study once detailed currently under exploration: the two most advanced are Opulencia and La engineering has been completed in 2016.
The consideration for these Gloria, where collectively 24,460 metres of surface diamond drilling was assessments is an 8,000 tpd mine with a dynamic leaching processing performed in 2014, and La Joya.
facility, focusing in the higher grade zones of the total 8.7 million At Opulencia, which forms part of the central and northwesternmost ouncesof gold resources.
extension of the La Luz silver-gold vein system, over 1.5 kilometres along strike has been drilled, defining an ore shoot of 800 by 350 metres, with widths up to 8 metres.
During 2014, environmental and permitting work, as well as partial surface land acquisition, took place: limited infill drilling was carried out.
At La Gloria, which lies east of the Veta Madre vein, several new ore shoots averaging widths of 1.5 metres were discovered in 2014 by drillingin the Calicanto, El Hallazgo and San Gregorio veins.
At La Joya, a newly discovered emerging sub-district located about 20kilometres southeast of the Guanajuato District, 15,010 metres of drilling were carried out and mineralisation remains open along strike.
