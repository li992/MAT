This means working closely with each project to deliver the returns expected at the time of investment.

Not only does this allow swift response times and decision making, but also ensures consistency through acquisition to ownership and enables a smooth transition for its clients.
Enhance In addition to delivering the base yield from the Portfolio, JLIF aims to generate growth over and above that which arises from the simple unwind of the discount rate.
By drawing on its wealth of experience in infrastructure asset and fund management, JLIF aims to identify and deliver enhancements to cash ows at both a project and portfolio level.

Similarly, the experience of the portfolio management team is used to good effect when identifying, pricing and negotiating new acquisitions.
Develop JLIF works hard to create new acquisition opportunities both within the Portfolio and in the market.
JLIFs opportunities for growth come from four main avenues, the first two of which, deliver support JLIFs pipeline: 1 Acquisition of co-shareholdings: 2 First Offer Agreements: 3 The creation of non-competitive bidding opportunities in the UK and overseas via its network of relationships: and enhance develop 4 The competitive secondary market.
In selecting opportunities and subsequently submitting an offer for an asset or portfolio, JLIF robustly tests the deliverability of the forecast future cash ows assumed in the valuation and ensures that its acquisitions add long term value to the Fund.
