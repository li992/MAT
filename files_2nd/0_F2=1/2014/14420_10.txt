All volumes beyond this scope of development activities are being RESERVES AND CONTINGENT For TGT the re-classification of reserves into classified as contingent.
The range of reserves Contingent Resources reflects the fact that there and Contingent Resources volumes continue RESOURCES EVALUATION is not yet agreement among JOC partners on to capture managements view of the full potential the scope of development activities and level of the TGT field.
The estimates are grounded in Against the background of lower oil prices of investment following the current FDP and H5 the results of the ERCE Dynamic Simulation and the resultant uncertainty around the scope FDP approved wells, all of which will be drilled Model and the current field performance and and timing of future development activities, in 2015.
SOCO has estimated reserves assuming reflect the degree of uncertainty around the in particular due to partner reluctance to commit the drilling of only existing approved and a small oil-in-place estimates.
to additional capital expenditures, we have revised down the 2P reserves estimates for our TGT FIELD OIL-IN-PLACE ESTIMATES portfolio, with a portion being re-classified into P90 P50 P10 Contingent Resources.
