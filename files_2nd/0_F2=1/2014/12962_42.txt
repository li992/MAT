Due to the structural complexity of the Tongon SZ, it is believed that the model can be upgraded, and with the mine being supplied by low cost gridpower, particularly where the drill spacing is relatively wide at depth.
a number of low grade opportunities around the deposit can provide optionality to the operation.
Four satellite The drilling intersected zones of intense alteration targets within 10km of the Tongon deposit were further associated with strong sulphides and occurrences of drill tested during the year.

In addition to the work mineralisation was stronger or wider than the existing at Sekala, further modelling of the Seydou S, Seydou N model and additional mineralisation was intersected on and Tongon E targets to determine their potential was structures outside the current model, all pointing to the completed.

Therefore, no further work is suggested at this target.
Skarn Tongon was identified as a skarn gold deposit in 2013 and well-developed spatial and temporal mineral zonation patterns, typical of gold skarns, are evident in both the SZ and NZ.
Zonation is classified based on garnet: pyroxene ratios, chemistry of the major calc-silicate phases, the skarn colour and grain size, and the degree of retrograde replacement epidote-clinozosite, prehnite-pumpellyite.
Relogging of the Tongon orebody was completed to create a detailed model of the skarn system, which can be used to improve the resource estimate through the modelling of the alteration and garnet fronts as well as for exploration targeting around the pit.
Skarn mineral zonation could be useful as a mineralisation vector, as gold is largely confined to the intermediate skarn zone at Tongon.
