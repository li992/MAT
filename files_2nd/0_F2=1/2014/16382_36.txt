DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED At the outset of the 2012-2014 performance period, the Committee set demanding performance ranges for the long-term incentive plans, as shown in the table above.
Over the past three years, Unilever has delivered very strong financial performance against these ranges.
Underlying sales growth during the period was 4.7% per annum and core operating margin improvement of 0.37 percentage points per annum over the period demonstrate managements commitment to delivering consistent top and bottom line growth.
Unilever has also generated very strong operating cash flow of 15.5 billion over the period.
Total shareholder return over the period was below the performance of our peers, consequently no part of this element of the award will vest.
The Committee considers that these outcomes are a fair reflection of Unilevers performance over the period and determined that GSIP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2012 will vest at 121% of the initial award level ie 61% of maximum.
The Committee also determined that MCIP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2012 will vest at 121% of initial award levels vesting capped at 150% ie 81% of maximum awards.
The 2011 GSIP performance shares figure, included in the single figure remuneration in respect of 2013, has been restated to reflect the actual number of shares that vested and the market value of the shares on the date of vesting of 14 March 2014 PLC 23.69 and NV 27.70 and have been translated into euros using the exchange rate on the date of vesting: 1 0.8351.
The figure included in the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report was estimated based on the average share price for the period from 1 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 as the vesting date was post the publication of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
The actual values at the vesting date were: Paul Polman 3,798,141 estimated as 3,849,000 and Jean-Marc Hut 2,630,022 estimated as 2,665,000.
F CONDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION AUDITED CEO: Paul Polman Conditional supplemental pension provision agreed with Paul Polman on hiring, which is conditional on his remaining in employment with Unilever to age 60 and subsequently retiring from active service or his death or total disability prior to retirement.
CFO: Jean-Marc Hut Jean-Marc Hut does not receive a conditional supplemental pension.
G SHARE INCENTIVES DUTCH LAW REQUIREMENT AUDITED As per the Dutch requirements, these costs are non-cash costs and relate to the expenses recognised for the period following IFRS 2.
This is based on share prices on grant dates, a 98% adjustment factor for GSIP shares and MCIP matching shares awarded in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

On 14 February 2014, the CEO invested 60% 949,905 and the CFO invested 25% 186,533 of their 2013 bonus in MCIP investment shares.

b The face values included in this table are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted on 14 February 2014 by the share price on that day of PLC 23.49 and NV 27.70 respectively, assuming maximum performance and therefore maximum vesting of 200% for GSIP and 150% for MCIP and then translating into sterling using an average exchange rate over 2014 of 1 0.8071. c The actual targets for the three business-focused performance measures for the 2014 MCIP and GSIP awards have not been disclosed up front as the Boards deem this to be commercially sensitive information as targets could reveal information about Unilevers business plan and budgeting process to competitors, which could be damaging to Unilevers business interests and therefore to shareholders.
Targets will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report following the end of the relevant performance period.
MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHARE INTERESTS UNAUDITED The table below shows the Executive Directors share ownership against the minimum shareholding requirements as at 31 December 2014 and the interest in NV and PLC ordinary shares of Executive Directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2014.
When calculating an Executive Directors personal shareholding the following methodology is used: Base salary at the date of measurement.
Shares in either Unilever PLC or Unilever N. V. or a combination of both will qualify provided they are personally owned by the Executive Director or by a member of his immediate family connected person.
Shares purchased under the MCIP from the annual bonus will qualify as from the moment of purchase as these are held in the individuals name and are not subject to further restrictions.
Shares acquired under a restricted stock arrangement will qualify on a net of tax basis.
Shares awarded on a conditional basis by way of the GSIP, or the MCIP, will not qualify until the moment of vesting ie once the precise number of shares is fixed after the three-year vesting period has elapsed.
The shares will be valued on the date of measurement, or if that outcome fails the personal shareholding test, on the date of acquisition.
The share price for the relevant measurement date will be based on the average closing share prices and the euro sterling US dollar exchange rates from the 60 calendar days prior to the measurement date.
Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of 100% of their shareholding requirement for 12 months post cessation of employment at Unilever, and 50% of these shares for 24 months post cessation of employment with Unilever.
All ULE members are required to build a shareholding of 300% of base salary.
This requirement is 150% of base salary for the Top 100 management layer below ULE.
