Cash Flow EBITDA increased 11% during the year reflecting strong trading conditions and good performance.
While the business grew over 2014, working capital was tightly managed and ended the year broadly unchanged.
Net interest paid decreased in the year to $5.6m from $6.5m in 2013 reflecting lower average net debt.
Tax paid in the year increased by $6.7m to $26.6m from $19.9m in 2013 due to higher taxable profits, an increase in rates and because 2013 benefited from a shielding effect of losses brought forward.
Replacement capital investment increased 54% to $69.0m in 2014 2013 $44.8m and included $25.4m on the new Houma facility, which replaces other sites.
Other key components included $19.2m on drilling tools and rental equipment and $16.4m on machinery and equipment.
Exploration and production capital investments totalled $7.0m during the year as contractually committed wells were drilled by the units business partners.
Other operating cash and non cash movements at $9.9m were $14.4m favourable to 2013.
This reflected higher adjustments for losses on the sale of plant, equipment and machinery, higher share based payment charges with the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan being replaced with the Hunting PSP, and higher pension charges.
As a result of the above investments, free cash flow increased by $36.7m to $182.3m in the year 2013 $145.6m.
Expansion capital investment during 2014 reached $54.5m 2013 $50.0m as the Groups internal capital investment programme progressed.
The Group incurred $23.0m on its new premium threading and test facility at Houston, Texas, $3.7m on the new regional facility in Cape Town, $9.7m on drilling tools and rental equipment, $12.9m on machinery and equipment and $3.1m at Hunting Dearborn.
Other expansion capital investments totalled $2.1m.
Total dividend payments of $46.6m were paid, with $2.5m of this relating to non-controlling interests.
The $44.1m paid to equity shareholders reflected the payment of the final dividend for 2013 of 21.8 cents 12.9 pence and the 2014 interim dividend of 8.1 cents 5.1 pence.
All dividends will continue to be declared in cents, with a Sterling equivalent paid, following a formal process of conversion.
The final dividend for 2014 is proposed at 22.9 cents, and, if approved by shareholders, is expected to result in an outflow of $33.7m.
During 2014 the Group paid $3.0m being the final payment on the Specialty Supply acquisition, which together with other cash inflows of $0.2m and foreign exchange movements of $3.0m resulted in a net cash inflow from continuing operations of $75.4m.
Within discontinued operations, an inflow of $3.9m following the settlement of a loan note from Field Aviation and the return of unutilised environmental escrow funds together with other cash inflows of $0.2m, were broadly offset by cashflow movements within Gibson Shipbrokers.
Therefore, net debt reduced by $74.8m during 2014 to end the year with a net debt position of $131.0m 2013 $205.8m.
