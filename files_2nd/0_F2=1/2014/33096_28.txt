The Groups net deferred tax at 31 March 2014 was nil 2013: nil.
This consists of a deferred tax liability of nil 2013: nil and a deferred tax asset of nil 2013: nil in respect of sundry short-term differences.
A deferred tax asset of 10.1 million based on a 20% tax rate, mainly relating to tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2014 and deferred tax arising in respect of contingent share awards and the convertible bond, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits will arise against which these losses can be offset.
As a REIT, the Group is largely exempt from corporation tax in respect of its rental profits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will not be subject to corporation tax, it will have a low tax charge over the coming years.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests including a minimum distribution test must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.

The total fees, including the fee for this assignment, earned by CBRE or other companies forming part of the same group of companies within the UK from the Group is less than 5.0% of total UK revenues.
The principal signatories of the CBRE valuation reports have continuously been the signatories of valuations for the same addressee and valuation purpose as this report since 2012.
CBRE has continuously been carrying out valuation instructions for the Group for in excess of 20 years.
CBRE has carried out Valuation, Agency and Professional services on behalf of the Group for in excess of 20 years.
Real estate valuations are complex and derived using comparable market transactions which are not publicly available and involve an element of judgement.
Therefore, in line with EPRA guidance, we have classified the valuation of the property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Inputs to the valuation, including capitalisation yields typically the true equivalent yield and rental values, are defined as unobservable as defined by IFRS 13.
Key inputs to the valuation ERV True equivalent yield Average Range Average Range per sq ft per sq ft % % North of Oxford Street Office 60 7 82 4.6 3.9 5.3 Retail 53 18 162 4.7 3.9 6.3 Rest of West End Office 55 30 86 4.8 4.3 6.0 Retail 82 15 204 4.4 3.9 5.5 City, Midtown & Southwark Office 44 34 59 5.4 4.8 5.5 Retail 28 23 45 5.6 4.8 5.7 Capital value Average Range per sq ft per sq ft Residential 1,767 200 1,850 n a n a Everything else being equal, there is a positive relationship between rental values and the property valuation, such that an increase in rental values will increase the valuation of a property and vice versa.
However, the relationship between capitalisation yields and the property valuation is negative: therefore an increase in capitalisation yields will reduce the valuation of a property and vice versa.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are determined by market conditions and the valuation movement in any one period depends on the balance between them.
If these inputs move in opposite directions i. e. rental values increase and yields decrease valuation movements can be amplified whereas if they move in the same direction they may offset reducing the overall net valuation movement.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had capital commitments of 54.4 million 2013: 48.9 million.
At 31 March 2014, properties with a carrying value of 311.9 million 2013: 278.9 million were secured under the first mortgage debenture stock see note 17.

The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third-party guarantees as a means of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 15 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversified range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock, private placement notes, convertible bonds and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated, as a result the Groups policy is to have no unhedged assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas transactions is fully hedged through foreign currency derivatives to create a synthetic sterling exposure.
132 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2014 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 18 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash flow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversified across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facilities.
The availability of these facilities depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with these covenants are set out in the table below: March 2014 Key covenants Covenant actuals Group Net debt net equity 1.25x 0.30x Inner borrowing unencumbered asset value unsecured borrowings 1.66x 3.43x Interest cover 1.35x 4.32x The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 488.0 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result the directors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing at the balance sheet date: Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash flows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2014 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 % debenture stock 2029 144.1 262.0 8.0 8.0 24.1 221.9 8 Other loan 2.6 2.6 2.6 Bank loans revolving credit facilities 11.0 13.4 0.3 13.1 Private placement notes 286.2 359.1 13.0 13.2 146.5 186.4 150.0 million 1.00% convertible bonds 2018 161.3 156.6 1.5 1.5 153.6 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swaps 18.3 2.4 0.5 0.4 1.1 0.4 Interest rate floor note 15 0.8 1.5 1.5 622.7 794.6 24.4 36.2 325.3 408.7 Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash flows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2013 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 % debenture stock 2029 144.1 270.1 8.0 8.0 24.1 230.0 8 Bank loans revolving credit facilities 234.1 250.6 5.4 5.4 239.8 Other loan 0.9 0.9 0.9 Private placement notes 286.1 372.3 13.0 13.0 39.6 306.7 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swaps 2.6 2.8 0.5 0.5 1.1 0.7 Interest rate swap 0.1 0.1 0.1 Interest rate floor note 15 3.8 4.6 3.1 1.5 658.9 892.2 23.9 26.3 304.6 537.4 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2014 133 18 Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing financial instruments.
It is the risk that future cash flows arising from a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy to eliminate interest rate risk in respect of the cash flows arising from its debt finance either through the use of fixed rate debt or through the use of interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps and floors.
It is the Groups usual policy to maintain the proportion of floating interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total debt.
However, this target is flexible, and may not be adhered to at all times depending on, for example, the Groups view of future interest rate movements.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps enable the Group to exchange its floating rate interest payments on its bank debt for fixed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a fixed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate floors Under the terms of an interest rate floor, one party the seller makes a payment to the other party the buyer if an underlying interest rate is below a specified rate.
The Group has bought an interest rate floor, which, when combined with its fixed rate private placement notes raised in 2011, gives rise to the same economic effect as purchasing an interest rate cap in respect of floating rate debt.
Put option A put option is a contract between two parties to exchange an asset at a specified price by a set date.
The Group has a 12.5% holding in The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership and has a put option to enable it to sell its net investment to Brookfield Properties Corporation for 15.8 million in October 2014.
The value of the option will only be greater than a nominal amount in the event that the value of the underlying investment is impaired below its cost.
Therefore, the value of the underlying investment together with the put option total the 15.8 million put option price.
Cross currency swaps Cross currency swaps enable the Group to exchange receipts or payments denominated in currencies other than sterling for receipts or payments denominated in sterling.
Such contracts allow the Group to eliminate foreign exchange risk arising from fluctuating exchange rates between sterling and other currencies.

Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors Statement on page 107 that the Group is a going concern.
We confirm that: we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate: and we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.

Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2014 141 The Audit Committees consideration of these risks is set out on page 80.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 25 million, which is below 2% of equity.
In addition to net assets, we consider EPRA Profit Before Tax to be a critical financial performance measure for the Group and we applied a lower threshold of 2 million based on 5% of that measure for testing of all balances impacting this financial performance measure.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 0.5 million, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
The Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior Statutory Auditor.
The audit is performed centrally, as the books and records for each entity within the Group are maintained at head office.
We also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information.
We audit all of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures which are subject to audit at statutory materiality level, which in most cases is substantially lower than Group materiality.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit: or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
