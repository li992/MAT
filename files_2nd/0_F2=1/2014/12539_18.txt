Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements 121 Share buyback Subject to applicable law and appropriate authority being granted by shareholders in a General Meeting, the directors have the power to authorise the market purchase of the companys shares.
At the 2014 AGM, shareholders authorised the directors to make market purchases up to a maximum of approximately 15 per cent of the companys issued share capital being 9,900,821 in nominal value excluding treasury shares.
Any shares purchased under this authority may either be cancelled or may be held as treasury shares provided that the number of shares held does not exceed 10 per cent of issued share capital.
The minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is an amount equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share.
The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of i an amount equal to 5 per cent above the average of the closing mid-market price of an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase, and ii that stipulated by Article 5 1 of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation, Commission Regulation EC of 22 December 2003.
On 27 February 2014, the company announced its intention to initiate a share buyback programme of an amount up to 75.0m, to be reviewed by the Board on a quarterly basis.
The rationale for the programme was that the excess capital available, over and above the long-run model assumption based at US$85 bbl, should be returned to shareholders by way of a buyback programme, and should be continued whilst shares in the company continued to trade at a discount to Net Asset Value.
By the end of the third quarter of the buyback programme, the oil price had decreased significantly such that model assumptions were re-visited and scaled downwards.
In light of the uncertainty of the oil price near-term direction and impact on expenditure, the Board agreed that the programme should be put on hold with the situation to be revisited later in 2015.
During 2014, 18,455,248 ordinary shares were repurchased by the company and cancelled, representing 3.61 per cent of the companys issued share capital as at 31 December 2014.
The nominal value of the shares purchased as at 31 December 2014 was 2,306,906 and the aggregate amount of consideration paid by the company for those shares was 55,730,484.
In December, a decision was taken by the Board to postpone the buyback programme pending a recovery in the oil price.
As at 31 December 2014, the remaining authority outstanding for the company to make market purchases of its own shares, under the shareholders resolution of 14 May 2014, stood at an aggregate nominal value of up to 7,593,915.
