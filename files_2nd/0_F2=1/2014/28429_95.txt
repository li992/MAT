From April 2014, all UK based employees were able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of 150 per month from their gross salary partnership shares through the SIP.

Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.
The table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with Matching Shares awarded on a 1:4 basis and dividend shares.
