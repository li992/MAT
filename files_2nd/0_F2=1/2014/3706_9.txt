Mission Systems LEADING CAPABILITIES IN AERIAL REFUELLING AND SURVIVAL SYSTEMS FOR EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS State of the art aerial refuelling test facility Cobhams state of the art aerial refuelling test facility provides the crucial function of testing the performance of Cobhams refuelling pods which are being developed for the latest generation of tanker aircraft.
It provides a realistic simulation in which pods can be tested in a in-flight environment with their hoses fully trailed.
