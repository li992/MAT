Underlying revenue growth rates also exclude the effects of exhibition cycling.
Constant currency growth rates are based on 2013 full year average and hedge exchange rates.
The underlying growth in revenue and in adjusted operating profit are the key performance indicators used by the Group in assessing performance.
