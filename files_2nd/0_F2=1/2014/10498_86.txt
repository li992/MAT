Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report.
The most significant risks and the Groups related management and mitigating actions are set out on pages 30 to 33.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements.
Mondis geographical spread, product diversity and large customer base mitigate potential risks of customer or supplier liquidity issues.
Ongoing initiatives by management in implementing profit improvement initiatives which include ongoing investment in its operations, plant optimisation, cost-cutting, and restructuring and rationalisation activities have consolidated the Groups leading cost position in its chosen markets.
Working capital levels and capital expenditure programmes are strictly monitored and controlled.
The Group meets its funding requirements from a variety of sources as more fully described in notes 18 and 29 of the financial statements.
The availability of some of these facilities is dependent on the Group meeting certain financial covenants all of which have been complied with.
Mondi had 456 million of undrawn committed debt facilities as at 31 December 2014 which should provide sufficient liquidity in the medium term.
The Groups debt facilities have maturity dates of between 1 and 11 years, with a weighted average maturity of four years.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, including an assessment of the current macroeconomic environment indicate that the Group should be able to operate well within the level of its current facilities and related covenants.

After making such enquiries, the directors are satisfied that the Group remains solvent and has adequate liquidity in order to meet its obligations and continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
