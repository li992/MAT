Around Gounkoto, several targets were tested and Higher grades are localised at the intersections of these rejected from the resource triangle.
The team returned to the old Toronto target which has remained in the structures, a relationship which has also been observed resource triangle over many years due to its structural at P64 and MZ3 at Gounkoto.
However, most of the complexity and high grade results from shallow orpaillage target is very narrow with artisanal miners targeting high workings.
The work highlighted a 2km long anomalous grade vein related mineralisation along the full strike.
