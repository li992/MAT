Total equivalent refined platinum production decreased by 21% to 1.84million ounces 2013: 2.32 million ounces.
The decline in production was primarily owing to the impact of the strike, which commenced on 23 January and ended on 24 June, and affected all of Platinums managed underground mines.
This resulted in a steep fall in output from Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines and a loss of 424,000 ounces of platinum.
The build up to steady state production in the third quarter resulted in a further loss of 108,000 ounces, bringing the total strike related impact to 532,000 ounces.
