Isiro Kilo Goldmines JV Randgold has entered into a JV with a subsidiary of Kilo Goldmines Limited Kilo Goldmines in the DRC.
This 2 provides Randgold with access to 1 920km of prospective Archaen age geology over the Northern Ngayu and Isiro greenstone belts in NE DRC Kilo Goldmines JV.
Work 10km on both belts continued through the year.
Ngayu belt is haematite rich in the ESE and more magnetite rich in Work this season has progressed the Yambeda Yasua, the WNW possibly reflecting the lateral facies changed Bonzuzu and Mbese targets, with results from Yambenda in the environment or possible demagnetisation along confirming the regional soil results, revealing a 9.6km the structure.
Litho sampling has returned values up to WNW trending 50ppb anomaly including seven pods of 1.71g t in the BIF.
100ppb measuring up to 750m x 300m in strike.
The anomaly sits in residual soils overlying a WNW trending The results from an infill pitting programme over the target ridge of banded iron formation.
The banded iron formation have identified a wide anomalous corridor beneath the Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 90
