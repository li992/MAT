The IMF predicts this growth trend will continue, with Emerging Markets share of GDP expected to rise by 0.7% per year over the next five years from the current base of 50.4% PPP adjusted.
This would be an acceleration from the average annual growth rate achieved over the past three decades, a period of profound development across Emerging Markets, and is a view supported by powerful structural drivers of economic, political and social development Against this backdrop of Emerging Markets rising global economic influence, investors perceptions and allocations to the asset class continue to lag the rapid fundamental advances.
This provides Ashmore with a substantial growth opportunity as investors address underweight positions.
