Capability development We aim to equip our staff with the skills needed to run safe and efficient operations.
Our OMS capability development programmes cover areas such as process safety, risk, and safety leadership.
Our applied deepwater well control course uses simulator facilities to train key members of rig teams, including contractors.
We have conducted more than 35 classes for rig crews from around the world since the course began in October 2012.
Security and crisis management The scale and spread of BPs operations means we must prepare for a range of business disruptions and emergency events.
BP monitors for, and aims to guard against, hostile actions that could cause harm to our people or disrupt our operations, including physical and digital threats and vulnerabilities.
We also maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans and work to build day-to-day response capabilities to support local management of incidents.
