Adjusted earnings per share was 17.54 pence, a decrease of 12.8% year-on-year, reflecting lower adjusted operating profit primarily due to the cessation of equity accounting for VZW from 2 September 2013, partially offset by a reduction in shares in issue arising from the Groups share buyback programme.
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 42.10pence 2013: loss of 15.66 pence primarily due to the recognition of the additional deferred tax assets in the current year.
