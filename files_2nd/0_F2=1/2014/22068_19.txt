Chairman and non-executive directors The table below sets out each component of the Chairmans and the non-executive directors remuneration and the approach taken by the company in relation thereto.
Component Approach Chairmans and non-executive The Chairmans fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee and the non-executive directors fees directors fees are set by the board.
These are reviewed periodically taking into account the responsibilities and time commitments required and non-executive director fee levels generally.
The Chairman receives an annual fee, which includes his basic non-executive directors fee, but does not receive any other remuneration.
Non-executive directors receive basic fees, which are subject to an annual limit for non-executive directors ordinary remuneration contained in the articles of association, currently 350,000.
In addition, special fees are paid for the chairmanship and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and also for the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and chairman of the Governance Committee.
The fees of the Chairman and the non-executive directors on implementation of the policy will be as follows: Chairman 184,500 Basic non-executive directors fee 39,900 Audit Committee chairman 5,600 Audit Committee member 2,300 Remuneration Committee chairman 4,900 Remuneration Committee member 1,600 Senior Independent Director Governance Committee chairman 5,100 Additional fees payable for Exceptionally, non-executive directors may receive fees from group companies for services services to other group provided to them.
The Hon C W Cayzer receives such a fee, currently 60,000, for his chairmanship companies of the Sloane Club, a position which he held as an executive director of Caledonia prior to becoming non-executive.
Fees for services provided to subsidiary companies are set and reviewed by the boards of those companies, but will not exceed 100,000 per annum in aggregate for any non-executive director.
Other benefits The Chairman and the non-executive directors are all covered under the companys directors and officers liability insurance policy and have the benefit of an indemnity under the companys articles of association.
The Chairman is also provided with an office and some secretarial support.
The company may, where appropriate, pay for the cost of spouses accompanying non-executive directors on trips where there is a business reason for doing so and reimburse non-executive directors for hotel accommodation and travel expenses in each case including payment of any tax thereon.
