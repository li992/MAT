Claims reserving Admirals reserving policy both within the claims function and in the financial statements is initially to reserve conservatively, above internal and independent projections of ultimate loss ratios.
This is designed to create a margin held in reserves to allow for unforeseen adverse development in open claims and typically results in Admiral making above industry average reserve releases.
Admirals booked claims reserves continue to include a significant margin above projected best estimates of ultimate claims costs.
As profit commission income is recognised in the income statement in line with loss ratios accounted for on Admirals own claims reserves, the reserving policy also results in profit commission income being deferred and released over time.
