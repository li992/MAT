Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Acquire Acquisitions are a key strategic investment which strengthen our product portfolio, add new technologies, deepen our management talent pool and extend our geographical reach.
They help us to sustain growth and highreturns and create shareholder value over the long term.
Our strategy is to buy companies with technology we understand selling into markets we know.
They must fit well with our operating culture and growth strategy, in addition to having strong financial metrics.
As a highly cash-generative business with a strong balancesheet, we can invest in acquisitions without accumulating excessive debt.
We acquired Medicel in 2011 to extend our presence in the ophthalmic surgical instrument market.
Since acquisition, Medicel has benefited from significant capital investment in equipment.
Halma has also supported Medicels development of current and new technologies.
In May 2014 we acquired Plasticspritzerei, a close commercial partner since Medicels inception, which secured important manufacturing know-how and will be operated by Medicels management.
