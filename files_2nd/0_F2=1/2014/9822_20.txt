In recent years we have achieved considerable reductions in energy usage by replacing all the lighting in the public areas of our managed and franchised pubs with LED lighting.
Water usage has been significantly reduced by installing water management systems in our managed pubs, and we are now rolling the same systems out across our franchised estate.
We continue to aim to increase the percentage of waste being recycled 2014: 80.2% 2013: 79.1% and have signed up to WRAPs Food and Hospitality Agreement to increase the amount of food recycling to 70% by the end of 2015.
Currently 319 of our managed pubs recycle food waste 2013: 290.
In 2014 we made real time reporting of our energy consumption available for our pub managers and their area managers to track energy consumption by pub against targets.
The system provides a continually refreshed dashboard on energy consumption compared to the expected level, by hour, day and week.
