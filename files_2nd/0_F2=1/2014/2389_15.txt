Strategic report Committing to the future The Gulf of Mexico is one of four key areas where we believe further growth in higher-margin barrels is possible.
As the regions leading acreage holder and largest investor for the last 10 years, BP has focused its activities on this important location for many years.
Our four deepwater production platforms Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Mad Dog and Na Kika are all in the early stages of their life cycles.
These major hubs offer long-term growth opportunities for BP and we aim to optimize production from them, as well as from our non-operated hubs.
In 2014 we made significant progress on a multi-billion dollar investment programme by starting up three major projects in the region.
Na Kika Phase 3 began oil production from our first well in February: our Atlantis North Expansion Phase 2 development started up in April with the first of four planned production wells: and with technical input and support from our experts, Shell-operated Mars B started up in February.
We also entered a strategic partnership with Chevron in January 2015 to explore and develop Paleogene assets, combining our subsurface expertise with Chevrons Paleogene development design and build experience.
Our progress highlights the potential of our portfolio to unlock value for investors while also delivering vital energy resources to the US.
We are strengthening our portfolio of higher-value and longer-life assets.
