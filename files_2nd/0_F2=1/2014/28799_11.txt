Investment Policy The Companys Corporate Objective is: to deliver long-term capital growth, while preserving shareholders capital: to invest without the constraints of a formal benchmark, but to deliver for shareholders increases in capital value in excess of the relevant indices over time.
The Companys Investment Policy is: to invest in a widely diversified, international portfolio across a range of asset classes, both quoted and unquoted: to allocate part of the portfolio to exceptional managers in order to ensure access to the best external talent available.
Asset Allocation and Risk Diversification The Board continues to allocate the Groups assets across a diversified range of asset classes, geographies, industries and currencies.
There are no external restrictions on the allocation of assets.
The portfolio is further diversified through the use of external managers with different mandates.
Exposures are monitored and managed by JRCM under the supervision of the Board.
Gearing The Company maintains structural gearing principally through credit facilities.
At 31 December 2014, the Sterling equivalent of the drawn indebtedness was 402.9 million, representing net gearing calculated in accordance with AIC guidance of 15.4%.
The maximum indebtedness that the Company is empowered to incur under its Articles of Association is five times its adjusted capital and reserves.
Further information is shown under Debt and Leverage on page 11.
Investment Management Fees Fee structures within the long-only equity funds, whether structured as segregated accounts or otherwise, typically involve a 1% per annum management fee and in some cases a relative performance fee.
The hedged equity funds are slightly higher typically a 1% to 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee.
Private equity fees are structured differently and will usually have a 1% to 2% annual charge, often based on commitments in early years and declining over time with realisations, as well as a 20% carried interest above an 8% hurdle.

Active intervention appropriate for the circumstances will be considered where it is in the Companys best interests.
The Company does not publish its voting record as it invests as principal rather than agent.
Cross Holdings The UKLA Listing Rules also require closed-ended investment companies to disclose quarterly all of their investments in other listed closed-ended investment funds... which themselves do not have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds.
The Group discloses such investments when necessary, but does not restrict its own investment policies in this manner.
