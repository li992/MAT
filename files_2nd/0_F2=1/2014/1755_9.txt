Working in collaboration with others Teamwork between Babcock, Volvo CE and our customer Multipit allowed us to help revolutionise commercial forestry planting in South Africa.
Combining an excavator with protected software, we have created a machine that digs and GPS registers planting pits.
This technology is used to generate 3D maps, helping to create an energy ef cient, highly productive and cost effective planting and harvesting programme.

In the power generation market we hope to continue to extend our support service operations.
After two years of limited activity in the powerline market, we are encouraged by recent wins and believe the shortage of lines to and from new power stations will give us further opportunities to grow.
In addition, we continue to identify new opportunities where we can build on Group expertise in new markets for the division.
Critical powerlines support in South Africa Working in close collaboration with the primary contractor, KEC, Babcock helped Eskom meet its 2013 2014 commitments for kilometres of transmission lines built as well as million volt-amperes of substations.
Working to tight deadlines in December 2013 and January 2014, we were responsible for the construction of 100 giant 765 kV towers and stringing 15 km of line.
Despite the signi cant challenges posed by working during the industry shutdown period in dif cult terrain and a remote site, an innovative resourcing approach coupled with a target incentive scheme delivered outstanding results.
Utilising our South African cranes business, Babcock completed the work on time, exceeding the clients and Eskoms expectations.
