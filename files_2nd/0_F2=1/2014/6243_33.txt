com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Performance What we said we would do in 2014 Key developments in the year Annual gold production decreased 3.4% from 2013 as a result of the Continue optimising milling capacity to reach 4,000 tpd by year end expected lower ore grade that reflected the depletion of higher gold Evaluate and initiate construction on milling capacity expansion to 5,000 tpd ore grades and wider stopes, as well as higher dilution.
These effects Conclude engineering and initiate construction of the third tailings dam were partially mitigated by an increase in ore processed, resulting from the optimisation of the milling process via the addition of a tertiary Continue exploration of the Cebollitas cluster with direct mine crusher, increased pumping capacity and longer residence time at the development work flotation tanks.
Initiate mine development at Rosario-Las Casas Silver production decreased 3.9% with lower ore grades resulting from increased dilution due to narrower veins at San Ramn.
However, this What we did in 2014 effect was partly mitigated by an increase in ore processed.
Optimised milling capacity to reach 4,000 tpd As expected, average gold ore grade decreased in the year, from 2.9 g t in 2013 to 2.6 g t 10.3%, and silver ore grade fell 10.7% to 108.5 g t. Initiated evaluation of the expansion at different capacity levels The average gold ore grade for 2015 is expected to be around 2.1 g t, and Concluded engineering for the tailings dam: applied for the the average silver ore grade around 120 g t. Gold ore grades are expected environmentalpermits to continue declining over time towards the reserve grade of 1.8 g t. Exploration of the Cebollitas cluster continued with a 1.2 kilometres access We continued our exploration of the Cebollitas cluster in the year, with tunnel developed to reach the Taspana vein direct mine development mainly at the Taspana vein, and advanced Mine development advanced at Rosario 95% and Las Casas 50% development at the Rosario-Las Casas areas.
Additional resources were also converted to reserves at the San Ramn vein.
This resulted in a 9.9% Obtained OHSAS 18001 certification and 11.8% increase in gold and silver reserves respectively.
The Cyanide Code certification process is on hold and will resume once Based on the results of our exploration programme and the potential capacity expansion of the plant is complete seen at the Cebollitas cluster, we have decided to defer the expansion, and evaluate the increase in the milling capacity at different levels What we plan to do in 2015 ranging from 5,000 tpd to 6,000 tpd.
This evaluation and engineering Conclude evaluation of the optimal capacity expansion alternatives: are expected to be concluded in 2015, with construction commencing complete engineering and commence construction immediately thereafter.
