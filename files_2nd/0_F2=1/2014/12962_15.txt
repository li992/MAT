Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 47 The geological model for the Southern Zone Mineral resources N MALI BURKINA SZ pit was updated in and ore reserves FASO 2014 with new grade control drilling, advanced grade control and exploration GUINEA data.
The Northern Zone NZ pit model remains the same as the 2011 model.
The 2014 resource update contains 25% more ore tonnes at a 5% higher grade than the 2013 resource model, yielding 32% more ounces.
This difference can primarily be attributed to the significant increase in ore CTE DIVOIRE GHANA volume in 2014 associated with the widening of ore zones LIBERIA and the merging of structures which have increased both the tonnes and grade of the ore zones previously interpreted too thin with depth.
Abidjan The resource gains have resulted in the replacement of open pit ore reserves mined during the year.
Drilling is currently Tongon gold mine underway to further infill drill the remaining portion of the Randgold permits SZ pit to verify whether further gains can be achieved.
A drilling programme is also planned to test the potential 500km for higher grade material immediately below the current $1 000 oz pit design which could potentially extend the pit deeper.
Underground mineral resources are those insitu mineral resources below the NZ, $1 500 oz pit shell reported at a 2.0g t cut-off.
Mineral resources for SZ were generated by Mr Simon Bottoms, an officer of the company and competent person, and for NZ by Mr Babacar Diouf, an officer of the company, and supervised by Mr Jonathan Kleynhans, an officer of the company and competent person.
2 Open pit ore reserves ore reported at a gold price of $1 000 oz and 0.8glt cut-off and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit ore reserves were calculated by Mr Shaun Gillespie, an officer of the company and competent person.

Total ore mined at 3 566kt was 13% below the previous year, mainly as a result of difficulties experienced in mining multiple thin orebody sections, predominantly found in the SZ pit, and controlling dilution.
The strip ratio for the year of 6.3 was up 11% on the prior year, in line with the LoM plan.
SZ pit mining activity centred on hard rock mining ore and waste with an oxide saprolite pushback which started in Q2 2014 in the northern side of the pit.
Mining production improved in the Q2 2014, reducing in the rainy season in Q3 as per plan and picking up once more in Q4.

Although plant availability was attributable to more efficient planned the vibrocone crushers delivered an improvement in maintenance, less controllable downtime stemming from crusher throughput and fineness of crushed product, mechanical failures in the milling circuit and improved power this improvement could not be sustained due to repeated management.
Consequently, it was agreed with the supplier to replace the vibrocone crushers with upgraded Improved maintenance of key recovery related equipment, hydrocone crushers within a new circuit configuration, which such as regeneration kilns, acid wash pumps and the elution was completed in Q4 2014. circuit, also contributed to the overall recovery improvement.
