Over the year, Capco has made positive progress in consolidating its ownership in the area through 51 million of small acquisitions around the Earls Court Masterplan, as referenced in the May 2014 capital raise.
The majority of these acquisitions will be transferred into ECPL upon its completion: they provide the opportunity to enhance the implementation of the early stages of the scheme and are positioned around the masterplan.
In November 2013, Capco exercised its option under the Conditional Land Sale Agreement CLSA, a binding agreement relating to West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates, and to date has paid 30 million of the 105 million cash consideration, the remainder of which is payable in five annual instalments starting in December 2015.
