Performance data As per our reported ambition last year, we have been working hard over the past year to collate and analyse as much sustainability performance data as possible.
92% Table 1 reports our energy and carbon footprint related to the financial year 2013 14.
Table 2 reports a selection of our social performance data as of the end of our carbon emissions arise of the same financial year.

We have chosen to report greenhouse gas emissions under our operational control, rather than financial control: this may mean that the scope of our greenhouse gas emissions disclosure differs from that of the consolidated financial statements.
We have used emissions factors from the UK Government conversion factors for company reporting.
In this disclosure, estimation refers to filling invoice gaps, not to whether invoices are based on estimated or actual readings.
1 Landlord-controlled emissions from our wholly-owned residential portfolio Clerkenwell Quarter, Highbury, Stockwell and Battersea are not included in this disclosure as they are not material to our total carbon footprint represent 2% of total emissions.
Emissions from our joint venture residential property at Moore House are excluded because we were unable to obtain comprehensive data for the reporting period we are working to improve data collection for future reporting, if the data transpires to be materially relevant to our footprint.
2 Scope 1 does not include refrigerant emissions as these have been determined to not be material represent 2% of total emissions : owned fleet does not apply.
3 Scope 3 includes landlord-obtained energy only if sub-metered to tenants, all transmission and distribution losses, and tenant-obtained energy where applicable and tenant provides data.
4 Net income after administrative costs are as reported in these financial statements on page 92.
LondonMetric Property Plc 42 Annual report and accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Performance data continued During 2014 15 we will be developing meaningful energy and carbon performance indicators for each property and asset type, which demonstrate We will be setting energy the energy and carbon intensity of each asset in the most appropriate way, such and carbon reduction that performance can be tracked over time.
Note that the vast majority of our emissions 92% in 2013 14 arise from our office portfolio, with only 8% from our retail targets over the portfolio in the same period.
We will also be setting internal energy and GHG coming year.
reduction targets for the two-year period April 2014 to March 2016, against a 2013 14 baseline.
