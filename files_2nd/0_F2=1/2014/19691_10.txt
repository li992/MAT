18 St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 2014 Strategic Report 0143 Financial Statements 4485 Additional Information 86 Our values in action WE DO WHAT WE SAY The 65 acre Bay Campus site was acquired in 2009 as part of a 2,500 acre portfolio of disused BP sites.
This acquisition made us the largest private owner of brownfield land in South Wales.
Following an intensive remediation programme, we are now transforming this portfolio into a major linked development of which the 450m Bay Campus forms a fundamental part.
It exemplifies our ability to deliver major regeneration schemes to the highest standards, on time and within budget.
Since becoming Swansea Universitys development partner in 2013, we have delivered on our promises and have progressed quickly with the development of the Bay Campus, which comprises circa 1m sq ft of buildings: 465,000 sq ft of academic and R&D space including a new Institute of Structural Materials, Engineering Central, Engineering East, Bay Library, Great Hall and School of Management: and around 500,000 sq ft of student accommodation for 1,142 students, with ancillary retail space and modern facilities to include a gym, sports hall and crche.
In December 2014 we completed the first of the engineering buildings and we are on programme to complete this campus project in time to welcome the new student intake in September 2015.
This 450m project will bring about a positive economic impact for the Swansea Bay City region of about 3bn, with potential for the creation of up to 10,000 jobs across the 10 year lifetime of the project and beyond.
