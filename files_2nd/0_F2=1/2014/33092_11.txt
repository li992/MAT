PROJECTS Over the next few years we look forward to delivering a substantial phased development programme tomeet occupier demand.
Creating well-designed space The Group has increased its development capital expenditure, to both improve the quality of the portfolio and to take advantage of current market conditions.
During the year wecompleted the refurbishment of 107,000 sq ft of office andresidential space, principally at 1-2 Stephen Street W1.
InOctober we completed Queens W2, our first standalone residential project.
It comprises 18,700 sq ft in 16 units and 2,700 sq ft of retail.
Since completion we have sold seven unitsfor 15.7m, and let the retail space.
The completion of the two developments mainly pre-let toPublicis was delayed into 2015.
Turnmill EC1 has now completed, and 40 Chancery Lane WC2 is on track to complete soon.
Together these two properties comprise 172,300 sq ft, and the remaining restaurant and retail spaceisunder offer.
There are two smaller projects due for completion later thisyear.
The first will be the retail scheme at Tottenham Court Walk W1 SIMON SILVER where we are seeking to introduce a more interesting mix of EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR retailers as part of regenerating 1-2 Stephen Street, and to bridge the gap with the higher value space around Tottenham Court Road station and Oxford Street.
In the second half of theyear we altered the scheme to make it more adaptable fora wider range of uses.
However, the changes reduced thenet lettable area by 5% to 38,000 sq ft and our valuers areassuming a lower ERV of 2.3m pa. One restaurant has been let securing 0.3m pa, and we are in negotiations on other units.
The second project set to complete is a residential development at 73 Charlotte Street W1.
This will comprise 11,700 sq ft of private apartments in nine units, as well as 1,900 sq ft of affordable housing and 1,900 sq ft of offices.
The largest project where we are on site is the White Collar Factory EC1.
Demolition finished in August 2014 and the development is due for completion in around 18 months time.
This is a significant development for two reasons.
First, its scale: it has a total estimated cost, including land, ofc.
The commercial element is expected to provide 24.3% an ERV of 14.7m and there are also nine apartments.
increase in value of Second, the development encapsulates our thoughts on development properties whatconstitutes the most attractive space for todays creative businesses.
We have seen that a number of our most successful offices, which have enjoyed resilient demand, 485,000 sq ft arebuildings originally designed for industrial use, such as of projects to TeaBuilding E1, Greencoat and Gordon House SW1 and mostrecently The Buckley Building EC1.
The White Collar commence in 2015 Factory provides new offices in an industrial frame which willgive occupiers robust and flexible space, with above average volume and strong sustainability credentials.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2014 47 fide-RISKING PROJECTS We usually commit to our refurbishment and development projects speculatively.
However, by the time the project is completed, our schemes are typically fully or partially let.
Sometimes this is part of our strategy for a particular project as we believe that occupiers are more likely to commit to buildings that they can see coming out of the ground.
Often it is asaresult of our buildings broad appeal.
These are nottypical pre-lets insofar as we do not have to compensate the incoming tenants with additional incentives.
Over the past five years 78% of our major schemes have been let beforecompletion.
There are many benefits: the risk profile of our pipeline is reduced which enables us to bring forward other projects.
In addition, it means that the property is income producing earlier and that the rates and service charge costs associated with any void period are reduced.
When compared to a six month void period post completion we gained an average of 2.4m per annumof rental income over the past five years and saved 1.7m per annum of void costs, a total positive impact of 20.5m.

Last year we were successful with our planning applications at The Copyright Building W1 and also 25 Savile Row W1.
At the latterwe now have permission to redevelop our head office building into 52,400 sq ft of residential accommodation in 29apartments and 5,600 sq ft of retail space.
However, rising office rents and the relatively higher costs in developing luxury apartments mean that we are still considering our best options FORWARD PLANNING for the building.
We already had planning permission for major schemes at 55-65 North Wharf Road W2 240,000 sq ft and As an important part of our business model, the 1 Oxford Street W1 275,000 sq ft offices, retail and theatre.

time delivery with the market and our overall development programme.
As the business has grown we have created important development clusters notably in Fitzrovia, the Tech Beltand Victoria.
In such cases improvements to one building can have a positive impact on other parts of theportfolio.
Our long-term interests in these areas have allowed us to foster good working relationships with local authorities, and a better understanding of local communities interests.
In Fitzrovia this can be seen in our investment in the Fitzrovia Community Investment Fund, and the fact that we are providing 24,600 sq ft ofaffordable housing including Suffolk House W1.
During 2014 we were successful in securing planning forThe Copyright Building W1 where work has already commenced.
We are replacing three tired adjoining offices in Berners Street W1, with a single purpose-built office building and injecting new retail life at street level.
We also secured consent to convert our own head office at 25 Savile Row W1 into 29 apartments with retail gallery space on the ground floor.
Together these added 163,000 sq ft to our consented potential developments.
In the current year we have applied for planning to redevelop Wedge House to create 110,000 sq ft of hoteland offices.
Securing the appropriate planning at the right time isakey part of our business model.
It enhances our acquisitions, secures our design-led principles, refreshesour portfolio and, in due course, will help tooptimise our income.
