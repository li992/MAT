Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 37 The underground feasibility GOUNKOTO GRADE MODEL Gounkoto study on Gounkoto was completed at the end of the Open pit underground year.
Work on the portal in the project south of the pit is planned to N start in 2018 with access to ore anticipated in 2019.
A rampup in stoping is scheduled for 2020, as the mining in the south of the pit comes to an end.
The mining method proposed comprises longhole open stoping with backfill to support a 60 to 70ktpm operation.
Capital expenditure has been minimised by the following: Ore handling method to be decline and truck with no underground crushing, alleviating the need for Gold g t expensive capital excavations and underground 0.50 engineering: 0.50-1.00 500m 1.00-3.00 Portal position to be located in the south of the pit to 3.00-5.00 ensure a straight decline route to the top of the ore, 5.00-8.00 reducing the requirement for spiral declines: 8.00 Ventilation raised to hole into the open pit with preparation of the holing positions during the pit development: and Gounkoto produced 256 957oz of Backfill to be a combination of Cemented Aggregate Operations gold, 6% less than the previous Fill CAF and Cemented Rock Fill CRF by using year in line with the plan to balance batching and CAF facilities available at Loulo, which production from Loulo and Gounkoto according to their will be transferred to Gounkoto.
An economic assessment on the financial viability of the Tonnes processed decreased during the year but head Gounkoto project underground reserve has been carried out grade milled increased by 13% to 5.3g t, in line with the based on the parameters summarised below: mining plan.
Improved recovery at 90.2%, together with the Total ore mined of 4.7Mt containing 0.9Moz of gold at increase in head grade milled, resulted in a decrease in total an average grade of 6g t: cash costs to $613 oz.

Mining and including 1.8Mt of ore at an average grade of 5.3g t, A financial model using a $1 000 oz gold price together production compared to 28.9Mt including with a 30% tax rate and a 6% royalty, produced a nine year 2.6Mt of ore at 4.7g t in 2013.
