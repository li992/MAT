Incentive Outcomes for 2014 Annual bonus in respect of 2014 In 2014, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive Directors was 100% of salary, linked to performance as measured by an Economic Value Added EVA calculation 90% and revenue growth outside the UK, USA and Mainland Europe 10%.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary were payable on the achievement of targeted levels ofgrowth.
For the CEO and FD, bonuses are calculated based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three years in the comparator calculations, executives must consider the medium-term interests of the Group otherwise there is the potential for an adverse impact on their capacity to earn a bonus.
EVA calculation: Profit for Minus Minus Plus minus Minus Equals each year A charge on cost of A charge on working Unrealised profit in The resultant bonus The EVA for each year acquisitions capital inventory itself to make it self-financing In the case of a Sector CEO, a bonus is earned if the profit of the sector for which they are responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each Sector as a stand-alone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
Bonuses for 2014 are based on the divisional allocation that existed throughout 2014.
Transitional provisions exist for restructuring to ensure Sector CEOs remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary executives participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.
