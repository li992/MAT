Once construction of the planned hydropower stations is Processing, plant completed and they are running as intended, the blended Processing cost is expected to reduce to between $0.10 kWh and and engineering $0.12 kWh.
A key achievement in 2014 was the commissioning of the sulphide circuit and subsequent ramp-up to design The project team production levels by the end of the year, including the Construction kept the construction rougher flotation, ultra-fine grind UFG and pumpcell CIP programme on circuits.
and underground schedule during the mine development year, completing the Flash flotation and gravity recovery units were also metallurgical facility, all associated infrastructure and the commissioned during the year.
The plant treated 5.6Mt, comprising both oxide and Construction of Ambarau, the second 11MW hydropower sulphide material, at an average grade of 3.7g t. Although station, started as well as Phase 2 of the Concentrate the average recovery for the year was 79%, optimisation of Tailings Storage Facility CTSF, both of which remain on the processing facility in the latter half of the year resulted in a steady improvement in performance, with December schedule for completion in 2015. averaging 86%.
Construction highlights in 2014 include: Engineering and power supply Sulphide metallurgical circuit including full flotation, Due to improvements in planned maintenance, plant UFG and pumpcells commissioned: availability increased throughout the year, reaching 90% in All metallurgical plant contractors demobilised: December.
CTSF Phase 2 initiated: Nzoro II hydropower station commissioned: A major milestone for Kibali during 2014 was the Ambarau hydropower station construction started: commissioning of the Nzoro II hydropower station which Mengu Hill open pit haul road completed: consists of four turbines with a capacity of 22MW.
After all First phase of the junior village completed: and four turbines were commissioned, a breaker failure resulted Main project RAP completed and infrastructure in only three turbines operating in the last quarter with a handed over to the community.
steady supply of 16.8MW and a 55 45% split between hydropower and thermal power.
Decline development The mining team consistently achieved decline and Further optimisation of the hydropower and synchronisation underground development targets during 2014 and at a of power produced from Nzoro II with the diesel power better advance rate than planned in the feasibility.
An average plant via a power management system PMS is expected of 300m month per jumbo was reached in development with to increase the contribution from hydropower in 2015 and the decline contractor now ramped up to 900m month.
To date, a total of 12.1km has been developed including 8km Before Nzoro II was successfully commissioned, the cost in 2014. of power was $0.46 kWh reducing to $0.21 kWh after its commissioning.
We expect a further reduction in power cost The underground pump chambers and ventilation required in 2015 due to lower fuel prices and better synchronisation for the current production levels were also all completed.
