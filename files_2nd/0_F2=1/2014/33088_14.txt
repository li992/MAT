Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 5.0 SCOPE 3 VOLUNTARY SUPPLY CHAIN EMISSIONS continued Waste generation in self storage is assessed as a low environmental impact.
The majority of non-hazardous bulk office waste is segregated by staff and recycled by our waste contractor.
Landfill recycling reduces waste on average to 36.4 tonnes per year.
Our average supply chain landfill gas emissions are 10.6 tCO e. These emissions represent less than 0.2% of combined Scope 1 and 2 2 emissions, which is below the materiality threshold for carbon emissions.
Construction contractors completed the fit-out of our new Gypsy Corner store which opened on 1 April 2014.
This generated residual construction waste, also below the materiality threshold.

Six skips of waste plasterboard 61.2 tonnes were also recycled.
We achieved the highest resource efficiency benchmark in the Building Research Establishment Methodology for new commercial buildings.
One new store development at Enfield is planned in 2015.

Monitoring water invoices has helped detect leaks for repair in stores.
Our data has provided an average of 20.3 tCO e emissions per year.
This 2 represents less than 0.4% of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which is below the materiality threshold for carbon emissions.
Water use monitoring will be continued in order to review water use efficiency and losses.
6.0 STAKEHOLDERS Big Yellow engages with its main stakeholders to provide information and gain useful feedback from a variety of groups, as described below.
6.1 Government Legislation and Standards: The Carbon Reduction Commitment CRC The Department of Energy and Climate Change and Environment Agency are two of the stakeholders in the policy for reducing demand for energy from industry, businesses and the public sector.
The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme is designed to cut emissions in large private sector organisations.
This legislation started in 2011 with a broad assessment of energy uses including electricity and gas.
The scheme uses a carbon dioxide conversion factor, and so is not directly comparable to the Companies Act GHG equivalent reporting.
The current CRC tax is 12 per ton of CO and this will rise to 13 per ton in the year ending 31 March 2015.
This year, our CRC taxation will reduce in 2 line with our Scope 2 electricity carbon emission reduction.
6.2 Investor Communications The Carbon Disclosure Project CDP The Carbon Disclosure Project is a global investor-backed initiative designed to encourage companies and their suppliers to publish information on their carbon emissions and climate change strategies.
The CDP acts on behalf of an increasing number of institutional investors to send annual information requests to many of the world's largest listed companies.
It has secured publicly disclosed climate change data from over 1,500 firms globally, including Big Yellow.
Carbon Disclosure Project FTSE 350 2010 2011 2012 2013 Disclosure Score 65 67 71 Performance Score B C D Number of Investors 534 655 722 42 Big Yellows carbon disclosure scores have continually improved from 2010 to 2013 by 9%, with improving internal data management practices for GHG emissions.
Our data responses have become more comprehensive with clearer consideration of business specific risks and potential opportunities related to climate change.
The B to D ratings represents our relative performance on transparent climate change mitigation scoring within the 50 range.
Disclosure standards are rising rapidly and Big Yellow maintains its position in the A to E range.
The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB GRESB collects information regarding the sustainability performance of property companies and funds.
This includes information on performance indicators, such as energy, GHG emissions, water and waste.
The Survey also covers broader issues such as sustainability risk assessments, performance improvement, and engagement with employees, tenants, suppliers and the community.
GRESB continued to rate Big Yellow with a Green Star Status in 2013.
In Europe and globally we were ranked with sustainability scores in the top quartile of management and policy and implementation and measurement.
The benchmark results allow us to identify the areas we can improve, both in absolute terms and relative to our peers.
We are able to provide our existing and potential investors with information regarding our ESG performance, in the current real estate investment market.
7.0 CSR PROGRAMME FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2015 The CSR programme will continue to focus on energy efficiency, carbon reduction, renewable energy generation and waste reduction.
