DISPOSAL ASSETS These assets required significant investment to extend their lives, return to positive COPPER GRADE IN 2014 cash flow and secure employment, which was incompatible with the Groups existing spending commitments.
A restructuring proposal was developed to achieve sustainable positive cash flow and support the development of the major growth projects by divesting those assets to a vehicle controlled by the Groups major shareholder and non-executive Director, Vladimir Kim.
Disposal Assets 2.35% The Group divested 12 copper mines, four concentrators, two coal mines, three CONTINUING OPERATIONS captive power stations and two smelters.
Under separate ownership these assets COPPER GRADEIN 2014 are now better placed to address the challenges they face.
Continuing operations KAZ Minerals has retained a portfolio of high margin, cash flow generative producing assets and the three major growth projects.

8 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 HIGH GROWTH PRODUCTION PROFILE Strong production growth to 2018 Copperproduction is expected to grow to an estimated 300 kt by 2018, representing an industry leading compound 35% annual growth rate CAGR of 35% from 2014 to 2018.
COPPER PRODUCTION Production growth driven by Bozshakol and Aktogay CAGR 2014 -2018 KAZ Minerals has established a separate Projects Division led by internationally experienced mining professionals to develop Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Working with Non Ferrous China as the lead contractor on both projects, the Group has made good progress in 2014 and Bozshakol remains on track to commence commissioning in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The projects are funded by 300 kt long-term debt from China Development Bank.
ESTIMATED COPPER Delivering into a copper market deficit PRODUCTION BY 2018 The market fundamentals are very positive for copper in the medium term.
Our new production will ramp up when we expect the global copper market to return to deficit.
