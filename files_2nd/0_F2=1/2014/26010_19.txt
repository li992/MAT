Accounting policies are contained within relevant notes and are boxed, with the basis of preparation and general policies collected in Section 5.
Net revenue The Groups primary source of revenue is management fees.
Management fees are based on an agreed percentage of the assets under management.
Initial charges and commissions include fees based on a set percentage of certain flows into our funds, commission earned on private client dealing charges and profits earned on dealing within the unit trust managers box, known as box profits.
Performance fees are earned from some funds when agreed performance conditions are met.
Net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of investment management services.
Revenue is shown net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts.
Our primary revenue components are accounted for as follows: management fees are recognised in the period in which the service is performed and calculated as a percentage of net fund assets managed in accordance with individual management agreements: initial charges and commissions on sales of unit trusts are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period of the provision of investment management services.
Box profits are calculated as the difference between the cost of purchasing redeemed units at cancellation prices and reselling them at creation prices.
Such box profits are recognised when the related transaction occurs: and performance fees, calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a defined hurdle.
These are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will be receivable.
Such fees are normally recognised at the end of the relevant reporting period of the fund.
Fee and commission expenses These are paid to third parties for ongoing services under distribution agreements and are charged to the income statement over the period in which the service is expected to be provided.
The services provided include the provision of access to a basket of fund products, information on financial products, promotional materials, ongoing services to customers and transaction processing.

Segmental reporting The Group offers a range of products and services through different distribution channels.
All financial, business and strategic decisions are made centrally by the Board of Directors the Board, which determines the key performance indicators of the Group.
Information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Board, on a single segment basis.
While the Group has the ability to analyse its underlying information in different ways, for example by product type, this information is only used to allocate resources and assess performance for the Group as a whole.
On this basis, the Group considers itself to be a single-segment investment management business.
Management monitors operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure, for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

Staff costs Staff costs include wages and salaries, share-based payments, pension costs and redundancy costs, along with associated social security costs, and are recognised on an accruals basis as services are provided to the Group.
Pension costs The Group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Contributions in respect of the UK employees at the rate of 15 per cent.
of gross salary are made into the Jupiter Pension Scheme whose financial statements are available from the trustees at the registered office of the Company.

Contributions made by the Group are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
2014 2013 m m Wages and salaries 70.8 66.8 Share-based payments Note 1.5 13.7 13.8 Social security costs 10.9 13.3 Pension costs 4.3 4.0 Redundancy costs 0.4 0.3 100.1 98.2 74 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Fund units As described in Note 1.5 ii, deferred bonuses can be deferred into either options over the Company's shares or a cash equivalent to units in the Group's funds.
The expense included within wages and salaries in the income statement in relation to fund units for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 1.3m 2013: 2.0m.
Where bonuses are deferred into fund units, the fair value of the award is spread over the vesting period and included within staff costs.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date to the expected settlement amount and is therefore based on the current market value of the underlying fund unit.
Any increase or decrease in value is recognised in the income statement within staff costs.
The liability is included in the balance sheet as part of accrued expenses within trade and other payables see Note 3.9.
The Group hedges its exposure to price fluctuations in the underlying fund units, by purchasing the fund units at the date of grant.

Average number of employees The monthly average number of persons employed by the Group during the year, including executive Directors, by activity are: 2014 2013 Fund management 76 72 Distribution and marketing 102 90 Infrastructure and operations 281 293 459 455 Information regarding Directors emoluments is given in the Remuneration report.
Share-based payments The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees by granting the right to either shares or options over shares, subject to certain vesting conditions and exercise prices.
These have been accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.
The difference between the fair value of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted and the price payable is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of services is calculated using the market value on the date of award, discounted for dividends foregone over the holding period of the award, and is adjusted for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the Group and the number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions.
These estimates are reviewed regularly and the charge to the income statement is adjusted appropriately.
As a minimum, this is adjusted at the end of the relevant scheme.
Shares and options vest on the occurrence of a specified event under the rules of the relevant plan.
The fair value of shares and options granted during the year to be charged over the vesting period was 14.3m 2013: 13.1m.
A summary of the charge taken to the income statement excluding social security for each share-based payment arrangement is shown below: 2014 2013 m m Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan 0.3 2.2 Deferred Bonus Plan DBP 6.4 4.8 Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP 6.3 6.3 Sharesave Plan SAYE 0.3 0.3 Share Incentive Plan SIP 0.4 0.2 Total Note 1.4 13.7 13.8 75 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SECTION 1: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR Notes to the Group financial statements Income statement continued 1.5.
Share-based payments continued The fair value of the services received has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Fair value amounts for the options granted under the DBP, LTIP and SAYE schemes were determined using a Black Scholes optionpricing method and the following assumptions: 2014 2013 DBP 2013 LTIP 2014 SAYE 2014 DBP 2012 LTIP 2013 SAYE 2013 Weighted average share price 4.21 4.15 3.43 3.28 3.34 3.64 Exercise price 0.02 2.97 0.02 2.91 Weighted average expected volatility % 32.1 31.3 31.6 32.3 32.4 32.3 Weighted average option life years 3.1 4.0 3.5 3.1 4.2 3.6 Weighted average dividend yield % 3.0 3.1 3.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 Weighted average risk-free interest rate % 1.3 1.6 1.4 0.3 0.8 1.1 Expected volatility for options granted in 2014 and 2013 has been calculated using the historical volatility of the Group.
The numbers above in relation to the LTIP include the Joiner Plans as both schemes have a similar structure.
i Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan These options were granted to certain employees prior to Listing in June 2010 and allow them to acquire shares at nominal value, subject to satisfying certain vesting and performance conditions.
The terms of the options allow individuals to make a payment to the Company entitling them to take up rights to shares between one and five years after the grant date, depending on the individual award.
The interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan were granted at the nominal price of 0.02, which gives them the characteristics of nil cost options, and therefore, the fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the award.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movement in, share options during the year: 2014 2013 WAEP WAEP Options outstanding Number Number At 1 January 9,679,504 0.02 14,798,616 0.02 Exercised 6,487,449 0.02 4,514,629 0.02 Forfeited 955,000 0.02 604,483 0.02 At 31 December 2,237,055 0.02 9,679,504 0.02 Exercisable at 31 December 287,055 0.02 1,377,168 0.02 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these options was 3.92 2013: 3.29 per ordinary share.

Income tax expense The Groups headquarters are based in the UK.
It pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current taxation, but there is also a charge relating to tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes deferred tax.
Tax is charged to equity when the tax benefit exceeds the cumulative income statement expense on share plans.
The Group provides for current tax according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is considered recoverable and, therefore, recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Current and deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax that has arisen in respect of equity items is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, less the weighted average number of own shares held.
Own shares are shares held in an Employee Benefit Trust EBT for the benefit of employees under the vesting, lock-in and other incentive arrangements in place.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year for the purpose of basic EPS, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purposes of calculating EPS, the share capital of the parent is calculated as the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue over the years reported.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares during the year used for the purposes of calculating EPS is as follows: 2014 2013 Number Number Weighted average number of shares m m Issued share capital 457.7 457.7 Less own shares held 14.1 38.6 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 443.6 419.1 Add back weighted average number of dilutive shares 19.5 22.9 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 463.1 442.0 2014 2013 Earnings per share p p Basic 28.4 21.1 Diluted 27.2 20.0 81 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
