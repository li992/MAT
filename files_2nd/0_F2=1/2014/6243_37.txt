production goals, and management believes there is sufficient geological The total approved capex for this project was US$235.0 million.
As of potential in the region to establish a new mining district in the future.
December 2014, approximately US$180 million had been spent on this The project includes construction of two plants: i a flotation plant with project, with the remaining US$55 million expected to be invested in 6,000 tpd capacity to process ore from the disseminated body: and ii a 2015as part of theon-going development of the mine.
dynamic leaching plant to treat 3,000 tpd of ore from the veins.
Once at This project is a key contributor to the Companys growth with a full capacity, average commercial production is estimated at 10.3 million production of an additional 8.4 million ounces of silver and 35,000 ounces of silver and 44,000 ounces gold per year, with cash costs in the ounces of goldperyear when it reaches full capacity, which we expect lowest quartile of the international cash cost curve.
toreachahead ofthe three-year timeframe previously anticipated.
Key developments in 2014 In 2014, construction of the first phase of the San Julin project progressed as expected.
We initiated the construction of the dynamic leaching plant, tailings dam and wastewater treatment plant.
Mining works at the vein system continued, whilst diamond drilling of approximately 20,000 metres converted a portion of the mineral resources into the reserve category, equivalent to 162.2 million ounces ofsilver and530,000 ounces of gold.
The first stage of this project, which comprises the leaching plant and mining activities at the vein system, remains on track to start operations in 4Q2015.
The construction of the flotation plant and processing of the ore from the disseminated ore body comprises the second stage ofSanJulin, which is expected to conclude in the second half of 2016.
2015 priorities Conclude construction of leaching plant Continue mining works at the veins Advance construction of water reservoir and initiate construction ofthe flotation plant | www.

This will contribute to Herraduras increased Saucito mines.
The plant will froth float pyrite concentrates that will be average annual production of 360,000 ounces of gold once steady state leached in a 2,000 tpd dynamic leaching plant and Merrill Crowe plant to is reached, and advances our objective to maximise production in the produce precipitates.

of silver and 13,000 oz gold per year, and advances our objective to maximise production in the Fresnillo District.
Key developments in 2014 Key developments in 2014 As gold production ramped up at Herradura following the temporary suspension lifted in March 2014, the new dynamic leaching plant We continued detailed engineering works and the project has now been concurrently reached full-scale operations and there was insufficient approved by the Board.
Based on this, estimated capex for the project capacity at the existing Merrill Crowe plant to efficiently process the has been set at US$155.0 million and expected average production to be solution from both the leaching pads and the DLP.
We began the process in the range of 3.5 million ounces of silver and 13 thousand ounces of gold of installing the second Merrill Crowe plant in the year, relocated from per year.
