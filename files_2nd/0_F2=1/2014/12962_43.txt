Trench intersections include: BGTR001 23m at 1.25g t, within this mineralised corridor and continue the infill work including 7m at 3.05g t: and BGTR003 103m at 1.30g t, to test this concept.
Additionally, several large untested including 26m at 1.82g t and 34m at 1.33g t. Both anomalies remain to be investigated.
trenches, however, include a number of sub-parallel quartz vein sets which are mineralised and inevitably Boundiali influencing results.
The team is now investigating whether At Boundiali, promising results at the Fonondara target these veins represent a stockwork in the brittle deformed have been received from trenches across an east dipping sediments in the fold hinge.
structure which is being interpreted as a thrust.
This target was discovered through a reconnaissance drilling Fapoha permit programme two seasons ago where results of 30m at The Fapoha permit is located along the southern strike 1.43g t and 19m at 0.88g t were received beneath a large extension of the Senefou belt to the south of the Nielle regional soil anomaly.
The permit features a sheared volcanic sediment contact over the full 40km strike with a number of large Encouraging results from early Fonondara trenching 15km gold in soil anomalies along the belt.
Work this 16m at 2.87g t including 9m at 4.92g t over these drill year on the southern anomaly adjacent to the Oubolo intersections were followed up by further trenches this Granodiorite, a Tongon type intrusion, has identified a year which have confirmed the strike of the mineralised 4km long anomalous corridor with results from aircore structure over 1.5km with an average grade of 2g t within drilling including: 39m at 1.54g t including 12m at 3.86g t: moderately silicified volcanics.
Trench intersections 33m at 0.51g t: 27m at 0.45g t: and 12m at 0.53g t. include: 17.26m at 2.16g t, including 5.48m at 4.59g t: Trenching over this corridor for more structural information 14.10m at 1.56g t, including 1.30m at 3.18g t: and 16m has returned results of: 25m at 0.43g t, including 3m at at 2.50g t including 11m at 3.49g t. Trench intersections 1.12g t: and 21m at 1.55g t, including 8m at 3.50g t, along do not represent true widths due to the shallow dipping with a number of mineralised samples from pits along the nature of the mineralised structure but the target same trend hosted in sheared volcanics and greywacke represents a significant mineralised structure which may with silica, sericite and carbonate alteration.
We believe dilate at depth or along strike and will be the focus of that zones of high grade mineralisation could be located further work in 2015.
