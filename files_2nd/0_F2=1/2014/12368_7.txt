Exploration and development Active in-fill drilling at the new ore zones continued in 2014, with more than 65 km of core drilling performed.
However, following the acquisition of the Kyzyl project in the middle of the year, it was decided to postpone putting the new resources into production by expanding the plant.
Instead, the new resources were converted into reserves after the in-fill drilling campaign.
This resulted in the addition of 1.4 Moz and more than doubled the mine life.
