INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT Market Environment The US loan market, as measured by the S&P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index the Index, returned 1.60% for 2014, which was below our full-year estimate of 3%-5%.
Performance for the first half of the year was in line with expectations 2.6% but we saw a combination of eroding technicals and falling oil and gas prices affect returns in the second half of 2014.
In December alone, the Index lost 1.25%, bringing the fourth quarters loss to -0.51%, following the third quarters -0.47%.
On the technicals side, a strong M&A market produced a 22% increase in new supply as the US loan market grew to a record $831 billion in 2014.
Demand from the CLO market was healthy throughout the year and 234 deals were printed, totalling $124 billion, beating 2006s $97 billion record.
On the retail side, however, demand waned as long-term interest rates decreased.
Between January 2013 and March 2014, retail loan fund AUM increased by $84 billion, to a record $175 billion.
In the nine months since, however, this receded by an estimated $32 billion as some investors had global growth concerns, duration fatigue set in, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell steadily from a multi-year high of 3.04% at year-end 2013 to close 2014 at 2.17%.
Falling oil prices did have an impact on the energy sector, but the decline in the broader loan market so far has been limited when compared to high-yield and equities, due to its smaller weight in the Index 4.5% compared to 16% for the BAML High Yield Index and 8.5% for the S&P 500.
That said, the loan markets oil and gas sector produced a -10% return for the year including -9% in December and shaved 55 basis points from full-year returns.
The Company was significantly underweight to this sector at only 1.3%.
For the year, lower-quality issuers outperformed their higher-quality counterparts: CCC-rated issuers returned 6.09% versus B and BB-rated issuers, which returned 1.43% and 1.52% respectively.
The S&P Loan 100 Index, the constituents of which are more akin to the Company larger, more liquid issuers, returned 0.99%.
In Europe, the S&P European Leveraged Loan Index ELLI recorded a full-year 2014 return of 2.99%, with 0.11% recorded during the final quarter.
Whilst performance was better in Europe than in the US during the year, the fourth quarter was when we evidenced more of a divergence.
The technical aspects of the US market brought Europe down in sympathy, as did the concern over plummeting oil prices, but the absence of retail outflows and the sustained CLO bid limited some of that downside.
During 2014, we saw record post-crisis CLO issuance of 14.5 billion in Europe, almost double that seen in 2013.
European institutional loan issuance grew to 49 billion for the year versus 37 billion in 2013, another post-crisis high.
Despite this, repayments continued to be received and the ELLI contracted to close 2014 at 98.3 billion, the lowest level since October 2013.
Since 2009, there have generally been better new issue yields available in Europe as opposed to the US, but in 2014 this started to change for example, in the fourth quarter, 2014 yields widened 57 bps to 471 bps in the US, whereas Europe improved 43 bps to 464 bps.
Post crisis, we have only seen five quarterly examples where this has happened, with two occurring in 2014, the second and fourth quarters.
US default activity was minimal during the year as only five issuers defaulted on $22 billion of loans with Energy Futures TXU accounting for $20 billion of this number.
Excluding it, the default rate ended 2014 at its lowest level since 2011 at 0.34% by amount and 0.50% by number, significantly less than the historical averages of 3.92% and 2.92% respectively.
Since the year end, we have seen one other large default, Caesars, which is the sixth-largest loan defaulter on record, at $5.4 billion, and lifts the loan default rate amount by approximately 70 bps.
The European default rate closed out the year at 4.9% and, whilst it had been higher during the year, was up on the 2.9% recorded at the end of 2013.
This increase was primarily related to the defaults of Vivarte, a French retailer, and Autobar, a UK vending machine business, in the first half of the year and, as with Energy Futures in the US, we considered these defaults as exceptions rather than a trend.
At the time of default together they accounted for approximately 2.5% of the ELLI.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2014 5 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 ANNUAL REPORT INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT CONTINUED Portfolio Management The portfolio remains fully invested and we continue to take advantage of global opportunities.
As at 31 December 2014, 94.14% excluding cash was invested in U. S. Dollar denominated assets with the remaining 5.86% invested in Euro and Sterling denominated assets.
The Companys exposure to non-U.
S. assets has reduced from 11.85% as at 31 December 2013 as we rotated the portfolio out of some of the European positions we held and into the significantly cheaper US market.
Our bond allocation dropped from 8.71% excluding cash at the end of 2013 to 2.62% at 31 December 2014.
During the first half of the year we reduced our exposure as bond spreads tightened and, whilst they did widen again in the second half, we chose to invest in attractively priced new issue loans which also assisted in limiting duration in the portfolio.
With regards to exposure by rating segment we remained overweight in single B assets, a consistent theme since the Companys incorporation.
The weighted average rating of the portfolio remained at B.
You will note that within the statement of operations under Net realised gain on derivatives and Net change in unrealised depreciation appreciation on derivatives that there are gains of $13,539,314 and loss of $98,935,336 respectively on these positions.
We would like to highlight that this is as a result of share class hedging and is not as a result of investments held within the portfolio.
The Company maintains forward foreign exchange transactions in order to hedge against the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Companys NAV.
The main purposes of hedging the financial instruments are i to mitigate the effect of foreign exchange movements on the value of non U. S. Dollar denominated investments by the Company and ii to mitigate the effect of foreign exchange movements on the Sterling value of shareholders investments in the Sterling share class.
Outlook We continue to believe that the fundamentals for investing in the loan asset class remain favourable.
Most companies in our investable universe continue to exhibit strong earnings, free cash flow, and solid liquidity and leverage profiles.
Furthermore, with minimal maturities over the next three years, we see very few catalysts for a sharp increase in the default rate during 2015.
We expect the US default rate by issuer to remain below 2% and Europe in the 3%-5% range.
Performance will continue to be coupon driven with downside risk again coming from any exogenous shocks which could return us to a risk off environment and create further outflows from the asset class.
These flows could be reversed as we move closer to interest rate rises, particularly in the US.
