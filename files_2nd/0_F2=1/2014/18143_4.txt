CORPORATE OBJECTIVE, BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY A PROVEN AND CONSISTENT STRATEGY CORPORATE OBJECTIVE Our objective is to create long-term shareholder value which is measured through total shareholder KPI returns and net assets per share BUSINESS MODEL STRATEGY Investments are required to make a high KPI We focus on cash returns, specialising in predominantly high-yielding cash-on-cash return office properties The cost of debt is kept well below the net initial yield of the properties to enhance the return on equity We invest in modern, high quality, well-let properties Our investment strategy is opportunistic, its approach cautiously in good locations entrepreneurial Local teams are required to compete for an allocation of the Group's capital on a case-by-case basis We create extra value via developments when letting risk and financing risk have in large part been mitigated, and at the appropriate time in the cycle We operate in diverse locations We invest in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden, and in sterling, the euro and the Swedish krona We utilise diversified sources of finance to reduce risk We have 60 loans from a range of lenders, including 23 banks, 2 public bonds and other financial institutions Most properties are owned by single purpose vehicles and financed by non-recourse bank debt in the currency used to purchase the asset Usually several banks are approached for each refinancing to achieve the most advantageous terms, and no one bank provides over 20% of the Group's debt During periods of low, benign interest rates, debt is hedged using caps and allowed to float: at 31 December 2014, 68% of debt was at floating rates The customer base is diversified, but underpinned We avoid a heavy reliance on any one customer or business sector, by a strong core income stream and actively seek rent indexation: we have some 517 customers: 46.8% of rental income is derived from government occupiers, and a further 21.3% from major corporations: the weighted average unexpired lease term is 6.4 years: 58.2% of rental income is subject to indexation We maintain low vacancy rates KPI In-house local property managers maintain close links with occupiers to understand their needs We focus on the quality of service and accommodation for our customers We maintain strict cost control KPI We perform as many back office functions as possible in-house, and monitor our performance against our peer group: our administration cost per employee, and as a percentage of rents, is one of the lowest in the sector We retain high levels of liquid resources We operate an in-house Treasury team which manages cash and corporate bonds to maximise their returns 6 Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts A focus on providing well-managed, cost-effective offices for cost-conscious occupiers in big European cities.
