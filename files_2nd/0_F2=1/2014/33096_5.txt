The East End of Oxford Street has for many years been a poor relation to the Western End, characterised by tired building stock, small retail units and poor quality retailers, resulting in relatively low rental levels.
However, major regeneration is coming.
Crossrail is due to complete in 2018 and the new Tottenham Court Road tube station will open in 2016, together creating one of the busiest transport hubs in Europe.
As a result, investment in the area is increasing andleading retailers are competing to gain a presence, with Primarkand Zara already having leased flagship stores.
We are developing into this resurgent market, helping to regeneratethe building stock and upgrade the local environment, while seeking to close the pricing gap with other prime West End locations.
We have four near-term development refurbishment schemes in this micro-location, including Oxford House which we purchased this year and Rathbone Square, our planning consented 411,800 sq ft mixed use scheme.
Together, our schemes could provide almost 700,000 sq ft of modern space over the next fouryears.
