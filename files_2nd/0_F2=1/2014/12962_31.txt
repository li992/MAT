Three follow-up trenches were excavated and returned any economic resources at surface and the main target results of: WTR01 3.85m at 2g t including 1.10m at 3.24g t: has therefore been removed from the resource triangle.
However, the structure does have the potential to dilate WTR02 3.40m at 1.65g t including 1.30m at 3.93g t: and at depth and will be included in an assessment of deep, WTR03 3.90m at 2.15g t including 1.60m at 4.83g t. conceptual targets around the Loulo deposits.
While narrow, these intersections were thought to be significant because they occur at a structural discontinuity New targets which has focused fluid flow.
This structure was tested After many years of exploration along several key structures with a diamond drillhole which intersected four zones of on the Loulo permit, a 380 line kilometre induced mineralisation totalling 30m downhole true width around polarisation IP geophysical survey was completed to the target structure.
The results from WDH001 returned provide a new data layer across the most prospective and 6.0m at 5.07g t from 153m and 15.8m at 1.43g t from 189m most underexplored parts of the permit where only limited in a 75m wide zone of variably sheared,  outcrop is available and transported soils are silica altered greywacke, heterolithic breccia and limestone.
thought to partially mask underlying mineralisation.
Further trenching along the 2km strike length of the The integration of this new layer of data with updated Waraba shear zone was then executed with the aim of mapping data and other layers produced a new geological extending the target along strike.
However, results from interpretation and identified 12 preliminary targets.
As part the programme were weak, with only one trench out of 11 of this programme, a district-wide initiative to improve the returning a mineralised intersection with a result of 5.2m at lithological and structural understanding of the Loulo area 2.38g t. was progressed.
Fieldwork confirmed a number of existing observations and, more significantly, defined the eastern The work at Waraba defined a narrow system of 4.7m margin of the coarser shelf sediments in a conglomeratic true width over a strike of 1.2km with limited potential of unit to the immediate east of Baboto.
