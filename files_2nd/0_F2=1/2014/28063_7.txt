DIRECTORS INDEMNITY The Companys Articles of Association entitle any Director or Officer of the Company to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any loss or liability incurred by him in the execution of his duties in relation to the Companys affairs to the extent permitted by law.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY The Companys payment policy is to settle investment transactions in accordance with market practice and to ensure settlement of supplier invoices in accordance with stated terms.
The Company did not have any trade creditors at the year end.
CARBON EMISSIONS The Companys carbon emissions result predominantly from its consumption of gas and electricity at its single office.
Using Defra DECCs GHG conversion factors for company reporting produced in 2013, emissions for the year to 30 April 2014 were 18.0 tonnes of CO2e 2013: 19.6 tonnes of CO2e.
This equates to 0.11 tonnes of CO2e 2013: 0.12 tonnes of CO2e per square metre.
AUDITORS Ernst & Young LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office as Auditors and a resolution proposing their re-appointment will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
RESOLUTIONS TO BE PROPOSED AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Annual Report and Accounts Resolutions 1, 2 and 3 are, respectively, to receive the Annual Report and Accounts for the year to 30 April 2014, to approve the Policy on Directors Remuneration and to approve the Directors Remuneration Report contained therein.
Directors Resolutions 4, 5, 6 and 7 are, respectively, to re-elect Hamish Buchan, Gordon Neilly, Stuart Paul and Frank Rushbrook, all of whom retire annually.
Resolution 8 is to re-elect Robin Angus, who, as an executive Director, also retires annually.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED The Board confirms that each of the Directors seeking re-election continues to make a significant contribution to Board deliberations, and that Robin Angus continues to undertake his executive duties in an effective and committed manner.
The Board therefore believes that it is in the interests of shareholders that the above Directors be re-elected.
Auditors Resolution 9 is to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as Auditors and authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration.
Authority to Issue Shares During the year the Company issued two supplementary Prospectuses and a new Prospectus to allow the Company to continue its policy of issuing shares at a small premium to net asset value in response to demand.
In order to meet the continuing demand for shares, two resolutions will be proposed.
Resolution 10 is to authorise the Directors to issue new shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 3,204,275, being 15 per cent.
of the total issued shares as at 5 June 2014.
Resolution 11 is to enable the Directors to issue such new shares and to re-sell shares from Treasury see Treasury Shares below up to an aggregate nominal amount of 3,276,712.50, being 15 per cent.
of the total issued shares as at 5 June 2014, for cash without first offering such shares to existing shareholders pro rata to their existing shareholdings.
If approved by shareholders, the authorities sought by Resolutions 10 and 11 will continue in effect until 31 October 2015, or, if earlier, the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2015.
The Directors issue new shares only when they believe it is advantageous to the Companys shareholders to do so and for the purpose of operating the Companys premium control policy.
In no circumstances would such issue of new shares or re-sale of shares from Treasury result in a dilution of net asset value per share.
Authority to Buy Back Shares During the year, the Company acquired 37,992 of its own shares to be held in Treasury.
The Companys current authority to make market purchases of up to 14.99 per cent.
of the issued Ordinary shares expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 12 is to renew the authority for a further period until the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2015.
The price paid for shares on exercise of the authority will not be less than the nominal value of 12.50 per share or more than the higher of a 5 per cent.
above the average of the middle market quotations of those shares for the five business days before the shares are purchased and b the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange.
The authority, which may be used to buy back shares either for cancellation or to be held in Treasury, will be used to purchase shares only if, in the opinion of the Directors, a purchase would be in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole and would result in an increase in the net asset value per share for the remaining shareholders.
There are no outstanding options warrants to subscribe for equity shares in the capital of the Company.
Treasury Shares Under UK company law investment trusts are able to acquire their own shares to hold in Treasury for re-sale.
The Directors consider that this facility gives the Company more flexibility in managing its share capital.
As at 5 June 2014 the Company held 38,637 Ordinary shares in Treasury, representing 2.2 per cent.
of the total issued Ordinary Share Capital.
16 Personal Assets Trust PLC DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Resolutions 11 and 12 would provide the Directors with the authority they need to manage Treasury shares.
Any buy-back of shares into Treasury and re-sale of shares from Treasury will operate within the following limits: Treasury shares will be sold only at a premium to the net asset value of the shares at the time of sale: and Treasury shares will not be sold at a discount of more than 10 per cent.
to the middle market price of the shares at the time of sale.
Notice period for General Meetings The Companys Articles of Association enable the Company to call General Meetings other than an Annual General Meeting on 14 clear days notice.
In order for this to be effective, the shareholders must also approve annually the calling of meetings other than Annual General Meetings on 14 days notice.
Resolution 13 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to seek such approval.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The Company meets the requirements for electronic voting under the Companies Act 2006, offering facilities for all shareholders to vote by electronic means.
The Directors believe it is in the best interests of the shareholders for the shorter notice period to be available to the Company, although it is intended that this flexibility will be used only for early renewals of the Boards authority to issue new Shares and non-routine business and only where merited in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
RECOMMENDATION The Board considers that the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole and recommends that they vote in favour of such resolutions, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
