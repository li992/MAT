Our operations: Kurdistan region of Iraq Strategic options being evaluated Barda Rash On 12 January 2015, Afren announced that an updated Business activity Competent Persons Report CPR of Barda Rash, carried out as part of the Companys annual reserves review, was expected Appraisal & Development to show a material reduction to previously published estimates of reserves and resources, essentially eliminating gross 2P Production reserves of 190 mmbbls and revising gross 2C resources from 1,243 mmbbls to around 250 mmbbls.
The final RPS report Working interest confirmed the results of the announcement.
60% The decrease in 2P and 2C reserves and resources followed the Operator 2014 reprocessing of 3D seismic shot in 2012 alongside results Afren from the Companys drilling campaign.
Overall, the reservoirs have not performed according to previous expectations of the Gross 2P certified reserves Company, RPS and the approved FDP.
The wells have produced 0 mmbbls higher water cuts than expected and the Company has Gross contingent resources encountered operational challenges associated with the drilling 247 mmbbls of difficult complex fractured reservoirs.
Production from these 2014 Gross average production reservoirs could potentially be achieved with the implementation 330 bopd of recovery schemes requiring significant capital expenditure, which may well be appropriate for a company with a different Work programme strategic focus.
Furthermore, while recent results at the field Production and development have indicated the presence of light oil accumulations from the Source: RPS Energy.
Reserves and Resources remaining as at 31December 2014. deeper Triassic Kurra Chine reservoirs, these have a high level of associated Hydrogen Sulfide H2S, which would require significant capital expenditure to develop.
In light of the above, Overview the Company is in discussions with the MNR regarding potential The Barda Rash PSC is 55 km north-west of Erbil.
The field is divestment opportunity options for the field and has taken the defined as an elongated anticline with surface expression of decision to fully impair the Barda Rash project.

The reservoirs are fractured carbonates of various depositional settings.

Operator Hunt Business activity Oil completed the Simrit-2 Extended Well Test EWT programme during the second half of 2013.
Produced crude was trucked to Appraisal & Development local markets.
The Simrit-3 well, exploring the eastern extent of the large scale Simrit anticline, tested a cumulative rate of 6,293 bopd.
Working interest The well has been configured as a produced water disposal well.
20% Field operations at the Ain Sifni block recommenced in September Operator 2014 following a temporary suspension in August due to the regional Hunt Oil Middle East Ltd security issues.
The Simrit-4 well that was spudded in early 2014 Gross contingent resources has reached Target Depth TD in the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs.
157 mmbbls The Simrit Betnar Field Development Plan was approved by the Ministry of Mineral Resources on 27 November 2014.
Simrit-4 testing Work programme is ongoing with one drill stem test DST completed in the Sargelu, Development one in the Naokelekan and two drill stem tests completed in the Kurra Source: RPS Energy.
Resources remaining as at 31 December 2014.
One DST in the Kurra Chine and one DST in the Mus Adaiyah are scheduled for 2015.
The DST in the Sargelu flowed up Overview to 6,089 bopd with a maximum of 1% water cut on 28 64 choke The Ain Sifni PSC is located 70 km north-west of Erbil, and is and 893 psi well head pressure.
The DST in the Naokelekan flowed operated by Hunt Oil Middle East Limited.
Drilled on the crest up to 5,743 bopd with no water on 128 64 choke and 434 psi well of the Simrit anticline in 2010, the JS-1 discovery well logged head pressure.
The DST in Kurra Chine C flowed up to 941 bopd with continuous oil from 3,642 ft to 10,072 ft in Cretaceous and 80% water cut on 1 choke and 762 psi well head pressure, whilst Jurassic reservoirs.
Triassic reservoir targets were not penetrated the DST in Kurra Chine B flowed up to 2,630 bopd with 40% water by the well and no oil water contact was established.

On 17 April 2012, the Group announced that the Simrit-2 2015 outlook exploration well had successfully encountered an estimated Negotiations are ongoing with the MNR to determine the future 1,342 ft of net oil in Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic age work programme for Maqlub which includes completing the reservoirs.
The well was initially drilled to its prognosed total DST on Maqlub-1.
The Partners plan for Simrit is to recomplete measured depth of 12,139 ft but was subsequently deepened one well and put two wells on production through an Early to a revised total depth of 12,467 ft to test additional zones of Production Facility in 2015. prospectivity.
The Partners completed drilling on the Simrit-2 exploration well in July 2012.
The objective of the well was to An independent Competent Persons Report estimates Afren net test the western extent of the Simrit anticline, a large-scale east Contingent Resources, including Maqlub, at 31.4 mmboe for Ain to west trending structure located on the northern part of the Sifni.
Although there is an approved Field Development Plan, the Ain Sifni PSC.
Analysis of data collected over the deepened project is uneconomic at current oil prices.
Given the uncertainty section of the well indicated the continual presence of light oil surrounding a sustainable oil export mechanism, low oil price, shows, and extended the estimated oil shows encountered by and re-focused efforts toward our Nigerian assets, management the well to 1,509 ft throughout Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic have decided to fully impair the Ain Sifni asset and are evaluating age reservoirs.
