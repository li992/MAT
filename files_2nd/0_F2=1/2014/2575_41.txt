BTPS funding valuation and future funding obligations The funding of our main dened benefit pension plan, the BTPS, is subject to legal agreement between BT and the Trustee of the BTPS, which is determined at the conclusion of each triennial valuation.
The most recent triennial funding valuation at 30 June 2011 and the{associated deficit contribution plan was agreed with the Trustee in{May 2012.
At 30 June 2011, the market value of assets was 36.9bn and the funding deficit was 3.9bn.
There are a wide range of assumptions that could be adopted for measuring pension liabilities and legislation requires that this deficit is based on a cautious or prudent view s for example, assuming a lower investment return than might be expected.
We also calculate a nmedian estimateo of the liabilities, using our central estimate on future assumptions such as expected investment returns.
If{the valuation is performed using this approach the scheme had a surplus of 2.5bn at 30 June 2011.
At 31 March 2014, the surplus using our median estimate assumptions was 0.5bn.
Under the current contribution plan, we made deficit payments of 2.0bn in March 2012 and 325m in March 2013 and March 2014.
The plan includes a further seven annual payments of 295m through to March 2021 and will be reviewed at the next funding valuation due to be carried out as at 30 June 2014.
Further details on the current funding agreement are included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and are also 52 discussed under Our risks on page Group performance
