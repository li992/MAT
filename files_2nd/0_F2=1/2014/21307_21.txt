com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 231 Financial review Analysis of results by business 2014 compared to 2013 Personal and Corporate Banking Profit before tax increased 29% to 2,885m driven by 3% growth in Personal income, lower impairment due to the improving economic environment in the UK, and the continued reduction in operating 8,828m expenses due to progress on the Transform strategy.
This resulted in total income a 2.2% increase in return on average equity to 11.9%.
In Personal, income increased 119m alongside significant cost reductions, with the net closure of 72 branches as part of ongoing branch network optimisation, as well as investment in the customer experience across multiple channels.
Corporate increased both loans and deposits, and Wealth undertook a substantial reorganisation to reduce the number of target markets while simplifying operations.
Personal income increased 3% to 4,159m due to balance growth and improved savings margins, profit before tax partially offset by lower fee income.
Corporate income was broadly in line at 3,592m 2013: 3,620m, with balance growth in both lending and deposits, offset by margin compression.
Wealth income was broadly in line at 1,077m 2013: 1,063m driven by growth in the UK business, offset by client and market exits as part of the reorganisations in the US and EU businesses, and lower fee income.
Net interest income increased 7% to 6,298m driven by lending and deposit growth and margin improvement.
Net interest margin improved 9bps to 3.00% primarily due to the launch of a revised overdraft proposition, which recognises the majority of overdraft income as net interest income as opposed to fee income, and higher savings margins within Personal and Wealth.
These factors were partially offset by lower Corporate deposit margins.

The Investment Bank continues to make progress on its origination-led strategy, building on leading positions in its home markets of the UK and US, while driving 7,588m cost savings and RWA efficiencies.
The business is focused on a simpler total income product set in Markets, which will enable it to build on existing strengths and adapt to regulatory developments.
The business continued to execute this strategy despite difficult market-making conditions and continued low levels of activity.
This has particularly impacted credit and interest rate products, resulting in an income decline across the Markets businesses.
This decline was partially offset by improved banking performance and significant cost reductions as a result of savings from 1,377m Transform programmes.
Total income decreased 12% to 7,588m, including the impact of profit before tax depreciation of average USD against GBP.
Investment Banking fee income decreased 2% to 2,111m driven by lower debt underwriting fees, partially offset by higher financial advisory and equity underwriting fees.
Lending income increased to 417m 2013: 325m due to lower fair value losses on hedges and higher net interest and fee income.
Credit decreased 17% to 1,044m driven by reduced volatility and client activity, with lower income in distressed credit, US high yield and US high grade products.

Our audit approach Summary The judgements that have the most effect on the nature, extent and timing of our audit procedures materiality, scoping and the key areas of audit focus are summarised here and explained in detail below.
Materiality Overall group materiality: 330 million which represents 5% of adjusted profit before taxation defined on page 230 excluding costs to achieve Transform.
The use of this measure of profit mitigates the effects of volatility and aligns our audit with the measures that management use to focus on the underlying performance and position of the Group.
Scoping We changed the way in which we scoped our audit following the Groups re-segmentation of its business during the year.
We audited the complete financial information of each of the four core Business Units.
In addition we audited the adjusting items and cost to achieve Transform in full.
For Barclays Non-Core and Head Office, we performed work over specific financial statement lines.
Areas of focus The areas of focus for our audit to which we allocated the greatest amount of our resources and effort were: Valuation of complex or illiquid financial instruments held at fair value Impairment of loans and receivables Provisions for the cost of conduct remediation Litigation and regulatory claims Provisions for uncertain tax positions IT systems and controls: and Re-segmentation barclays.

as areas of focus in the table below.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
For each of the areas of focus we have set We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the out how we developed our audit to address these specific areas in risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
We looked at order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole: the where the Directors made subjective judgements, in particular in comments made on the results of our procedures should be read in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making this context.
All of these areas of focus were discussed with the Board assumptions and considering future events that are inherently Audit Committee.

For the more significant financial instruments, we evaluated the valuation models used by the Group or made our own valuations and compared the results of our work to that of the Group.
In some cases, this resulted in a different valuation to that calculated by management: but in our view the differences were within a reasonable range of outcomes in the context of the inherent uncertainties disclosed in the financial statements.
In relation to the particular matters set out opposite: We considered the appropriateness of the revision in ESHLA valuation methodology in the light of the changes in the current year, and we examined the revised methodology, seeking corroborative evidence for assumptions made where these were available: We assessed the methodology for the derivative valuation adjustments and compared it with our knowledge of current and emerging practice: the methodology, which is consistent with that used in previous years, was acceptable, but there is, as yet, no clearly accepted market practice: and We examined relevant transactions to corroborate the methodology for the derivative valuation adjustments and the assumptions made: and we found some comparable transactions, albeit limited in number.
Overall, in our view, in the context of the inherent uncertainties as disclosed in the financial statements, these valuations were within a reasonable range of outcomes.

This assessment considered the latest information available including regulatory inspections and communications and our knowledge of other such redress settlements.
As set out in the notes to the financial statements, because such assumptions concern future events, the calculations of the provisions are inherently uncertain.
We considered the sensitivity of the provision to possible variations in those assumptions.
This could result in different amounts for some provisions to those calculated by management, but in our view these differences were within a reasonable range of outcomes in the context of the degree of uncertainty.

As set out in the financial statements, the outcome of such cases are dependent on the future outcome of continuing legal and regulatory processes and consequently the calculations of the provisions are subject to inherent uncertainty.
In our view, the provisions had been arrived at based on the information currently available to the Group and after proper consideration of the legal advice received by the Group.

the financial statements as a whole as follows: We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Overall group materiality 330 million 2013: 310 million.
How we determined it 5% of adjusted profit before taxation excluding cost to achieve Transform.
The adjusting items, as defined by management on page 230 are as follows: own credit, the gain on US Lehman acquisition assets, the provision for PPI and interest rate hedging redress, the provision for ongoing investigations and litigation relating to Foreign Exchange, the loss on the announced sale of the Spanish business, the ESHLA valuation revision and goodwill impairment.
Rationale for benchmark The removal of these items mitigated undue volatility in determining our materiality and provided a more stable applied basis of determining materiality, focusing on the underlying profitability of the Group.
