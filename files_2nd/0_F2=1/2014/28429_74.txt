2014 AIP performance measures and achievement Financial performance The financial performance measures set for 2014 are shown below.
Prior to the start of the year the Committee set stretching performance ranges for each of these measures in line with the Groups performance targets.
The Committee reviewed performance against these ranges at its meeting in February 2015: in all of our key performance metrics the Groups 2014 results exceeded those achieved in 2013.
The Committee also reviewed a report from the Group Chief Risk Officer which confirmed that these results were achieved within the Groups risk appetite and framework.
The performance measures, and the relative achievement compared to the performance range, is illustrated below.
The Board believe that, due to the commercial sensitivity of these targets, disclosing further details may damage the competitive position of the Group.
