of Europes leading pulp and paper making training In terms of our land claims process, we have settled approximately 29% of claims institutions.
During 2014, the government reopened the land claims process and we are uncertain as to how these will progress.
All settled claimants continue to play an active role in providing us with some of our fibre requirements.
We remain committed to sustainable forestry management practices.
This means increasing the long-term productivity of our forests while ensuring that we contribute to the protection of adjacent high conservation value areas, including wetlands.
To make a significant and sustainable difference, we continue to place importance on engaging and collaborating with others beyond our boundaries.
In that way, we can contribute to a positive industry-wide impact on key ecosystems in South Africa.
Our investment in tree research is yielding significant benefits in the form of increased yield and disease resistance.
Over the last 10 years, yields have improved between 11% and 24% from the use of superior genetic material.
We are committed to developing the skills of our people and provide world-class training to our operators through one of Europes leading pulp and paper making training institutions.
We have established strong ties in our surrounding communities, particularly in the more rural forestry areas.
We provide health and educational support, aligned to the communities most pressing needs.
Our enterprise development activities are focused on growing small businesses around our forestry activities.
At both our mills, we continue to update our processes to ensure that we minimise waste and reduce material consumption.
We have also implemented a process to reduce the impact of electricity interruptions.
