2014: 1.2bn 2013: 1.2bn Middle East construction services Outlook 2014: 0.9bn 2013: 0.9bn Despite the fact that market conditions remained challenging Construction services excluding in 2014, we continued to win substantial new orders and probable the Middle East 2014: 2.4bn orders, consistent with our selective approach, worth some 5.1 billion 2013: 2.3bn 2013: 4.9 billion, which is well in excess of the Groups revenue of 4.1 billion.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had orders and probable orders worth 18.6 billion 31 December 2013: 18.0 billion, of which 17.1 billion related to signed contracts and 1.5 billion to probable orders, which are contracts that we have a greater than 90 per cent probability of signing, for example, where we have been selected as the preferred bidder for a contract.
Revenue visibility This represented a strong work-winning performance, which resulted 1 in record revenue visibility, which is currently around 85 per cent of anticipated revenue for 2015 2013: 81 per cent for 2014.
We were also selected for a number of large framework agreements 85% during 2014, for both support services and construction.
These 1 record revenue visibility for 2015 2013 for 2014: 81% frameworks are expected to generate up to 2.0 billion of revenue for Carillion.
However, the revenue we expect from framework agreements has not been included in our order book or in probable orders, in line with our strict order book policy, because this revenue Pipeline of contract opportunities is not guaranteed until specific contracts have been awarded under these agreements.
The value of our pipeline of contract opportunities at the year end 39.2bn increased to 39.2 billion 2013: 37.5 billion, which includes only at 31 December 2014 2013: 37.5bn specific contracts that have passed our initial selectivity criteria, and have either come to market or are expected to come to market.
Support services 2014: 11.1bn 2013: 10.4bn Although there is still some way to go before our markets have fully Public Private Partnership projects recovered from the effects of the global economic downturn, we expect 2014: 2.5bn 2013: 3.0bn the steady improvement in our markets that began in 2014 to continue Middle East construction services in 2015, subject to a sustained economic recovery.
Therefore, in 2015 2014: 15.4bn 2013: 13.1bn we will target revenue growth for the Group, particularly in support Construction services excluding services given the strength of our work winning performance in this the Middle East 2014: 10.2bn segment in 2014.
We will also target winning further Public Private 2013: 11.0bn Partnership projects in which we can make equity investments that generate good financial returns, consistent with our objective of achieving an internal rate of return of 15 per cent.
Across all our markets, we will continue to be very selective in choosing the contracts for which we bid in order to maintain margin discipline and we will also target cash-backed profit in 2015.
Approved by order of the Board.
