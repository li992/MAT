INVESTMENT ACTIVITY We have acquired two properties which reinforce existing Derwent London clusters in the Tech Belt andoffer significant redevelopment opportunities.
Acquiring properties and unlocking their value During the year we acquired two properties which reinforce existing Derwent London clusters in the Tech Belt.
They are both let off low rents with low capital values, have scope for near term asset management and, in the longer term, offer significant redevelopment opportunities.
We acquired the largest of the two properties, Angel Square EC1, in November 2014.
This is a prominent corner property comprising three multi-let connected buildings around a central courtyard.
It is located above Angel underground station and opposite our successful Angel Building.
Rents range from 10 to 30 per sq ft with an average rent of 21.68 per sq ft on let space.
The majority of leases expire in March 2015.
Our initial plan is to capture the rental reversion through medium term lets on this space such as the recent letting to Expedia.
Longer term we are considering plans for a larger building on the site.
The other acquisition has helped unlock a larger site.
19-23 Featherstone Street EC1 is located next to our White Collar Factory development, and adjacent to our Monmouth DAVID SILVERMAN House EC1 41,500 sq ft of offices.
The vendor has leased the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR building back at an initial rent of 10 per sq ft with a break after 12 months.
The property is already highly reversionary, but we have commissioned some early studies on a potential new development on a larger site combining Monmouth House.
This work has suggested the site could hold a c. 125,000 sq ft development, which would represent an 80% increase on the existing space and a major regeneration opportunity.
Since the year end we have announced the acquisition of 20Farringdon Road EC1 as part of a property swap.
Wediscuss the related disposals under recycling capital below.
This prominent 170,600 sq ft property is currently oneof the largest in Clerkenwell next to Farringdon Crossrail station, and opposite 19 Charterhouse Street EC1 which we acquired in 2013.
The consideration was 88.0m before costs, which we met through a property swap, for a minimum 175-year lease with the vendor retaining a 10% ground rent.
98.0m The net rent is 3.2m, and our net initial yield is 3.4% 545 per of commercial property sq ft.
The property comprises 141,400 sq ft offices, 5,700 sqft of ancillary space, 1,200 sq ft retail and a 22,300 sq ft salesat 40% premium to gym.
One office floor is let at a peppercorn rent until December December2013 values 2015 with the remaining office floors let at an average rent of 27 per sqft.
Like Angel Square EC1 we believe the purchase offers short-term management and repositioning potential, 90.9m withlonger-term redevelopment angles.
Each purchase has of principal property enhanced our position next to important transport hubs.
