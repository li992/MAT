A further 18 million was drawn down by private equity funds in which Electra is a limited partner.
Commitments outstanding to private equity funds fell to 77 million at 30 September 2014, compared to 94 million a year earlier.
The reduction in the level of disposals was anticipated as a consequence of the very high levels of realisations experienced in the two years to September 2013.
Realisations in period Allen & Heath 74m AXIO Data Group 22m BDR Thermea 20m EP1 Secondary Portfolio 28m Lil-lets Group 37m 352m LondonMetric Property 36m Total realisations for the year Nuaire 16m Premier Asset came to 352 million compared Management 20m to 459 million in the previous year.
Private Equity Funds 26m Other 73m The most significant realisations during the year were in respect of Allen & Heath, Lil-lets Group, LondonMetric Property, the EP1 Secondary Portfolio, AXIO Data Group, BDR Thermea and Premier Asset Management.
As mentioned previously Allen & Heath was merged with DiGiCo to form the Console Group in August 2014.
The transaction generated total proceeds of 74 million in cash and in securities in the Console Group.

Electra sold its entire holding in LondonMetric Property during the year, realising total proceeds of 36 million.
Electra sold a further six holdings from its listed portfolio during the year, realising further proceeds of 20 million excluding dividends.
During the course of the year Electra received total distributions from the EP1 Secondary Portfolio of 28 million.
The investment in the EP1 Secondary Portfolio has to date produced a return of over 40% on original investment cost in less than two years.
Electra received 22 million of loan repayments and interest from AXIO Data Group.
Strong cash generation has resulted from profits, a reduction in working capital and disposals of non-core assets.
This cash generation has allowed the return of 30% of the original investment cost of 91 million in less than eighteen months.
In January 2014, Electra received the final instalment of 20 million in respect of deferred consideration from the sale of BDR Thermea, bringing this investment to a successful conclusion.
In August 2014 Electra announced that it had agreed to sell a majority shareholding in Premier Asset Management to Elcot Capital Management.
Electra received total proceeds of 20 million cash and 26 million of preference shares, while retaining an equity interest of 25%.
This represents a 10 million increase in the valuation over the year and compares to an original cost of 56 million.
The transaction has enabled Electra to crystallise some of the benefit of Premiers recent strong trading performance while retaining structured equity exposure to a pure-play retail asset management business growing at more than 30% per annum.
Other realisation proceeds received by Electra were 16 million of loan repayments from the refinancing of Nuaire and a further 26 million from private equity funds in which Electra held a limited partnership interest.
Performance During the year to 30 September 2014 Electras investment portfolio generated a total return of 246 million, an increase of 25% on the opening portfolio of 968 million.
The performance arose principally from the direct unlisted portfolio which generated a total return of 182 million, representing an increase of 27%.
Excluding investments held for less than twelve months and property investments, earnings in portfolio companies grew by 21% year on year.
Listed investments produced a return of 56 million or 64%, mainly due to an increase in the share price of Zensar Technologies.
The secondaries portfolio contributed 12 million to the total return.
Private equity funds have produced a negative return over the past three years, but returns are expected to improve as more of these funds move into a realisation period.

Valuation Changes In respect of direct unlisted investments retained at the end of the year, the most significant increases in valuation arose in respect of AXIO Data Group, Park Resorts, South Lakeland Parks and Nuaire.
The investment strategy for AXIO Data Group included measures identified during due diligence to improve profit and cash performance through a focus on costs and working capital.
In 2013 the company implemented operating and capital efficiency programmes across the group and the positive effects of these have continued into the current year.
The group has continued to simplify its portfolio by disposing of non-core assets and has acquired complementary businesses in order to strengthen its strategic position in selected markets.
Further progress has been made in strengthening divisional management teams while implementing performance improvement and growth initiatives across the group.
The combination of increased profitability, cash generation and an increase in the multiple used to value the company resulted in the valuation of Electras investment in AXIO Data Group increasing by 57 million.
The valuation of this investment at the end of September was 1.9x original cost.
28 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2014 In line with our business plan for Park Resorts following the companys consensual debt restructuring in August 2013, the winter of 2013 14 was spent investing in new capacity and growth.
Together with strong trading conditions, this investment programme has led to profits increasing by 22% to 40 million this year.
The performance resulted in the valuation of Electras investment in Park Resorts increasing by 51 million.
Further investment is planned for the forthcoming winter season.
Recognising that Park Resorts was an excellent platform for acquisition-led growth, we have made two further acquisitions in the holiday parks sector, South Lakeland Parks in September 2013 and Southview and Manor Park in August 2014.
The management of South Lakeland Parks was taken over by Park Resorts on acquisition: cost synergies and performance improvement initiatives implemented since have resulted in profits growth substantially ahead of plan and the valuation of Electras investment increasing by 22 million.
The valuation of South Lakeland Parks at the end of September was 2.1x original cost.
The valuation of Nuaire was increased by 18 million as a result of strong profits growth and an increase in the multiple used to value the investment.
Under Electras ownership the company maintained its investment in product development and manufacturing capabilities throughout the recession and is now well positioned to benefit from the recovery in the construction cycle.
During the year the company refinanced its borrowings, returning 15 million to Electra.
The total return on this investment at the end of September was 2.4x original cost.
The largest decreases in valuation, all of which were unrealised during the year, were in respect of Hotter Shoes, Promontoria and Sentinel Performance Solutions.
The valuation of Electras investment in Hotter Shoes was reduced by 10 million.
The management team has successfully achieved a number of strategic objectives this year, including further UK store openings, entering the German home shopping market and broadening the product range and price architecture for the Autumn Winter 2014 15 range.
A number of key appointments have been made to strengthen the senior management team.
However, a provision was made to reflect the difficult trading environments in the UK and the US which have held back profits growth.
Following a portfolio review, Promontoria reduced the valuation of its real estate holdings.
This review combined with negative currency movements reduced the valuation of Electras investment in Promontoria by 7 million.
The total return on this investment at the end of September was 1.9x original cost.
Sentinels trading environment has weakened this year for a number of reasons.
An early start to spring and a warm autumn have reduced demand.
This has been compounded by the competitive environment and some customer destocking.
A number of improvements have been made to the sales function in response.
The valuation of Electras investment however has reduced by 4 million.
The valuation of this investment at the end of September was 0.6x original cost.
