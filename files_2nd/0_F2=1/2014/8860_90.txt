117 Variable Pay Additional Disclosures, Including Bases of Calculation and Outcomes 1 Annual Bonus for the Year Ended 31st March 2014 The annual bonus for 2013 14 is based on the performance against budgeted underlying PBT.
The table below sets out the bonus opportunity and performance target for the year ended 31st March 2014.
Required underlying PBT performance Bonus as % of base salary Chief Executive Executive directors Threshold 95% of budget 15.0% 15.0% Target 100% of budget 75.0% 62.5% Maximum 110% of budget 150.0% 125.0% The annual budget target is set when budgets are approved in March, immediately prior to the new financial year.
Budgets are built from the bottom up and are subject to a rigorous process of challenge before final proposals are considered by the board.
Further information is used in the determination, including a consensus of industry analysts forecasts, provided by Vara Research.
The Vara consensus as at March 2013 immediately prior to the year was for an underlying PBT in the region of 402 million.
In line with the setting of challenging and stretching targets, the annual budget was set at a higher figure than the consensus, at 410.0 million.
The actual underlying PBT achieved was 427.3 million, 4.2% above the budget, and therefore bonus payments were awarded at the levels indicated below.
Commercial sensitivity precludes the advance publication of bonus targets but we reproduce below the targets for 2013 14 and the previous year.

This had no effect on bonus outcomes as the threshold was not reached.
2 In 2013 14 the underlying PBT for 2012 13 was restated note 40 on page 175.
For bonus payments earned in relation to the year ended 31st March 2014 the following rules of deferral apply: For the Chief Executive, 33.3% of the bonus payable is awarded as shares and deferred for a period of three years.
For other executive directors, 20% of the bonus payable is awarded as shares and deferred for three years.
There are no further performance conditions attached to the deferred element.
The MDRC is entitled to apply forfeiture to the deferred element in the case of misstatement or misconduct.
The MDRC retains discretion in awarding annual bonuses to vary the level of annual bonuses from the formulaic outcome.
No discretion was applied to the above outcomes.
2 LTIP Vesting for the Three Year Performance Period Ended 31st March 2014 The table below sets out the opportunity and performance targets for the LTIP award made in July 2011 with a three year performance period which ended 31st March 2014.
Required underlying EPS performance Proportion of award which may vest Vesting as % of base salary at time of award 1 Chief Executive Executive directors Threshold 7% CAGR 15% 26.25% 21% Maximum 16% CAGR 100% 175% 140% 1 John Walker became an executive director on 9th October 2013.
Mr Walkers 2011 LTIP award has a threshold opportunity of 18.75% of base salary and maximum opportunity of 125% of base salary.
The performance targets applicable to this award are 6% CAGR and 15% CAGR respectively for service up to 9th October 2013 and 7% CAGR and 16% thereafter.
The awards vest on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum.
In addition to the EPS performance condition, the MDRC considers the performance of ROIC over the performance period to ensure that earnings growth is achieved in a sustainable and efficient manner.
The 2011 LTIP award was originally granted with a performance range from threshold to maximum of 6% to 15% CAGR in underlying EPS.
However, in August 2012 the company carried out a share consolidation associated with the payment of a special dividend.
The MDRC therefore considered the impact of the share consolidation on the EPS performance targets for outstanding incentives, where those performance targets were agreed by the MDRC before the consolidation was announced.
The MDRC adjusted the vesting requirements for the outstanding LTIP awards of executive directors so as to reflect the impact of the consolidation and therefore any resultant numerical enhancement of EPS.
The MDRC also took into account the mitigating effect of the cost associated with increased borrowings as a result of the associated special dividend and concluded that the LTIP performance range should be increased for the three relevant awards whose performance periods spanned the consolidation.
These are the awards made in 2010 previously vested, 2011 vested during the year and 2012 outstanding.
