The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report: Fund Managers Report As a result of the strength of the economy, expectations of a rise in interest rates were brought forward and this was one important factor behind the sideways move in UK equity prices in the first six months of 2014.
A second negative factor was sterling, which rose from 1.52 to 1.71 against the US dollar and from 1.17 to 1.25 against the euro, and had an adverse effect on the some 70% of UKstock market profits that are earned overseas as well as  for exporters.

Emerging markets were mixed but China Investment Background still managed to grow above 7% despite much investor scepticism.

12 The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report: Fund Managers Report continued cheaper than medium-sized or small companies based on dividend yields or price earnings ratios.
At 10 September 2014, based on the previous twelve months dividends per share DPS and earnings per share EPS, the FTSE 100 Indexs dividend yield was 3.4% and price earnings ratio PE was 13.8x compared with 2.6% and 18.3x for the FTSE mid 250 Index and 2.4% and 23.5x for the FTSE Small Cap Index.
The potential for large companies to outperform and realise some of their latent potential is well illustrated over the last year by the takeover approach for AstraZeneca and Vodafones disposal of its stake in Verizon Wireless.
The largest companies also tend to be more global.
Within the top ten holdings, British American Tobacco, HSBC, Diageo and Unilever all have significant exposure to emerging markets which continue to offer great potential given the likely long-term growth in prosperity of their emerging and sizeable middle classes.
In the short term, UK domestic companies should continue to benefit from economic growth fuelled by low interest rates and rising employment.
However, there is a danger of the share prices of domestic cyclicals derating in anticipation of rising interest rates as the UK economic cycle matures.
UK domestic sectors favoured in the portfolio for strong trading fundamentals include Real Estate Investment Trusts and Travel & Leisure companies.
The general election of May 2015 is already casting a shadow over some of the UK utility companies.
However, future governments will have to work with the utility companies to provide the private capital needed for further investment in the UKs infrastructure.
The Company maintains an exposure to the UK utility sector given the steady returns that are likely to be achieved over the medium term.
Overall, a balanced approach is appropriate.
The largest exposure is towards large capitalisation multi-national companies but there are also significant investments in domestic shares.
