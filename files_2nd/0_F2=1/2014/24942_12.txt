4 Net operating income before loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions, also referred to as revenue.
5 Positive numbers are favourable: negative numbers are unfavourable.
6 Currency translation adjustment is the effect of translating the results of subsidiaries and associates for the previous year at the average rates of exchange applicable in the current year.
7 Own credit spread includes the fair value movements on our long-term debt attributable to credit spread where the net result of such movements will be zero upon maturity of the debt.
This does not include fair value changes due to own credit risk in respect of trading liabilities or derivative liabilities.
8 From 1 January 2014, the geographical region Asia replaced the geographical regions previously reported as Hong Kong and Rest of Asia-Pacific see Note 11 on the Financial Statements for further details.
Comparative data have been represented accordingly.
Consolidated income statement 9 Dividends recorded in the financial statements are dividends per ordinary share declared in a year and are not dividends in respect of, or for, that year.
For further information, see footnote 3 on page 39.
10 Dividends per ordinary share expressed as a percentage of basic earnings per share.
11 Net interest income includes the cost of internally funding trading assets, while the related external revenues are reported in Trading income.
In our global business results, the cost of funding trading assets is included with Global Banking and Markets net trading income as interest expense.
12 Gross interest yield is the average annualised interest rate earned on average interest-earning assets AIEA.
13 Net interest spread is the difference between the average annualised interest rate earned on AIEA, net of amortised premiums and loan fees, and the average annualised interest rate paid on average interest-bearing funds.
14 Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as an annualised percentage of AIEA.
15 Interest income on trading assets is reported as Net trading income in the consolidated income statement.
16 Interest income on financial assets designated at fair value is reported as Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value in the consolidated income statement.
17 Including interest-bearing bank deposits only.
18 Interest expense on financial liabilities designated at fair value is reported as Net income on financial instruments designated at fair value in the consolidated income statement, other than interest on own debt which is reported in Interest expense.
19 Including interest-bearing customer accounts only.
20 Net trading income includes a favourable movement of US$15m 2013: unfavourable movement of US$66m: 2012: unfavourable movement of US$629m, associated with changes in the fair value of issued structured notes and other hybrid instrument liabilities arising from movements in HSBC issuance spreads.
21 Trading income also includes movements on non-qualifying hedges.
These hedges are derivatives entered into as part of a documented interest rate management strategy for which hedge accounting was not, nor could be, applied.
They are principally cross-currency and interest rate swaps used to economically hedge fixed rate debt issued by HSBC Holdings and floating rate debt issued by HSBC Finance.
The size and direction of the changes in the fair value of non-qualifying hedges that are recognised in the income statement can be volatile from year-to-year, but do not alter the cash flows expected as part of the documented interest rate management strategy for both the instruments and the underlying economically hedged assets and liabilities if the derivative is held to maturity.
22 In 2013, we recorded a net gain on US$553m on the completion of the Ping An disposal.
This represented the net effect of US$1,235m gain on fide-recognition of equity securities classified as available for sale and recorded in Gains less losses from financial investments, partly offset by US$682m on a contingent forward sale contract, recorded in Net trading income.
23 Other changes in fair value include gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with HSBCs long-term debt issued.
24 Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to policyholders arise from both life and non-life insurance business.
For non-life business, amounts reported represent the cost of claims paid during the year and the estimated cost of incurred claims.
For life business, the main element of claims is the liability to policyholders created on the initial underwriting of the policy and any subsequent movement in the liability that arises, primarily from the attribution of investment performance to savings-related policies.
Consequently, claims rise in line with increases in sales of savings-related business and with investment market growth.
25 The cost efficiency ratio is defined as total operating expenses divided by net operating income before loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions.
Consolidated balance sheet 26 In 2013, GB&M changed the way it manages reverse repo and repo activities in the Credit and Rates business.
This led to a decrease in amounts classified as Trading assets and Trading liabilities in the balance sheet and an increase in the amount classified as Non-trading reverse repos at amortised cost and Non-trading repos at amortised cost respectively.
27 From 1 January 2014, non-trading reverse repos and repos are presented as separate lines in the balance sheet.
Previously, non-trading reverse repos were included within Loans and advances to banks and Loans and advances to customers and non-trading repos were included within Deposits by banks and Customer accounts.
Comparative data have been re-presented accordingly.
Non-trading reverse repos and repos have been presented as separate lines in the balance sheet to align disclosure with market practice and provide more meaningful information in relation to loans and advances.
The extent to which reverse repos and repos represent loans to from customers and banks is set out in Note 17 on the Financial Statements.
29 On 1 January 2014, CRD IV came into force and the calculation of capital resources and risk-weighted assets at 31 December 2014 are calculated and presented on this basis.
2011 to 2013 comparatives are on a Basel 2.5 basis.
2010 comparatives are on a Basel II basis.
30 Capital resources are total regulatory capital, the calculation of which is set out on page 246.
31 Including perpetual preferred securities, details of which can be found in Note 30 on the Financial Statements.
32 The definition of net asset value per ordinary share is total shareholders equity, less non-cumulative preference shares and capital securities, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue excluding shares the company has purchased and are held in treasury.
