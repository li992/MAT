Additionally, exploration targeting to the south of Gara Gara predicts further high grade along the hinges of tight At Gara, 155 diamond core boreholes were drilled 28 064m during the year comprising 125 holes south-plunging s-type folds, especially where they 12 900m for GC drilling and 30 holes 15 164m for cross through the axis of a sub-horizontal warp in the resource infill or conversion drilling.
The wavelength of s-type folds within the orebody suggests that the target area would be A total of 9 holes 4 018m were drilled in the southern 300-500m south of the existing model.
This model was inferred area between -400 and -500m level to upgrade tested with LOCP187 which returned an intercept of 2.93m the resource to indicated status.
These holes reduced the at 7.44g t from 544.60m, 400m south of the existing block average width of the orebody by about 35% compared model and confirmed strong mineralisation and alteration to the model but increased the grade by 50% with an is open along the system.
This, when combined with average intersection of 6.89m at 5.46g t and permitted the strong results at depth at Gara, confirms an exciting the conversion of 147koz to the indicated category.
potential for further resource growth.
High grade mineralisation is associated with the hinge of a south plunging anticline which remains open down Gounkoto plunge and presents further opportunity for reserve growth.
Individual drill results include: LOCP161 4.7m The main highlight of the work at Gounkoto this year has at 7.71g t from 332.7m: LOCP162 4.1m at 22.00g t from been the completion of the underground feasibility study 473.10m: LOCP165 4.65m at 17.83g t from 465.85m: in the Jog Zone JZ.
This project targeted the high grade L0CP173 9.00m at 6.16g t: and L0CP167 6.25m at mineralisation in the MZ2 and MZ3 zones beneath the pit, 6.01g t. a large portion of which was drilled out in previous years.
The resource infill drilling was undertaken to increase As part of the feasibility programme, work focused the confidence level in the indicated zone.
Overall the on improving the understanding of the controls on intersections returned a lower grade and width compared mineralisation in the JZ, infill drilling to upgrade the to the block model.
However, holes along the base of resource and step out drilling in MZ3 where high grade the deposit confirmed that the system is open, strongly rods of mineralisation plunge to the north of the current altered and intensely mineralised, highlighting potential for underground project for a total of over 12 000m of core step-out drilling around the block model to incrementally drilled during the year.
The conclusion of this work add to resources.
Results from this area this quarter was the delivery of a reserve of 4.69Mt at 6.00g t for include: LOCP176 8.5m at 6.74g t from 370.65m: L0CP177 4.55m at 5.63g t from 370.65m: and L0CP175 910 000oz with good potential to increase this through 16.2m at 5.96g t from 180.2m.
