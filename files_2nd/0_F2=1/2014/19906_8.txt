STRONGEST CAPITAL STRUCTURE 22 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information USAF RAISED CAPITAL AND ACQUIRED PORTFOLIO In March, USAF successfully completed a 115 million fundraising.
These proceeds were used to reduce leverage and acquire a portfolio of nine regional assets from the Cordea Savills Student Hall Fund.
The portfolio of 3,000 beds was acquired for 137 million and adds to Unites existing presence in strong regional locations, with properties located in Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds, Loughborough, Portsmouth and Preston.
Unite currently manages the properties in Bath and Portsmouth under leases offering us the potential to enhance returns as these contracts are re-negotiated.
The acquisition increased USAFs property portfolio value by 10% and the fund now comprises 24,820 beds in 68 properties across 22 UK towns and cities.
USAF is Europes largest non-listed real estate fund focusing purely on student accommodation investment assets.
The 1.6 billion fund is an open-ended infinite life vehicle and Unite has a 22% stake.
