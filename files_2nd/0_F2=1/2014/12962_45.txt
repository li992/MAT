As part of Randgolds long term strategy in Cte dIvoire, we have upgraded our understanding of the geology We have also been granted two new permits through through a programme of regional mapping across the old applications, Tengrela South and Kouassi Detekro country.
This resulted in a reinterpretation of the countryNorth.
Currently, Randgold and its Ivorian partners hold 2 scale geological map with notable changes, mainly to the a portfolio of eight permits for 4 500km which provides extent of the intrusive bodies and the delineation of new the flexibility to prioritise permits as well as targets within areas of greenstones.
