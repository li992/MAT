19 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Our strategy Our objective is to grow total shareholder returns while maintaining a strong BBB Baa investment grade credit rating.
In order to achieve this, we aim to increase returns on capital and also cash flows.
Incremental capital is only deployed where strict and clearly defined financial criteria, in respect of returns and payback, can be met.
We seek to maintain and, where possible, strengthen our overall competitive position within ourexisting, highly diversified suite of commodities.
These commodities are ones where long-term demand growth drivers remain robust.
Our major industrial assets are long life and lowcost.
This partly reflects substantial investment in recent years, often into commodities where our large-cap competitors are exiting or have already done so.
Our industrial activities are focused on generating sustainable operating and capital efficiencies.
Safety isparamount and our number one priority.
Our industrial assets also provide an essential source of flows for our marketing operations, where incremental value can be added via critical mass, blending, storage and geographical arbitrage.
Our priorities in the marketing activities are to maximise the returnsand cash flows from the pool of capital allocated toit.
The structure of the business remains highlyconservative in respect of risk, whether that be market, credit or liquidity.
Our culture remains highly entrepreneurial with an ability to be opportunistic within our clearly set-out financial criteria.
This is supported by the high level ofownership by management and employees.
