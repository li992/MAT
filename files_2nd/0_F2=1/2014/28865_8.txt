20 Key economic indicators The key market in which RBS operates is the UK.
Lending in the UK is closely linked to GDP and growth in the housing market is highly dependent on the level of interest rates.
Falling unemployment may have a positive impact on lending as more people are able to afford loans.
The profitability of the banking sector is adversely impacted by low interest rates as they squeeze the margin between borrowing and lending.
The level of impairments is affected among other things by GDP growth, movements of unemployment rates and interest rates.
The other key economies in which RBS operates are the US and the Republic of Ireland RoI.

But we know customers still want to speak to a person for those important life decisions, like buying a home or starting a new business.
Were responding to the changing needs of our customers by investing 1 billion over the next three years to improve our banking services.
As part of this investment were refurbishing our branch network to create open, bright spaces for customers to talk to us face to face about the things that matter most to them.
For customers who like to do their banking on the move were continuing to develop our market-leading mobile banking app, which is used regularly by more than three million customers and supports around 3.5 million logons and half a million payments and transfers every day.
Weve also just become the first bank in the UK to introduce Touch ID fingerprint logons, offering even better security for our customers.
However, this is just one of the ways were taking our service to where our customers want us to be.
With the UKs second largest branch network, a 24 7 telephone banking service, the second largest free to use ATM network in the UK and an extended relationship with the Post Office which means customers can now access our basic services in 11,500 branches, customers have never had more choice about how they do their banking.
And for those customers in more remote communities weve invested in a further five mobile banking vans, taking our fleet of vans to 23.
They join a long, proud tradition of mobile banking services our first van was introduced in 1946.
