2 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Priorities We set out below our Strategic Priorities and on the opposite page the Key Performance Indicators KPIs which we use to measure our progress.
We use KPIs to assess how the Company is performing in the short, medium and long term over a range of financial and business objective measures.
These KPIs are embedded within our performance management processes and are the key tool we use to ensure that all of our people are fully aligned behind our strategic priorities and to allow us to measure progress against our Vision 2020 goals.
Our KPIs are also used by our Remuneration Committee in determining the rewards of our Executive Directors.
You will find more detail in our Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 60 as to how their Corporate and Business targets are aligned to our KPIs.
