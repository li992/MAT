12 NEUBERGER BERMAN DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Going Concern Going concern refers to the assumption that the Company has the resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
After analysing the following, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements: 1.
Working capital As at 31 December 2014, there was a temporary working capital deficit of approximately $28 million This deficit has been cleared as at 31 March 2015, however, the Directors noted that as at 31 December 2014 i the gross investment income for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 was approximately $96m and ii the Company had no borrowings.
As such the board believes the Company has sufficient capital to cover all expenses which mainly consist of Investment Managers fees, Administration fees and Professional fees and to meet all of its obligations as they fall due.
Closed-ended Company - The Company has been registered with the Guernsey Financial Services Commission as a Registered Closed-ended Collective Investment Scheme, as such there cannot be any shareholder redemptions, and therefore no cash flows out of the Company in this respect.
Investments - The Company has a tradeable portfolio, therefore the investments can be sold for cash.
Based on the above assessments, the Directors are of the opinion that the Company is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for payment because it has and is expected to maintain, adequate cash resources.
Given the nature of the Companys business, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The going concern statement required by the Listing Rules and the AIC Code is set out above.
Life of the Company The Company does not have a fixed life.
However, under Article 51 of the Articles of Incorporation the Articles, the Directors have to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the Company at certain anniversaries of Admission and, at such meeting, propose an Ordinary Resolution that the Company continues its business as a closed-ended investment company.
The first Continuation Resolution, which fell due on or before the third anniversary of Admission, was passed on 19 March 2014.
The Directors are next required to convene an extraordinary general meeting to propose a further Continuation Resolution on or before the sixth anniversary of Admission.
The Directors will convene a general meeting to propose a further Continuation Resolution every year thereafter.
If a Continuation Resolution is not passed, the Directors are required to put proposals to shareholders for the restructuring or reorganisation of the Company.
Discount Controls As set out in the Articles, if, as at 31 December in any calendar year, the Shares of a particular class have, on average over the last three calendar months of the relevant calendar year the Discount Calculation Period, traded on the London Stock Exchange at a discount in excess of 5% to the Net Asset Value per Share of that class, the Directors will, subject to any legal or regulatory requirements, implement a redemption offer the Redemption Offer pursuant to which each holder of Shares of the relevant class shall be offered the opportunity to redeem up to 50% of their Shares of such class.
This provision was not triggered at 31 December 2014.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2014 13 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 ANNUAL REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Discount Controls continued Buybacks At the annual general meeting of the Company held in June 2014, the Directors were granted the general authority to purchase in the market up to 14.99% of the Ordinary Shares of each class in issue as at 18 June 2014.
This authority will expire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Directors intend to seek annual renewal of this authority from the Shareholders.
Pursuant to this authority, and subject to the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and the discretion of the Directors, the Company may purchase Ordinary Shares of a particular class in the market on an ongoing basis with a view to addressing any imbalance between the supply of and demand for Ordinary Shares of such class, thereby increasing the Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share of that class and assisting in controlling the discount to Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share of that class in relation to the price at which the Ordinary Shares of such class may be trading.
The Company re-purchased 15,429,672 Ordinary Sterling shares in 23 tranches between 16 February 2015 and 15 April 2015, to be held in treasury.
Further details on these transactions can be found in the subsequent events note on page 69.

Each of those Directors confirms that: to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the Auditors are unaware: and he or she has taken all steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
