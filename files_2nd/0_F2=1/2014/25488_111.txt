The table above refl ects the net credit exposure in the vehicles that the group has refl ected in the total credit and counterparty exposure with the 01 maximum credit exposure referenced to credit providers external to the group in the column headed assets that we deem to have no legal credit exposure.

These facilities have remained undrawn and are refl ected as a contingent liability, i. e. off-balance sheet exposure of the bank.
Other assets include settlement debtors where we deem to have no credit risk exposure as they are settled on a delivery against payment basis.
