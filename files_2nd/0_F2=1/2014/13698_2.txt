Strategic Review Group Activities and Management As indicated above our business is an international consultancy providing independent advice that relates to oil and gas and natural resources as well as to the built and natural environment.
The Groups services in relation to the development of infrastructure draw upon expertise from within both of these areas.
Energy We provide advice to our clients upon the exploration and production of oil, gas and other natural resources which comprises technical, commercial and project management support and training in the fields of geoscience, engineering, health, safety and environment.
It may be provided on a multi-disciplinary and integrated basis anywhere in the world.
We aim to assist clients development of their energy resources across the complete life cycle, combining technical and commercial skills with an extensive knowledge of environmental and safety issues.
The business has regional offices in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Norway, Singapore and Malaysia and undertakes projects in many other countries.
During the year under review, with the exception of our Australian and Asia Pacific offices, they were managed by a single Board supported by a number of operating Boards and their results reported as a single segment.
With effect from 1 January 2015 this business has been split into two sub-segments one covering our activities in Europe, Africa and the Middle East EAME and the other our activities in North America.
These sub-segments are now being managed by separate Boards.
Our Australian and Asian offices have been and will continue to be managed on a regional basis by a Board that has responsibility for both our Energy and our Built and Natural Environment offices in this region.
During 2014 our Norwegian business was within that part of the Energy business which is now EAME.
Due to the changing balance of energy and environmental activities consideration is now being given to consolidating its results within the BNE Europe segment.
Built and Natural Environment This is the advice we provide to our clients upon the built and natural environment which includes planning, urban design and regeneration, environmental assessment and management, transport and infrastructure, architecture and landscape, engineering and surveying.
We also provide services in the areas of environmental science, the management of water resources, health safety and risk management, laboratory testing, asbestos consulting, air quality, noise, property and oceanography.
Our services are provided on a regional basis from offices in Europe, Australia and North America.
Our regional businesses in Europe and North America are each managed by a single board supported by a number of operating boards.
We present the results of each of these two businesses as separate reporting segments.
As noted above and due to the integrated nature of the environmental and energy infrastructure markets in that area, the Built and Natural Environment business in Australia Asia Pacific is managed with the Energy business in that region by a single Board.
The results of this combined business are presented as single reporting segment covering all of our operations in Australia Asia Pacific AAP.
During the year it was announced that the results of HMA Land Services which had previously been included within the Energy segment would be consolidated within the Built and Natural Environment segment.
Infrastructure We operate multi-disciplinary teams drawing on expertise of each of the segments to focus on development of Energy and Urban Infrastructure.
In the former we provide advice on the development of infrastructure for developing energy from renewable sources, storing and transporting hydrocarbons and transmitting energy and power.
With regard to urban infrastructure we develop projects through planning, design and construction support including hospitals, schools, residential development and manufacturing facilities as well as the planning and design of transport schemes.
Further Information A sample of the projects and activities that we undertake is described on our website at www.

2 Based on earnings before amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs.
The strength of sterling had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated profit growth.
This was offset by the contribution from acquisitions.
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 22.04 pence 2013: 20.22 pence: 19.32 pence on a constant currency basis.
At the segment level we focus on underlying profit: all segments grew on a constant currency basis: the contribution from each segment was: 2013 constant Underlying Profit m 2014 2013 currency 39.0 Energy 36.4 35.3 Built and Natural Environment: Europe 21.3 19.2 18.8 9.1 Built and Natural Environment: North America 8.3 7.8 Australia, Asia Pacific 9.6 10.0 9.0 79.1 Total 73.9 70.9 As defined in note 1g to the consolidated financial statements.
Our Energy activities are conducted on a worldwide basis.
In combination with our Built and Natural Environment BNE business in North America and our Australia, Asia Pacific AAP business, we now have over three quarters of our underlying profit generated outside the UK.
Although this diversity exposes us to currency fluctuations, it enables the Group to deliver good results, even when confronted with challenging conditions.
The Groups key performance indicators are shown below: 2013 constant Group Key Performance Indicators 2014 2013 currency Fee income m 505.0 492.1 468.3 PBTA m 66.1 63.0 60.2 3 Conversion of profit to cash % 89.0 96.0 96.0 Net debt m 73.2 32.4 32.4 Notes 3 Based on operating profit adjusted for depreciation, share scheme costs, amortisation of acquired intangibles, deferred consideration treated as remuneration and noncash transaction related costs.
6 Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Cash Flow, Funding and Dividend Our cash flow in the year was good and our balance sheet remains strong.
Our year end net bank borrowings were 73.2m 2013: 32.4m after paying out 17.4 million in dividends 2013: 15.0 million and 64.7 million 2013: 46.7 million in respect of initial and deferred payments for acquisitions, including acquired net debt.
Net bank borrowings include a 51.8 million loan from Pricoa, due for repayment in 2021.
We have a 125 million committed revolving credit facility with Lloyds available until July 2016 which had headroom of about 87 million at the year end.
The Board intends to refinance the Lloyds facility during the course of the next few months, which is likely to involve an additional bank providing part of our total facilities.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.42 pence per share payable on 22 May 2015 to shareholders on the register on 24 April 2015.
If approved, the total dividend for the full year would be 8.47 pence per share, an increase of 15% 2013: 7.36 pence per share.
We remain well positioned to continue funding the Groups growth strategy.
Markets and Trading Energy The Energy business continued to grow, with an improved result in the second half supported by acquisitions made in 2013, managing well the rapid decline in oil price and political unrest in the Middle East.
The strong margin was also maintained.
We provide internationally recognised consultancy services to the oil and gas sector from our main bases in the UK, USA and Canada.
These act as regional centres for projects undertaken in many other countries.
The Energy component of our AAP business, with offices in Perth, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, provides an integral part of the service offering to our international oil and gas clients.
Our range of clients and services and geographical diversity of our business provides opportunity for us throughout the investment cycle in this industry.
2013 2014 2013 constant currency 180.7 Fee income m 205.1 186.9 Underlying profit m 39.0 36.4 35.3 19.5 Margin % 19.0 19.5 As defined in note 1g to the consolidated financial statements.
We continued to benefit from our excellent reputation and prominent position in the oil and gas sector in many parts of the world.
In particular, we experienced good demand for our consultancy advice, including transaction and asset valuation support.
During the second quarter some of our clients began to manage expenditure more tightly, particularly in their operational activities.
Against the background of a rapidly falling oil price, this trend continued through the second half.
Our trading was also affected by the political disruption in the Middle East, which caused clients to delay investment in Kurdistan Iraq.
Despite these adverse conditions our profit in the year grew.
This, in part, reflects the flexible nature of our business model which enables us to execute much of our operations support with experts recruited for specific assignments.
Our global reach enables us to support a wide range of long term clients, for whom we undertake many projects of varying scale.
We are not, in consequence, dependent on a small number of clients or projects.
Recent market conditions have been unusually volatile.
As a result, clients are likely, in the short term, to continue focusing on cost management: we are, therefore, reducing our cost base and concentrating on those parts of the market and projects likely to receive investment.
There are, however, already some signs of stabilisation.
With the global economy set to grow substantially in coming years, we are well positioned in what continues to be an attractive, long term market.
Built and Natural Environment BNE Within this business we provide a wide range of consultancy services to many aspects of the property and infrastructure development and management sectors.
These include: environmental assessment, the management of water resources, due diligence, oceanography, health and safety, risk management, town and country planning, building, landscape and urban design, surveying and transport planning.
It is split into two segments: Europe and North America.
com 7 BNE: Europe This business performed well, with an improved margin, and was supported by two high quality acquisitions.
It also benefited from strong growth of our UK planning and development activities, which experienced significantly improved market conditions and client confidence.
2013 2014 2013 constant currency Fee income m 156.7 149.3 146.5 Underlying profit m 21.3 19.2 18.8 Margin % 13.6 12.8 12.9 As defined in note 1g to the consolidated financial statements.
Those of our activities exposed to operational environments, such as providing environmental management advice, continued to need to offer an efficient, cost effective service to assist clients manage tight budgets.
Even in these markets we secured good performances, particularly from our Dutch business and our UK businesses providing support to the nuclear and defence industries.
The acquisition of Clear Environmental Consultants announced on 10 April has extended the range of our UK water activities.
It will assist the strategic development of this business in 2015: this will be important at a time when we will be seeking to renew and win a significant number of contracts with the UK water utilities.
The acquisition of CgMs announced on 11 August has extended the range of our UK planning activities and will assist the strategic development of this fast growing business.
Both businesses have integrated well and should add materially to our result in 2015.
We anticipate this business should show further good growth this year.
BNE: North America This business delivered a good result and remains well positioned in attractive sectors of the expanding North American market.
It is primarily focussed on providing environmental management support to our clients and undertaking projects in the energy infrastructure market.
2013 2014 2013 constant currency Fee income m 41.3 32.7 30.9 Underlying profit m 9.1 8.3 7.8 Margin % 22.0 25.4 25.2 As defined in note 1g to the consolidated financial statements.. Reorganisation costs: 2014 nil: 2013 nil..
The acquisition of GaiaTech announced on 20 May was an important step in the development of this business, giving us access to new markets and geography particularly in relation to environmental due diligence, a high margin activity.
It has integrated well and has already begun to make an important contribution.
Those parts of the BNE business closest to oil and gas E&P activities experienced only modest expenditure tightening from clients.
Staff retention became difficult in the part of the business involved in permitting and licensing of industrial facilities.
This significantly reduced the anticipated performance.
The oceanography businesses performed well.
We announced on 13 February 2015 the acquisition of a leading water and transportation consultancy in Texas.
Klotz Associates Inc KAI has 116 staff and is headquartered in Houston with other offices in the main cities of Texas.
In the year ended 31 December 2014 it had revenue of $26.2 million 17.2 million, and profit before tax of $3.6 million 2.4 million adjusted for non-recurring items.
It was acquired for $24.1 million 15.9 million all payable in cash, of which $16.9 million 11.1 million was paid at closing, with the balance payable over two years.
Adding GaiaTech and KAI to our North American business gives us confidence about the performance in 2015.
Australia Asia Pacific AAP This business is a combination of the former BNE: AAP and the AAP component of Energy.
They were brought together in 2013 to take advantage of the opportunities in the integrated energy and energy infrastructure market: this has helped counter the significant impact of the severe slow down in investment in the resources sector in this region on our business during the year.
The acquisition of Point, announced on 18 September, together with Whelans announced on 27 February, both property consultants, enabled the business as a whole to grow its profit on a constant currency basis.

Throughout this year our mining and energy clients in AAP have remained focused on operational efficiency rather than capital expenditure on new project development.
As a result a significant number of projects have been delayed or cancelled, with this trend continuing until the year end.
We have, therefore, continued to reduce our cost base.
This is helping stabilise our performance ahead of market recovery.
As we reposition the business we are benefiting from increased client investment in urban development and public sector infrastructure projects.
State funding in Queensland and Victoria has been slowed by recent changes of Government, but they remain attractive markets.
Our position in this sector, particularly in respect of Federal agencies, has been significantly reinforced with the acquisition of Point.
Overall we are expecting an improved performance in 2015.
Group Strategy and Prospects RPS is well positioned in markets of importance to the global economy.
Our strategy of building multi-disciplinary businesses in each of the regions in which we operate continues to be both attractive and successful.
Despite currency headwinds and uncertainty across the resources sectors our flexible business model, diversity of operations and experienced management enabled us to deliver further growth in 2014.
We intend to develop organically, whilst continuing to seek further acquisition opportunities.
Our balance sheet is strong and supports this strategy.
The acquisitions made in 2014 have integrated extremely well and will make a significant contribution this year.
We have already built on this with the recent acquisition of KAI and expect further transactions during the course of the year.
We believe our positioning and business model should deliver a successful outcome and further growth in the current year.
