We continue to refine and update the model to focus on the development programme choices required for the revised STUDY OF TGT full FDP.
Forward Plans COMMISIONED IN 2014 At this time, the HLJOC partners are preparing an update to the TGT FDP for submission to the relevant Vietnamese authorities.
The updated HAS SIGNIFICANTLY FDP will incorporate the development plans for the TGT field beyond 2015.
The conclusions of the ERCE work were shared with the HLJOC ADVANCED OUR Partners as part of this process, as the work suggests a substantial increase in oil recovery can be achieved.
UNDERSTANDING Clearly, the scope of the development programme in the updated FDP will, to a large extent, depend OF THE FIELD on the oil price outlook at the time and JOC partners alignment on a development path and appetite to commit capital.
In light of the current oil price, Group production guidance for 2015, at 10,500-12,000 boepd, is lower than 2014 production performance reflecting the reduced scope of 2015 TGT drilling, limited to wells approved under the original FDP and the H5 FDP, as well as conservative estimates of initial flow rates from H5.
Production from TGT could be increased from the existing well stock TGT Performance Evaluation and Prediction by perforating additional horizons, optimising In 2013, SOCO retained ERCE to build a Dynamic reservoir management by shutting off higher Simulation Model of the TGT field.
