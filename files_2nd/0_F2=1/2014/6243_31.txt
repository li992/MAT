com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Performance What we said we would do in 2014 Key developments in the year Annual silver production fell 11.7% from its 2013 level mainly due to lower Increase development rate to 3,300 metres per month ore grades, from 285 g t in 2013 to 258 g t in 2014.
This was due to: Conduct detailed engineering for the pyrites plant: pending approval, the expected natural decline in silver ore grade: initiate construction in 2H 2014 higher dilution in some stopes at the San Carlos and San Mateo areas Start the engineering to deepen the San Carlos shaft in order to reduce due to rock conditions: and haulage costs and gain access to deeper ore reserves limited access to a number of stopes at the San Carlos, San Mateo and San Alberto areas as a result of the delay in development activities: this What we did in 2014 was due to contractor delays caused by equipment malfunction.
Increased rate of stope development to 3,320 metres per month: In contrast, gold production in 2014 increased 7.9% due to higher ore however, access to several stopes was limited by contractor delays grades and, to a lesser extent, higher recovery rates.
Took measures to increase development rates and mitigate decrease We are confident that we have clearly identified the measures necessary inore grades to address the issues experienced at Fresnillo, and have appointed Commenced detailed preparatory engineering for the pyrites plant: an external consultant to verify our findings.
To control dilution we will approved minimise the height of mine stopes banks, conduct further blasting training and decrease stope lengths to improve precision in the Began basic engineering and preparatory mining works for deepening drilling activities.
Additional contractors were brought on to increase theSan Carlos shaft development rates and ensure the continuity of development activities.
Obtained OHSAS 18001 certification Over the year, we increased development rates to 3,320 metres per month: however, access to a number of stopes was limited due to the What we plan to do in 2015 aforementioned contractor delays.
We expect to increase the rate of development to 4,000 metres per month in 2015, ahead of the capacity Further increase rate of development at Fresnillo to 4,000 metres expansion at Fresnillo to 10,000 tpd.
In addition, we plan to finalise the permonth detailed engineering for the pyrites plant and commence its construction, Finalise detailed engineering of pyrites plant and commence as wellas continue the preparatory works to deepen the San Carlos shaft, construction aproject that is expected to conclude in 2018 four years of construction.
Continue preparatory works to deepen San Carlos shaft We expect silver ore grades to average approximately 250 g t in 2015, Expand tailings dam andapproximately 265 g t in the long term.
We expect the volumes of oremilled in 2015 to increase due to efficiencies in the milling process andthe additional volumes of ore processed from the development works at the mine.
Silver contained in resources decreased by 5.9% to 753.0 million ounces whilst in terms of reserves, silver content decreased by 17.4% to 229.3 million ounces.
This resulted from the 7.7% decrease in silver price used to calculate reserves and resources, as well as delayed development.
2014 Adjusted 2014 Capex US$ revenue US$ Capital expenditures 175.9m Total capex of US$175.9 million in 2014 was allocated mainly to mine 460.3m development and sustaining capex.
This figure does not include mining 9.3% works at San Julin and acquisition of equipment at Orisyvo wholly 21.8% owned by Minera Fresnillo where US$112.3 million and US$1.2 million, respectively, were invested in 2014.
In 2015 capex will be allocated to equipment replacement, preparation of new stopes and the continuation of preparatory works to deepen the San Carlos shaft, which will reduce haulage costs and increase access to ore reserves at deeper levels of the mine.
Based on the progress of mine stope development, we expect to commence the expansion of milling capacity in 2015 and commercial production to start in 2017.
This will include the adjustments necessary to process higher lead and zinc ore grades.
The construction of a pyrites plant to increase gold and silver recovery from tailings at Fresnillo and Saucito is discussed in more detail on page 72.
