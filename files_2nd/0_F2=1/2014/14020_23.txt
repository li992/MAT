siGn-on AwARds Derek Harding was appointed as Group Finance Director from 2 September 2013.
In structuring his recruitment package, the Committee sought as much as possible to partly compensate him for the forfeited entitlements from his previous employer with awards that vest over longer time periods which are subject to performance conditions based on the longer-term performance of Senior and take into account the expected value of the awards.
The basis and terms of his sign-on awards were fully disclosed in the 2013 Remuneration Report.
In recognition of the fact that Derek Harding was relinquishing awards from his previous employment which were close to vesting or maturity, a cash payment of 100,000 was paid to Derek Harding in December 2013 and the Committee granted him the following awards: Face value Number Form of award of award of shares Vesting conditions Deferred Share Award under Listing Rule 9.4.

At 31 December 2014, awards outstanding and shares issued in the previous 10 years under all share plans the Senior plc 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP and the 2006 Savings-Related Share Option Plan the Sharesave Plan amounted to 6.21% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 31 December 2014, awards outstanding and shares issued in the previous 10 years under executive discretionary plans the LTIP amounted to 3.26% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
Typically, share awards are satisfied by the issue of new shares, except for the Enhanced SMIS deferred bonus share award and Derek Hardings Share Award where market purchased shares are used.
The Remuneration Committee monitors the flow rates of the Companys share plans, in particular before new share awards are made, to ensure the flow rates remain within the ABI dilution guidelines.
stAtement oF diRectoRs shAReholdinG And shARe inteRests Audited inFoRmAtion The Remuneration Committee encourages Directors to own shares in the Company and, in support of this policy, it expects executive Directors to retain at least 50% of the shares that vest under the LTIP, after allowing for tax liabilities, until a shareholding equivalent in value to 100% of base salary is built up.
Based on the executive Directors 2014 base salaries, Mark Rollins had a holding of 491% of base salary and Derek Harding had a holding of 66% of base salary in the Companys shares.
Deferred share awards are not taken into account for these purposes.
Shares are valued using the Companys closing share price on 31 December 2014 of 303.2p.

The Committee has selected approximately 150 of the Groups senior managers in Europe and North America, as the operations in these territories deliver approximately 90% of the Groups revenue, and these senior managers have broadly similarly structured remuneration packages.
Businesses acquired by Senior during the year and leavers and joiners in either year have been excluded to prevent distortion.

In 2015, he was awarded a salary of 472,000, representing a 1.9% increase on his 2014 salary of 463,000.
He has decided to waive 54,000 of his 2015 salary, so taking a salary of 418,000.
2 A benchmarking exercise found the fees paid for the Chairs of Audit and Remuneration and for the role of the Senior Independent Director were well below the rates paid for such roles in similar organisations and consequently increases in excess of inflation were considered appropriate.
After these increases, the fees remain around lower quartile.
