The Companys benchmark is the FTSE All-Share Index excluding constituents of the FTSE 100 Index and investment trusts with net dividends reinvested.
4 The fair value of the Companys debentures have been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield from a similarly dated gilt plus a margin based on the 5 year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.
6 Management fee and all other operating expenses excluding finance costs, expressed as a percentage of the average daily net assets during the year.
Ongoing Charges are calculated in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies in May 2012 using debt at par value and replaces the Total Expense Ratio published in previous years.
7 Gearing represents the excess amount above shareholders funds of total assets expressed as a percentage of the shareholders funds.
Total assets include total investments and net current assets liabilities less cash cash equivalents and excluding bank loans of less than one year.
If the amount calculated is negative, this is shown as a net cash position.
