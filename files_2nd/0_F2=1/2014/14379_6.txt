Outlook We have made material progress in reshaping Smith & Nephew for higher growth since 2011.
Whilst the journey to transform Smith & Nephew continues, increasingly we expect to benefit from the actions and investments we have made.
We expect the Group to deliver higher underlying revenue growth in 2015 than in 2014.
We also expect to deliver a further improvement in trading profit margin.
Additionally, we expect the effective corporate tax rate on trading results to reduce to slightly above 27% in 2015, absent any changes to tax legislation.
This is incremental to the 220bps reduction achieved in the last two years.
We believe the Group is at the start of a new and exciting phase in its 158-year history.
Sincerely, Julie Brown Chief Financial Officer Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 17
