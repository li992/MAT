fT. 75 55,000 The West End has become more popular % Of CuRRENT INCOME as a place to live over recent years, which has led to sustained demand for reasonably-priced apartments to rent.
This has allowed us to convert smaller offices, which are no longer able to 12% meet the requirements of modern occupiers, to residential use.
Consequently, residential has become an increasing part of our business, now representing 12% of our current income, having been just 4% ten years ago.
Occupancy levels in our apartments, which are generally positioned as mid-market, are high and, with rising CuRRENT RESIDENTIAL INCOME demand and rents, they produce a BY VILLAGE growing and reliable income stream.
During the year, the number of apartments we own has increased by 21 to 491, largely as a result of conversions of smaller, poor-quality offices.
We continue to identify opportunities to create further apartments.
We are also now reconfiguring and upgrading some of our existing flats to improve their rental prospects.
With good demand throughout the year, we completed lettings and renewals totalling 4.9m, representing 45.8% of our current residential income.
At year end we had just two apartments available to let in the wholly-owned portfolio and one in the Longmartin joint venture.
