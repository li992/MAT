Strategic report Group performance A summary of our group financial and operating performance.
10-point plan performance In 2014 we completed our three-year 10-point plan, established in 2011, to help stabilize BP and restore trust and value in response to the tragic Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010.
Here we report on our performance in delivering the plan over the period.
Relentless focus on safety Active portfolio management 1 6 We reduced tier 1 process safety events and loss of primary We completed our $38-billion divestment programme ahead of containment LOPC by 62% and 21% respectively over the plan schedule and plan for a further $10 billion of divestments before period.
However, in 2014 there were eight more tier 1 events and the end of 2015, with $4.7 billion of sales already agreed.
Safety remains our primary New upstream projects onstream with unit cash margins focus and we continue to focus our efforts on it.
7 double the 2011 average We started up 15 major upstream projects, of which 13 are in the 2 Play to our strengths 2 We accessed almost 158,000 km exploration acres, made 13 new four higher-margin areas Angola, Azerbaijan, Gulf of Mexico and North Sea.
Average forecast unit cash margins 2014-23 for the 15 discoveries and drilled a total of 44 exploration wells 2014 18. projects at $100 bbl oil price were more than double the 2011 3 Stronger and more focused upstream segment average.
We have reshaped our portfolio to have a set of high-value deepwater assets, gas value chains, giant elds, and 8 Generate around 50% more in operating cash ow by 2014 a versus 2011 a high-quality downstream business.
We sold around half of our upstream installations and pipelines, and one third of We reported $32.8 billion of operating cash ow in 2014 averaged oil price of $98.95 bbl, averaged Henry Hub gas price of our wells while retaining roughly 90% of our proved reserves and production.

More visibility and transparency to value 5 Strong balance sheet We provide downstream results by fuels, petrochemicals and 10 Our gearing stayed within our target range of 10-20%, lubricants, and report earnings from Rosneft as a separate decreasing from 20.4% in 2011 to 16.7% at the end of 2014. operating segment.
Increasing value Delivering our goal of value over volume means tough decisions can be necessary to make the best financial choices for BP.
An important part of our portfolio in the Gulf of Mexico is the deepwater Atlantis eld which is early in its life cycle.
To increase recovery from the eld, we had planned to install new subsea infrastructure, requiring a long and expensive construction period.
When reassessing our eld development plan we concluded that our approach would not generate the most value from the eld, so we decided to look for an alternative solution.
By using our existing subsea facilities to safely drill future wells, rather than building new infrastructure, we aim to deliver just as much value to BP as originally planned, while requiring millions less in capital expenditure and reducing corresponding risk and demand for resources.
The change in plan could signicantly increase the Atlantis elds capital efficiency and cash ow over the next five years.
This focus on capital allocation discipline is being rigorously applied on all of our elds around the world.
We only select the best options that maximize value.
a Assumed an oil price of $100 bbl and a Henry Hub gas price of $5 mmBtu in 2014.
2011 excluded BPs share of TNK-BP dividends: 2014 included BPs share of Rosneft dividends.
The projection included the impact of payments in respect of federal criminal and securities claims with the US government and SEC where settlements have already been reached, but does not reect any cash ows relating to other liabilities, contingent liabilities, settlements or contingent assets arising from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
