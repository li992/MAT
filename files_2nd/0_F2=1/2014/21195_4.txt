| 02 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Wigan, United Kingdom Lindas story nsurance can make a real difference to peoples lives.
Linda Hunns has had critical illness cover with Aviva since 2002.
I enjoyed life to the full as a mother and grandmother.
I loved going for walks and prided myself on keeping fit, as well as enjoying my part-time job at the local hospital.
A routine mammogram showed I had breast cancer.
Luckily wed caught it early and the cancer was very small, but I still had a gruelling time with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Everything else had to take a back seat.
Once Id started treatment I remembered that I had critical illness cover with Aviva and might be able to make a claim.
I spoke to a young girl with a lovely manner.
She told me that I would receive the money once the hospital had confirmed the type of cancer.
Aviva even sorted out all the confirmations for me.
The service I received from Aviva was excellent.
I cant tell you how much this money meant to me.
It meant one less thing to worry about and so it hugely helped in my recovery.
I went back to work in February and things are getting back to normal.
In fact, I turned 60 this year and celebrated by taking the whole family away for a week in the sun.
The money meant one less thing to worry about and so it hugely helped in my recovery.
