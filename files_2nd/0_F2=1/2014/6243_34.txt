In March 2014 full operations resumed at Herradura following a temporary explosives suspension as a result of a court order regarding the Ejido El Bajo litigation process.
In the same month, we saw the start-up of the dynamic leaching plant at the mine.
Full year gold production having acquired full ownership of the Penmont assets remained at similar levels to 2013 0.4% as a result of the gold production ramp-up at Herradura, the contribution of ore processed at the DLP following its start-up, and higher ore grade.
These factors mitigated the adverse impacts of: i expected lower production from the heap leaching process during its ramp-up to the pads reaching their steady state post the temporary suspension of explosives: ii an excess of suspended solids in solution resulting from the start-up of the new DLP: Gender diversity at Penmont 2014 Adjusted 2014 Capex US$ At 12%, Penmont has the largest participation of women among our revenue US$ units.
