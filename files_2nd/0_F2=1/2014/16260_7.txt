This section provides insight into how UBM progressed during 2014 against the previous strategic KPIs below and its three strategic priorities of: organic growth, portfolio management and sustainable performance.
More detail about these three priorities can be found on pages 1113 of last years 2013 Annual Report.
In 2015, we shall benchmark UBMs performance against new KPIs which are aligned with the Events First strategy.

We delivered underlying revenue growth in our key Events and PR Newswire businesses, whilst continuing to tighten our focus on Events with four event acquisitions, notably Advanstar, and three small disposals in OMS.
We also made further progress against the People & Culture and Responsible Business initiatives for sustainable performance.
In May, Tim Cobbold joined the Group as CEO and, in November, set out UBMs Events First strategy to become the worlds leading B2B events business.
UBM will drive profitable growth by focusing its resources on its largest and most profitable shows and those with the potential to become large, aligning its OMS activities with those events, increasing its efficiency and effectiveness through the consistent use of standardised systems and focusing on operational excellence.
During 2014 we delivered To implement the strategy UBM expects to underlying revenue growth in make capital investments of approximately 15m during 201517 and associated our key Events and PR Newswire implementation and rationalisation costs of between 15m and 20m also during businesses, whilst continuing to 201517 which are expected to be taken as operating expenses.
These investments tighten our focus on Events are expected to give rise to annualised cost savings beginning in 2016 which will build Robert Gray to 10m per annum.
In the medium term, Chief Financial Officer the strategy will enable UBM to grow revenue ahead of global GDP in our Events business and provide a basis for margin expansion.
Near term revenue growth will reflect the decision to rationalise UBMs smaller Events and to exit from certain activities in OMS.
To support this strategy, UBM intends to target a leverage ratio of between 1.52.0 times Net Debt EBITDA which is consistent with investment grade metrics, will provide flexibility for biennial cycles and will provide capacity to invest in the business.
In late December, Advanstar which generated $290.4m revenue and $97.1m EBITDA in 2014 was acquired for $972m financed, in part, through a 564.6m rights issue.
The acquisition had no impact on UBMs 2014 operating results but is an important strategic milestone within our Events First strategy.
