13 Business model and strategy Our Strategy After five years spent restoring fundamental soundness to the bank, we have created a strategy and a structure that provides us with an exciting opportunity.
Over the next few years, we are going to focus all of our energy on earning back the trust we lost in 2008.
And in doing so, RBS is going to change the UK banking sector for the better.
Our Priorities Strength and Customer Simplifying Supporting Employee sustainability experience the bank growth engagement We have a long way to go to be the bank that our customers deserve.
But we are in a period of very significant, positive change.
We have millions of great customers, tens of thousands of outstanding employees, and a home economy that is getting stronger.
By building on this foundation, we can achieve our ambition to be number one for customer service, trust and advocacy in all our chosen markets.
Our Plan Our overarching ambition is to become the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.
We have set out how we track our progress towards this goal on page 15.
We also track a number of other performance measures and have set long-term targets for these to keep us on track.

15 Business model and strategy Building the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy in the UK We use independent surveys to measure our customers experience and track our progress against our goal in each of our markets.
Net Promoter Score NPS Customers are asked how likely they would be to recommend their bank to a friend or colleague, and respond based on a 0-10 scale with 10 indicating extremely likely and 0 indicating not at all likely.
Customers scoring 0 to 6 are termed detractors and customers scoring 9 to 10 are termed promoters.
The Net Promoter Score NPS is established by subtracting the proportion of detractors from the proportion of promoters.
In 2014, we have seen some positive NPS movements in some of our franchises and our plans for 2015 will help to gather momentum across the bank.

Customer Trust We also use independent experts to measure our customers trust in the bank.
Each quarter we ask customers to what extent they trust or distrust their bank to do the right thing.
The score is a net measure of those customers that trust their bank a lot or somewhat minus those that distrust their bank a lot or somewhat.

Measured as a net of those that trust RBS NatWest to do the right thing, less those that do not.
Latest base sizes: NatWest England & Wales 927, RBS Scotland 206.
The year-on-year improvement in RBS customer trust is largely a reversion to its longer-term trend: there were issues in late 2013 that impacted the banks reputation and customer trust.
There are early signs that customer trust in RBS is stabilising and starting to improve.
NatWest has consistently performed competitively, and has shown early signs of improvement.
We will continue to aim for improvement through a secure, consistent and reliable service, and an unrelenting focus on our customers.
