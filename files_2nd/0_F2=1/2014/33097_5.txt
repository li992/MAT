KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS MEASURING PERFORMANCE During 2014, we reviewed the Key Performance Indicators KPIs by which we monitor our business.
This was to ensure they provided the most appropriate metrics for monitoring the achievement of the Groups three strategic priorities which are designed to deliver value for shareholders.
In order to better align the KPIs with these strategic priorities we have introduced three new KPIs: Cost ratio, Leasing activity and Global emissions intensity ratio.
The Groups seven KPIs are split between financial and operational measures and the KPIs and associated benchmarks are set out below.
