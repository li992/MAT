Service contracts may be terminated without notice and without payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of cessation, on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct.
The Committees normal policy on termination is to make phased compensatory payments and to reduce or stop such payments to former Executive Directors where they receive remuneration from other employment during the notice period where this is consistent with local employment legislation and market practice.
Termination payments will not exceed contractual entitlements.
For future directors contracts, if the Company exercises its right to make a payment in lieu of notice PILON, these such payments will not exceed an amount equal to basic salary for any unexpired notice period.

The Companys remuneration policy, as set out in the policy report on pages 60 to 65, results in a significant proportion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.

Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows: Minimum: fixed remuneration only i. e. latest known salary, benefits and pension.
Target: fixed remuneration plus half of maximum annual bonus opportunity plus 25% vesting of performance shares.
Note that the Company does not have a stated target for its financial measures or incentive payouts.
Maximum: fixed remuneration plus maximum annual bonus opportunity plus 100% vesting of performance shares.
