We generate cash flow from our high-margin producing assets, which is then appropriately allocated to exploration activities, costs and dividends.
Our exploration activity is the feedstock of our portfolio and success gives us options to monetise assets and maximise value at various points in the life cycle.
We selectively develop the oil we find, focusing on world-class development projects that are economically viable and will return sustainable future cash flows.
When surplus cash is generated, a decision will be made to either reinvest this into additional operational activities or return cash to shareholders.
