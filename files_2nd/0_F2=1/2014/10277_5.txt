10 Overview How we performed The Group continues to build strong foundations for further growth through a carefully executed asset management strategy.
Results from this in 2014 included the completion of the guest room refurbishment at the Grand Hyatt Taipei, the acquisition of new properties in London, New York and Rome, as well as the opening of a newly constructed hotel in Tokyos Ginza district.
Our results in 2013 were boosted significantly by the recognition of revenue and profit on the Glyndebourne development.
