Good cost control, benefits from the restructuring of the Neusiedler mill in Austria, completed in 2013, and lower input costs provided some 148m offset to these headwinds.
250 Demand for uncoated fine paper increased by around 1% in Europe, while Russian 16.9 16.7 16.7 16.0 16.1 demand is estimated to have declined by approximately 3% compared to the 200 previous year.

Average benchmark uncoated fine paper selling prices were down 2% year on year in million Europe.
Selling price increases were implemented during the year in Russia, although ROCE % these were not sufficient to fully offset the negative impact of the weaker rouble.
Following the significant devaluation of the rouble towards the end of the year, a 15% price increase in the domestic Russian market was implemented in February 2015.
In Europe, price increases of 5-8% were announced to take effect from the end of the first quarter of 2015.
The business benefited from lower wood costs in Russia, with local currency increases more than offset by the weaker rouble.
Wood costs in central Europe were up marginally.
Significantly lower gas and chemical input costs provided a further benefit to the business.
A continued focus on cost optimisation meant that fixed costs were contained well within inflationary levels.
The benefits of the recently completed recovery boiler replacement in Ruomberok are expected to be fully realised in 2015.

The most significant capital project completed during the year was the 128 million replacement of the recovery boiler in Ruomberok, Slovakia.
The recovery boiler will make the mill totally electricity self-sufficient and will provide significant benefits in the form of increased operating efficiency and reduced operating costs, while also providing additional pulp capacity.
Pleasingly, despite the large project and complex maintenance shuts being completed, our safety performance has continued to improve.
Through our Top 5 Fatal Risks initiative and focus on moving rotating equipment and working at heights, we have identified our most critical risks and developed action plans to engineer these risks out or reduce them to an acceptable level.
We continue to engage with the local communities surrounding our operations in Russia, Austria and Slovakia as our mills are in close proximity to the local population.
We partner with our communities to increase their understanding and awareness of our operations and to address community needs and concerns on a proactive basis.
