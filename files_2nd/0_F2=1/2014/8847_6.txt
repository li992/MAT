We have seen a continued focus by customers on their costs in the North Sea and have responded by delivering a number of solutions including implementing two cuts to contractor rates in May and December, which together reduce these costs to customers by around 20%.
We continue to work with our customers to safely deliver production optimisation, asset life extension and operating cost management programmes which are becoming increasingly important in this mature basin.
Internationally, we have secured and commenced work on a number of important contracts.
These include EPCM services for Woodside in Australia and ExxonMobil in Malaysia, and brownfield engineering and procurement support work for ExxonMobil in Papua New Guinea.
In the Middle East we are seeing expansion in Iraq with BP and Taqa.
