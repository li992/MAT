Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 53 STRATEGIC REPORT COAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Australia and Canada Australia and Canada Australia and Canada achieved record metallurgical coal Peace River Coal operations in Canada were placed on care production of 20.9 Mt, chiefly attributable to a step change and maintenance in December 2014 owing to weak market in performance at Grasstree following its implementation conditions.
The Drayton South project which was intended of the management operating system and improvements to extend the life of Drayton mine has not yet received across all Australian open cut operations.
A new development application and accompanying Environmental Impact Statement will be Australian export thermal coal production decreased by submitted early in 2015.
17%, mainly the result of lower production at the Drayton open cut mine as the mine nears the end of its life.
Metallurgical coal production in 2015 is expected to remain broadly flat at 20 to 21 Mt as the increase in output Underground operations increased production by 11% from Australian underground operations and Grosvenor to record their best ever output.
This was offset, however, development coal will be offset by the suspension of activity by a 14% decrease in production at Moranbah North, from at Peace River Coal.

Foxleigh open cut mine recorded a record output, reflecting productivity improvements.
South Africa Export production at 18.2 Mt was 7% higher, with all operations delivering an increase in production.
Trade mine productivity, measured through the percentage of benchmark overall equipment effectiveness, increased by 6% for the underground operations and 5% for the opencast operations.
Domestic production at 37.6 Mt decreased by 5%, primarily owing to Eskom reducing offtake from New Vaal, and planned production decreases at Kriel prior to a move to new mining areas.
Colombia Our share of Cerrejns output of 11.2 Mt was 2% higher than in 2013.
In 2014, production was impacted by high dust emissions associated with the extended drought conditions that constrained production up until August, followed by heavy rainfall that led to production stoppages.

Our Coal South Africa business has developed and patented quality of existing rehabilitation by increasing the organic bioconversion technology that could significantly accelerate content and the humic acid concentrations in the soil, and improve the quality of opencast mine rehabilitation.
thereby improving vegetation health and reducing soil compaction which is a significant rehabilitation challenge Known as Fungcoal, the process harnesses fungi and facing the industry.

The technology was trialled at four of our coal mines at a collective cost of $1.5 million.
The outcomes of the research The next steps will be to establish a thorough record showed that certain fungi have the ability to break down and of land rehabilitated with Fungcoal and to gain a greater liquefy coal that has been exposed to the elements.
In certain understanding of the products use in other applications applications, it showed extremely positive results, both on and over a longer period of time.
