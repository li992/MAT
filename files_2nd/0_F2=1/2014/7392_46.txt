External appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-forprofit appointments, and that these can broaden the experience, network and knowledge of the Director, from which Hikma can benefit.
Executive Directors may accept external appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest and are allowed to retain any fees.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of $10,000 2013: $10,000 and $10,000 2013: $10,000 respectively relating to external appointments which are detailed in their Director profiles on page 56.
The process for controlling these appointments is described in the governance statement on page 72.
Closing statement We have further developed our approach to remuneration reporting this year and the Committee hopes that this has aided shareholder and stakeholder understanding of our remuneration policy and practices.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or observations.
