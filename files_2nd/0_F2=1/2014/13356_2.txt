Everybody knows what their perfect pub looks like.
Each of ours has its own style and personality and youll always find a warm welcome, set against a backdrop of ageless interiors.
Mostly set in beautiful rural or semirural locations, each pub has a local feel and many are set in intriguing buildings with fascinating histories.
We dont want all our pubs to look and feel the same instead we preserve the character of the building, which after all was what attracted us to the property in the first place.
We serve a wide selection of cask ales which change frequently and always try to include a local brew or two.
We have decent but not over the top wines and the essence of our freshly prepared food is classic British dishes complemented by more exotic influences from other parts of the world: what we believe is modern British cookery.
Seasonal and local specials mean the menu always offers new choices alongside trusted favourites each time you visit.
Theres friendly, engaging service from the moment you arrive, ensuring that all your needs are taken care of.
