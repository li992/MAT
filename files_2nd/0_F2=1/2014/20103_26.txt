Strategic report Governance Remuneration Committee continued Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Remuneration report for 2014.
I am happy to confirm that the implementation of Executive Director remuneration, in 2014, complied fully with our Remuneration policy agreed by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014.
We also comply with the Government Department for Business, Innovation and Skills reporting regulations on Directors pay, introduced in October 2013.
This report has been split into three sections: Statement by the Chairman of the Committee An Annual report on remuneration 2014 which explains how the Remuneration policy has been implemented during the year ended 31stDecember 2014 The approved Remuneration policy which describes and explains the components of the Companys Remuneration policy, unchanged from 2013.
We will seek your support for the Annual report on remuneration, in the form of an advisory vote, at the AGM on 11th May 2015.
We would like to thank shareholders for their support of the Annual report on remuneration 2013 and the Remuneration policy 2014.
At the AGM on 20th May 2014, the advisory vote on the Annual report on remuneration 2013 received 99.4% of the votes in favour and the binding vote on the Remuneration policy 2014 received 98.5% of the votes in favour.
The Remuneration policy was implemented immediately following the AGM.
We have continued to actively seek and take into account the views of shareholders when reviewing Executive Director remuneration.
The Committee is satisfied that the Remuneration policy continues to reflect the interests of shareholders and aligns Executive Director remuneration with Company strategy, while allowing the Group to attract and retain motivated and talented individuals.
Executive Director salary reviews 2015 Salaries were reviewed in accordance with the Remuneration policy taking into account Company and individual performance, wider workforce comparisons and market benchmarking.
In line with policy, Nick Andersons salary on appointment was set below what would normally be paid for this position and below the market median, with the intention, subject to performance, of realignment over the next two or three years.
Considering this and Nicks strong performance in his first year as Group Chief Executive, the Committee agreed to an initial increase in his salary of 4.2%, which is higher than the average increase for the broader UK employee population this year of around 2%.
Jay Whalen also received a 4.2% increase, which is higher than the USA average increase of 3%.
Jay is now permanently located in the USA and revised market data was obtained for a divisional head of a UK parent located in the USA to ensure Jays remuneration is competitive in that market.
Jays performance in achieving consistently good results at WMFTG was considered as excellent by the Board.
Both Nick Andersons and Jay Whalens salaries remain below market median.
Business performance As noted in the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3, the Company made further progress in 2014 with Group revenue up 5% and pre-tax profit up 12%, both at constant currency, contributing to earnings per share EPS growth of 13% at constant currency, or 1% at reported exchange rates, and a Return on Capital Employed ROCE of 44.6% as determined under the annual bonus plan rules.
Over the three-year period ending in 2014, the Company delivered a total shareholder return TSR of 65.2%.
A 9% increase in the total dividend for theyear excluding the special dividend, extends our dividend record to 47 years.
Our Remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a significant percentage of Executive Director pay is based on the achievement of demanding performance targets and is, therefore, at risk.
Maximum payout in the annual bonus plan and Performance Share Plan PSP is only available as a result of significant outperformance by the business.
The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to Executive Directors in 2014 given as a single figure for each Director on page 78 reflects the progress made by the Company during 2014, as well as over the last three years.
Annual bonuses are based on adjusted operating profit and ROCE targets.
The Group profit achievement of 153,509,000 as determined under the annual bonus plan rules was 1.5% below the plan target and the ROCE achieved of 44.6% was 1.1% above the 44.1% plan target.
These achievements resulted in a 55.76% bonus award for the Group Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Other Executive Directors' targets have an additional divisional profit element and details of their bonus targets and level of achievement can be found on pages 79 and 80.
Continuing difficult macro-economic conditions have resulted in some of the demanding performance targets in the PSP only being partially met.
Shares awarded in the PSP up to 2013 vest based on growth of two measures TSR 60% and EPS 40% over the three-year plan period.
Performance on the EPS measure resulted in a nil vesting.
A 65.2% increase in TSR in the three years to 2014 triggered a 55.1% award for the TSR element.
The total number of shares vesting under both elements was therefore 33.06% of the total shares awarded.
Details of bonus and PSP awards can be found on pages 80 and 81.
76 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Board changes in 2014 As reported in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, Nick Anderson was appointed Group Chief Executive in January 2014.
In light of his new appointment, the Committee reviewed Nicks contract and remuneration package to ensure compliance with the Remuneration policy and, in line with that policy, his salary on appointment was set below median and below what would normally be paid for this position.
It isthe Committees intention that all new appointments to the Board, or significant changes to the scale, scope or responsibilities of existing Executive Directors, will result in new contracts being agreed in accordance with the policy.
For more information see Service agreements and termination policy on pages 94 and 95.
Committee change in 2014 As previously reported, Gareth Bullock stepped down as Chairman of the Committee in December 2013.
He also retired as an independent Non-Executive Director and Senior Independent Director in May 2014.
Jamie Pike was appointed as an independent Non-Executive Director and Senior Independent Director in May 2014 and has joined the Remuneration Committee.
Our Remuneration policy and links to strategy The elements of Executive Director remuneration are described and explained in the Policy table on pages 90 to 92.
The principal aims of the Committee, as it reviews and establishes remuneration policy, are outlined below: 1 To maintain a competitive remuneration package that will attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the calibre required to meet the Groups strategic objectives both in the short and long term.
2 To align the interests of shareholders and Executive Directors.
This will be achieved through the use of long-term incentives, which reward TSR and EPS growth, and by requiring Executive Directors to build a significant shareholding themselves, ensuring that they are directly exposed to the same degree of gains or losses as all other shareholders.
3 To support the achievement of the Groups strategic priorities to: Increase direct sales effectiveness through sector focus Develop the knowledge and skills of our expert sales and service teams Broaden our global presence Leverage our R&D investments Optimise supply chain effectiveness Operate sustainably and help improve our customers sustainability.
For more details of the strong connection between strategy and remuneration, and the description of performance measures and relevant targets, see the Policy table on pages 90 to 92.
4 To align Executive Director remuneration with financial KPIs.
For more details see the description of performance measures and relevant targets on pages 90 to 92.
5 To ensure that superior awards are only paid for exceptional performance against challenging targets.
Base salary is reviewed annually and takes into account the scale, scope and responsibility of Executive Director roles: the skills and experience of individuals: wider workforce comparisons: and market benchmarking, within a defined external comparator group.
The annual bonus plan and PSP reward financial performance, both absolute and relative, to ensure that there is clear and demonstrable pay for performance.
The Committee believes that the current Remuneration policy, implemented during 2014 and outlined in this Remuneration report, offers a fair and competitive package for Executive Directors: rewarding performance while supporting the interests of shareholders.
Changes for 2015 Performance Share Plan The current Performance Share Plan rules expire on 15th March 2015 and the new rules will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM.

Any bonus payment is based entirely on the achievement of challenging financial measures, which have been chosen as they are clearly aligned with the Companys strategy.

80 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan PSP The Committee makes an annual conditional award of shares to each Executive Director under the PSP.
Prior to award, the Committee reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching.
For financial measures this includes a review of analysts forecasts.
In normal circumstances, the maximum award under the PSP is 100% of base salary but, in exceptional circumstances, this may be increased to 150% of base salary.
Vesting is based on two performance measures, which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy: TSR performance relative to a comparator group Aggregate EPS relative to target aggregate EPS.
Performance is measured over a three-year period.
Clawback provisions apply for PSP awards made from 2012 onwards.
PSP awards vesting over 20122014 In 2012 the Executive Directors received share awards under the PSP, with vesting subject to EPS growth and relative TSR performance.

Increases for the broader UK employee population were on average 2.0%, increasing to 5.0% in accordance with internal guidelines for top performers.

Strategic report Governance Annual report on remuneration 2014 continued Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan PSP EPS growth calculation From 2015 EPS will be measured on a point-to-point basis rather than an aggregate basis as is the case currently see page 140.
The targets will be unchanged, requiring a compound annual growth rate of RPI 3% to RPI 9% per annum.
This change has been made to focus on growth in EPS over the medium to long-term improvements and reduce the risk of one year's performance over-influencing the outcome of three award cycles in either direction.
Expiry and renewal of PSP The current PSP expires on 15th March 2015.
New rules for a replacement PSP, the Spirax-Sarco 2015 Performance Share Plan 2015 PSP, will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
The key changes to the PSP are as follows: Holding period: Committee discretion to grant awards subject to a holding period.
Where a holding period is attached to an award, the default holding period is two years.
The Committee does not intend to apply a holding period to PSP awards granted in 2015 but will keep the application of this provision under review for future grants Malus and clawback: the PSP already covered both malus reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation and clawback reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid.
We have updated the provisions to ensure they can be applied during a holding period Treatment of good leavers: new provisions have been introduced so that, in the future, the Committee can choose the most appropriate timing of vesting considering the individual circumstances of a good leaver.
Currently, we calculate performance at the point employment ceases and settle awards on a time pro rata basis.
We prefer to move to a default wait and see approach for good leavers during the performance period as this provides a longer-term interest in performance after a participants departure and also reduces some of the costs associated with operating the PSP.
We will retain the time pro rata adjustment, and early vesting is maintained in the case of death or at the Committee's discretion.

1.12 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors remuneration Operation of the Remuneration Committee in 2014 Membership and attendance Each of the Committee members is an independent Non-Executive Director and thus brings independence to consideration of all aspects of Board remuneration and the application of professional advice to matters relating to remuneration.
During 2014, the Committee was chaired by Krishnamurthy Rajagopal, and the members comprised Gareth Bullock up to 20th May 2014, Jamie Pike from 1st May 2014 Trudy Schoolenberg and Clive Watson, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
In 2014 the Committee met three times and all members attended each meeting, with the exception of Gareth Bullock, who attended one of the two meetings held prior to his retirement, and Clive Watson, who was absent from one meeting due to a prior commitment.
Jamie Pike attended the one meeting held following his appointment.
Advisers to the Committee During 2014 the Committee sought advice and information from Bill Whiteley, the Chairman, Nick Anderson, the Group Chief Executive and Frank Richardson, the Group Human Resources Director.
None of the invitees participated in any discussions regarding their own remuneration or fees.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee received external advice from Towers Watson.
Towers Watson were appointed by the Committee and provided material advice to the Committee on various matters such as executive remuneration levels and structure, performance updates in respect of the PSP, the remuneration report and attendance at Committee meetings.
Towers Watsons fees in respect of these services totalled 65,000 in 2014.
In addition, Towers Watson work with management on other matters relating to remuneration with the approval of the Committee.
A separate advisory team within Towers Watson provides support and advice to management on pensions and other employee benefit-related matters.
The Committee is of the opinion that the advice received is objective and independent, given that Towers Watson are a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, the manner in which advice is delivered and the separate teams that advise management more generally.
In 2014, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP provided legal advice to the Company which was available to the Committee.
Legal fees relate to advice provided to the Company and not the Committee, and are charged on a time-cost basis.
