Directors' Report Annual Remuneration Report 2013 14 The following sets out the Annual Remuneration Report of SSEs Executive Directors and detailed policy for 2014 15.
The report will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 AGM.
Fixed remuneration Variable remuneration Base salary Short-term annual Long-term three years Annual Incentive Scheme 75% maximum Performance Share Plan PSP 3 years plus cash and 25% deferred shares 2 year holding period Pension final salary Linked to individual and team performance, 20% linked to relative FTSE 100 TSR, 20% corporate, financial and operational MSCI Eur.
Utilities TSR, 20% dividend growth, measures 20% adjusted annual EPS growth and 20% customer satisfaction.
Benefits car, medical and Share Incentive Plan Minimum shareholding guideline equal to 100% of base salary Changes to incentive scheme structures and base salary from 2014 Following a consultation exercise with leading shareholders the Committee will be implementing a number of changes to the remuneration plans for Executive Directors from 2014 15.
The incentives have been reshaped to align more explicitly with both shareholder and customer expectations.
There are no changes to the maximum opportunities.
Annual incentive plan For 2014 15, the structure of the Annual Incentive Plan will change so that assessment of performance is more closely aligned to SSEs business strategy and its responsibility to the customers it serves.
The key differences are the introduction of the additional financial performance measures of cashflow and dividend per share, and an operational measure focussed on the quality of service delivered to SSEs energy supply customers and networks customers.
The maximum annual incentive payable will remain 100% of salary split between profit before tax 30%, dividend per share 10%, cashflow 10%, teamworking 20%, personal objectives 15% and customer performance 15%.
While the Committee has set specific targets for 2014 15 it has chosen not to publish them at this time as they are commercially sensitive.
Performance share plan As with AIP, the structure of the PSP will change so that assessment is more closely aligned to SSEs business strategy and its responsibility to the customers it serves.
From 2014 15, the PSP will have a new measure relating to the quality of service delivered to SSEs energy supply customers.
Adjustments will also be made to the Earnings Per Share EPS and Dividend Per Share DPS targets in the context of our business strategy and shareholder expectations.
Targets are set to be achievable but stretching with the aim of paying around half of maximum levels for good performance.
The PSP will have 5 component factors each worth 20% each.
TSR1 20% TSR2 20% EPS 20% DPS 20% Customer Service 20% Measure Relative position against Relative position against Growth in Adjusted EPS Growth in DPS versus Consumer Futures the FTSE 100 European Utilities versus RPI RPI ranking The Total Shareholder Return TSR measures remain unchanged.
TSR performance is compared to the FTSE 100 and a dedicated peer group of around 30 UK and other European utilities the MSCI Europe Utilities.
This provides a sector emphasis whilst continuing to bring a market perspective to the plan.
For median performance 25% of the maximum of these segments is payable.
For upper quartile 100% is payable.
For EPS growth of RPI, 25% of the maximum of this segment will be payable, 80% will be payable for RPI 5% and 100% will be payable for RPI 8%.
For DPS growth of RPI, 50% of the maximum of this segment will be payable.
100% will be payable for DPS growth at RPI 4%.
In assessing performance against DPS the Committee must be satisfied that a reasonable level of dividend cover has been maintained.
The higher vesting level at entry-level DPS growth reflects the higher degree of stretch of this target.
Taking into account the importance of dividend growth to our shareholders, the Committee sought to operate a principle of no vesting for below RPI growth.
However it is recognised that sustained growth at RPI would be good performance in the context of SSEs business environment and is considered to be a stretching level of performance rather than a threshold level of performance.
The vesting has therefore been set at a higher than usual entry-level vesting of 50% for achieving this stretch target.
Customer performance will be measured against the Consumer Futures Complaints League Table.
This is an independently verified measure which ranks customer performance based on a measure of customer complaints.
For customer performance ranking below the top 2 large suppliers 0% of the maximum segment will be payable, for ranking at 2, 50% will be payable.
For ranking at 1, 100% will be payable.
Within this group ranking 3rd would be an above median entry level performance.
The Committee, however, set the threshold at what would be a more stretching level of 2nd position, with vesting of 50% for achievement of this position.
The Committee considers that the new performance measures and targets will represent a balanced assessment of SSEs performance.
The Committee reserves the right to exercise discretion to override an award, even if a measure has been met, if there has been a failure in how a part of the business has been delivered.
As part of the changes to the PSP, the Committee has also decided to apply an additional 2 year holding period after vesting for the Executive Directors.
Base salary The Committee gave consideration to the appropriate base salary increase for Chief Executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies.
When reaching its conclusions the Committee considered the fact that he had been appointed at a salary that more than 15% below that of the previous incumbent.
In addition, the Committee also took into account the excellent start Mr Phillips-Davies has made to the role, including his leadership around customer affordability, and the structural changes that have been successfully made to the management team in SSE.
After careful consideration, the Committee decided to increase his salary by 6.6% to 805,000.
Alistair Phillips-Davies was appointed to the role of CEO on 1st July 2013.
Ian Marchant retired on 30th June 2013.
Sue Bruce was appointed to the Board on 1st September 2013.
Benefits relate to company car allowance, medical benefits and Share Incentive Plan matching shares.
The AIP figures above show the full value of the award before 25% was deferred in shares.
Ian Marchant decided to waive his annual incentive for 2012 13 which would have been 329,000.
The PSP figures above are based on awards vesting in 2013 the award granted in 2010 and 2014 the award granted in 2011 and include the value of dividends accrued.
As per the new regulations, the 2013 award is based upon the share price as at date of vesting and the 2014 award is based upon the average share price in the last 3 months of the financial year ended 31 March 2014 14.69.
The pension value represents the cash value of pension accrued over 1 year multiplied by 20 in line with new regulations with allowance for inflation and employee contributions.
Directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.
Alistair Phillips-Davies total remuneration for 2013 14 is strongly influenced by the valuation methodology of his pension, calculated in line with the new regulations.
The pension number for 2013 14 is largely driven by his base salary increase awarded 1 July 2013 39% when he was promoted to Chief Executive.
85 Directors' Report Annual Remuneration Report 2013 14 continued Remuneration and performance Executive Directors salary and incentive plans 2013 14 Measure Decision Base salary The 2013 review of Alistair Phillips-Davies and Gregor Alexanders salaries were deferred until July 2013, when they took on new responsibilities following the departure of the previous Chief Executive.
In 2014, salary reviews reverted to April, and were as follows:- Alistair Phillips-Davies was awarded an increase of 6.6%, and Gregor Alexander was awarded an increase of 2%, in line with the annual salary budget for the wider senior management team.
Annual incentive plan Overall 60% awarded maximum award of 100% of base salary The Annual Incentive award is determined by the Remuneration Maximum award up to 100% of base salary: 75% in cash non-pensionable : 25% Committees assessment of the performance during the year, compulsorily deferred into shares which only vest, subject to continued service, based on the three key areas below: corporate performance: after three years.

Corporate performance 60% Corporate performance 24% awarded Group corporate performance is measured by adjusted profit During 2013 14, SSE delivered a 3% increase in dividend per share, a 4.1% increase before tax, which reflects the underlying profits of SSEs business in adjusted earnings per share and a 9.6% increase in adjusted profit before tax.
and the basis on which it is managed.
These increases were achieved in a challenging business and operating environment which was impacted by adverse weather conditions, reduced customer demand and a very competitive retail environment.
The business delivered an adjusted profit before tax of 1,551m compared to a stretching corporate target of 1,585m and a threshold target of 1,505m.
On this basis 24% was awarded.
This performance means that SSE achieved its first financial objective for the year of an annual dividend increase that was greater than RPI inflation.
SSEs financial performance means it can also improve its operations for the benefit of customers, invest in the energy infrastructure that customers will depend on in the future, employ many thousands of people and pay 431.6m of tax.
Teamwork 20% Teamwork performance 18% awarded Teamwork is measured by performance against the SSE SET of Safety a reduction in the Total Recordable Injury Rate among SSE employees, core values: Safety: Service: Efficiency: Sustainability: Excellence: and a reduction for contractor safety rates and Teamwork.
Performance against these values is assessed Service SSE remained the leading large supplier in customer service surveys through SSEs performance management process.

87 Directors' Report Annual Remuneration Report 2013 14 continued Pension In common with all members of the pension schemes who joined at the same time as the Executive Directors, the following provisions relating to leaving the Company apply: for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid: in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50: and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension being paid on an unreduced basis.
The Executive Directors are members of either the Southern Electric Pension Scheme or the Scottish Hydro-Electric Pension Scheme and their plan membership predates their Board appointments.
These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members.
The Directors service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.
In relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements the Company provides top-up unfunded arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned if they had not been subject to the salary cap.
There are no arrangements to compensate members for any change in their personal tax liability.
Dependent upon the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committees policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB pension at the time of leaving.
Any cash commutation would limit SSEs liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and would be undertaken on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.

The increase in the accrued pensions over the period net of CPI inflation was calculated by comparing the accrued pension at 31 March 2014 with the accrued pension at 31 March 2013 increased in line with CPI over the period from September 2011 to September 2012 in line with the new regulations.
Ian Marchant left the Company on 30 June 2013 and his UURBS pension entitlement was settled as a lump sum.
The amount shown in the table represents his pension entitlement on leaving the Company immediately prior to his UURBS pension entitled being settled as a lump sum.
Benefits Benefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similar sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Group.
Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Companys all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees: the Sharesave Scheme which allows employees options to acquire shares using the proceeds of a monthly savings contract of up to 250 per month.
Exercise of the options is not subject to satisfaction of any performance target.
The option price is set at a discount maximum of 20% to market value.
The rules of the scheme can now accommodate up to 500 per month.
the Share Incentive Plan the SIP which allows employees to allocate part of their pre-tax salary to purchase shares up to a maximum of 125 per month.
Participants receive two free matching shares monthly for each share purchased up to a maximum of six free shares.
The rules of the scheme can now accommodate up to 150 per month.
the long service award scheme which purchases 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 shares on behalf of an employee on the occasion of the employee reaching 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years service respectively with the Group.
Previous Chief Executives leaving arrangements Ian Marchant retired from the Company on 30June 2013.
The remuneration terms applied on exit were derived from his terms of employment or through the rules of the relevant incentive plans, and summarised in the Remuneration Report in 2013.
He received his base salary and benefits until 30June 2013 but he did not receive any payment in lieu of notice or compensation for loss of office on termination.
His terms of employment provided for a pension of around 429,000 payable from age 60.
This pension is provided by two schemes: the Southern Electric Pension Scheme SEPS and an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS.
As previously disclosed, he had the option to request that the SEPS element of his pension be payable from age 55 subject to actuarial reduction.
He also had the option to request that the portion of his pension provided through the UURBS be paid as a commuted lump sum.
Ian Marchant made the UURBS lump sum request and as per the terms of the UURBS arrangement the Committee considered this in light of the financial health of the Company and agreed a commuted payment of 6.8m, which in its judgement and that of its actuaries, was deemed to be cost neutral to SSE.
He also received a pro rata annual incentive payment based on the Committees assessment of his performance up to 30 June 2013.
Ian Marchant was, for the purposes of his share plans, treated as a good leaver and his award was subject to time pro-rating so that he will receive 27 36ths of any award vesting under the 2011 Performance Share Plan subject to performance conditions being met at the end of the performance period.
At his request, participation in the 2012 plan, where he could have received 15 36ths of any award that may vest, has been cancelled for no consideration.
His deferred share arrangements from 2011 and 2012 vested in full on his departure.
