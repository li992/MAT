However, we have decided this year to revert to our former practice of showing, for information, a chart of total return performance along with the chart of share price performance even although total return is not one of the Key Performance Indicators the Board uses for measuring the Companys performance.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 3 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SINCE 30 APRIL 2000 Note: The two charts on this page are designed to show the share price volatility of Personal Assets compared to that of the FTSE All-Share Index.
The first chart, Annual percentage change in Share Price and FTSE All-Share Index to 30 April, shows how, with the exception of the 2013-2014 aberration, the Companys capital performance has tended to be less volatile than that of the All-Share but how, even taking 2013-2014 into account, the Companys long-term price gain of 64% since April 2000 has comfortably exceeded the All-Shares 21%.
The second chart shows the performance of Personal Assets compared to that of the FTSE All-Share Index in share price total return terms.
