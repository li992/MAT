The KCD, Mengu Hill, Gorumbwa and Mofu N Mineral resources resource models were and ore reserves SOUTH CENTRAL AFRICAN updated during 2014.
SUDAN REPUBLIC This included additional grade control drilling in KCD and Mofu, advanced grade control drilling in Mengu Hill and additional CAMEROON depletion information and drilling at Gorumbwa to more accurately quantify the available resources.
The pit shells UGANDA selected to limit each of the open pit resources correspond to the CONGO shell produced using a gold price of $1 500 oz.
DEMOCRATIC RWANDA REPUBLIC Kinshasa BURUNDI Total mineral resources have decreased due to production OF CONGO depletion, model changes at Mengu Hill and infill drilling at TANZANIA Gorumbwa.
The Gorumbwa resource changes were mainly a result of the exclusion of all historical data.
Further drilling is underway to test conceptual areas of potential mineralisation ANGOLA within the $1 500 oz resource shell of the latest model, which could result in resource gains.
ZAMBIA The underground KCD mineral resource increased on the back of the revised geological model after further resource drilling of Kibali gold mine the 9000 lodes.
Randgold permits Total ore reserves are down year on year with depletion by 900km mining only partially offset by gains in the Gorumbwa open pit, KIBALI MINERAL RESOURCES AND ORE RESERVES Attributable 3 Tonnes Mt Grade g t Gold Moz gold Moz at 31 December Category 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 MINERAL 1 RESOURCES Stockpiles Measured 3.8 3.6 1.4 2.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 Open pits Measured 4.4 2.3 2.4 2.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.08 Indicated 63 81 2.1 2.1 4.3 5.4 1.9 2.4 Inferred 21 29 1.8 2.3 1.2 2.1 0.6 1.0 Underground Indicated 68 68 5.4 5.2 12 11 5.2 5.1 Inferred 32 31 3.1 3.1 3.2 3.1 1.4 1.4 TOTAL MINERAL Measured RESOURCES and indicated 139 154 3.7 3.5 16 17 7.4 7.7 Inferred 53 60 2.6 2.7 4.4 5.2 2.0 2.3 2 ORE RESERVES Stockpiles Proven 3.8 3.6 1.4 2.2 0.2 0.2 0.08 0.1 Open pits Proven 1.6 1.9 2.6 2.5 0.1 0.2 0.06 0.07 Probable 33 40 2.4 2.5 2.5 3.2 1.1 1.4 Underground Probable 44 44 5.7 5.7 8.2 8.0 3.7 3.6 TOTAL ORE Proven RESERVES and probable 83 89 4.1 4.0 11 12 4.9 5.2 1 Open pit mineral resources are the insitu mineral resources falling within the $1 500 oz pit shell reported at a cut-off of 0.5g t. Underground mineral resources are those insitu mineral resources at the KCD deposit that fall below the 5 685 metre RL elevation, reported at a cut-off of 1.5g t. Mineral resources were generated by Mr Ernest Doh, an officer of the company and competent person.
2 Open pit ore reserves are reported at a gold price of $1 000 oz and an average cut-off of 0.9g t and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit ore reserves were calculated by Mr Nicholas Coomson, an officer of the company and a competent person.
Underground ore reserves are reported at a gold price of $1 000 oz and a cut-off of 2.4g t and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Underground ore reserves were calculated by Mr Tim Peters, an independent consultant and a competent person.
3 Attributable gold Moz refers to the quantity attributable to Randgold based on its 45% interest in the Kibali gold mine.
Mineral resource and ore reserves are quoted as per JORC 2012 guidelines and thus reported to the second significant digit.
