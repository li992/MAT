Chief Executives strategic review continued Outlook The combination of increasing price competition and the continued low interest rate environment makes the outlook more challenging.
We nevertheless expect to continue to deliver attractive returns on equity.
Amlin is well positioned for this environment.
We have highly experienced underwriting teams and pricing discipline is in our DNA.
Our market positions, together with an increased marketing capability, mean we are better able to seek out and grow in areas which offer more favourable return potential.
Where necessary, we will temper our growth ambitions and, in some areas, will even retract if pricing falls below levels we consider to be technically sound.
With the lower pricing in catastrophe reinsurance we have reduced our catastrophe risk appetite as shown on page 33.
Insurance markets are undergoing fundamental changes and Amlin is in a good position to gain from these changes.
For further comment on our outlook, see page 62.
