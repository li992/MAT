standards Our paper-based products provide a sustainable, environmentally friendly solution for many of our customers packaging requirements.
We continue to invest in research and development to provide products for our customers that help address sustainability challenges like food security and reduce their environmental footprint by using lighter weight material and other smart packaging solutions.
Resource efficiency is critical to the long-term sustainability of the Fibre Packaging business.
We focus our efforts on reducing material used in our products while still providing the same features.
We have implemented a quality initiative in our converting operations to increase product quality and customer satisfaction through tighter, standardised and more efficient processes, while achieving energy and material savings and minimising waste.
Some food packaging contains metals which have a high environmental impact during production, so we also look for opportunities, particularly in our Extrusion Coatings segment to replace metals with materials with a lower environmental footprint.
