Housing remains high Significant demand in the UK after low transaction levels on the political agenda with recognition of the importance of housebuilding to the economy and the need for more quality homes in the UK by all of the main political parties.
Whilst there remains uncertainty around the outcome of the General Election in May, consumer confidence remains solid and is supported by healthy underlying demand, low interest rates and high levels of employment.

Taylor Wimpey is one of the largest homebuilders in the UK, We build a wide range of homes, from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom houses, with prices ranging from below 100,000 to building 12,454 homes in 2014.
In addition, we build affordable housing across the UK, representing 17.5% of our 2014 completions.
