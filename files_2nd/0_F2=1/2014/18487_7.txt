The sector offers an opportunity to acquire properties secured on long leases, usually at least 15 years, with xed uplifts or RPI linkage.
These can be attractive in times of low gilt yields and when there is a limited amount of stock offering long leases in the traditional three sectors.
However, there is strong competition for such assets and the income return can be relatively low.
As a result, while the Company has considered various opportunities, it has a limited exposure to this sector comprising the student accommodation let to the University of Winchester.

The sharp fall in the price of oil is likely to affect corporate occupiers real estate strategies in the Aberdeen area but the full impact is unknown at this stage.

The asset class remains in favour with a wide range of investors and market sentiment has shifted in favour of interest rates staying lower for longer, potentially allowing property yields to compress further.
At some point interest rates will start to normalise and, while this could affect investment performance through yield adjustment in later years, a growing economy, capacity constraints and improved rental growth may help to mitigate the impact.
We forecast that total returns will remain positive both in real and nominal terms over the medium-term to 2019.
We continue to expect London and the South East to out-perform and for good quality ofces and industrials to out-perform retail property outside London.
There is likely to be a disparity in performance at the asset level and we continue to stress the importance of focusing on local market conditions, the qualities of the asset and the potential to protect and enhance the income stream over time.
