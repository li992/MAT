Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Strategic Report Financial Statements Cranswicks commitment to have all its existing sites accredited to the Environmental Management Standard ISO14001 has been achieved, and the newly acquired sites will follow as part of their integration into the Group.
Community Supporting local communities is important to the Group.
Nearly 80 per cent of the workforce live within ten miles of their place of work so the Company remains centred on encouraging and supporting employees to be active in their communities through volunteer working or fundraising.
The Group understands the need to work with local communities and to be a responsible neighbour.
Throughout the year a number of employees have been engaged in physical challenges, raising money for their local and national charities.
In addition charitable donations made by the Company at the various sites have totalled in excess of 16,000 in the year.
The Group continues to be involved with the Red Lion Brand, a business which donates all of its post-tax profits to forces charities.
Cranswick does not make any political donations.
Summary Cranswick will continue to review and monitor the performance of its target areas set out in this report and through this process the Groups stakeholders will have a clearer picture of what corporate responsibility means to the Company and that it is an integral part of its development.
