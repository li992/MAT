Around 74% of mobile users are in emerging markets, such as India and Africa, reflecting the typical combination of large populations and the lack of fixed line infrastructure.
The remaining users are from wealthier mature markets, such as Europe.
However, the proportion of the population with a phone or mobile penetration tends to be higher in mature markets usually over 100% and lower in emerging markets, particularly in rural areas, due mainly to lower incomes and less Telecommunications revenue US$ billion network coverage.

Growing importance of data and other new revenue areas Regulation will continue to have a significant impact Mobile voice and texts, our traditional revenue sources, have reached The industry is expected to see continued downward revenue pressure maturity in a number of markets.
To deliver future growth opportunities, from regulation.
For example the Europe Commission is seeking the we are investing in newer revenue areas such as data.
