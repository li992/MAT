The high grade plunge in the Gounkoto deposit is thought intersection of west dipping footwall shears with the to be controlled by the intersection of the east-dipping main east dipping orebody.
A number of holes have hangingwall shear and steeper west-dipping footwall intersected strong mineralisation in the target including: structures which exhibit different alteration suites and may GKDH200 11.8m at 6.05g t: GKDH205 17.2m at 11.04g t: represent zones of fluid mixing and gold precipitation.
and GKDH218 40.3m at 3.03g t. At present this target Drilling shows that the highest grades are either related area hosts a potential of 300 000oz at 4g t, which will be further tested in 2015. to carbonate, silica albite and hematite alteration in the hangingwall, or in a ferruginous, chlorite rich, footwall shear.
Highlights of the drilling programme targeting P64 the high grade mineralisation in the MZ3 zone this year P64 is an old exploration target immediately to the include infill hole GKDH418 which returned 14.5m at north west of the Gounkoto deposit where a short strike 31.59g t where the block model was predicting a grade length of high grade mineralisation was discovered over of 18g t, GKDH414 drilled 200m down plunge from 418m 10 years ago.
This year a review of all the data for P64 which intersected 23.65m at 6.45g t and GKDH412 drilled was completed along with further trenching which led a further 300m down plunge which intersected 13.65m at to the identification of new controls to the mineralisation 5.34g t. and the updated model was then further tested by infill drilling in Q4 2014.
The existing model at P64 interpreted Work on the extensions of the Gounkoto orebody was the high grade mineralisation to be hosted in the eastern completed this year, with holes testing and eliminating limb and south plunging hinge zone of a synformal fold deep targets both in the footwall and down plunge to the in tourmaline altered greywackes.

Work continued to define MZ4 and model at P64 shows that mineralisation is controlled explore its relationship with P64 and has confirmed it to by the intersection of NS and NE trending structures, be a relatively small lens of mineralisation hosting 653kt similar to that observed in Gounkoto Pit at MZ1 and MZ3.

This zone Implications of this new model for exploration are that of mineralisation is interpreted to be the continuation of the high grade NE trending mineralisation at P64 is open the left-stepping Gounkoto system to the NNW which down plunge, rather than having a depth extent that is continues towards and now incorporates the old P64 limited by folding.
Additionally, intersections between NS target.

A model of NS and NE trending also high grade mineralisation located beneath the structures matches the general pattern of soil anomalism southern MZ1 pit where, similarly to the JZ, the high in this area, and preliminary target areas have been grade mineralisation is controlled by the north-plunging identified for further work.
