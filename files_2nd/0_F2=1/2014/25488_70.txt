Corporate governance and corporate responsibility Corporate governance continued Values and code of conduct We have a strong organisational culture of entrenched values, which forms the cornerstone of our behaviour towards all stakeholders.
These values are embodied in a written statement of values, which serves as our code of ethics and is continually reinforced.
We view all employees as the custodians of ethical behaviour, which is reinforced through internal processes, policies and procedures.
As such all new employees are invited, and are strongly encouraged, to attend an induction process at which our philosophies, values, culture, risk management and compliance procedures are explained and discussed.
Our Organisation Development team plays an important role in facilitating the understanding and ongoing practice of our values, philosophies and culture.
In addition to our values, acceptable business practices are communicated through the human resources practices manual, available on the intranet.
