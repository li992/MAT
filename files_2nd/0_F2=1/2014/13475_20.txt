Financial overview The key metrics for Group financial management and planning are summarised below.
2014 2013 2012 US$ million US$ million US$ million a Underlying earnings 9,305 10,217 9,269 a Net earnings loss 6,527 3,665 3,028 Net cash generated from operating activities 14,286 15,078 9,430 Net debt 12,495 18,055 19,192 b Total capital 67,089 71,557 76,932 a Underlying earnings is the key financial performance indicator which management uses internally to assess performance.
It is presented here as a measure of earnings to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of the Group.
Items excluded from net earnings to arrive at underlying earnings are explained in note 2 to the financial statements.
Both net earnings and underlying earnings deal with amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto.
However, IFRS requires that the profit for the year reported in the income statement should also include earnings attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries.
b Total capital is defined as equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto plus equity attributable to non-controlling interests plus net debt.
Decreased underlying earnings reflect the unfavourable impact of lower prices in the Groups main commodities, other than aluminium and diamonds.
This was offset by the favourable impact of improved sales volumes, operating cash cost improvements and continued overall strengthening of the US dollar against local currencies.
Net earnings of US$6.5 billion reflect non-cash exchange losses of US$1.9 billion: impairment reversals of US$1.0 billion offset by impairment charges of US$1.1 billion: a US$0.4 billion write-off of deferred tax assets following the repeal of the Mineral Resources Rent Tax by the Australian senate: and losses on disposal of businesses during the period of US$0.3 billion.
Net cash generated from operating activities, which include dividends from equity accounted units, reflect the negative impact of lower commodity prices partially offset by the favourable impact from higher volumes and cost reduction initiatives and a reduction in net interest paid as a result of lower net debt.
Net debt decreased from US$18.1 billion at 31 December 2013 to US$12.5 billion at 31 December 2014 as operating cash inflows, divestment proceeds and proceeds from the disposal of the Groups St Jamess Square properties more than offset the outflows relating to capital expenditure and the increased dividend payment.
Gearing ratio decreased from 25.2 per cent at 31 December 2013 to 18.6 per cent at 31 December 2014.
Interest cover remained unchanged from the prior year at 13 times.
The boards objective when managing capital is to safeguard the business as a going concern whilst maximising returns for the Groups shareholders.
In practice, this involves regular reviews by the board and senior management.
These reviews take into account the Groups strategic priorities, economic and business conditions, and opportunities that are identified to invest across all points of the commodities cycle.
The resulting capital structure provides the Group with a high degree of financial flexibility at a low cost of capital.
