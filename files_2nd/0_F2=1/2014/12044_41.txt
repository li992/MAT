Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 62 Annual report on remuneration continued Remuneration policy implementation for 2015 Executive Directors Base salaries After taking into consideration Group employees salary increases in 2014 monthly paid employees generally received a 3% base salary review increase in 2014 and general market conditions, the Committee has awarded salary increases of 3% to Executive Directors from 1 January 2015.
Base salary from 1 January 2015 2014 Jeff Fairburn 636,500 618,000 Mike Killoran 482,400 468,390 Nigel Greenaway 339,500 329,600 David Jenkinson 339,500 329,600 Annual bonus In line with the Companys strategy to improve margins and return cash to shareholders under the capital return plan, the Committee has decided that the most appropriate performance condition for 2015 annual bonus will again primarily be based on profit before tax and cash generation measures, plus a condition relating to customer satisfaction, which will account for 10% of the maximum bonus opportunity.
Health and safety outcomes may act as a downward modifier of up to 10% of the bonus outcome.
The targets are based on figures which are commercially sensitive, but they will be disclosed in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee considers that the targets it has set are stretching.
Annual bonus awards continue to be subject to robust clawback and malus provisions.
The Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus potential for Jeff Fairburn should remain at 200% of base salary.
This annual bonus potential reflects that Jeff Fairburns base salary is lower than the salaries of the Chief Executives of other major housebuilders.
This structure enhances the emphasis on pay for performance, with any annual bonus payable in excess of 100% of base salary paid entirely in deferred shares.
The Committee notes that Jeff Fairburns combined base salary plus maximum annual bonus remains below the FTSE 100 market median.
The Committee has retained the maximum annual bonus achievable for the other Executive Directors at 150% of base salary.
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary will again be paid in bonus share scheme awards for all Executive Directors, halfvesting one year and half vesting two years after the announcement of the relevant years financial results.
Long term incentive plan awards When Jeff Fairburn was appointed Group Chief Executive, the Committee deliberately granted him a lower award of shares than that of his predecessor pending their assessment of his performance.
The Committee now considers that Jeffs excellent performance and strong leadership since his promotion merit an additional award of an option under the LTIP 2012.
Jeff will therefore be granted an option over 241,600 shares in 2015, to bring his total award to the maximum approved by shareholders for the Group Chief Executive.
Pension schemes There is no change to pension benefits for 2015: current arrangements are as set out on page 58.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees The Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee for 2015 should be increased by 3%, making his fee for 2015 201,600.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has agreed that the fee for 2015 should increase by 3% to 56,200, plus an additional fee of 10,000 for extra responsibilities in chairing a Committee.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 63 The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the Chairmans and each Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee is comprised of four Non-Executive Directors, who all served throughout the year.
Current members Date of appointment to the Committee Jonathan Davie Chairman 1 January 2010 Nicholas Wrigley 18 December 2007 Mark Preston 27 February 2012 Marion Sears 20 February 2013 The Committee sought advice on Executive Directors remuneration matters from its independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street NBS, a trading name of Aon Hewitt part of Aon plc, who were selected by the Committee due to their expertise in this field.
The Committee considers that the advice provided by NBS as professional remuneration consultants is objective and independent.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Aon Hewitt also provides advice to the Company on the Companys pension schemes via its actuarial and pension consultancy division.
The Committee does not consider that the independence of NBS is compromised by this appointment as NBS is a separate division of Aon Hewitt based in London the actuarial and pension consultancy offices are in Leeds and Birmingham.
The amount of fees the Company paid to NBS for the services they provided in 2014 was 17,032, charged on a time spent basis.
In addition, the Committee consulted with Jeff Fairburn, Group Chief Executive, but no Director was involved in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee has also reviewed the remuneration of the Groups divisional boards the level of management below Board level and of the Group Company Secretary.
