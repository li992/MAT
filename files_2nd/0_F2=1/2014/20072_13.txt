2 Prices for Kumba Iron Ore Kumba are the average realised export basket price.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW Samancor Underlying EBIT decreased by 15% to $178 million, driven Kumba by lower ore prices, offset to some extent by higher sales Underlying EBIT decreased by 37% to $1.9 billion volumes and cost control.
2013: $3.0 billion, mainly attributable to the significant decline in the iron ore benchmark price, which declined 28% to an average of $97 tonne.
In 2014, Kumba took steps MARKETS to address its cost base and to establish a robust continuous Iron ore improvement programme that builds off the implementation 2014 2013 of Anglo Americans Operating Model.

Export sales increased by 4% to 40.5 Mt 2013: 39.1 Mt IODEX 62% has been used in this instance as a generic industry benchmark against as a result of higher iron ore production which increased by which to compare average realised prices.
Kumba rebuilt stock on the Demand for seaborne iron ore grew 6.7% 2013: 7.0%, back of the higher production.
Total finished product stocks or 79 Mt: however this was more than offset by seaborne increased to 6.5 Mt as at 31 December 2014 compared supply which increased by 14.2%, or 167 Mt, on an with 2.9 Mt at 31 December 2013. equivalent basis.
The result was a 28% decline in the Iron Ore Brazil average iron ore price, which reached $72 per tonne First ore on ship was achieved on 25 October 2014, ahead of Platts 62% benchmark at the end of the year.
Kumbas schedule and with total project capital expenditure expected achieved sales benefited from the inclusion of a significant to be $0.4 billion below the revised budget of $8.8 billion.

Minas-Rio achieved an exceptional safety performance with Manganese ore very low lost time injury rates compared to other projects The manganese ore market remained under pressure, of similar scale.
Delivery of the project is a significant with the benchmark ore price CIF China falling 16% over milestone.
The ramp up schedule continues and is expected the prior year.
Infrastructure constraints in South Africa to reach design capacity during the second quarter of 2016. were loosened, which eliminated a key bottleneck from the Minas-Rio is a world class asset benefiting from long life market.
This resulted in South African production becoming 45 years : high quality iron ore saleable product the relevant price setting assets.

Underlying EBIT is expected to be capitalised until the end of 2015, by which time the Minas-Rio project is expected to have achieved commercial production capacity.
In 2014, Iron Ore Brazils capitalised underlying EBIT loss was $57million, while an amount of $34 million was charged to the income statement in relation to expenses that were not directly associated with the project.
Sales volumes of 0.2 Mt relate to three Panamax vessels transporting iron ore from Minas-Rio to customers in China.
Iron ore production volumes for the year reached 0.7 Mt wet basis.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 49 STRATEGIC REPORT IRON ORE AND MANGANESE Samancor OPERATING PERFORMANCE Production of manganese ore remained consistent at Kumba 3.3 Mt attributable basis, with a record performance in Overall, Kumba showed a marked improvement in the second half.
Production benefited from improved ore production as plans put in place over the past few years recovery and plant availability in South Africa, which offset yielded benefits.
These were complemented by the the impact of weather related stoppages in the first quarter implementation of Anglo Americans Operating Model in Australia.
Production of manganese alloys increased by 14% to Sishen production of 35.5 Mt increased 15% 286,100 tonnes attributable basis owing to greater furnace 2013: 30.9 Mt, with total tonnes mined rising to stability and availability in South Africa and Australia.
Although below the waste target OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK set at the start of the year, waste removal run rates are now meeting targets.
Additional contractor capacity has been Kumba secured and the performance of Kumbas own mining fleet Kumba will focus on optimising its production portfolio improved.
The vertical rate of advance at the mine was by reconfiguring its project portfolio to focus on low cost increased, further strengthening the exposed ore position.
The target is an additional 5 Mt in South Africa The strategic redesign of the western pushbacks of the pit, over the next three to five years, through incremental together with the improved waste removal run rates, have volumes from projects at Sishen and Kolomela.
achieved appropriate waste removal during the year to Additional port capacity through the use of the Saldanha ensure sufficient exposed ore to support a 2015 production Multi-Purpose Terminal is expected to optimise port target of 36 Mt.
Sishen is aiming to increase production to Execution of the pit redesign plan has resulted in an around 36 Mt in 2015, as it ramps up its waste stripping to improved mining plan that enables better use of equipment, around 250 Mt.
This will be supported by the Dingleton and the deployment of two priority pushbacks.
Around relocation project and ongoing implementation of 780Mt of waste was taken out of the revised life of mine Anglo Americans Operating Model.
Following the planned plan, reducing the average life of mine stripping ratio from commissioning of a new modular plant in 2015, production 4.4 to 3.9, and the reserve life from 18 years to 16 years at guidance has been increased by 1 Mt to 38 Mt in both 2016 the end of 2014. and 2017.
Kolomela maintained its strong performance, with total Kolomelas life of mine production capacity has been tonnes mined increasing by 18% to 70.4 Mt 2013: 59.9 Mt.
increased to 11 Mtpa from 2015, and studies are in progress The mine produced 11.6 Mt of iron ore 2013: 10.8 Mt, an which could result in increasing production further to 12 Mt increase of 7%, and mined 55.5 Mt of waste 2013: 46.7 Mt.
The future of Thabazimbi mine in Kumbas portfolio is currently being assessed.
Pre-stripping of the third pit 19.4 Mt, in order to maintain flexibility, was completed during the year, with first ore Iron Ore Brazil exposed during November.
Iron ore production of between 11 Mt and 14 Mt wet basis is expected in 2015.
Nameplate capacity is expected to be Thabazimbi lifted output to 1.1 Mt 2013: 0.6 Mt, with reached by the second quarter of 2016, with production of waste mining volumes increasing by 19% to 31.6 Mt between 24 Mt and 26.5 Mt wet basis expected in 2016.
In addition to the safe ramp up of operations, activities also Volumes railed on the Iron Ore Export Channel were include the completion of the outstanding construction 6% higher at 42.2 Mt 2013: 39.7 Mt on the back of the works and the regular cycle of licence and permit renewals improved performance at Sishen and Kolomela, accounting required for the mining operations.

To facilitate the expansion of Sishen mine to the west, Phase1 of the Dingleton relocation project was completed, with 71 homes in Dingleton North being moved to the new host site.
Phase 2, the relocation of the 428 remaining houses, buildings and businesses, has commenced and is progressing well.
