Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
At 31 December, the Group had future unprovided commitments under non-cancellable operating leases due as follows: Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
9 Goodwill and other intangible assets Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ACCOUNTING POLICY indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position may be less than its recoverable amount.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
amount of each asset or group of assets cash generating unit or CGU to which the goodwill relates.
A CGU represents an asset grouping at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent From 1 January 2010, the Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008. risks and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash flows.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which Animpairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in Separately Disclosed Items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised inprofit or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are taken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
