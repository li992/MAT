For projects to meet Randgolds development and Exploration work at Loulo focused on the evaluation of investment criteria, they need to have the potential Loulo Mali identified targets within the for 3 million minable ounces and offer an internal rate permit, defining drill programmes to convert resources to of return IRR of 20% at a long term gold price of reserves and to identify new brownfields opportunities at $1 000 oz.
Although no new discoveries were made during both Gara and Yalea.
the past year, the team was able to replace the ounces mined through ongoing brownfields exploration which included the Work on the Gara South, Yalea Ridge South, Loulo 4, completion of the underground feasibility study at Gounkoto.
Samaba and Sansamba West targets during the year determined that they have little potential to add significant Over the past year, the exploration strategy and management ounces to the project with only limited surface exposure to mineralisation and they were removed from the resource structure was thoroughly reviewed to ensure the team was triangle.
Consequently, there were a number of changes within the team including a number Waraba of internal promotions.
As part of this process, the targets A new target named Waraba returned encouraging early contained in the resource triangle were reduced from 160 to results from shear hosted mineralisation over a 400m 115.
The groups portfolio of mineral rights was expanded strike in an area of artisanal mining in the north of the through the acquisition of new permits as well as additional Loulo permit.
