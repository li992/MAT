When the Committee took these decisions, it considered the salary increases awarded to other employees in 2014 and the expected increases in 2015.
The Committee also took account of the performance and experience of each executive, and the relative size of each directors role, as well as the performance of the Group.
The external markets used to provide context to the Committee were identical to those used for 2014 salaries.
The 2015 salary increase for the Chief Executive, PCA was 5 per cent, all other executive directors received a 3 per cent increase.
These uplifts are in line with 2015 salary increase budgets for other employees across our business units 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
2015 salaries are set out in the Our executive remuneration at a glance section.
Changes were made to the maximum opportunities under the annual incentive plan and long-term incentive awards for two executive directors Chief Executive, PCA and Chief Executive, UK & Europe: there were no changes to the maximum opportunities for the other executive directors Chief Executive, PCA: increase in maximum AIP and LTIP awards to 180 per cent and 250 per cent of salary respectively.
This reflects the importance of PCAs 2017 strategic initiatives which are crucial to the achievement of Group wide objectives.
The incumbent has also demonstrated considerable personal performance and contribution to the Group.
Chief Executive, UK & Europe: increase in maximum AIP and LTIP awards to 175 per cent and 250 per cent of salary respectively.
The scope of the incumbents role has increased due to the Groups expansion into Africa.
Additionally, to reflect the ambition of the UK & Europe business as it relates to the Groups growth and cash ambitions.
In making these adjustments, the Remuneration Committee was mindful to ensure that the majority of the additional opportunity be provided through long-term incentive awards, so that the full value is only realised over the long term and subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
Major shareholders were consulted on this change prior to implementation.
In preparation for the implementation of Solvency II, part of executive directors 2015 bonuses will be determined by the achievement of economic capital targets.
The performance measures attached to long-term incentive awards remain unchanged from those set out in the Remuneration in respect of 2014 section of this report.
From 1 January 2015, the Committee has, at its discretion, the power to recover all or part of bonuses and share awards for a period after they are received by executives.
These clawback provisions complement the Committees existing malus powers which enable unvested share awards to be reduced or cancelled in specific circumstances.
