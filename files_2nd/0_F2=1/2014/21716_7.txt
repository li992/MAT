Prior to 1 December 2014, the allocation to this strategy was achieved through BlueMatrix.
BLUECREST CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL During the year, performance contribution by region was dominated by profits from European primarily euro area and UK strategies.
Asia Pacific strategies made a modest contribution, broadly in line with the capital allocation, whereas the North American region delivered flat returns, as gains from Mortgages strategies were offset by underperformance in US Rates strategies.
Cross Market strategies implemented across more than one region were one of the greatest profit contributors.
European rates strategies successfully captured the decrease in yields as the economy deteriorated and inflation fell.
UK rates strategies profited from tactical trading through the majority of the year.
US rates strategies positioned with a short bias were challenged by the technical bid for bonds that kept yields persistently low, with bouts of panic leading to further safe haven buying.
The low positive performance in 2014 reflects a very challenging environment for both our tactical and directional rates trading strategies.
Volatility and trading volumes continued to deteriorate, limiting opportunities for tactical trading and our economic assessment and valuation analysis did not correspond with the bond market rally that persisted through the year.
