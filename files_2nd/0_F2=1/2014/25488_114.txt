This arises from the consolidation offset between various asset classes diversifi cation.
UK and Other The average VaR utilisation was higher than in 2013, as a result of a slight increase in trading activity across all trading businesses.
Using hypothetical clean profi t and loss data for backtesting resulted in one exception over the year at the 99% confi dence level, i. e. where the loss was greater than the 99% one-day VaR.
This is less than expected at the 99% level and is largely due to a reduction in market volatility over the past year.
Using hypothetical clean profi t and loss data for backtesting resulted in three exceptions as shown in the graph below, which is in line with the number of exceptions that a 99% VaR implies.
The exceptions were due to normal trading losses, the loss in January was due to a surprise rate hike.
Using actual profi t and loss resulted in two exceptions which is in line with expectations.
Using hypothetical clean profi t and loss data for backtesting resulted in one exception over the year, i. e. where the loss was greater than the 99% one-day VaR.
This is less than the expected number of exceptions at the 99% level.
The exception was a result of a daily loss in foreign exchange positions, primarily due to a large movement in the AUD USD exchange rate.
This arises from the correlation offset between various asset classes.
Stress testing The table below indicates the potential losses that could arise if the portfolio is stress tested under extreme market conditions.
The method used is known as extreme value theory EVT, the reported stress scenario below calculates the 99% EVT which is a 1-in-8 year possible loss event.
These numbers do not assume normality but rather rely on fi tting a distribution to the tails of the distribution.
