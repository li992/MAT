Optimising production and maximising oil recovery Production operations continue to run smoothly at the Okoro field.
Total gross production at the Okoro field in 2014 was 6 mmbbls of oil, representing a gross average daily rate of 16,451 bopd, and a process uptime of over 97%.
The year-on-year decrease of circa 9% was in line with expectation, incorporating planned downtime associated with the riser re-termination work carried out in Q1 2014.
Since the start of production in 2008, the Okoro field has continued to perform ahead of expectations, delivering aggregate gross production volumes to the end of December 2014 of c. 39.4 mmbbls, significantly above the original 2P scenario of 26.2 mmbbls, a remarkable achievement for our first greenfield development project.
During the year, in order to optimise production at the Okoro main field, the Adriatic 1 rig was moved to the Okoro Main Well Head Platform WHP where one producer, Okoro-15, and one side track, Okoro-12 ST1, were brought on stream and are currently producing at rates of approximately 2,000 bopd in line with expectations.
In Q3 2014, the Partners sanctioned the Final Investment Decision FID for the Okoro Further Field Development Okoro FFD.
The rig for the Mobile Offshore Platform Unit MOPU was procured and arrived in the construction yard in Singapore in Q4 2014.
In February 2015, Amni and Afren began discussions on how best to manage the Okoro FFD in light of deteriorating oil prices with a view to re-engineering the forward work programme at Okoro.
Outlook The re-engineered Okoro FFD may utilise the existing infrastructure at the field, and will incorporate the development of the Okoro FFD discovery over two phases from the Okoro Main WHP.
The forward drilling schedule will enable production decline from the main field to be offset with new wells coming on stream from the Okoro FFD.
