Energy The Group uses mainly two sources of energy, electricity and diesel.
Revenues Electricity Adjusted revenues decreased by 12.3% to US$1,545.0 million in 2014 as a result of the lower gold and silver prices and the decrease in The Groups weighted average cost of electricity remained unchanged sales volumes of gold, mainly from Soledad-Dipolos and Cinega at US$11.0 cents per kW in 2014.
Electricity rates are set by the Comisin seetable above.

In 2014, we entered into derivative contracts to hedge lead and zinc through respective collar structures, resulting in a US$0.1 million gain Diesel recorded in the income statement.
In addition, we initiated a one-off gold The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 6.3% to hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made in the US$83.5 cents per litre in 2014.

The total metal price effect lower prices of gold, silver and lead mitigated by an increase in zinc price, resulted in an adverse impact on revenues Operating materials of US$238.0 million.
This was partially mitigated by the US$21.1 million favourable impact of the total volume effect: which resulted from the In 2014, unit prices of the majority of key operating materials decreased higher volumes of silver sold at Saucito and higher volumes of zinc sold due to the lower demand for these inputs, resulting in a net weighted from the underground mines: partially offset by the lower sales volumes average decrease of 1.8%.
This reflects the combined effect of price of gold due to the stoppage at Soledad-Dipolos.
inflation and the weighting of each component in the total cost of operating materials see table above.
In 2014, silver and gold contributed in nearly equal parts to adjusted revenues.
In terms of adjusted revenues by mine, Fresnillo remained the main contributor to adjusted revenues, albeit with a lower contribution.
Saucito and Noche Buena increased their contributions as a result of their respective expansions that increased sales volumes.
In contrast, the lower gold and silver ore grades at Cinega combined with the lower precious metal prices resulted in a decrease in its contribution to adjusted revenues.
At Herradura, the lower gold price was the main driver reducing its contribution to consolidated adjusted revenues see table above.

On a per mine basis, gross profit at the Fresnillo mine decreased 34.7% All-in sustaining cost to US$206.7 million in 2014, but remained the largest contributor to In addition to the traditional cash cost described above, the Group is the Groups consolidated gross profit, at 36.4%.

corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to current Notwithstanding, the adverse effect of lower precious metal prices operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, limited the mines increase in gross profit to 4.2% over the previous sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
Gross profit at Herradura increased 7.3% to US$136.2 million in 2014, which represented 24.0% of the Groups consolidated gross profit, Management considers all-in sustaining costs a reasonable measure to reflecting the positive effect of the resumed operations.
The decrease monitor current production costs and sustaining costs as it includes mine in gold and silver ounces sold at Cinega at lower prices led to a 56.9% development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, decline in gross profit for the year, which reduced its share of the Groups aswell as sustaining capex.
Lastly, at Noche Buena, the favourable effect of higher gold Fresnillo: All-in sustaining cost rose mainly due to the increase in volumes produced and sold did not fully mitigate the impact of lower gold capitalised development and mining works: which were partially mitigated price and higher costs, decreasing gross profit at this mine 38.5% and by the lower cash cost.
contributing only 2.0% to the consolidated gross profit.
Saucito: All-in sustaining cost declined as a result of the lower cash costand lower sustaining capex in the year.
This was partially offset bythe increase in capitalised mining works related to the development ofSaucito II.
