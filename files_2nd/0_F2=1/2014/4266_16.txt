The Board is committed to maximising shareholder value and regularly reviews the efficiency of its balance sheet and the expected ongoing cash requirements of the business.
In light of this, at the time of announcing its annual results for the financial year 2013, the Company confirmed its intention to undertake a buyback of its ordinary shares of up to $50 million.
The Board believed that the proposed share buyback would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Pursuant to the general authorities obtained from shareholders at the Annual General Meetings held on 22 May 2013 and 21 May 2014, in the period from 1 May 2014 to 30 June 2014, the Company completed the purchase of 5,118,026 ordinary shares in the open market, all of which were cancelled.
As at the close of the share buyback on 30 June 2014, the full $50 million had been expended.
78 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Strategic report Financial statements Other information Governance For the buyback that commenced in May 2014, the Company entered into arrangements with J. P. Morgan Securities plc such that the Company purchased shares from J. P. Morgan Securities plc who had itself, acting as principal, first made market purchases of such shares.
J. P. Morgan Securities plc acted as an independent third party, which allowed the buyback to continue to be implemented following the end of the second financial quarter for the 2014 financial year, during what would otherwise have been a prohibited period of the Company.
In June 2014, the Board authorised a further share buyback of up to $20 million, due to the Boards continued focus on maximising shareholder value.
As with the previous 2014 share buyback, the Board believed that this $20 million share buyback would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Purchases were made in the open market between 15 July 2014 and 27 August 2014 under a general authority provided by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
A total of approximately $11.5 million, excluding commission, was expended and as at 27 August 2014, being the last day on which shares were acquired under the authority, 1,242,702 ordinary shares had been repurchased, all of which were cancelled.
After this date, the buyback was suspended, due to the announcement on 28 August 2014 of the approach to the Company by Microchip Technology Inc. with regards to a possible offer for CSR.
On 15 October 2014, as mentioned above, the offer from Qualcomm was announced, and in view of this and as previously advised, the Board does not intend to undertake any further share buybacks prior to the completion of the Qualcomm Transaction.
As at 26 December 2014, 6,360,728 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence had been repurchased by the Company during the 52 week period ended 26 December 2014 at an average price of 574 pence per ordinary share.
This represented 3.83% of the Companys issued share capital excluding treasury shares as at close on 26 December 2014.
During 2014, a total of 1,068,022 ordinary shares were transferred out of treasury to satisfy the allotment of ordinary shares on the exercise of options under the Companys various share plans.
As at 26 December 2014, the Company held 19,855,906 ordinary shares in treasury.
The issued share capital as at 16 March 2015 was 166,331,652 ordinary shares and 19,808,940 ordinary shares were held in treasury.

During the 52 week period ended 26 December 2014, options were exercised pursuant to the Companys share schemes.
The number of shares allotted and the consideration received in respect of such allotments are detailed in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.
ABI Guidelines relating to directors power to allot share capital and disapply pre-emption rights are reected in Resolution 14 the Section 551 Authority and Resolution 15 respectively, in the Notice of Meeting.
The directors propose Paragraph A of Resolution 14 in the Notice of Meeting to renew the authority granted at the 2014 Annual General Meeting to authorise the directors to allot equity or grant rights in respect of equity shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 55,443 representing approximately one-third of the ordinary shares issued as at the latest practicable date.
In accordance with ABI Guidelines, the directors also propose Paragraph B of Resolution 14 in the Notice of Meeting to renew the authority granted at the 2014 Annual General Meeting to authorise the directors to allot or grant rights in respect of equity shares representing two-thirds of the Companys issued share capital as at the latest practicable date as reduced by the nominal amount of any allotment or grant made under paragraph A of Resolution 14 in the case of a compensatory rights issue.
This authority, if renewed, will represent in total an aggregate nominal value of 110,886.
This Section 551 Authority, if approved, will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2016 or 20 August 2016, whichever is the earlier.
The limited power granted to the directors at the 2014 Annual General Meeting to allot equity shares for cash other than pro-rata to existing shareholders expires on the conclusion of this years Annual General Meeting to be held on 20 May 2015.
Subject to renewal of the Section 551 Authority, the directors recommend Resolution 15 in the Notice of Meeting that this authority also be renewed so as to give the directors the ability until the earlier of 20 August 2016, or the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2016 to issue equity shares for cash other than pro-rata to existing shareholders, in connection with a rights issue or up to a limit of 5% of the ordinary shares issued at 16 March 2015.
The directors have no present intention to issue equity shares for cash other than pursuant to the Companys employee share plans.
The directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of Resolutions 14 and 15 to maintain the Companys exibility in relation to future share issues, including any issues to finance business opportunities should appropriate circumstances arise.
A Special Resolution will be proposed Resolution 16 in the Notice of Meeting to renew the directors limited authority to repurchase ordinary shares in the market.
This authority will be limited to a maximum of 16,633,100 ordinary shares representing 10% of the Companys issued share capital as at the latest practicable date and also sets the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid.
The authority contained in the Special Resolution will expire at the earlier of 20 August 2016, or the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2016.
It is the current intention of the directors to renew this authority annually.
The directors believe it is advantageous for the Company to continue to have the exibility to make market purchases of its own shares.
As at 26 December 2014, the Company had 19,855,906 ordinary shares held in treasury.
As at 16 March 2015, the Company had 19,808,940 ordinary shares held in treasury.
In the event that additional shares are purchased, they would either be cancelled and the number in issue would be reduced accordingly or, subject to the legislation referred to below, retained as treasury shares.
The directors will only make purchases after consideration of the possible effect on earnings per share, the long-term benets to shareholders and in consultation with advisers.
As previously advised, and as mentioned above, the Board does not intend to undertake any further share buybacks prior to the completion of the Qualcomm Transaction.
com 79 Other statutory information continued The Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003 allow shares repurchased by the Company to be held as treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or used for the purpose of employee share schemes.

The Regulations implementing this Directive increase the notice period for general meetings of the Company to 21 days, unless shareholders agree to a shorter notice period.
On the basis of a resolution passed at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, the Company is currently able to call general meetings other than an Annual General Meeting on 14 days notice.

The approval will be effective until the Companys next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
In accordance with the Directive, the Company will offer an electronic voting facility for a general meeting called on 14 days notice.
