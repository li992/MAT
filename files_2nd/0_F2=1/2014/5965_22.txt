Fidessa group plc 39 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Nominations Committees conclusions originally reported in 2012 continue to apply, namely that while diversity including gender diversity is important when reviewing the composition of the Board and possible new appointees, the single most important factor is to identify and recruit people based on merit.
The Nominations Committee continues to note that achieving gender diversity in certain sectors, including the technology sector, presents particular challenges when considering the profile of the available talent pool in those sectors.
Accordingly, the Board confirms that it is still not in favour of setting specific targets for Board representation to be achieved by particular dates.
The Nominations Committee will, however, require that appointed recruitment consultants observe Lord Davies recommendations when considering new appointments to the Board.
Currently there is one female member of the Board representing 14% of Board membership.

Fidessa has considerable financial resources, no borrowings, a high level of recurring revenue and a very broad spread of customers.

For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Fidessa group plc 42 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors and corporate governance report continued Directors responsibilities statement in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on Fidessas website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: the Directors and Corporate Governance Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face: and the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
