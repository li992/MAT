SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other 5.1.
Basis of preparation and other accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC Interpretations IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
After reviewing the Groups current plans and forecasts and financing arrangements, as well as the current trading activities of the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 includes the consolidated financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries.
"The accounting policies set out those policies that have been applied consistently in preparing the Group financial statements, with no new policies adopted for the year ended 31 December 2014, except as disclosed later in this note within the section titled ""New standards and interpretations adopted for 2014""."
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
"The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed later in this note within the section titled ""Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions""."
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has all of the following: power over the investee: exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group assesses where it is acting as an agent or principal for its holdings in its seed capital investments.
Where the Group concludes it is acting as a principal the entity is consolidated.
This assessment is based on the Groups total exposure.
This incorporates direct holdings and income earned from management and performance fees.
There is no fixed minimum percentage at which the Group consolidates, and each exposure is reviewed individually.
In addition to these exposures the Group considers any kick out rights the entity may have.
This is in contrast to the previous accounting policy where only holdings over 50 per cent.
The group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
A list of principal subsidiaries can be seen in Note 6.3.
Uniform accounting policies are applied across all Group companies and intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Seed capital investments in closed-ended funds, open-ended investment companies and unit trusts are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates or other financial investments depending on the holdings of the Group and on the level of influence and control that the Group exercises.
The transactions and balances of subsidiaries are consolidated in these financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
When the Group holds controlling interests in certain mutual funds and similar entities, these are accounted for as subsidiaries.
The funds have issued redeemable shares to the Group and external investors who have the ability to put the redeemable shares back to the funds.
In accordance with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation, non-controlling interests in redeemable shares issued by these funds accounted for as subsidiaries represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the Group or its subsidiaries and are included within other gains in the income statement and as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated balance sheet.
This is due to the ability of the external shareholders in these funds to put the shares back to the funds.
93 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other continued 5.1.
Basis of preparation and other accounting policies continued ii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control.
Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it has between 20 per cent.
of the voting rights up to the point where it is deemed the Group gains control.
This is in contrast to the previous accounting policy where all entities with holdings between 20 per cent.
were deemed to be an associate.
Investments that are held as part of the Groups investment portfolio in mutual funds and similar entities are carried in the balance sheet at fair value even though the Group may have significant influence over those companies as permitted by IAS 28, Investment in Associates, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The fair value of investments in associates is determined by reference to the quoted bid prices or net asset value of the underlying investments at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The Group has no investment in associates other than these and, therefore, no associates are currently equity accounted.
Foreign currency i Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial information of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is both the Companys functional and presentational currency as well as the currency in which the majority of the Groups revenue streams, assets and liabilities are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of other gains.
Translation differences on non-financial assets, such as investments classified as available for sale, are included in other comprehensive income unless the change in the fair value taken to equity has been recycled to the income statement, in which case the foreign exchange gain or loss is also recycled to the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each consolidated income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income.
New standards and interpretations adopted for 2014 The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements Defines the principle of control, and establishes control as the basis for consolidation in the preparation of consolidated financial statements.
IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities Includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, such as joint arrangements, associates and other off balance sheet vehicles.
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Prescribes the accounting for investments in associates and sets out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures.
Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments These amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets Clarifies the disclosure requirement for Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets.
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and These amendments provide a relief from the requirement to discontinue Continuation of Hedge Accounting hedge accounting when a derivative designated as a hedging instrument is novated under certain circumstances.

94 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The main change resulting from IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements relates to the definition of control and establishes control as the basis for consolidation.
As such, the Group has applied IFRS 10 retrospectively in accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 10.
The financial effects of this can be seen in Note 5.2.
The main changes resulting from IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities require disclosure of all forms of interests in other entities, including associates.
The financial effects of this can be seen in Note 5.5.
The effect of the adoption of IFRS 12 has resulted in additional disclosures in the Group financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS Interpretations Committee have issued a number of new accounting standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations.
The following new standards are not applicable to these financial statements, but are expected to have an impact when they become effective.
The Group plans to apply these standards in the reporting period in which they become effective.
Effective for periods beginning Not yet endorsed by the EU Summary on or after IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Replacement project on financial instruments consists of 1 January 2018 three phases: Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities: Phase 2: Impairment methodology: and Phase 3: Hedge accounting IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use 1 January 2017 in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.

The adoption of the accounting standards endorsed but not yet applied above are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.
95 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other continued 5.1.
Basis of preparation and other accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of the financial information requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If, in the future, such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial information, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements are discussed in the following notes.
1.5 Share-based payments 3.1 Impairment of goodwill 3.6 Accrued income 3.9 Accrued expenses 5.2.
Restatement due to the adoption of IFRS 10 From 1 January 2014, the Group adopted IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements for the first time.
This required retrospective application meaning that the impact of adoption was applied from 1 January 2013.
This has resulted in a restatement of the comparative balance sheet as at 31 December 2013, and also a requirement to disclose the restated opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2013.
The adoption of IFRS 10 has resulted in consolidation of certain funds which previously did not require consolidation.
For 31 December 2013 this resulted in the Jupiter Global Fund SICAV: North American Equities being consolidated and at 1 January 2013 Jupiter Global Fund SICAV: Asia Pacific.
These funds had not been consolidated under the previous rules as the Group held less than 50 per cent.
Under IFRS 10, ownership of less than 50 per cent.
of the voting interests can constitute control, and therefore consolidation, if it has the power, ability to direct, and exposure to variable returns.
The table below shows extracts of the consolidated statement of cash flows and consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2013 and 1 January 2013, including the amounts previously reported, the adjustment arising from the adoption of IFRS 10 and the restated amounts.
There was no impact on the income statement in any period.

In September 2014, the Group signed an agreement for a 20 year lease on an uncompleted building.
Until completion, there is no obligation to make lease payments, and therefore no amount in relation to this has been included above.

In 2013, 6.6m was recycled from equity to the income statement on disposal of an available for sale investment see Note 3.4.
The Group used the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques, for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 2014 m m m m Available for sale investments Investments in associates 13.8 13.8 Financial assets at FVTPL 37.1 37.1 Financial liabilities at FVTPL 3.0 3.0 47.9 47.9 As at 31 December 2013, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: Restated Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 2013 m m m m Available for sale investments 2.6 2.6 Investments in associates 15.6 15.6 Financial assets at FVTPL 47.5 47.5 Financial liabilities at FVTPL 14.0 14.0 49.1 2.6 51.7 Level 1 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
98 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Investments in associates and financial assets at FVTPL These relate to seed capital investments in funds and investments made through subsidiary undertakings.
Details of the subsidiary and associate seed capital investments are included in Note 5.5.
Level 2 financial instruments At 31 December 2014, the Group did not have any level 2 financial instruments.
In 2013, the Level 2 financial instruments related to interest rate swaps.
The Group used the swaps to manage the interest rate exposure on its floating-rate loan.
The fair value of the swaps were determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
The swaps were terminated during 2013.
Further information on the swaps is included in Note 1.9.
The swaps were not designated as hedging instruments as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in the fair value were taken to the income statement within finance income or finance costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not trade in derivatives.
Derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price to exit the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value are included in the income statement.
The Group enters into total return swap arrangements to hedge certain of its seed capital investments.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement within other gains in accordance with the fair value movements in the swap over the period of the contract and settled monthly in accordance with the terms of the contract.
At the balance sheet date, any cash settlement due from, or to, the counterparty is recorded within current assets or current liabilities as appropriate.
At 31 December 2014, the notional value of the swaps was 21.2m 2013 22.6m.
The settlement amount at 31 December 2014 was 0.2m due from the counterparty and is included within trade and other receivables 2013: 0.4m due to the counterparty and included within trade and other payables.
Level 3 financial instruments Level 3 financial instruments held at fair value relate to available for sale investments.
Fair value is based on internally calculated valuations of the entity, which takes into account inputs such as expected future cash flows or the net assets of the investment.
Liquidity discounts are included where considered relevant.
The Level 3 financial instrument held at 31 December 2014 relates to an investment in iO Adria Limited Adria.
At 31 December 2014, an impairment review was performed and the balance was fully written off.
The Group previously held an investment in Cofunds Holdings Limited Cofunds.
In May 2013, the Group sold its investment for 16.6m.
This was recognised in the income statement along with 6.6m previously recognised in the available for sale reserve, which was recycled to the income statement on disposal.
This resulted in a total realised gain in the income statement of 6.7m see Note 1.7.
The table below reconciles the carrying values of Level 3 financial instruments at the beginning and end of the year: 2014 2013 Adria Total Adria Cofunds Total m m m m m At 1 January 2.6 2.6 2.6 16.5 19.1 Disposals 16.6 16.6 Losses recognised in other comprehensive income 6.6 6.6 Losses gains recognised in consolidated income statement 2.6 2.6 6.7 6.7 At 31 December - - 2.6 2.6 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is subject to a number of financial risks throughout its business, the principal risks being market risk, including price, foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board is accountable for risk and is responsible for oversight of the risk management process.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk strategy of the Group, and for determining an appropriate risk appetite and tolerance levels within which the Group must operate.
By defining these, the Board demonstrates that it is aware of and, where appropriate, has taken steps to mitigate the impact of risks that may have a material impact on the Group.
The Executive Committee reviews the key corporate risks facing the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility for the governance of the risk management of the firm, but delegates the risk and control framework to the Chief Financial Officer CFO.
The CFO is responsible for the monitoring and reporting of risk and controls, and through the Risk Committee manages the ongoing development of the Groups risk and control framework.
Jupiter embeds risk management within the business, with independent oversight and challenge being provided by the risk function.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets will adversely impact the profitability of the Group.
Management has identified price risk as the exposure in the value of financial assets held by the Group, resulting in a loss recognised in the consolidated income 99 statement.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other continued 5.4.
Financial risk management continued The Group holds equity investments in its seed capital portfolio and is exposed to the risk of changes in the equity markets that will reduce the value of the Groups investments.
At 31 December 2014, the exposure to unlisted equity securities at fair value was nil 2013: 2.6m and the exposure to listed securities at fair value was 48.2m 2013: 52.9m.
The Groups policy is to hedge the equity market and currency exposure of its seed capital investments depending on the fund mandate and whether available transactions are cost effective.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had a total return swap arrangement over certain holdings in seed fund investments.
A fall in value of an available for sale investment which is significant or prolonged is considered to be an indication of impairment under IAS 39.
In such an event, the available for sale investment is written down to fair value and the amounts previously recognised equity in respect of market value are recognised in the consolidated income statement as an impairment charge.
Price risk sensitivity analysis on financial assets The Directors believe that 10 per cent.
gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to price risk.
An increase or decrease of 10 per cent.
in equity markets would have the following impact on the profit before taxation and equity of the Group: 2014 2013 Market value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Income statement 2.7 2.7 3.0 3.3 Equity 0.3 The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
As the Group predominantly operates in the UK, with some transactions from overseas third parties in foreign currencies, this then impacts its exposure to non-sterling income and expenses.
The Groups policy is to hold minimum currency to cover operational needs and, therefore, to convert foreign currency on receipt.
Direct exposures are limited to operational cash held in overseas subsidiaries and short-term outstanding currency fee debts at any time.
The Group does not normally hedge this risk.
Foreign currency risk is managed by the finance function incorporating treasury operations, whereby foreign currency balances are monitored closely.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups cash balances and long-term debt obligations Note 1.9.
The Group manages interest rate risk via its finance function monitoring the interest rate cash flow risks and returns.
Historically, the Group has managed the interest rate risk on its borrowings via the use of interest rate swaps.
During 2013, these swaps were terminated, as the Board no longer considered it necessary to hedge the exposure of such a reduced loan balance.
The Group puts cash on deposit at fixed rates of interest for periods of up to three months.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The Directors believe that a movement in interest rates of 50bps gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax mainly through the impact on floating rate cash deposits and borrowings.
There is only an immaterial impact on the Groups equity.
2014 2013 Impact on the income statement of change in interest rates m m 50 bps 1.3 0.8 50 bps 0.8 0.5 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a financial loss in its operating activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily on its trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Trade receivables arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents Notes 3.6 and 3.7.

Financial risk management continued The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December is shown below: Restated 2014 2013 m m Trade receivables Note 3.6 66.8 68.2 Cash and cash equivalents Note 3.7 251.0 171.8 317.8 240.0 With regard to credit risk related to financial instruments, the Groups policy is to place deposits only with financial institutions which satisfy minimum ratings and other criteria set by the Counterparty Review Group CRG.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and, therefore, mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The CRG monitors the Groups counterparty exposures.
The table below contains an ageing analysis of current and overdue trade receivables: Restated 2014 2013 m m Neither past due nor impaired 65.8 67.0 Days past due 30 0.9 1.0 30-60 0.1 0.1 61-90 90 0.1 66.8 68.2 None of the receivables which were past due were considered to be impaired.

Trade and other receivables which are not rated comprise cancellations of units in unit trusts and sales of units in unit trusts, title to which are not transferred until settlement is received.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due or at a significantly higher cost.
The Group produces a cash flow forecast to ensure all assets and liabilities are managed efficiently.
The Groups objectives are: ensuring both the Group as a whole and individual entities within the Group have access to sufficient liquid funds to trade solvently and meet trading liabilities as they fall due: allowing the Group to maintain a flexible dividend policy, taking reference to prior year and prospective profitability, cash flow and balance sheet: and providing the Group with appropriate flexibility over the transferability of its capital and cash balances.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balances required for working capital management is held in interest bearing deposits of up to three months and the regulated companies, in particular, ensure that sufficient capital is kept to meet regulatory requirements.
