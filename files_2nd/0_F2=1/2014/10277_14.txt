Property refurbishment, together with increased overseas visitor numbers helped to increase average room rate and occupancy in most locations.
The hotels in Auckland and Queenstown in particular performed well.
Hotel revenue does not fully reflect improved RevPAR performance due to the cessation in the first quarter of 2014 of business interruption insurance receipts relating to the three Christchurch hotels damaged in the 2011 earthquake.
Excluding this factor, hotel revenues increased by 6.6% compared to 2013.
