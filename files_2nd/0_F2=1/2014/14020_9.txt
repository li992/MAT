16 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 strategic objectives The application of the Groups four key elements of value creation has resulted in the development of the following strategic objectives in each of the Groups five key market sectors.
The Groups progress against these objectives is also included in the table below: strategic objectives delivering strategy Structures Extend customer value proposition via increased collaboration New programme wins with significant aircraft OEMs have resulted from leveraging across the Group existing relationships within the Group Place significant internal emphasis upon utilisation of internal Capabilities increased at facilities in lower cost countries, and in support of a key low-cost Countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Mexico customer, a new Senior Aerospace facility in Charleston, South Carolina opened in Continue to focus on operational excellence to drive customer February 2015 satisfaction and increase market share On-time delivery improvements have been achieved through continuous focus on Develop capabilities and build a business of increased scale in key measures and the execution of improvement programmes South East Asia including the expansion of process capabilities New manufacturing facility under construction in Thailand for expansion of Structures to enhance added value for customers operation in South East Asia which will include a specialist treatment capability Invest in new technologies necessary for substantial growth Senior Aerospace is partnering with the AMRC Advanced Manuafacturing Research Centre at the University of Sheffield for the development of the latest machining and manufacturing techniques.
Additionally support for additive manufacturing is ongoing with the MTC Manufacturing Technology Centre Coventry Fluid conveyance systems Continue to develop products for new platforms Development contracts for ducting components secured for the engines that will Further develop strategic customer relationships power the A320neo, A350 and B737 MAX.
The A320neo and the A350 are due to Successful execution of new development programmes enter service in 2015 and the B737 MAX in 2017 Expand engineered product portfolio A targeted approach with strategic OEMs and tier 1 customers which have generated Acquire new or adjacent technologies multi operation opportunities across Senior Aerospace Continued investment in engineering and programme management is ensuring new programmes enter production profitably and in line with customer milestones Additional focus has been given to engineering collaboration across the Group resulting in a more formalised approach with potential additional capabilities and product offerings under consideration New facilities at SSP are due to start production during 2015 in order to satisfy increased customer demand Gas turbine engines Target higher value-added engineered or flight critical parts First rotating parts in production as part of an outsourcing contract from a significant e. g. rotating manufacturer.
A centre frame product was manufactured by Ketema in support of the Develop cross-business customer relationships B737 MAX engine development Further develop low-cost country footprint Collaboration and technology sharing between an increasing number of operations is Secure additional content on engines for next generation delivering new opportunities narrow-body and wide-body commercial aircraft Further investment in Thailand and Malaysia has resulted in additional opportunities being Expand process capabilities via new technology investment developed with existing and new customers Investment in specific improvement projects with the AMRC noted above also supports our activities in gas turbine engines Land vehicle emission control Develop product portfolio as emission regulation thresholds Development of a new design heavy-duty cooler has resulted in orders for natural increase globally gas applications as well as mid-range and smaller engine applications Build programmes with new truck and off-highway customers Developed and launched the state-of-the-art Flex-A-Fin EGR cooler Invest further in emerging market footprint, in growth markets Launched engine tube manufacture in India and now quoting on global programs out Investment in passenger car niches to support development of of Olomouc, Mexico, Brazil and China global platform capabilities Presence of China JV assisted in the award of exhaust flexes which will also be satisfied by our operations in Cape Town and Brazil The production of common rails and exhaust flexes has commenced within China and is expected to increase during 2015 New programme wins mean the Groups French land vehicle operation is expected to see continued improving financial performance in the future Industrial process control Expand global presence as emerging markets add local Secured and started delivery on two major Catofin projects.
One in South Korea hydrocarbon refining and processing facilities and one in Houston, USA secured several large international damper orders Secure growth from tightening emission standards in Developed a proprietary heat exchanger for Waste Heat recovery systems developed markets Developed fuel system components for Natural Gas engines Seek proprietary adjacent products Supplying key components to several fuel cell manufacturers and micro turbine Participate in new technology developments and applications suppliers in both Europe and North America e. g. combined heat and power fuel cells, concentrated solar Collaboration between Group operations in USA, Canada and Brazil is resulting in power, micro turbines improved competitiveness and broadening of product offerings Secure new major process projects as their capital funding Increase in new work awarded as a result of tightening emission regulations leads becomes available to additional damper and fabric expansion joint contracts Acquired Upeca adding product and geographic offering Developed and successfully testing new system to replace ball joints in existing solar energy plants www.
