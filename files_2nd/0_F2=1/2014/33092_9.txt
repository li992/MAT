The valuation surplus for the year was683.8m, before accounting adjustments of 11.9m seenote16, giving a total reported movement of 671.9m.

Our London portfolio, now 98% of our assets, rose by 20.7%.

Thetrue equivalent yield was 4.73%, a 55 basis points 8 reduction over the year and follows a 27 basis points tightening in 2013.
Since December 2013 the portfolios equivalent yield 7 has been in new territory with the previous cycle low point being 5.35% in mid-2007.
Current property yield levels are 6 supported by a shortage of good office space in central London, firm rental growth and a positive economic outlook, 5 allset around a historically low interest rate environment.
OnanEPRA basis our rental values rose 9.0% during the year 4 and followed a five year steady trend.
During 2014 the City Borders saw rental growth of 11.3% and the West End 8.4%.
3 The Groups total property return was 25.1%, compared 2 to18.5% last year.
This measurement is one of our key performance indicators KPI and was above the comparable 1 benchmark, the IPD Central London Office Index, which returned 23.5%.
A further property KPI benchmark is the 0 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 average three-year total property return, which was 18.4%, against the IPD All UK Property Index benchmark which Derwent London True Equivalent Yield Gap between DL TEY was10.4%.

The significant difference represents areversion of 83.9m, which is 18% greater than one year ago, and represents a 64% uplift on passing rents tothe estimated December 2014 rental values.
Portfolio reversion Analysis of the reversion shows that 32.0m or 38% is already Rental income m Reversion % 240 70 contracted through pre-lets, fixed uplifts and expiry of incentive periods.
Examples of properties with incentives include TurnmillEC1 and 40 Chancery Lane WC2 pre-let to Publicis 200 60 and 1Page Street SW1 let to Burberry.
This is a higher level than last year, when it was 30.2m.
This uplift is important for the valuation and the cash flow, but much of it, excluding 160 50 7.8mofpre-lets, is already included in our accounting earnings under IFRS.
The second contributor is the potential 28.4m receivable from letting vacant space, of which 120 40 21.3mis expected to come from on-site developments and refurbishments and 7.1m from immediately available space.
80 30 The final element of the estimated uplift is the lease reversion of23.5m, which represents 28% of the potential.
Some ofthese latter potential gains will be lost if we choose to 40 20 redevelop properties, although they should be more than compensated for by the increase in rental values on the subsequent projects.
