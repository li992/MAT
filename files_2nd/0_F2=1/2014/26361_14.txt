Financial results Other financial information Banking net interest margin Banking net interest margin is calculated by dividing banking net interest income by average interestearning banking assets.

Volatility arising in insurance businesses The Groups statutory result before tax is affected by insurance volatility caused by movements in financial markets, and policyholder interests volatility, which primarily reflects the gross up of policyholder tax included in the Group tax charge.
In 2014 the Groups statutory result before tax included positive insurance and policyholder interests volatility totalling 228 million compared to positive volatility of 668 million in 2013.
Volatility comprises the following: 2014 2013 m m Insurance volatility 219 218 1 Policyholder interests volatility 17 564 Total volatility 202 782 Insurance hedging arrangements 26 114 Total 228 668 1 Includes volatility relating to the Groups interest in St. Jamess Place in 2013.
54 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Insurance volatility The Groups insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments, including equities, property and fixed interest investments, all of which are subject to variations in their value.
The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments, yet IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments be reflected within the income statement.
As these investments are substantial and movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group, management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition to results based on the actual return.
The expected gross investment returns used to determine the normalised profit of the business, which are based on prevailing market rates and published research into historical investment return differentials, are set out below.
2014 2013 United Kingdom % % Investments backing annuity liabilities 4.54 3.83 Equities and property 6.48 5.58 UK government bonds 3.48 2.58 Corporate bonds 4.08 3.18 A review of investment strategy in the Groups Insurance business has resulted in investment being made in a wider range of assets.
Expected investment returns include appropriate returns for these assets.
The impact on the results due to the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return based upon economic assumptions made at the beginning of the year, adjusted for significant changes in asset mix is included within insurance volatility.
Changes in market variables also affect the realistic valuation of the guarantees and options embedded within the withprofits funds, the value of the inforce business and the value of shareholders funds.
The negative insurance volatility during 2014 of 219 million primarily reflects an adverse performance on equity and cash investments in the period relative to expected return.
Policyholder interests volatility The application of accounting standards results in the introduction of other sources of significant volatility into the pretax profits of the life, pensions and investments business.
In order to provide a clearer representation of the performance of the business, and consistent with the way in which it is managed, adjustments are made to remove this volatility from underlying profits.
The effect of these adjustments is separately disclosed as policyholder interests volatility.
The most significant of these additional sources of volatility is policyholder tax.
Accounting standards require that tax on policyholder investment returns should be included in the Groups tax charge rather than being offset against the related income.
The result is, therefore, to either increase or decrease profit before tax with a related change in the tax charge.
Timing and measurement differences exist between provisions for tax and charges made to policyholders.
Consistent with the normalised approach taken in respect of insurance volatility, differences in the expected levels of the policyholder tax provision and policyholder charges are adjusted through policyholder interests volatility.
In 2014, the statutory results before tax included a credit to other income which relates to policyholder interests volatility totalling 17 million 2013: 564 million relating to offsetting movements in equity, bond and gilt returns.
Insurance hedging arrangements The Group purchased put option contracts in 2014 to protect against deterioration in equity market conditions and the consequent negative impact on the value of inforce business on the Group balance sheet.
These were financed by selling some upside potential from equity market movements.
A charge of 26 million was taken on hedging contracts in 2014 2013: 114 million.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 55 Financial results Other financial information continued TSB The financial results for TSB are presented on a Lloyds Banking Group basis and differ to those reported by TSB for the reasons shown below.
Investors in TSB should only rely on financial information published by TSB.
2014 2013 m m Profit before tax: On a Lloyds Banking Group reporting basis underlying profit 458 106 1 Recognition of product transfers 200 2 Cost allocation 217 3 TSB dual running costs 326 4 Volatile items 26 46 5 Defined benefit pension scheme settlement gain 64 6 FSCS levy adjustment 10 Other 2 Reported in the TSB results announcement 170 85 2014 2013 bn bn Risk-weighted assets: On a Lloyds Banking Group reporting basis 5.2 5.6 7 Riskweighted assets for operational risk 1.5 0.4 8 Other 0.2 0.2 Reported in the TSB results announcement 6.9 6.2 1 On the Lloyds Banking Group reporting basis, all product transfers to TSB are assumed to have occurred on 1 January 2013.
2 In 2013, TSB was allocated costs on the same basis as the other business segments.
In 2014, costs have been charged to TSB in accordance with the Transitional Service Agreement and the costs that were previously allocated to TSB have been charged to the other business segments.
3 This represents corporate head office and similar costs incurred by TSB.
The Group has excluded these from underlying profit to provide a more meaningful view of underlying business costs as they represent the duplicated costs of running two corporate head offices.
These costs form part of the continuing TSB cost base and are reflected in the Groups statutory profit before tax.
4 Banking volatility reported below underlying profit in the Lloyds Banking Group results.
5 Following the transfer of employees from employment with Lloyds Banking Group companies to TSB Bank, the defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities have been derecognised from the TSB Bank balance sheet and settled with nil cash consideration, resulting in a one off gain of 64 million.
This is eliminated at Lloyds Banking Group level.
6 Adjustment to reflect the change in timing of the FSCS charge.
7 The TSB riskweighted asset for operational risk is determined by TSB as a standalone organisation.
8 Other relates mainly to riskweighted assets that result from TSBs standalone capital calculations, for example threshold adjustments and exposures with other businesses in the Lloyds Banking Group.
