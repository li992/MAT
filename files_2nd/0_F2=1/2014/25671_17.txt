GOING CONCERN The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Investment Adviser Report.
The financial position of the Company, its cash ows and its liquidity position are described in the Investment Adviser Report.
In particular, the current economic conditions continue to present a number of risks and uncertainties for the Company and these are set out in the Risk Committee Report on pages 10 to 13.
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company and the exposure of the Company to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are discussed in note 18 of the Financial Statements.
The Company continues to meet its requirements and day-to-day liquidity needs through both its own cash resources and those of the Group, to which it has full recourse.
In February 2013, JLIF Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Company, secured a three year 150 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc, Royal Bank of Scotland plc and ING Bank NV.
This facility replaced the previous 75 million facility with Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The facility is used primarily to fund acquisitions and is repaid through raising equity in the market.
The facility is intended to be additional resource and not structural nancing.
The facility is due to expire in February 2016.
JLCM has started to engage with several potential lenders with a view to agreeing a new facility to replace the existing facility once it expires.
As at 31 December 2014 the Company had a cash balance of 4.3 million, a further 22.2 million within the rest of the JLIF Group and the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and available for future acquisitions and working capital.
The Company has sufficient cash balances to meet other current obligations as they fall due while all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and projections which cover a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report, taking into account reasonably possible changes in investment and trading performance, which show that the Company has sufficient financial resources.
Furthermore, the Directors have borne in mind the need to renance the revolving credit facility within the next 12 months.
The Group has sufficient financial resources together with long term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Report of the Directors continued GOING CONCERN CONTINUED On the basis of this review, and after making due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
