Key performance indicators With our strategy now focused on delivering even greater loyalty from our customers, we place even greater emphasis across the business on improving five customer-focused key performance indicators.
Whilst we continue to track a range of financial and non-financial measures, it is these five which each of our businesses now uses to gauge progress.
Key performance indicators of our strategic performance We have entered the new, multichannel world of retail and customers expectations have changed.
Customers have increased access to more and more retailers simply at their search bar on their smartphone and our success will be a result of more customers choosing Tesco in preference to others.
As a result of this fundamental change, we have prioritised our customer-focused measures to track and communicate our progress against the strategy.
We believe these five KPIs are more relevant today, during this time of transition and transformation, than some of our historical and short-term measures.
Everything we are doing to create the most compelling offer is designed to retain our most loyal customers, attract new ones and allow them to shop however, whenever and wherever they want to.
These measures both allow us to monitor our progress and to create value because they are entirely focused on customers and how they choose to shop.
Greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value so we are tracking the behaviours of our loyal Clubcard customers those who are most engaged and typically spend more with us.
Focusing on our loyal customers is how we are driving the transformation we are going through and is how we will build enduring like-for-like sales.
The measures contained in this section are for our core UK business where they are particularly relevant.
They do however apply to every part of our business whether its a store, a category, a country or a department and we are using them across the Group to drive the behaviours that we believe will lead to long-term success.

Loved by customers word of mouth, as well as engaging more broadly and deeply Our final measure is one of customer advocacy.
Whilst the first four are functional measures, we know that for our brand to be with the business.
There are many different ways of measuring loved, liked or actively chosen, our emotional connection with advocacy, not least using a net promoter score, but they all add up to something similar do customers like you enough our customers must get stronger.
Emotionally loyal customers, advocates and fans become brilliant ambassadors and drive to recommend you to others?
Loyal customers are defined based on their frequency of spend and average weekly spend.
Channels include: large stores, convenience stores, grocery home shopping, Tesco Direct and Wine by the case.
Current results do not include Blinkbox, Clothing online, Nutricentre, Dobbies and our new coffee shops and restaurants.
These will be tracked going forward.
