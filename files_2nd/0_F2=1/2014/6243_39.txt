exploration diamond drilling, and 4,350 metres of drifting in 2014, In 2014, we conducted 23,053 metres of surface diamond drilling and whichresulted in extended mineralised structures to the west and north.
686 metres of drifting to complete the infill drilling programme, as Notwithstanding, additional exploration is required to determine the ore recommended by mining consultancy AMC to provide further confidence bodies in the coming years, thus deferring this advanced exploration in resources.
Further progress in the construction of the decline and project until more detailed information is obtained.
additional geological investigation is planned for 2015.
Other sites in the Fresnillo Corridor Drilling continues in a number of targets surrounding the Fresnillo District, which resulted from integrated geochemical, geophysical and structural studies vectoring towards the most favourable locations in the region for finding additional veins.
