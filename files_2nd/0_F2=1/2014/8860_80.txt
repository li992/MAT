The MDRC has discretion to accelerate vesting, in which case the performance condition would be assessed to the end of the financial year preceding the accelerated vesting date.
In either case, unless the MDRC determines otherwise, the level of vesting shall be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the performance period which has elapsed to the date of leaving.
In the post-vesting deferral period, only those who leave due to misconduct will lose their shares.
