External directorships Savills recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies.
Such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Savills.
Subject to approval by the Board and any conditions that it might impose, the Executive Directors and Group Executive Board members are allowed to accept external non-executive directorships and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
For non-executive directorships which are considered to arise by virtue of an Executive Directors or Group Executive Board members position within Savills, the fees are paid directly to Savills.
During 2014, Simon Shaw received a fee of 30,000 in relation to his continuing appointment as Non-Executive Chairman of Synairgen plc which he was permitted to keep.
