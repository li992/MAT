Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices Operating review Dukat Omolon Mining Omolon delivered strong operating and financial performance At Dukat, ore mined grew by 17% compared to 2013 to 1.47 Mt, in 2014, with gold equivalent production increasing by 43% to Targeting reliable  underground of which 0.9 Mt was hauled by the newly commissioned railroad 226 Koz and cash costs decreasing by 35% to US$570 GE oz.
Underground development grew by 2% to This was driven by a higher grade profile, as well as an 8% to-reserve conversion Location: Magadan Region, Russia 31.2 km.
Small-scale equipment was integrated in the current increase in Kubaka mill throughput.
Managing director: Vladimir Bloshkin production process.
We are now prepared to mine narrow ore Location: Magadan Region, Russia Employees: 783 bodies in Smeliy and Vostochniy.
At Goltsovoye, a total of Mining Managing director: Mikhail Egorov Mining: open-pit underground 191 Kt at a stable grade of 624 g t silver was mined in 2014.
Total ore mined increased by 20% in 2014 and amounted Employees: 1,807 Processing: 850 Ktpa CIP Merrill-Crowe Kubaka to 2,065 Kt.
Mining: mostly underground Production start date: 2010 At Arylakh, underground development continued following Production start date: 2000 Life of mine: 2021 the completion of open-pit mining in Q2.
The ore is still At Sopka, ore mined grew by 37% to 922 Kt and open-pit Life of mine: 2023 Lunnoye, 2024 Dukat predominantly sourced from Lunnoye underground mine mining was completed in Q4 2014 with ore processing due to Key figures with a variable grade profile driven by stope sequencing, with be completed in Q3 2015.
In Q1 2015, we plan to relocate the Key figures average silver grade increasing by 22% to 421 g t in 2014. released mining fleet to Oroch by winter road.
At Dalneye, ore At Lunnoye mine, stoping in ore zone 7 started.
To ensure mining will be completed in 2015.
At Birkachan, open-pit mining better grade control and to reduce dilution, we launched pilot was completed in June, and the underground development 226 Koz 570 cut-and-fill mining in horizontal layers in ore zone 7. started in Q3.
At Tsokol, which was the major source for CIP 3rd 23.9 Moz circuit in 2014, ore mined grew by 42% to 317 Kt.
GE production cost US$ GE oz Processing and production Largest silver deposit Silver production 43% Total cash costs 35% In 2014, Omsukchan concentrator shifted from three-stage to Processing in the world 8% two-stage milling.
As a result of this and due to a reduction in The Kubaka plant achieved a further increase in throughput time for re-lining and scheduled maintenance, ore processed in 2014, with ore processed increasing by 8% to 825 Kt.
There was a modest reduction Supported by a high share of ore processed from Sopka and 51% in average grades by 9% for gold to 0.66 g t and by 5% to Dalneye during the year, average grades processed increased 8.7US$ SE oz 2.1Mt 405.6 g t for silver.
Silver recoveries were sustainably high at by 31% for gold to 6.7 g t and by 13% for silver to 133 g t. Adjusted EBITDA margin 86.5% due to an ore quality control system based on geological As a result, gold production at Kubaka increased by 48% Total cash cost Ore processed 23% and process mapping.
As a result, gold and silver production to 170 Koz and silver production was up 14% to 2.9 Moz: -25% 10% grew by 4% and 7%, respectively, to 31.5 Koz of gold and the peak level achieved by Omolon hub.
At Birkachan heap leach, irrigation of the existing leach pads At Lunnoye, ore processed grew by 18% year-on-year to continued and 6 Koz of gold were recovered from the solution 400 Kt after the new SAG mill was commissioned, with average during 2014.
There will be no additional ore stacking in 2015 grades increasing by 21% for gold and 5% for silver, and as multi-year recoveries will continue to be monitored.

Gold production was 13.9 Koz, up 36% year-on-year, Reserves, resources and exploration and silver production was 4.4 Moz, up 16%.
At Omolon, we continue to work on a number of brownfield targets close to the Kubaka plant in order to extend the life of The hubs total silver production was a record 23.9 Moz, mine.
In 2014, we have completed an initial reserve estimate up 8% year-on-year.
Gold production grew to 45.3 Koz, for Burgali, adding 72 Koz to reserves, and continued drilling up 12% year-on-year.

In 2015, we will continue drilling at other areas, such as Yolochka.
Resources and exploration In 2014, we completed the conversion of resources into reserves Priorities for 2015 at Olcha, adding 119 Koz of gold and 222 Koz of silver into the In 2015, Omolon operations will increasingly switch to hubs base.
Further resource-to-reserve conversion continued underground mining.
Open-pit mining at Tsokol will near at the deeper levels of Dukat, Lunnoye and Goltsovoye.
We have completion in Q2 2015, with underground development planned carried on our exploration efforts at the flanks of Dukat.
The potential for underground mining result of drilling 28 km at the flanks, known ore bodies were will be evaluated after the completion of a detailed in-fill drilling Mines Mines Kubaka traced in more detail and new blind veins were discovered.
