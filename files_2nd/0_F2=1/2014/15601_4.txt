Using our unrivalled insight to understand what customers want, we buy products and services from suppliers, move them through our distribution network and sell them 38 million to customers.
Most importantly, our core purpose is at the heart of these activities.
It is by improving these activities Clubcard customers shopping in our 7,300 stores across the Group give us unrivalled insight into consumer habits, for customers each time they shop with us that we make trends and preferences.
Across the Group, our customers visit us in store, online, or through a combination of different formats and channels.
They come to buy their groceries, clothing, general merchandise and services such as telecoms, digital entertainment and banking.
We are focused on providing customers with the most compelling offer and the best shopping trip.
We work with our suppliers to offer an excellent range of products and services.
We move the products through our modern and efficient supply chain into our well-located, multi-format store network, ready for customers to shop with us 24 hours a day.
The core activities form a cycle.
To keep customers coming back, we are constantly strengthening our operation.
We listen to customers in a number of ways, including through our monthly Customer Viewpoint surveys in UK stores, in-depth focus groups with our Tesco Families and dedicated Customer Question Time sessions.
Combining this feedback with our data, including the unique insight we gain from Clubcard, and acting on it is crucial to our success.
The key enablers Our seven key enablers are our business strengths.
They help us to sustain and improve our core activities.
These elements are what make us different and its because of these that we are uniquely placed to win.

This year, for example, we completed the roll-out of grocery home shopping to all of our markets except India.
It is a service we developed in the UK and have rolled out in a capital-efficient way to our international businesses, with a great customer response.
Doing the right thing for customers is central to the business model.
Its why one of our Values is no-one tries harder for customers: we know that if we do the right thing for customers, they will reward us with their loyalty.
The more pleased customers are with the shopping trip, the more loyal they will be and the more we will grow our sales.
This combination of scale and growth is the driving force of the business model.
