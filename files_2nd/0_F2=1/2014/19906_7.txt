We regularly review the quality of our existing properties to ensure they are operationally efficient and continue to provide the best accommodation for students.
This year we recycled 9% of our total portfolio and used the proceeds to fund new development and reduce borrowings.
HIGHEST QUALITY PORTFOLIO 20 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information PLANNING SECURED IN 2014 399 BEDS CAUSEWAYEND, ABERDEEN Unite has operated in Aberdeen since 2001 and currently provides a home for 1,300 students across four properties, all in great central locations providing easy access to The University of Aberdeen and Robert Gordon University.
Our new development site at Causewayend was acquired from Aberdeen City Council.
The 399 bed scheme will include the refurbishment of a redundant Grade C listed school building as part of the design, bringing an old building back to life.
In November, planning was granted by officers under a delegated decision.
With most schemes of this scale having to be heard at committee for approval, a sole officer's recommendation highlights the confidence Aberdeen has in Unite.
This confidence is based on Unite's ability to deliver the development with the reuse of the existing historical buildings, and to continue to support the Universities in the city.
Work is due to commence in March 2015 with completion in time for the 2016 17 academic year.
In 2014 Unite was granted planning for 2,796 beds across four sites.
