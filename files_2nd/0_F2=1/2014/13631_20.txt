GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Relative importance of spend on pay The following graph shows actual expenditure of the Company and change in spend between current and prior financial periods on remuneration paid to all employees against distributions to shareholders.
Statement of implementation of the remuneration policy in 2015 The base salaries for the executive directors were reviewed in December 2014 and the percentage increases shown below effective from 1 January 2015 were agreed by the Committee.
Except for JM Davis, this is consistent with the typical increase for the UK workforce which was 1.8%.
JMDavis received a marginally higher increase reflecting his experience and continued progression in the role.
The salaries from 1 January 2015 are therefore as follows: RH Arnold $389,760 1.8% JM Davis 292,125 2.5% PI France 430,000 1.8% GM Ogden 208,997 1.8% The annual cash bonus for 2015 will be based on annual profit target 25%, three year profit growth 25%, EPS 10%, cash generation 10%, accident frequency rate 5% and CO emissions 5%.
These targets total 80% and are then allocated to executive directors at 100% of basic salary, except for the 2 Chief Executive where the allocation is 125% of basic salary.
The specific targets relating to the bonus have not been disclosed as they are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive but full details will be given on a retrospective basis in next years report.
LTIP awards of 100% of salary will be granted, except for the Chief Executive where the LTIP award will be 125%.
This is within the maximum policy limit of 150% of salary.
The Committee considers that the higher award level for the Chief Executive in 2015 provides a better balance between the short and long-term incentive opportunity for the Chief Executive and is appropriate given the overall potential value of his remuneration package.
Consistent with the approach used in previous years, the performance conditions will be subject to TSR and EPS performance conditions each accounting for 50% of the award.
TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE 250 Index excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts with 25% vesting at median increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
For the EPS condition, EPS growth must be at least RPI 10% for 25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 25% and above.
The Committee is satisfied that the EPS targets remain appropriately challenging given the current outlook for the Group.
The fees for the non-executive directors were reviewed in December 2013 and no changes to the fees are proposed.
The fee for the Chairman was reviewed in December 2014 as part of the search process for a successor Chairman.
GM Ogden will retire from the Company on 31 March 2015.
He will not receive any compensation for loss of office.
He will receive a pro-rated annual cash bonus for 2015.
The Committee has exercised its discretion in relation to his outstanding LTIP awards for 2013 and 2014 in line with the relevant scheme rules applicable for each award.
For the 2013 award there will be a pro rata award based on a hypothetical vesting at the retirement date.
For the 2014 award there will be a pro rata vesting in the event that there is any vesting of the award at the end of the relevant performance period.
Any outstanding Sharesave or SIP awards will vest in accordance with their terms.
