Financial review Key Performance Indicators 2016 Transform targets On 8 May 2014, Barclays announced revised Transform targets based on the results of an updated strategic review.
There are six primary 2016 targets as outlined below.
Three of these targets relate to performance of the Group with regards to capital, leverage and dividends: two relate to the Core business, focusing on sustainable returns and cost management: while the final target is specific to minimising the Non-Core dilution on the Groups return on equity RoE.
These measures formed the basis of the Key Performance Indicators KPIs in 2014 and are used by management in order to assess financial performance.
In addition, the Group adjusted RoE and CRD IV fully loaded CET1 ratio are included as the Group Balanced Scorecard measures.
