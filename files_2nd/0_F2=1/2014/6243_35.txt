Capital expenditures However, production volumes were partly impacted by lower ore grade of 0.51 g t in 2014, from 0.54 g t in 2013.
In 2015, it is expected that Capital expenditures of US$20.9 million were allocated to construction the average gold ore grade at Noche Buena will be around 0.45 g t. of leaching pads, development activities and expansion of processing Ore grades through the life of the mine are expected to average 0.53 g t, capacity at the beneficiation plant.
which is lower than our previous estimates as a result of the increased volumes ofresources added, albeit with lower grades.
Financial performance 3 During the year, we completed construction of the 1,600 m hour Adjusted revenues at Noche Buena were US$163.5 million due to higher processing plant: full capacity has been reached.
In addition, we sales volumes that partially mitigated lower gold prices in 2014. completed construction of fourth and fifth leaching pads at Noche Buena.
