WPP 2 ANNUAL REPORT 2014 The fast read What we think In praise of the long view by Sir Martin Sorrell Champions of the long view are becoming harder to find.
Boardrooms in the West at least are more likely to be inhabited by the ghosts of Lehman than John Maynard Keynes animal spirits.
Consequently, targets are often reached not by maximising revenues, but by minimising costs including marketing spend.
Despite the challenges, our business performed well in 2014, which was another record year for the Group.
We expect the pattern for 2015 to be much the same: a bit of a slog, but a satisfactory result at the end of it, ahead of last year.
Looking further into the future, corporate minds will eventually turn to investment and growth, and marketing services will be one of the principal beneficiaries.
Throughout our three decades of existence, taking the long view has worked well for WPP and its stakeholders.
We have the right strategy to take advantage of the fundamental shifts both technological and geographical shaping our industry.
We continue to focus on: new markets, new media, data investment management and the application of technology, and horizontality.
Sir Martin Sorrells article begins on page 87.
You May Not Know Where Youre Going Until Youve Got There Which is why The Best Brief may be The Brand by Jeremy Bullmore In business, particularly in marketing, we seem to be at least as reluctant as scientists to come clean about our processes of thought.

Four strategic priorities Our goal remains to be the worlds most admired and respected communications services advisor to global, multinational, regional and local companies.
To that end, we have four core strategic priorities: Increase the combined geographic share of revenues from the faster-growing markets 1 of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe to 40-45% of revenues.
Increase the share of revenues of new media to 40-45% of revenues.
2 Maintain the share of more measurable marketing services such as data investment 3 management and direct, digital and interactive at 50% of revenues, with a focus on the application of new technology, big data and digital.
Advance horizontality by ensuring our people work together for the benefit of 4 clients, primarily through two horizontal integrators: Global Client Leaders and Regional, Sub-Regional and Country Managers.
