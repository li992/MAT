22 | HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements Ive been Reparalias customer for a few years now and called them to come and fix a broken plug.
The person that came to repair it was exceptionally kind.
When someone comes to repair a breakdown it is very important that theyre willing to do a good job and that the person who does it is a qualified professional, and thats exactly how it went.
We asked for a bigger plug and got it, no questions asked.
I also felt very well taken care of by customer service and the tradesman was on time.
He had to go out to get a few parts but returned quickly.
