Mid and small sized companies performed more strongly than large companies reflecting the fact that they are generally more exposed to a strengthening domestic economy.

Housebuilders performed strongly last year as they continued to recover from their very deep recession and benefited from recent Government policy initiatives aimed at increasing the number of new houses being built, most notably the Help to Buy scheme.
Persimmon and Barratt Developments were the two largest contributors to performance in the portfolio last year.
Our position in Software and Computer Services performed relatively well as a number of companies which we do not hold, such as Telecity, Aveva and Anite suffered reduced growth prospects and a relatively recent new issue, Fusionex, did well from growing uptake of its software for analysing consumer data.
Your Companys Media sector performance was also strong last year, in particular benefiting from an increasing appreciation of the strong non-newspaper growth prospects within the Daily Mail & General Trust group, which was the third largest contributor to performance in the portfolio last year.
The largest negative relative performance last year was suffered by the Food Producers sector where our holdings in palm oil companies, such as New Britain Palm Oil and MP Evans, cost us performance in a rising stock market as they failed to show any strength against a background of a relatively flat palm oil price.
We continue to hold these stocks because we believe that their longer term prospects are good.
The oil and gas sector, which has been a strong contributor to performance for Mercantile over recent years, was a detractor last year as a number of our holdings suffered from substantial delays in developing their exploration assets, most notably at Providence Resources offshore Southern Ireland and at Bowleven, in Cameroon.
JPM Mercantile pp01 20 JPM Mercantile pp01 20 01 04 2014 11:47 Page 7 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 7 Last year saw a revival of the Initial Public Offering IPO market, with the fourth quarter of 2013 being the third largest IPO quarter for a decade.
We are actively involved in analysing and meeting companies in some cases as much as 18 months before they are offered in the stockmarket.
Last year we met 21 such companies and invested in six of them.
Each of these added to the performance of Mercantile and we are continuing to research a number of companies which may come to the stockmarket over the next 18 months.
Portfolio Your Company benefited from being geared throughout the year.
The investment managers have the flexibility to operate within a gearing range of 10% net cash to 20% geared and a more specific tactical range is agreed regularly with the Board.
The portfolio continues to be diversified across all sectors, comprising around 140 stocks of which 95 are mid sized and 45 are smaller companies.
The ten largest holdings represent 24% of the net assets.
Of the ten, which are shown on page 13, Persimmon, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, Bovis Homes, Barratt Developments, Berkeley Group, Bellway and Cable & Wireless Communications were all in the top ten a year ago and the other three stocks were already substantial holdings within the portfolio.
Turning to the three largest investments of one year ago which are no longer in the top ten: Phoenix Holdings failed to agree merger terms with Admin Re which would have generated substantial synergies and so we reduced the size of our holding: Mondi was sold on its promotion into the FTSE 100 Index: and the size of our position in Hiscox was reduced in response to the weakening outlook for insurance rates.

Whilst more than half of this revenue is derived from the UK, we still have a good level of exposure to international growth opportunities that are available to us as investors in UK quoted mid and small sized companies.
So whilst, for example, the focus of the housebuilders is in the UK domestic market our interests in insurance, manufacturing, telecommunications, food ingredients and oil and gas companies provide international exposure.

We focus on those successful growing mid sized companies which are progressing towards promotion into the FTSE 100 index and also on value opportunities presented by companies being demoted from the FTSE 100 index which may have fallen out of favour but offer good opportunities for recovery.
We also focus on smaller companies which may be less well known but which can offer the potential for superior growth.
Our intensive research process is designed to identify the winners of tomorrow before they become better known.
During the year we held more than 300 research meetings with companies and this remains an important part of our investment process when evaluating companies.
Outlook The last two years have provided exceptional returns for investors in small and medium sized UK companies, as the market re-rated in anticipation of an improving economic environment.
We are now seeing signs of such improvements, and the market commentary has moved from the threat of a triple dip recession just 12 months ago, to broad based domestic economic recovery, as evidenced by The Bank of England forecasting UK real GDP growth of 3.4% in 2014, the fastest rate JPM Mercantile pp01 20 JPM Mercantile pp01 20 01 04 2014 11:47 Page 9 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 9 of growth since 2007.
The more domestically exposed small and medium sized companies should benefit from this growth, as they derive a significantly greater proportion of revenue from the UK than their larger counterparts.
