| 12 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2014 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2014 13 Singapore Help when its needed most t must be one of the worst moments imaginable: a diagnosis of terminal cancer.
That was the devastating news given to one Iof our customers in Singapore, Mr Yeo Chong Kheng and hisfamily.
But because Mr Yeo had a life insurance policy with us we could help and reassure him and his family at an awful time.
We made a payment to Mr Yeo when he received his diagnosis.
This meant he could spend his last weeks more comfortably and put his affairs in order, knowing that his wife and son would be taken care of after he had gone.
In particular, he now knew that his son would still be able to study overseas.
Nothing can bring Mr Yeo back.
But we know that what we could do meant a great deal to him and his family.
Mr Yeos wife, Mdm Chin Yoke Yoon, recalls how the family coped with the news: Dealing with my husbands sudden illness was such a difficult time for the whole family, so not having to worry about our finances, on top of everything else, was a relief.
This experience has made me realise just how beneficial insurance can be, so Im now an advocate and I want to help others understand the importance of planning for the future.
We believe it is our privilege to support our customers at such difficult times.
This has shown me just how important insurance is.
