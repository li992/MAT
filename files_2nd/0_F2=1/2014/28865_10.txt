25 Business review Customer Case Study Fairer Banking Weve made a conscious decision to be different from other banks.
In 2014, we made a series of customer commitments which aimed to make banking simpler, fairer and clearer for our customers.
In an industry leading move we stopped offering teaser rates to attract new customers and offered our customers the same rates online, through a branch or over the phone.
As part of this we became the first bank on the high street to commit to giving all our savers the same rates, including proactively moving our loyal existing customers onto our best rates.
Weve also simplified our products, so its easy for our customers to find the right one for their needs and with all our charges explained on just one page.
In March we stopped offering 0% balance transfer credit cards.
This type of card was designed to make it easier for customers to repay existing credit card debt, but our research showed that debt tended to increase, rather than reduce over the term.
Stopping these cards meant around 100,000 customers transferred to a low, ongoing rate with no chance of being caught out by a big jump in their interest rate down the line.
Were making changes for business customers too 95% of business lending decisions are now made within five days and gross business lending is up 30% from 2013.
Plus, weve committed an extra 1 billion to support small businesses with fee-free, fixed rate loans.
