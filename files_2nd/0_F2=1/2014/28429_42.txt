Notes 1 Excludes Groups proportionate share in joint ventures and unit-linked assets and holdings of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
2 The methodology and assumptions used in calculating the economic capital results are set out in note II c of Additional unaudited financial information.
The economic capital ratio is based on outputs from the Groups Solvency II internal model which will be subject to Prudential Regulation Authority review and approval before its formal adoption in 2016.
We remain on track to submit our Solvency II internal model to the Prudential Regulation Authority for approval in 2015 but given the degree of uncertainty remaining these economic capital disclosures should not be interpreted as outputs from an approved internal model.
