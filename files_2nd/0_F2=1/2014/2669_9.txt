While betting volumes as well as overall player activity on sports and gaming excluding poker have been above last year, lower margins in sports betting and casino meant that average daily net revenue was down 12% year-on-year.
New gaming and other indirect taxes, continued pressures in European poker and the absence of a major football tournament this year represent significant headwinds in 2015.
However, the steps taken during 2014 to reduce costs and the early results from some of our recent product launches and other initiatives mean that we remain confident about the full year outlook.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.89pence per share, a 5% increase over the prior year making 3.78 pence per share for the full year.
