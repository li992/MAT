ULTIMATE REMEDY MALUS Grants under the GSIP and MCIP are subject to ultimate remedy.
Upon vesting of an award, the Committee shall have the discretionary power to adjust the value of the award if the award, in the Committees opinion taking all circumstances into account, produces an unfair result.
In exercising this discretion, the Committee may take into account Unilevers performance against non-financial measures.
The Committee will only adjust the value of a vesting GSIP and MCIP award upwards after obtaining shareholder consent.
With effect from the 2015 GSIP and MCIP awards, the Committee may apply malus to reduce an award or determine that it will not vest or only vest in part in the event of a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever, gross misconduct or gross negligence, material breach of Unilevers Code of Business Principles or any of the Unilever Code Policies or conduct by the individual that results in significant losses or serious reputational damage to Unilever.
With effect from the 2015 annual bonus based on 2014 performance, the annual bonus will also be subject to malus on the same grounds as apply for GSIP and MCIP awards.
CLAW-BACK The Committee has discretion to reclaim or claw-back some or all of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors in the event of a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever.
This includes the annual bonus together with any awards that have been made and or vested shares under the Share Matching Plan, the GSIP and the MCIP.
This claw-back may be effected up to two years from vesting by reducing outstanding awards or requiring the return of the net value of vested awards to Unilever.
In 2014, the Committee did not reclaim or claw-back any of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors.

At the beginning of the year, the Committee set stretching performance targets, against which management has made solid progress despite declining growth rates during the year across many of the markets in which Unilever sells its products.
Underlying sales growth was 2.9% and underlying volume growth was 1.0%.
Although these results are towards the lower end of the performance range, Unilever has continued to grow ahead of its markets.
Improvement in core operating margin compared with 2013 was 0.4 percentage points.
The Committee considered this to be an outstanding performance, especially given unfavourable movements in exchange rates over the course of 2014.
To achieve this result, underlying core operating margin growth at constant exchange rates has been 0.8 percentage points reflecting strong discipline in controlling costs.
In view of the high quality of results achieved over the course of the year, the Committee exercised its judgement to raise the overall Group bonus score from 68% to 80% of target 40% of maximum.
The Committee considered this to be a fairer representation of the performance delivered by the executive team during 2014.
In the past five years, including 2014, the Committee has exercised its discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus calculation downwards three times and upwards twice.
In determining bonus outcomes for Paul Polman, the Committee also considered his strong personal performance and leadership in driving Unilever to a more agile and resilient business, as well as his personal leadership in driving towards a more responsible long-term sustainable business model, taking the needs of multiple stakeholders into account, driving diversity and making Unilever the choice for talent in the majority of its markets.
As a consequence of that review, Paul Polman was awarded a personal performance multiplier of 138%.
This resulted in Paul Polman receiving a bonus of 132% of his base salary.
This is calculated as follows: 68 Governance Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Target bonus: 120% of Unilevers 2014 Personal performance 1,333,200 base salary 1,212,000 performance ratio 80% multiplier 138% 132% of base salary In determining bonus outcomes for Jean-Marc Hut, the Committee also considered his personal performance and leadership, including the management of Unilevers financial risk exposure and driving enterprise wide efficiencies.
As a consequence of that review, Jean-Marc Hut was awarded a personal performance multiplier of 110%.
This resulted in Jean-Marc Hut receiving a bonus of 88% of his base salary.
This is calculated as follows: Target bonus: 100% of Unilevers 2014 Personal performance 628,320 base salary 714,000 performance ratio 80% multiplier 110% 88% of base salary MCIP 2015 AWARDS BASED ON 2014 ANNUAL BONUS OUTCOMES On 13 February 2015, Paul Polman invested 60% 799,920 and Jean-Marc Hut invested 25% 157,080 of their 2014 bonus in MCIP investment shares.
Paul Polman elected to invest fully in NV shares.
Jean-Marc Hut elected to receive a 50 50 mix of PLC NV shares.
They each received a corresponding award of performance-related MCIP matching shares awarded in the same form as the investment shares.
MCIP matching awards are subject to the same performance measures as GSIP awards.
Further information on matching awards is set out on page 65 to 66.
D MCIP UK LAW REQUIREMENT AUDITED 2014 OUTCOMES This includes MCIP matching shares granted on 17 February 2012 based on the percentage of 2011 bonus that Executive Directors had invested in Unilever shares based on performance in the three-year period to 31 December 2014 which vested on 17 February 2015.
The values included in the single figure table for 2014 are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted on 17 February 2012 including additional shares in respect of accrued dividends through to 31 December 2014 by the level of vesting 121% of target awards.
The share prices on the date of vesting of NV 37.04 and PLC 28.01 have been translated into euros using the exchange rate on the date of vesting: 1 0.7383.
The award was based on the same performance targets as the GSIP and performance against targets is outlined in section E below.
