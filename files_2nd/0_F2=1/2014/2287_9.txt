Bodycotes services offer tangible benefits to customers such as reduced Heat treatments are controlled processes used to alter the equipment maintenance, capital expenditure, energy costs, people microstructure of materials, such as metals and alloys, to impart costs and a major reduction in CO emissions.
properties which benefit the working life of a component, for 2 example, increased surface hardness, temperature resistance, Bodycote has a long history of successful outsourcing ductility and strength.
Metal joining includes specialised processes relationships, working with a range of customers from global to such as electron beam welding, vacuum and honeycomb brazing local manufacturers.
In many cases, these relationships lead to complex operations requiring a fusion of expertise and technology.
component and service-specific arrangements, which provide protection for the customer from supply disruption by leveraging Bodycote offers an extensive range of heat treatment services and Bodycotes unique facility network, and optimising asset utilisation.
metal joining techniques including three of the Groups Specialist 3 Such arrangements are normally exclusive in character and Technologies: Specialty Stainless Steel Processes S P, Corr-I-Dur provide the basis for mutual business development, with both and Low Pressure Carburising from facilities around the world.

Every week a typical Bodycote HIP plant will process many tons of titanium, aluminium, steel and super-alloy castings, removing porosity and improving the performance of parts such as turbine blades and oilfield components.
With the largest operational capacity in the world and a wide variety of equipment sizes, Bodycote HIP is able to accommodate large volumes of small product as economically as large individual components.
Surface technology The Groups Specialist Surface Technologies are used extensively to prolong the working life of components and protect them from environmental factors such as corrosion and abrasion.
The range of surface technologies available from Bodycote covers a wide variety of applications, providing manufacturers with solutions to meet requirements such as durability, wear resistance, improved hardness and electrical conductivity.
Bodycote is a provider of specialised plasma spray, high velocity oxy fuel HVOF and thermochemically formed coatings treatments and is able to surface engineer components including complex geometric shapes and internal bores that are designed to operate in the most demanding of industrial applications.
