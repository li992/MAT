Derivative financial instruments The group enters into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions as a principal only to minimise the impact of interest and currency rate changes to its financial instruments.
The groups total derivative asset and liability position as reported on the consolidated balance sheet is as follows: 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 Notional Notional value Assets Liabilities value Assets Liabilities million million million million million million Exchange rate contracts 254.6 4.8 0.3 245.6 4.8 2.2 Interest rate contracts 4,245.7 8.0 3.8 4,228.4 14.5 7.2 Equity derivatives 128.1 15.0 15.4 298.1 37.5 39.0 4,628.4 27.8 19.5 4,772.1 56.8 48.4 Notional amounts of interest rate contracts totalling 3,127.6 million 31 July 2013: 2,597.0 million and exchange rate contracts totalling nil 31 July 2013: 43.8 million have a residual maturity of more than one year.
The notional amounts of equity and associated embedded derivatives with a residual maturity of more than one year total nil 31 July 2013: 128.9 million.
Included in the derivatives above are the following cash flow and fair value hedges: 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 Notional Notional value Assets Liabilities value Assets Liabilities million million million million million million Cash flow hedges Interest rate contracts 1,384.0 3.2 0.6 1,560.6 1.3 3.3 Fair value hedges Interest rate contracts 1,558.2 3.3 1.6 1,268.9 10.5 1.8 The cash flow hedges relate to exposure to future interest payments or receipts on recognised financial instruments and on forecast transactions for periods of up to eight 2013: seven years: there was immaterial ineffectiveness.
The cash flow hedge amounts that were removed from equity and included in the consolidated income statement for the years ended 31 July 2014 and 2013 were immaterial.
The gains recognised in equity for cash flow hedges during the year was 3.8 million 2013: 3.6 million.
The fair value hedges hedge the interest rate risk in recognised financial instruments: the gain on the hedged items was 5.2million 2013: 4.6 million which was largely offset by a loss of 5.3 million 2013: 4.3 million on the hedging instrument.

In the 2014 financial year, 4.9 million 2013: 5.0 million of the amortisation charge is included in amortisation of intangible assets on acquisition and 9.8 million 2013: 6.5 million of the amortisation charge is included in administrative expenses shown in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment tests for goodwill At 31 July 2014, goodwill has been allocated to 10 individual CGUs.
Seven of these CGUs are within the Banking division, two are within the Securities division and the remaining one is the Asset Management division.
Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out annually by assessing the recoverable amount of the groups CGUs, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The recoverable amounts for all CGUs were measured based on value in use.
A value in use calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent board approved budgets and three year plans to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
For cash flows beyond the groups three year planning horizon, a terminal value was calculated using a prudent annual growth rate of 0% 2013: 0%, except for the Close Brothers Asset Management CGU where a growth rate of 2% 2013: 2% is considered more appropriate as the business is expected to grow at a steady rate in line with GDP growth rates.
These cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market rates appropriate to the CGU as set out in the table below.
The inputs used in the value in use calculations are sensitive, primarily to the impact of changes in the assumptions for future cash flows, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.
At 31 July 2014, the results of the review indicate there is no goodwill impairment.
Having performed stress tested value in use calculations, the group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

Capital The groups policy is to be well capitalised and its approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
The PRA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition, a number of subsidiaries are regulated for prudential purposes by either the PRA or the FCA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
The groups Pillar 1 information is presented in the following table.
Under Pillar 2, the group completes an annual self assessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP is reviewed by the PRA which culminates in the PRA setting Individual Capital Guidance ICG on the level of capital the group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website www.
The group maintains a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to ensure the group meets the Pillar 1 capital requirements and ICG at all times.
As a result, the group maintains capital adequacy ratios above minimum regulatory requirements.
The groups individual regulated entities complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2014 and 2013.
On 1 January 2014, European legislation came into force implementing Basel III in Europe through Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation collectively known as CRD IV.
CRD IV changes both the composition of regulatory capital and the calculation of risk weighted assets.
The highest quality capital is now defined as common equity tier 1, having been previously referred to as core tier 1.
A full analysis of the composition of regulatory capital and Pillar 1 risk weighted assets is shown in the following table, including a reconciliation between equity and common equity tier 1 capital after deductions.
At 31 July 2014, the groups common equity tier 1 capital ratio remained broadly stable at 13.1% 31 July 2013: core tier 1 capital ratio 13.3% even after the implementation of CRD IV, the overall impact of which was neutral, as shown in the final table of this note.
Common equity tier 1 capital increased to 710.8 million 31 July 2013: core tier 1 capital 687.5 million due to growth in profit attributable to shareholders which was partly offset by the foreseeable dividend deduction required under CRD IV, being the 2014 proposed final dividend of 47.7 million.
Risk weighted assets increased to 5,445.8 million 31 July 2013: 5,184.5 million as a result of growth in credit and counterparty risk associated with the loan book, which was partly offset by the discount to the risk weighting for lending to SMEs set out in CRD IV.
Notional risk weighted assets for market risk also increased reflecting increased trading positions in Securities.

Contingent liabilities, guarantees and commitments Contingent liabilities Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS A principal subsidiary of the group, CBL, by virtue of being a regulated deposit taker, contributes to the FSCS which provides compensation to customers of financial institutions in the event that an institution is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
At 31 July 2014, the group has accrued 2.2 million 2013: 1.6 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
The facilities are expected to be repaid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit takers, except for an estimated shortfall of 1.0 billion which the FSCS has announced it intends to collect in three equal instalments beginning in 2013 2014, in addition to the ongoing interest charges on the outstanding loans.
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapse of certain financial services firms is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS.
The groups share of the ultimate FSCS levy will also depend on the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.

Assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the group.
Defined contribution scheme During the year the charge to the consolidated income statement for the groups defined contribution pension schemes was 8.9 million 2013: 7.8 million representing contributions payable by the group and is included in administrative expenses.

The valuation of the schemes liabilities is sensitive to the key assumptions used in the valuation.
The effect of a change in those assumptions in 2014 is set out below.
The analysis has been presented for the first time and reflects the variation of the individual assumptions.
The variation in price inflation includes all inflation-linked pension increases in deferment and in payment.

The most significant risks are: a Market factors movements in equity and bond markets 80% of the schemes assets are invested in global equities and the schemes liabilities are measured with reference to corporate bond yields.
The performance of both of these asset classes can be volatile.
Underperformance of either of these markets would have an adverse impact on the carrying value of the scheme.
b Inflation deferred pensions and pensions in payment increase at specified periods in line with inflation subject to certain caps and floors in place.
Changes in inflation may impact scheme liabilities.
c Life expectancy change in the life expectancy of the schemes members may impact scheme liabilities.
The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the scheme liabilities is 20 years.

The fair value of the subordinated loan capital at 31 July 2014 was 88.3 million 31 July 2013: 84.9 million and the carrying value was 77.2 million 31 July 2013: 77.3 million.
The fair value of the CBG plc bond at 31 July 2014 was 224.9 million 31 July 2013: 218.1 million and the carrying value was 205.2 million 31 July 2013: 204.9 million.
At 31 July 2014 the fair value of the CBL bond, which was issued during the year, was 306.5 million and the carrying value was 300.2 million.
Valuation hierarchy The group holds financial instruments that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities where prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency to provide ongoing pricing information: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Investments classified as Level 1 predominantly comprise UK government securities and listed equity shares.
Investments classified as Level 2 predominantly comprise investment grade corporate bonds, less liquid listed equities and over the counter derivatives.
Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2014 126 The Notes 31.
Financial risk management continued Investments classified as Level 3 predominantly comprise investments in unlisted equity shares including an entity offering post trade services in securities, a legacy investment property fund and the groups residual shareholding in Mako.
The valuations of these investments are determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and net asset values.
The group believes that there is no reasonably possible change to the inputs used in the valuation of these positions which would have a material effect on the groups consolidated income statement.
The tables below show the classification of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy at 31 July 2014 and 2013.

c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a reduction in earnings and or value, as a result of the failure of a counterparty or associated party with whom the group has contracted to meet its obligations in a timely manner and arises mainly from the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
The groups lending activities are generally short-term in nature with low average loan size in order to control concentration risk in the loan book and associated collateral.
In addition the group applies consistent and prudent lending criteria mitigating credit risk.
The credit quality of counterparties with whom the group deposits or whose debt securities are held is monitored within approved limits.
Loans and advances are spread across asset classes, short-term and with a low average loan size.
The Banking division monitors the credit quality of the counterparties with whom the group places deposits, enters into derivative contracts or whose debt securities are held against established limits.
Whilst these amounts may be material, the counterparties are all regulated institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and fall within the large exposure limits set by the regulatory requirements.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as the businesses in that division trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any credit exposure is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Credit and counterparty risk, and the measures taken to mitigate or manage these risks, are disclosed within the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on pages 30 to 33.

Financial risk management continued Maximum exposure to credit risk The table below presents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking account of any collateral and credit risk mitigation, arising from its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at 31 July 2014.
For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk represents the contractual nominal amounts.
31 July 31 July 2014 2013 million million On balance sheet Cash and balances at central banks 1,171.8 935.4 Settlement balances 465.8 471.0 Loans and advances to banks 87.4 89.8 Loans and advances to customers 5,289.7 4,645.6 Debt securities 94.2 124.9 Loans to money brokers against stock advanced 63.9 52.1 Derivative financial instruments 27.8 56.8 Other financial assets 50.5 39.4 7,251.1 6,415.0 Off balance sheet Undrawn commitments 1,263.1 1,036.4 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 8,514.2 7,451.4 Loans and advances to customers: Exposure outside the UK The group has limited exposure outside the UK.
At 31 July 2014, the group has loans and advances to customers in Ireland of 252.6 million 31 July 2013: 176.4 million.
These relate to loans in the groups Retail and Commercial businesses and are issued with the same approach to lending as applied within the UK.
Assets pledged and received as collateral The group pledges assets for repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard securitised borrowing contracts.
The group has securitised without recourse and restrictions 1,134.1 million 31 July 2013: 1,112.7 million of its insurance premium and motor loan receivables in return for debt securities in issue of 848.6 million 31 July 2013: 846.9 million.
As the group has retained exposure to substantially all the credit risk and rewards of the residual benefit of the underlying assets it continues to recognise these assets in loans and advances to customers in its consolidated balance sheet.
At 31 July 2013, the group had a repurchase agreement whereby FRNs to the value of 21.9 million were lent in exchange for cash of 18.3 million which were included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
These FRNs remained on the groups consolidated balance sheet as the group retained the risks and rewards of ownership.
The majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 25 of the Strategic Report.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria is applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2014 129 Financial assets: Loans and advances to customers Credit risk management and monitoring Within the Banking division the overall credit risk appetite is set by the CBL board.
The monitoring of credit policy is the responsibility of the Banking divisions risk and compliance committees.
All large loans are subject to approval by the Banking divisions Credit Committees.
Retail, Commercial and Property each use credit underwriting and monitoring measures appropriate to the diverse and specialised nature of their lending.
The Banks collections and recoveries processes are designed to provide a fair, consistent and effective operation for arrears management.
The Bank seeks to engage in early communication with borrowers experiencing difficulty in meeting their repayments, to obtain their commitment to maintaining or re-establishing a regular payment plan.
The Bank maintains a forbearance policy to support customers in financial difficulty and ensures the necessary processes and policies are in place to enable consistently fair treatment of each customer.
At the same time, the Bank ensures these processes and policies do not restrict the ability to manage customers based on their individual circumstances.
This includes considering whether it is appropriate to change the terms and conditions of a loan, e. g. by extending its term, changing the type of loan, deferring interest or by capitalising arrears to assist a customer in financial difficulties.
The Bank seeks to ensure that any forbearance results in a fair outcome for the customer and will not repossess an asset unless all other reasonable attempts to resolve the position have failed.
Retail is typically high volume secured lending with a small average loan size.
Credit issues are identified early via predominantly automated tracking processes.
Remedial actions are implemented promptly to restore customers to a performing status or recovery methods are applied to minimise potential loss.
Commercial is a combination of several niche lending businesses with a diverse mix of loans in terms of assets financed, and average loan size and loan to valuation LTV percentage.
Credit quality is assessed on an individual loan by loan basis.
Recovery activity is executed promptly by experts in the specialised assets.
This approach allows remedial action to be implemented at the appropriate time to minimise potential loss.
Property is a portfolio of higher value, low volume lending.
Loans are continually monitored to determine whether they are performing satisfactorily.
Performing loans with elevated levels of credit risk may be placed on watch lists depending on the perceived severity of the credit risk.
The Banking division has a dual approach to mitigate credit risk by: Lending on a secured basis with emphasis on both the customers ability to repay and the quality of the underlying security to minimise any loss should the customer not be able to repay: and Where the security collateralising a loan is less tangible, or in cases of higher LTVs, greater scrutiny is applied both analytically and in terms of escalation of sanctioning authority.
Much of the Banking divisions lending is short term and average loan size is small with the result that few individual loans have the capacity to materially impact the groups earnings.
Credit risk reporting Loans and advances to customers within the Banking division, as disclosed in note 11, are analysed between the following categories for credit risk reporting: i Neither past due nor impaired These loans and advances to customers reflect the application of consistent and conservative lending criteria on inception and the quality and level of security held.
The contractual repayments are monitored to ensure that classification as neither past due nor impaired remains appropriate.
It also demonstrates the short-term nature of the lending, with 2.9 billion 2013: 2.5 billion having a contractual maturity of less than 12 months.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are neither past due nor impaired.

Financial risk management continued ii Past due but not impaired Loans and advances to customers are classified as past due but not impaired when the customer has failed to make a payment when contractually due but there is no evidence of impairment.
This includes loans which are individually assessed for impairment but where the value of security is sufficient to meet the required repayments.
This also includes loans to customers which are past due for technical reasons such as delays in payment processing or rescheduling of payment terms.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are past due but for which no impairment provision has been raised.

Impaired loans and advances to customers are analysed according to whether the impairment provisions are individually or collectively assessed.
Individually assessed provisions are determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the financial condition of the customer and an estimate of potential recovery from the realisation of security.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Property business and by the invoice finance business within Commercial.
Collectively assessed provisions are considered on a portfolio basis, to reflect the homogeneous nature of the assets.
A percentage of the portfolio is impaired by evaluating the ageing of missed payments combined with the historical recovery rates for that particular portfolio as discussed in note 2 a.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Retail businesses and the asset finance business within Commercial.
The gross impaired loans are quoted without taking account of any collateral or security held, which could reduce the potential loss.
The application of conservative loan-to-value ratios on inception and the emphasis on the quality of the security provided are reflected in the low provision to gross impaired balance ratio coverage ratio of 30% 2013: 31%.
The following table shows gross impaired loans and advances to customers and the provision thereon split by assessment method.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2014 131 The group holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of residential and commercial property, charges over business assets such as equipment, inventory and accounts receivable.
Analysis by LTV ratio is provided below based on the groups lending facilities to customers where the exposure at origination exceeded 1.0 million, excluding Property facilities written pre 2009.
Lending below this threshold has greater homogeneity predominately in the motor and premium finance businesses with typical LTV ratio between 80% to 90%.
The value of collateral used in determining the LTV ratio is based upon data captured at loan origination, or where available, a more recent updated valuation.
Gross loans and advances to customers where exposure at origination exceeded 1.0 million: Asset Invoice Property Total million million million million LTV Less than 70% 45.9 156.5 850.3 1,052.7 70% to 90% 44.5 102.4 18.2 165.1 Greater than 90% 54.5 5.1 4.0 63.6 At 31 July 2014 144.9 264.0 872.5 1,281.4 Asset Invoice Property Total million million million million LTV Less than 70% 38.7 135.2 588.3 762.2 70% to 90% 34.0 110.3 27.1 171.4 Greater than 90% 48.5 1.1 2.4 52.0 At 31 July 2013 121.2 246.6 617.8 985.6 Financial assets: Settlement balances Credit risk management and monitoring The credit risk presented by settlement balances in the Securities division is limited as such balances represent delivery versus payment transactions where delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment.
The credit risk is therefore limited to the change in market price of a security between trade date and settlement date and not the absolute value of the trade.
The Securities businesses are market-makers and they trade on a principal only basis.
The Securities businesses trade only with regulated counterparties including stockbrokers, wealth managers, in institutions and hedge funds who are either authorised and regulated by the PRA and or FCA or equivalent regulator in the respective country.
Credit risk reporting Settlement balances are classified as neither past due nor impaired when the respective trades have not yet reached their settlement date.
Settlement balances are classified as past due but not impaired when trades fail to be settled on their contractual settlement date.
The credit risk presented by settlement balances which are past due is mitigated by the delivery versus payment mechanism, as well as by the Securities businesses trading only with regulated counterparties.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place as part of an overall risk management framework and settlement balances past due are actively managed.
The following table shows the ageing of settlement balances: 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 Neither past Past due Neither past Past due due nor but not due nor but not impaired impaired Total impaired impaired Total million million million million million million Within one month 445.3 14.7 460.0 447.7 16.6 464.3 Between one and three months 1.9 1.9 4.2 4.2 Between three months and one year 2.9 2.9 1.3 1.3 Over one year 1.0 1.0 1.2 1.2 445.3 20.5 465.8 447.7 23.3 471.0 Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2014 132 The Notes 31.
Financial risk management continued d Market risk Market risk is the risk that a change in the value of an underlying market variable, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, will give rise to an adverse movement in the value of the groups assets and arises primarily in the Securities division.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves that are used to fund the loan book.
The groups policy is to match repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities naturally where possible or by using interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 14.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At 31 July 2014 changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts: 2014 2013 million million 1.0% increase 4.2 2.7 0.5% decrease 2.1 1.4 At 31 July 2014 changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2014 2013 million million 1.0% increase 12.6 11.7 0.5% decrease 6.3 5.8 Foreign currency risk The group has a limited number of currency investments in subsidiaries and has chosen not to hedge these exposures.
These investments are predominantly in euros.
Foreign exchange differences which arise from the translation of these operations are recognised directly in equity.
At 31 July 2014 a change in the euro exchange rate would decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2014 2013 million million 20% strengthening of sterling against the euro 5.3 5.7 The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of treasury operations in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, using exchange rate derivative contracts where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 14.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.
Market price risks Trading financial instruments: Equity shares and debt securities The groups trading activities relate to Winterflood and Seydler.
The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk.

The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 4.1 million decrease 2013: 2.9 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 1.4 million decrease 2013: 0.7 million decrease on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly market-making where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the sensitivity referred to above is purely hypothetical.
Non-trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments are disclosed in notes 12 and 13. e Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that liabilities cannot be met when they fall due or can only be met at an uneconomic price and arises mainly in the Banking division.
The group has a prudent liquidity position with total available funding at 31 July 2014 of 7.1 billion 31 July 2013: 6.3 billion.
This funding is significantly in excess of its loans and advances to customers at 31 July 2014 of 5.3 billion 31 July 2013: 4.6 billion.
The group has a large portfolio of high quality liquid assets principally including cash placed on deposit with the Bank of England and gilts.
The group measures liquidity risk with a variety of measures including regular stress testing and cash flow monitoring, and reporting to both the group and divisional boards.
