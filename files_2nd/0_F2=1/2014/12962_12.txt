Capital expenditure for the year of $142.6 million included the Processing, plant continued development of the Yalea and Gara underground Processing mines as well as the construction of the Yalea and Gara paste and engineering backfill plants.

Ventilation in the mines was considerably improved, with two additional primary ventilation shafts at Yalea and one at Gara Engineering and power supply completed in 2014.

UNDERGROUND BACKFILLING PERFORMANCE Mill availability was impacted by the replacement of the 3 m secondary drive and motor as well as the installation of the 160 000 new upgraded cyclone pumps.
However, crusher availability 140 000 was sustained during the year due to the commissioning of another secondary crusher unit at the plant.
