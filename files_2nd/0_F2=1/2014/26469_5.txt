8 Strategic report London Stock Exchange Group plc Annual Report 2014 Market position and outlook With its three core business activities: capital formation, risk and balance sheet management and intellectual property, the Group helps to underpin global economic growth by offering a wide range of services to support the effective functioning of global capital markets and the creation of innovative new financial and investment products.
The markets in which we operate are affected by a wide range of factors, Capital Formation including structural shifts in the global economy, demographic trends, the geopolitical landscape and ongoing regulatory changes.
Access to primary sources of equity and debt finance for companies of all sizes from all over the world Economic conditions Secondary markets for price formation and trading Economic recovery in advanced economies is expected to continue in 2014.
Economists widely anticipate a gradual end to quantitative easing QE Risk and Balance Sheet Management in the US with tapering having already commenced on a modest scale.
Should the reduction in QE continue, we can expect upward pressure on Post trade services to mitigate counterparty risk, maximise capital interest rates in the medium term and increased bond yields.
Economic efficiencies for customers, support the safe transfer of securities activity in the Eurozone is gradually stabilising as the region emerges from and optimise cash flows for efficient collateral management recession.
However, the recovery is not broad based and is slower than in Technology and analytics to support efficient processes and meet some other developed markets.
Consequently, any tightening of Eurozone regulatory requirements monetary policy is expected to lag behind that of the US.
Other risks remain, including slowing growth in China and tensions around Ukraine.
Intellectual Property The gradual turnaround in sentiment and overall economic activity in Market data, indices, analytics and information services to increase the past year was reflected in a 27 per cent global increase in the capital knowledge and transparency in support of trading and investment raised aggregate value of $163 billion.
Such improved opportunities for decision making investment combined with growing consumer confidence, excess liquidity and Technology solutions to enable customers and markets to operate continued GDP growth in developed markets are creating an equity-friendly reliably, securely and efficiently environment which is likely to prevail throughout 2014.
Equity funding is, therefore, likely to remain attractive and to support primary market activity.
The Group is responding to this trend with innovations such as the introduction of the High Growth Segment on London Stock Exchange.
In other asset classes, trading levels remain uncertain due to proposed regulatory changes and the impact of bank fide-leveraging.
Regulatory factors in Europe such as MiFID MiFIR requirements on controls for dark pools and high frequency trading HFT, as well as the potential for a widespread financial transaction tax FTT, could have a negative impact on capital markets activity.
Regulation continues to influence the shape of financial infrastructure more broadly see more details on pages 10-13.
At the same time, such trends create opportunities for the Groups clearing, post trade and information services operations where our open access principles are aligned with the demand for greater transparency and improved, cost effective services.
Clearnet is responding to customer needs in respect of the Basel III Capital Requirements and is seeing increased clearing volumes of OTC derivatives as a result.
Clearnet, UnaVista and Monte Titoli are also developing a range of solutions for EMIR compliance including globeSettle, our new international central securities depository.
Requirements affecting financial benchmarks in MiFID II, from IOSCO and other national and supranational bodies, will likely create new opportunities for globally focused index providers such as FTSE with established strong governance standards and transparency in the provision of index services.
