Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Policy Implementation 2015 Comparator Group In accordance with the authority granted to the Committee by shareholders, the Committee instructed a review of the comparator group during 2014 which led to changes that will apply in 2015.
The rationale for the review was: f Increased pool: The previous pool of 19 companies was frequently reduced by mergers and acquisitions.
The current pool has been increased to29companies f Market capitalisation: The average market capitalisation has been reduced while Hikmas has increased by 105% f Revenue: Under the previous group the average revenue was three times the level of Hikma.
Under the current group, Hikmas revenue is 7% aboveaverage f US and MENA focus: Hikma is increasingly orientated to the US and MENA markets and does not operate in the UK.
Hikmas European sales are minimal.
In order to achieve greater alignment between the comparator and Hikma, some of the UK and Western European focused companies were removed and US and emerging markets companies were added f FTSE position: To ensure that the UK market is taken into consideration, the Committee requested a separate benchmarking exercise assessing the25FTSE companies on either side of Hikma in market capitalisation The changes were: Removed Added Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd Actelion Aspen Healthcare Limited Akorn Pharmaceuticals AstraZeneca PLC Alexion Pharmaceuticals BTG PLC Alkermes EGIS PLC Almirall Forest Laboratories Inc Biogen Idec Gedeon Richter Plc Biomarin Pharmaceutical Grilfols SA Celgene Krka Cubist Pharmaceuticals Novartis AG Genus Sanofi Aventis Jazz Pharmaceuticals Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC Lonza Group STADA Arzneimittel AG Medicines Company Myriad Genetics Novozymes Pacira Pharmaceuticals Perrigo Qiagen Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Salix Pharmaceuticals United Therapeutics Vertex Pharmaceuticals 96 Corporate governance Salaries During 2014, the Committee undertook the annual benchmarking of executive packages and concluded that a significant increase intheChairman and Chief Executives salary to $1,200,000 was required for 2015.
Salary Increase Name 2015 2014 % Chief Executive $1,200,000 $842,265 42% Vice Chairman $675,987 $620,172 9% The information in the table above has been audited by Deloitte The Committees rationale for the increase was: f Complexity: Hikma operates in the developed US market and the less developed Middle East and North African markets.
These have different andunique characteristics which require a skill set which is bespoke f Strategic Delivery: Hikma is very acquisitive and has delivered significant shareholder value through the integration of distressed assets.
The current medium-term plans include the integration of such assets purchased in September 2014 and which requires consistency of leadership.
For example during 2014, Hikma acquired circa 300 injectable products and the US injectable manufacturing facilities of Bedford Laboratories.
In order to obtain value, Hikma must transfer the products and tangible assets to its existing facilities and integrate them into the manufacturing and marketing processes over the next three to five years f Growth: Since 2011, the Hikma market capitalisation has grown 225%, without issuing shares to fund acquisitions.
The entrepreneurial spirit oftheexisting team needs to be retained and encouraged for the future f US Focus: Since 2011, the US business has grown from approximately 34% to 49% of revenue and the integration of the injectable products seeStrategic Delivery above acquired during 2014 is likely to further increase the significance of this geographical area.
The US market is very competitive for executive talent and Hikma needs to protect its position f Overall Package: The current package is significantly behind the comparator group.
A significant one-off increase was required to achieve an overall package that was commensurate with organisations of a similar size and business f FTSE Positioning: The significant increase in shareholder value over the past three years has resulted in Hikma being on the verge of entering the FTSE100.
The Committee benchmarked the packages of Chief Executives in the 25 companies on either side of Hikma at the time of the consideration and concluded that the new package would be in line with peers The Committee realised that the scale of the salary increase was significant and the Chairman of the Committee consulted with the Companys major shareholders as outlined in the table below.
Steps Details Timeframe 1 Comparator Review The Committee instructed the remuneration adviser to review the comparator group to more closely align it August 2014 with the current business dynamic.
The main changes were a reduction in the average market capitalisation and revenue comparables, an increased pool of companies and greater US and emerging market focus.
2 Benchmarking The Committee instructed the remuneration adviser to benchmark the packages of the executives in the October 2014 comparator group and, to ensure that the UK market context was taken into consideration, the 25 FTSE companies on either side of Hikma by market capitalisation.
3 Review The adviser presented the comparator group adjustment and the benchmarking to the Committee.
November 2014 After considerable debate, it was agreed that a significant one-off increase was required.

This avoids the risk of the Company inadvertently giving international competitors an unfair advantage because they are not required to report to the same disclosure standard as a UK listed company.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made are published at the end of the performance period in order that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the EIP.
