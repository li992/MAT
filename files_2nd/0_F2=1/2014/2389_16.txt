Extending the life of the North Sea This year marked 50 years since we were awarded our first licence in the UK North Sea.
And now, after producing more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, we are not only nding more oil and gas, but also extending the life of our existing elds.
Our latest discovery in the Central North Sea called Vorlich demonstrates the basins ongoing potential.
The nd was made jointly with GDF SUEZ E&P, underlining the benets increased collaboration can bring to a mature basin.
Vorlich spans two adjacent but separately operated blocks one by BP and one by GDF SUEZ.
It has been tested to a ow rate of 5,350 barrels a day.
We identied Vorlich through analysis of existing wells in the area, along with detailed mapping of high-quality seismic data, and are now looking at options to develop it.
These options range from a simple subsea tie back into existing infrastructure, through to possibly introducing new infrastructure that could also serve to unlock additional undeveloped resources in the area.
We continue to grow our exploration position using our leading subsurface capabilities.
