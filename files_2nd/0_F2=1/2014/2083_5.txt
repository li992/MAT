1 Petroleum and Potash Business Our Petroleum and Potash Business headquartered in Houston, United States, comprises conventional and non-conventional operations located in six countries throughout the world and a potash project based in Saskatchewan, Canada.
Petroleum Our Petroleum Business includes exploration, development, production and marketing activities.
We have a high-quality resource base concentrated in the United States and Australia.
Our core production operations are primarily located in the US Gulf of Mexico, Onshore US and in Australia.
We also have operations in Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan, Algeria and the United Kingdom.
We produce crude oil and condensate, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGLs.
The Petroleum portfolio consisted of conventional oil and gas operations up until 2011, when we moved into the unconventional shale business.
Our Onshore US operations evolved from the acquisition of the Fayetteville shale assets from Chesapeake Energy Corporation and the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation.
Our overall production for FY2014 was 246.0 million barrels of oil equivalent MMboe.
This was mainly attributable to our US and Australian operations, which produced 144.3 MMboe and 80.0 MMboe, respectively, with the majority of US production coming from Onshore US, which produced 108.1 MMboe.
Operations outside Australia and the United States delivered the remaining production volumes.
Information relating to our oil and gas reserves is set out in section 2.3.
In line with our aim of simplification and a sharper strategic focus, we continue to evaluate our existing portfolio in order to optimise our position around our core business.

1 Petroleum and Potash Business continued Shale reservoirs are characterised by low permeability, so it is necessary to stimulate the reservoir to create additional permeability Oklahoma and, therefore, the flow of liquids and gas to the wellbore.
Extracting New Mexico Fayetteville oil and gas from shale involves hydraulic fracturing, which is a Arkansas process developed to efficiently access supplies of oil and natural gas locked inside dense subsurface rock formations, such as shale.
Mississippi Haynesville Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand and a small amount of chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation Texas to allow the well to produce commercial volumes.
Permian Houston Louisiana The development phase of an onshore shale operation requires Eagle Ford an extensive drilling and completion program, which may include Shenzi associated gas compression and treatment facilities and connecting Neptune Gulf of Mexico pipelines.
Shale development has a repetitive, manufacturing-like Atlantis nature that provides opportunities for increased efficiency.

Jimblebar delivered first production in the September Mt Whaleback Newman Wheelarra Orebody 29 30 35 2013 quarter and produced 9 Mt during FY2014.
Jimblebar is expected to deliver phase one capacity of 35 Mtpa by the end of FY2015.
Existing Operations Note: Location of markers Production from Wheelarra, a sublease of the Jimblebar tenement, is indicative only Port Hedland Newman Rail Line which was previously processed through Newman, was permanently Goldsworthy Rail Line connected to the Jimblebar processing hub during the period.
All ore is transported by rail on the Mt Newman JV and Mt Goldsworthy JV rail lines to our port facilities.
A typical train Along with the other joint venture partners, we have entered into configuration consists of two locomotives per 124 ore cars, called marketing agreements in the form of joint ventures with certain a rake, with two rakes per train.
Each individual ore car carries customers.
These customer joint ventures, JW4, Wheelarra and approximately 128 tonnes of iron ore. Our rail operations are POSMAC, involve subleases of part of WAIOs existing mineral controlled from Perth via our integrated remote operations leases.
The ore is sold to the existing joint ventures with contractual centre which co-locates rail control, port production control, terms applying to the customers share.
As a consequence, we are mine dispatch control and mine fixed plant control.
entitled to 85 per cent of production from these subleases and the Our port facilities are located on both sides of the harbour at customer joint ventures are not jointly controlled operations for Port Hedland.
These facilities consist of Nelson Point, owned by the accounting purposes.
Mt Newman JV, and Finucane Island, owned by the Mt Goldsworthy WAIO Mineral resources and Ore reserves are reported for the JV.
The port facilities include five ore car dumpers, three screening Pilbara as a whole by ore type, to reflect our production of the plants, nine stackers, five reclaimers, stock and blending yards, Newman Blend lump product and our single logistics chain and and eight ship loaders.
Vessels depart the harbour via a dredged associated management system.
The reserve life of our Western channel that is approximately 45 kilometres long and has a width Australian mines is 16 years.
Samarco We are a 5050 joint venture partner with Vale at the Samarco operation in Brazil.
Samarco is currently comprised of a mine and two concentrators located in the state of Minas Gerais, and three pellet plants and a port located in Anchieta in the state of Espirito Santo.
Three 396-kilometre pipelines connect the mine site to the pelletising facilities.
Samarcos main product is iron ore pellets.
Extraction and beneficiation of iron ore is conducted at the Germano facilities in the municipalities of Mariana and Ouro Preto.
Conveyor systems are used to extract the ore and convey it from the mines.
Ore beneficiation then occurs in concentrators, where crushing, milling, desliming and flotation processes produce iron concentrate.
The concentrate leaves the concentrators as slurry and is pumped through the slurry pipelines from the Germano facilities to the pellet plants in Ubu, Anchieta, where the slurry is processed into pellets.
The iron ore pellets are then heat treated.
The pellet output is stored in a stockpile yard before being shipped out of the Samarco-owned Port of Ubu in Anchieta.
Pellets are independently marketed by Samarco and sold to steelmakers in 20 countries in the Americas, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, with prices generally linked to market indices.
In FY2014, our share of production was 11 Mt of pellets.
The reserve life of Samarco is 39 years.

Compared to the total proved exchange rates used to estimate the economic viability of reserves undeveloped of 1,072 MMboe reported at 30 June 2013, this are based on asset-defined or BHP Billiton long-term forecasts.
represents a net reduction of 112 MMboe in proved undeveloped The Ore reserves tabulated are held within existing, permitted reserves during the year.
This reduction was the combined result mining tenements.
The Groups mineral leases are of sufficient of development activities that converted proved undeveloped duration or convey a legal right to renew for sufficient duration reserves into proved developed, the addition of new North American to enable all reserves on the leased properties to be mined in shale drilling locations, as well as revisions to the proved undeveloped accordance with current production schedules.
Our Ore reserves reserves previously reported at 30 June 2013.
Our active development may include areas where some additional approvals remain program successfully drilled and converted 190 MMboe from proved outstanding, but where, based on the technical investigations undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during the year.
we carry out as part of our planning process, and our knowledge Development activities in our North American shale fields converted and experience of the approvals process, we expect that such 132 MMboe of this amount, while 34 MMboe of proved undeveloped approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business were converted into proved developed in the Atlantis field in the and within the time frame required by the current schedule.

At BHP Billiton, we have a governance framework that goes beyond an interest in governance for its own sake or the need to comply with regulatory requirements.
Instead, we believe that high-quality governance supports long-term value creation.
Simply put, we think good governance is good business, and our approach is to adopt what we consider to be the better of the prevailing governance standards in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In the same spirit, we do not see governance as just a matter for the Board.
Good governance is also the responsibility of executive management and is embedded throughout the organisation.
At BHP Billiton, we have a governance the diagram on the following page describes the governance framework that goes beyond an interest framework at BHP Billiton.
It shows the interaction between the shareholders and the Board, demonstrates how the Board Committee in governance for its own sake or the need structure facilitates the interaction between the Board and the to comply with regulatory requirements.
Chief executive Officer CeO and illustrates the flow of delegation from shareholders.
We have robust processes in place to ensure that the delegation flows through the Board and its committees Jac Nasser AO to the CeO and Group Management Committee GMC and into Chairman the organisation.
At the same time, accountability flows back 1 1 September 2014 upwards from the Company to shareholders.
this process helps to ensure alignment with shareholders.
As part of our corporate planning cycle, we have embedded a range of scenarios that are reviewed annually and updated by the Group with the GMCs involvement.
the scenarios, and the governance process supporting them, also form part of the Board agenda.
these scenarios provide a lens to assess the performance of our business portfolio.
they include assumptions around carbon and commodity prices, currencies, costs and tax rates and ranges for a number of risks that face the Group, including climate change, global growth, levels of trade, geopolitical situation and technology focus.
All of the scenarios are used to inform BHP Billitons strategy and the resilience of our diversified asset portfolio over the short and long term.
Regardless of which direction the world may take, we will always be guided by Our Charter values, including our value of Sustainability, in how we operate our business, interact with our stakeholders and plan for the future.
As we set out later in this report, while the five committees have accountability for making recommendations to the Board on certain matters such as remuneration and sustainability, we ensure that all the Board members have oversight and the opportunity for full discussion of those issues through the committee report-out process to the full Board.
Our BHP Billiton Charter is core to the governance framework of BHP Billiton.

the Board will not endorse a Director for re-election if his or her performance is not considered satisfactory.
the Board will advise shareholders in the notice of Meeting whether or not re-election is supported.
BHP Billiton does not apply or implement a no vacancy rule in relation to Board appointments.
Accordingly, Director candidates can be elected to the Board by ordinary resolution and are not required to out-poll an incumbent Director in order to be elected.

174 BHP BIllItOn AnnUAl RePORt 2014 1 2 3 Corporate 4 5 Strategic Report Our assets Governance Statement Remuneration Report Directors Report Section 303A of the NYSE-listed Company Manual contains a broad regime of corporate governance requirements for NYSE-listed companies.
Under the NYSE rules, foreign private issuers, such as ourselves, are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the requirements of Section 303A, except for the rule relating to compliance with Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 audit committee independence and certain notification provisions contained in Section 303A of the listed Company Manual.
11 of the listed Company Manual, however, requires us to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards.
Following a comparison of our corporate governance practices with the requirements of Section 303A of the listed Company Manual followed by US companies, the following significant difference was identified: Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure that their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the external auditor unless the companys governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters.
While the RAC is directly responsible for remuneration and oversight of the External Auditor, the ultimate responsibility for appointment and retention of the External Auditor rests with our shareholders, in accordance with UK law and our constitutional documents.
The RAC does, however, make recommendations to the Board on these matters, which are in turn reported to shareholders.
While the Board is satisfied with its level of compliance with the governance requirements in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, it recognises that practices and procedures can always be improved, and there is merit in continuously reviewing its own standards against those in a variety of jurisdictions.
The Boards program of review will continue throughout the year ahead.
