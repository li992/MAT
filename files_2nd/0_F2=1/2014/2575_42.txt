Actuarial losses on plan assets for 2013 14 reect actual investment returns over the year of 0.6% which were below the IAS 19 Revised 2011 discount rate of 4.2%.
This was due to low or negative returns on a number of asset classes such as index linked gilts, partially oset by higher returns from UK equities and property.
This performance follows a record high for the BTPS plan assets of 41.3bn at 31 March 2013 which was driven by strong investment returns over 2012 13 of around{12%.
The increase in the real discount rate relative to RPI, from 0.87% to 0.97%, led to a fall in the liabilities which is shown as an actuarial gain on liabilities due to assumptions.
Allowing for scheme and membership experience over the year, such as updated membership data, led to an increase in the liabilities, shown as an actuarial loss on liabilities due to experience.
We have adopted IAS 19 Revised 2011 this year, the revised pensions accounting standard issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Details of this and its impact are set out in note 1 on page 127 of{the consolidated financial statements.
