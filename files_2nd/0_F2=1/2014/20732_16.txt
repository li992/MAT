24 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2014 Chief Financial Officer We made good progress during 2014 to deliver the financial and risk and control framework necessary to drive our 2020 Vision.
We understand the importance of the dividend to shareholders at this time.
Our total dividend yield of 2.6% at the year end, makes us one of the highest yielding companies in our peer group.
The chart below shows how the growth in the dividend has comfortably outstripped inflation over the last 48 years.
In the last five years, when interest rates have been running at 0.5%, our total dividend has grown by an average of 8.7% per year.
We significantly reduced our costs whilst continuing to ensure we meet our current and future regulatory responsibilities.
Outsourcing of our middle and back office investment process delivered a single, scalable and cost effective solution.
It also ensured that these services will develop in line with industry best practice.
We also took advantage of the current low interest rate environment by issuing 100m of unsecured fixed-rate long-term debt at attractive rates, with our private placement debt issuance being three times oversubscribed.
We strive to continue to deliver clear and concise reporting.
We have therefore reduced the length of our Annual Report this year.
By seeking to implement integrated reporting in future years we hope that our reporting will continue to benefit all our stakeholders.

Prior to the restructure of 26 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2014 the SRI and Global Equity teams into a unified Equities team in September 2014, the Global Equity team also managed the equity portfolio of the Trust.
The cost of the Global Equity team was split between Alliance Trust Investments and the Trust according to the average assets under administration during the period.

What is the cost of our buyback programme?
In 2014 we repurchased 1.2% of our shares compared with 0.3% in 2013.
Since the introduction of our flexible buyback policy in 2011 the Company has bought back and cancelled 16.3% of its shares at a cost of 392m.
This has contributed to a reduction in volatility of the discount during a period of turbulent market conditions and to a narrowing of the discount from 17.1% to 12.4% since 2011.
The Board remains committed to the ongoing flexible use of buybacks, taking into account the Companys discount relative to the peer group.
Whilst we bought back 10% of our shares in 2011 during the first year of our flexible buyback policy we stated at that time we would not expect to maintain this level of buyback activity in normal market conditions.
Why have we taken out long-term debt?
In late July 2014 we issued 100m fixed rate 15 year unsecured debt at 4.28% as we believe that this pricing is attractive and is expected to enhance shareholder returns over the life of the facility in line with the Companys investment objective.
The average cost of borrowing for the Trust remains a very competitive 2.2% at the year end.
