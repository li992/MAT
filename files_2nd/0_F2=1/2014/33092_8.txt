Londons level of availability and supply JANUARY 2015 remain conducive to rental growth, which we expect to continue in 2015.
Last year CBRE estimated central London prime office rents rose 11.4%, with 10.7% growth in the West End.
This is the fourth year of growth, which, in line with the economy, has been at a steadier pace than in other recoveries.
During 2014 CBRE estimated 6.0m sq ft of office space was completed in central London, which was a 72% increase on the previous year.
West End new supply was actually lower at just 0.8m sq ft, which was 35% below the expected level at the start of the year as a number of schemes are completing late.
CBRE expect central London completions to fall to 3.6m sqft in 2015 before picking up to 8.0m sq ft in 2016 and 6.1m sq ft in 2017.
The outlook for the West End follows adifferent pattern with rising supply of 1.2m sq ft in 2015, and then also peaking at a potential 2.2m sq ft in 2016.
The largest concentrations of new supply in the West End over the next five years are expected to be in Victoria 1.4m sq ft, Fitzrovia 1.0m sq ft and Mayfair 0.9m sq ft. Last years central London take-up of 15.0m sq ft exceeded 2013s total by 9%.

SIR RICHARD BRANSON PIONEER-AT-LARGE, VIRGIN MEDIA PIONEERS ANDVIRGIN START UP JUNE 2014 Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2014 35 THE CHANGING FACE OF LONDON TECH BELT 2.1m sq ft We adopted the term Tech Belt in 2013 for the area which extends from Kings Cross to Whitechapel.
It contains 33% of our portfolio and is centred around the Old Street roundabout.
A Attracted by the vibrancy and diversity of emerging locations, start-ups in this sector are converging on the area in ever greater numbers, with around 3,200 media, software and communications companies making up the East London tech cluster.
The rise of Clerkenwell, Shoreditch and Aldgate as business centres is partly a result of their close proximity to thedeep supply of skilled creative professionals.
The remarkable growth around Londons Silicon Roundabout and its importance to us is no secret.
We are investing heavily in this part of London and have learned what occupiers want from their offices and also from their landlord.
Derwent London came early to this energetic area, which has been increasingly favoured by creative companies.
For example, we acquired 1Olivers Yard in 1994 and the Tea Building in 2001.
In recognition of changing demand, we build for long life: loose fit i. e. flexibility for buildings.
Change is now happening in work environments across sectors and were seeing second and third generation businesses and even the most established companies starting to move into inspirational buildings attheheart of the action.

BORIS JOHNSON, MAYOR OF LONDON 13 JUNE 2014 D G E H C F B L A K I FITZROVIA 1.8m sq ft Our Fitzrovia portfolio consists of approximately 30 buildings covering nearly two million sq ft and forms 37% of our portfolio by value.
This bohemian corner of the capital is set in quieter streets full of history and character.
Fitzrovia is enjoying a renaissance and we are helping to shape its future thanks toexciting new architecture such as the Charlotte Building, Qube, 1-2 Stephen Street and our upcoming developments at80 Charlotte Street and The Copyright Building.
Part of the areas appeal is its unique character and the challenge for developers is to create an environment that retains Fitzrovias special ambience whilst providing the space that business and residents want.
Like London, ours is an ever-changing and developing estate with assets in different stages of their life all of which will benefit from Crossrail and the increasing appeal for retail at the eastern end of Oxford Street.
CROSSRAIL The arrival of Crossrail in 2018, currently about 60% complete, will be a game-changer for Londons infrastructure, improving accessibility for millions more visitors and workers.
Crossrail will bring an extra 1.5 million people to within 45 minutes of central London and will link Londons key employment, leisure and business districts the West End, the City, Docklands, and Heathrow stimulating further economic development.
Anestimated 200 million passengers will use Crossrail annually anditwill increase Londons rail capacity by 10%.
Transport improvements can change perceptions of an area.
Theintroduction of Crossrail has raised the profile of areas such asFarringdon and Clerkenwell where we have completed the schemes at Turnmill and The Buckley Building and where our recent acquisition of 20 Farringdon Road is located.
When Crossrail is complete, over 140 trains per hour will travel through the Farringdon interchange on Thameslink, Crossrail and London Underground services.
Farringdon will be the only station from which passengers will be able to access allthree networks making it one of Britains busiest train stations, anda key hub for passengers travelling into London.
By 2026 it is estimated that three times as many passengers willuse Tottenham Court Road station as today.
Annual footfall isexpected to soar around Tottenham Court Road station by morethan 75 million to nearly 110 million as a result.
Arguably the greatest benefit to Derwent London will be in Fitzrovia, our largest holding by value, which is located to the north of Tottenham Court Road station.
