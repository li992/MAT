2 The Net Promoter Score is a metric which is compiled by asking customers whether they would recommend Oxford Instruments to a friend or colleague.
Customers give a score between zero and ten.
Those customers who score nine or ten are promoters, those customers who score seven or eight are neutral andcustomers who score six or less are detractors.
The net promoter score is the difference between the numbers of promoters and the number of detractors both expressed as a percentage of the number of replies received.
The score can range between 100 no customers are promoters and 100 all customers are promoters.
A positive score indicates that the Company has fewer detractors than promoters.

To answer fundamental and therapeutic questions, paediatric immunologists are utilising Atomic Force Microscopy AFM to study theT-cells at the nanoscale.
With AFM scientists are able tomanipulate single molecules andcontrol their interaction with receptor proteins on the surface ofimmune cells.
These tools allow researchers to dissect the function ofcells in health and their dysfunction in immune disease.
Atomic Force Microscopy Studying the immune system at a deeper level Signal transmission among immune cells occurs at the nanoscale, and AFM allows us to image, quantify, interact with, and study these processes.
These methods allow an unprecedented look at how immune cells communicate with one another.
