IN GEAR A COMPONENT JOURNEY In gear - a component journey PINION GEAR A pinion gear is a critical automotive component used in virtually all transmission units.
During use, a vehicle places heavy demand on its transmission, requiring a fast and reliable response to the drive controls.
The gears begin life The gears are machined as low alloy steel.
The gears require high strength and wear resistance to shape using a shaving in order to withstand the stresses applied to each gear or hobbing method.
Bodycotes heat treatment processes, in particular Low Pressure Carburising LPC, enable modern transmissions to deliver high performance and seamless response, even reducing noise during gear changes.
The gears are quenched using Nitrogen gas to minimise part distortion, then tempered to The parts are inspected and relieve internal stresses.
tested for surface hardness, core hardness and effective case depth.
The gears are dimensionally measured before heat treatment to monitor and maintain repeatability of distortion.
The gears are then heat treated using LPC to enhance functionality by adding a case depth The gears are shot peened to add to provide strength and residual stress this allows the parts resistance to wear and tear.
to withstand more wear and tear.
The gears are measured again after heat treatment to check any distortion is within limits.
The gears are assembled into the transmission unit.
