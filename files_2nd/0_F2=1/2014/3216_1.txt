02 STRATEGIC REPORT GROUP RESULTS 2014 was a very difficult year for Centrica and the recent fall in oil and gas prices creates further challenge.
We are cutting investment and costs in response.
However, it is with regret that, along with reducing capital expenditure and driving efficiency beyond planned levels, we have taken the difficult decision to rebase the dividend by 30%, commencing with the final distribution for 2014.
In addition, given the changed external environment, we are reviewing the longer-term strategy and will conclude this by the interim results in July.
