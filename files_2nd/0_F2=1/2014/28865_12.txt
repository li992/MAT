29 Business review Customer Case Study Manchester takes off Manchester Airports Group MAG owns and operates four UK airports including Manchester, the UKs third largest airport, and London Stansted, the fastest growing airport in London.
They serve over 45 million passengers and handle more than 600,000 tonnes of freight every year, contributing over 4 billion to the UK economy and directly supporting around 45,000 full-time jobs.
Our long-standing relationship with MAG has seen us support both their 1.5 billion acquisition of London Stansted in 2013, and two bond issuances which raised a total of 810 million.
Those funds allowed MAG to refinance the acquisition debt used to buy London Stansted, and gave them a platform to invest in services and facilities at their airports.
A good example of their investment is the multi-million pound upgrade of the terminal at London Stansted.
The expansion will double the size of the security space, expand the departure lounge and help create a new lounge area in the terminal building.
