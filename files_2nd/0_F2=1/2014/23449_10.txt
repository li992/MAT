Market Review Electra Partners continues to be able to find value by executing proprietary and off market deals at attractive entry prices, not only in traditional buyouts, but also through portfolio company bolt-ons and co-investments.
We remain extremely selective and we will continue to concentrate on buying the right assets at the right price.
This has been another record year of new investment in which we have maintained pricing discipline despite the backdrop of a competitive market.
We have focused investment in three areas: first in growth businesses playing to our key investment themes: second in stable, cash-generative businesses which appear to be relatively undervalued by the market at the moment: and third in bolt-on acquisitions in which synergies and frequently limited competition allow us to deploy capital at favourable prices.
Market deal volumes Deal volumes are stable but not buoyant.
In the year to 30 September 2014 there have been 36 private equity deals in the UK in the 75 to 300 million range.
This is a slight improvement on the 34 deals last year, but still a long way below the pre-recession peak.
Volumes this year were held back by IPO market conditions in the first quarter, which diverted deal flow from the private equity market.

Of the 36 deals completed in the UK for the year to 30 September 2014, we considered 32 of them 89% and completed three.
Deal Pricing Deal pricing has continued to rise.
In the year to 30 September 2014 the average entry multiple for UK buyouts valued at more than 10 million was 10.6x EBITDA compared to 10.5x in 2013 and 9.0x in 2012 source: CMBOR.
We are and should be prepared to pay a full price for a high-quality asset.
However, by deploying the focus described above, we have successfully achieved a significantly lower average entry multiple than the market, transacting at a weighted average 7.5x EBITDA.
We expect this to continue.
