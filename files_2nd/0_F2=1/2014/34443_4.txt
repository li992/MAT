Hitting the 35% like for like high street increase in sales in our stores Online has been a great source of success for us, but this has been complemented by new stores taking the high street by storm.
We now have eight dual fascia Simply Be and Jacamo stores in major cities around the UK, with plans for more on the way.
If were going to put our customers at the heart of our business, we need to keep our brands fresh in their minds.
Growing the network Simply Be now has the biggest selection of clothing for size 20 in the UK fashion market, and that hasnt gone unnoticed by its fans.
They now have over 170,000 Facebook followers an increase of 150% from last year, and Twitter followers are up a huge 213% to 48,000: more than any other UK plus size brand.
