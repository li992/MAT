Strategic Report Therapy Area Review Therapy Area Overview Our business model describes how we create and sustain value over the life-cycle of a medicine across our therapy areas.
In this section, we review our therapy areas, including our portfolio of marketed products, pipeline projects, strategic priorities, capabilities, resources and business development activities.
As outlined in Strategic priorities from table opposite summarises our key pipeline Pipeline overview page 18, a key element of our drive progressions in 2014.
