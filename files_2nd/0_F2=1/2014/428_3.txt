markets move in discontinuous patterns, the firm specialises in forecasting major Meeting the energy challenge changes of direction based on thorough The oil and gas industry is unique in that resource development bottom-up analysis of supply and demand.
Most estimates put the average depletion rate for crude oil at around 5% per year.
Putting that into context, to simply hold global supply flat at 83 mmbd requires over 4 mmbd of new production each year equivalent to the combined production from Brazil and Nigeria.
To make things more difficult, the easy oil has already been found and developed over past decades.
Each new barrel will be more expensive because of the escalating costs that come with more difficult geology and greater above-ground risk.
These factors depletion and increasing development costs support a return to higher oil prices in time.
Sustaining oil output and the energy requirements for the global economy will therefore be a challenge in both the near and long term.
Meeting this challenge will require significant capital investment, technological innovation and persistence to keep pace.
Companies with access to conventional reserves, financial discipline and technical excellence will not only survive the current supply overhang but also be well positioned for when oil prices eventually rebound.
