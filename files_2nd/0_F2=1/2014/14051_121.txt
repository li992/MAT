The annual base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014 were: Director Base salary Effective Date Increase Rupert Soames 850,000 8 May 2014 N A Angus Cockburn 500,000 27 October 2014 N A Ed Casey $1,061,690 1 April 2014 1.5% Andrew Jenner 463,855 1 April 2014 1.5% Variable pay outcomes audited information Performance-related annual bonus For 2014, the Executive Director bonus was on achieving a mix of financial and non-financial objectives which were weighted 50:50.
The financial measures were based on Revenue 20%, Free Cash Flow 40% and Adjusted Operating Profit 40% and the non-financial measures were individually set and based on key strategic goals.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the achievements against the targets for the year and proposed annual incentive payments for Rupert Soames and Ed Casey.
The table below shows the achievement against the financial and non-financial measures.
Although the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group Chief Executive, Rupert Soames, has significantly outperformed the targets he was set for 2014 and had intended to award a bonus on the basis of performance for the year, Rupert Soames has decided that, given the position the Company finds itself in, it would be in the best interests of the Company if he were to waive payment of his annual bonus for 2014.
Given this, no bonus will be paid to him in respect of 2014.
However, it remains the Boards intention over the course of the recovery period to reward the Group Chief Executive fairly and appropriately for achieving the targets that will contribute to Sercos recovery.
