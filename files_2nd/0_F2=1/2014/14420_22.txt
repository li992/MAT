to set the organisation boundary, along with improvements and updates to certain emissions factors used to calculate GHG emissions from activities in 2014.
This recalculation of the base year is in line with CDP guidance and was undertaken to ensure that GHG reporting reflects genuine emissions trends over time.
The 2013 base year recalculations have been included in the verification process, during which no material errors were identified.
2014 saw an increase in emissions produced, reflecting an increase in the level of operational activity during the year.
Operation activity during 2014 included field development drilling campaigns on both the CNV and TGT fields, offshore Vietnam, and an exploration appraisal drilling campaign on Marine XI, offshore Congo Brazzaville.
