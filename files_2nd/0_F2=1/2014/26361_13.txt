Progress against strategic initiatives Insurance is a market leader in the corporate pensions market serving over 11,500 employers including 19 per cent of the FTSE 350 and 1.4 million employees with 27 billion of assets invested with us.
In 2014 the number of employees covered by these schemes grew by 40 per cent principally reflecting the ongoing support for employers through the autoenrolment process.
The roll out of the Pensions Freedoms legislation in 2015 presents a significant opportunity to help customers with their retirement planning needs and a range of products to support this is being developed.
With access to 24 million Retail customers, the Group remains very well placed to participate in this market.
Relaunched the Scottish Widows brand in 2014 and increased investment in strategic initiatives specifically in digital and mobile solutions, demonstrating the Groups commitment to being a leader in the changing market.
In 2014 the underwriting of the Home insurance direct channel business was brought inhouse offering all customers access to the first class claims service we provide.
Investment is being made in the Groups direct digital capability with the aim of increasing market share in General Insurance and responding to changes in the way customers buy General Insurance, moving more towards online distribution channels.
Continued commitment to supporting customer protection needs, with focus now on the sale of our standalone protection products through investment in digital solutions and in the Independent Financial Adviser distribution channel alongside continued inbranch protection advice for mortgage applications.

Financial performance Resilient performance against a backdrop of significant change throughout the industry in 2014.
Operating cash generation increased by 55 million, to 737 million, primarily reflecting lower commission paid on corporate pensions and increased returns on shareholder free assets offset by reduced General Insurance premiums.
Underlying profit down 15 per cent to 922 million impacted by the cost of structural changes in the corporate pensions book, primarily the cap on pension charges and lower life new business and General Insurance premiums offset by improved economics and an increase in yields on assets backing annuity business as a result of the strategy to invest in longterm, low risk, higher yielding assets.
A 10 per cent increase in corporate pensions funds under management has driven a 3 billion increase in unit linked pension funds under management to 79 billion.
LP&I sales PVNBP reduced by 13 per cent in the year with sales of autoenrolment corporate pension business higher than expected but more than offset by an overall reduction in sales in 2014 following the Retail Distribution Review.
General Insurance Gross Written Premiums GWP down 8 per cent, reflecting the run off of legacy products and a competitive market during 2014.
Capital Remitted 1.0 billion of dividends to the Group in 2014 2013: 2.2 billion, including the 0.3 billion of Heidelberger Leben sale proceeds, whilst maintaining a strong capital base.

The new business income of 268 million includes a reduction in pensions new business income due to lower volumes relative to the spike in 2013 sales as preRetail Distribution Review sales completed.
In calculating new business income on autoenrolment schemes, allowance has been made for low initial contribution levels and does not include future automatic increases in contribution levels.
These increases will be reported in future years.
In addition Protection & retirement new business income has reduced following the 2014 Budget announcement which led to industry wide reductions in annuities volumes following changes to the freedoms consumers have in accessing their pension savings.
Existing business income has increased by 85 million reflecting improved economics benefiting the life and pensions business.
Assumption changes and experience variances include, within Protection and retirement, the benefits arising from the acquisition of attractive higher yielding assets to match long duration annuity liabilities and benefits from assumption changes.
This has been offset by assumption changes within the existing Pensions and investments book including actions being taken to prepare for the structural changes arising from the DWPs announcement, which introduced a cap on pension charges.
These changes to corporate pensions will ensure that future new business is less capital intensive.
General Insurance profit has fallen by 41 million, due to the continued runoff of legacy books and the impact of storms during the first quarter, offset by good prior year experience.
During the year underwriting of the Home Insurance business was brought inhouse, ensuring delivery of a first class service to all our customers and continued sustainable growth in the underwritten customer base.
Excellent technical capabilities and scale have enabled Insurance to respond to competitive pressures and a number of severe weather events in the early part of 2014, and maintain a strong combined ratio.

The growth in cash generated from existing business resulted from increased yields on assets backing the annuity business and increased returns on shareholder free assets.
In Pensions and investments, cash invested in new business has reduced due to lower volumes of corporate and individual pensions and reduced commission costs, partially offset by increased reserves for autoenrolment business these reserves are expected to unwind over the next few years as contribution levels increase.
In Protection and retirement, cash invested in new business is greater than 2013, reflecting lower profitability of standard annuities.
