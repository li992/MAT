While our shareholders are always our key focus, we believe it is equally important to create in-country value for a wider group of beneficiaries including employees, governments, local suppliers and communities.
This value is not purely focused on financial returns, it also comes from local employment, local sourcing of goods and services, capacity building and improved standards of living.
