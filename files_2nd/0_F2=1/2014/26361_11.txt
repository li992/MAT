Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Summary of Group results Overview: strong underlying profitability and balance sheet The Groups underlying profit increased by 26 per cent in the year to 7,756 million, with a 2 per cent fall in income more than offset by a 2 per cent reduction in costs and a 60 per cent improvement in impairments.
Excluding the effects of St. Jamess Place, which benefited the 2013 results, total underlying income was up 1 per cent, and expenses were down 2 per cent with underlying profit up 40 per cent.
Statutory profit before tax in 2014 was 1,762 million 2013: 415 million after provisions for PPI of 2,200 million 2013: 3,050 million and other regulatory matters of 925 million 2013: 405 million, liability management losses of 1,386 million 2013: 142 million, Simplification and TSB build and dual running costs of 1,524 million 2013: 1,517 million and a pension credit of 710 million 2013: charge 104 million.
The statutory profit after tax in 2014 was 1,499 million compared to a loss after tax of 802 million in 2013.
In the 2014 half year results news release we stated that we expected the full year statutory profit to be significantly ahead of the first half.
Statutory profit before tax in the year was 1,762 million compared with 863 million in the first half.
Total loans and advances to customers were 477.6 billion at 31 December 2014, 3 per cent lower than at 31 December 2013, with growth in the key customer segments of mortgages, SME lending, Mid Markets and UK Consumer Finance offset by reductions in balances in the Runoff portfolio and lending to Global Corporate customers.
Customer deposits were 447.1 billion at 31 December 2014, an increase of 10.6 billion, or 2 per cent, since 31 December 2013 with growth of relationship deposits, partly offset by a reduction in tactical brands.
The Groups riskweighted assets have fallen by 12 per cent to 239.7 billion reflecting the reduction in Runoff assets, active portfolio management in Commercial Banking, and the improving economic conditions.
The Groups liquidity position continues to improve with increased primary liquidity up 20.0 billion to 109.3 billion.
In addition the Group has a further 99.2 billion of secondary liquid assets a proportion of which are expected to be eligible for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR.
Based on the Groups current understanding of the LCR standards due to be implemented in October 2015, the Group believes that it met the upcoming requirements as at 31 December 2014.
The combination of strong underlying profitability and continued reduction in riskweighted assets resulted in a further improvement in the Groups common equity tier 1 ratio to 12.8 per cent at 31 December 2014 after the 0.2 per cent impact of the recommended dividend 31 December 2013: 10.3 per cent pro forma and the leverage ratio to 4.9 per cent post dividend 31 December 2013: 3.8 per cent pro forma.
The increase in the leverage ratio also reflects the issue of additional tier 1 securities AT1 in the second quarter.
Total income 2014 2013 Change million million % Net interest income 11,761 10,884 8 Banking fees and commissions 2,775 2,987 7 Insurance income 1,944 2,234 13 Operating lease and other income 1,437 1,434 Runoff 451 604 25 Other income 6,607 7,259 9 Total underlying income 18,368 18,143 1 St. Jamess Place 662 Total income 18,368 18,805 2 Banking net interest margin 2.45% 2.12% 33bp Banking net interest margin excluding TSB 2.40% 2.10% 30bp Average interestearning banking assets 483.7bn 510.9bn 5 Average interestearning banking assets excluding TSB 461.1bn 486.7bn 5 Total income of 18,368 million was 2 per cent lower than in 2013, with strong growth in net interest income offset by lower other income.
Adjusting for St. Jamess Place effects, total underlying income increased by 1 per cent.
Net interest income increased 8 per cent to 11,761 million, reflecting the continued improvement in net interest margin and loan growth in our key customer segments, partly offset by the effect of disposals and the reduced Runoff portfolio.
Net interest margin increased to 2.45 per cent, up 33 basis points, benefiting from improved deposit pricing and lower funding costs including approximately 7 basis points from the Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs exchange in the first half, partly offset by continued pressure on asset prices.
The net interest margin in the fourth quarter was 2.47 per cent, 4 basis points lower than in the previous quarter as a result of a oneoff charge to net interest income following the decision to simplify the range of savings products available to customers.
The Group expects the net interest margin for the 2015 full year will be around 2.55 per cent.
Excluding St. Jamess Place effects, other income in the year was 9 per cent lower at 6,607 million.
The reduction was due to lower insurance income which was affected by changes in the pensions and annuities markets, the continued challenging market conditions experienced by the Debt Capital Markets and Financial Markets businesses and lower valuations in the private equity business within Commercial Banking, and the impact of business disposals and the smaller Runoff portfolio.
The Group expects other income will be broadly stable in 2015 compared with 2014.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 35 Financial results Summary of Group results continued Total costs 2014 2013 Change million million % Total costs 9,412 9,635 2 Operating lease depreciation included in costs 720 746 3 1 Cost:income ratio 51.2% 52.9% 1.7 pp 2 Underlying cost:income ratio 49.8% 49.8% Simplification savings annual runrate 2,042 1,457 40 1 Excluding income of 662 million and costs of 44 million relating to St. Jamess Place in 2013.
2 Excluding St. Jamess Place, operating lease depreciation deducted from income and costs and excluding TSB running costs.
Total costs of 9,412 million were 2 per cent lower than in 2013.
The reduction was driven by incremental savings from the Simplification programme of 449 million and business disposals of 392 million, partly offset by pay and inflation of 116 million, and increased investment in the business.
Total costs excluding TSB running costs in the year were 9,042 million 2013: 9,072 million.
Costs in the fourth quarter included the Bank levy of 254 million 2013: 238 million.
The Simplification programme which began in 2011 is now delivering annual runrate savings of 2 billion, meeting the increased target announced with the 2013 results.
In October the Group announced the next phase of the programme and is targeting a cost:income ratio excluding TSB and adjusting for operating lease depreciation of around 45 per cent by the end of 2017 with annual improvements in the ratio in the intervening years.
Impairment 2014 2013 Change million million % Impairment charge excluding Runoff 997 1,615 38 Runoff impairment charge 203 1,389 85 Total impairment charge 1,200 3,004 60 Asset quality ratio 0.24% 0.57% 33 bp Impaired loans as a % of closing advances 2.9% 6.3% 3.4 pp Provisions as a % of impaired loans 56.4% 50.1% 6.3pp The impairment charge was 1,200 million, 60 per cent lower than in 2013 as a result of a significant reduction in runoff business and improvements in all divisions.
The improvement reflects lower levels of new impairment as a result of effective risk management, improving economic conditions and the continued low interest rate environment.
The net charge has also benefited from significant provision releases but at lower levels than seen in 2013.
The asset quality ratio in 2014 was 24 basis points.
The impairment charge and asset quality ratio in the fourth quarter were 183 million and 15 basis points, respectively.
The Group expects the asset quality ratio for the 2015 full year will be around 30 basis points.
Impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances reduced from 6.3 per cent at the end of December 2013 to 2.9 per cent at the end of December 2014, driven by reductions within both the continuing and the Runoff portfolios.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increased from 50.1 per cent to 56.4 per cent.

Further information on the reconciliation of underlying to statutory results is included on page 206.
2014 2013 million million Underlying profit 7,756 6,166 Asset sales and other items: Asset sales 138 687 Sale of government securities 787 Liability management 1,386 142 Own debt volatility 398 221 Other volatile items 112 457 Volatility arising in insurance businesses 228 668 Fair value unwind 529 228 1,719 280 Simplification and TSB costs: Simplification costs 966 830 TSB build and dual running costs 558 687 1,524 1,517 Payment Protection Insurance provision 2,200 3,050 Other regulatory provisions 925 405 Other items: Past service pensions credit charge 710 104 Amortisation of purchased intangibles 336 395 374 499 Profit before tax statutory 1,762 415 Taxation 263 1,217 Profit loss for the year 1,499 802 Underlying earnings per share 8.1p 6.6p Earnings per share 1.7p 1.2 p Asset sales and other items The net gain from asset sales of 138 million included a gain of 122 million from the sale of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership.
In 2013 there was a net loss from asset sales of 687 million and a 787 million gain on the sale of government securities.
The loss for liability management in 2014 of 1,386 million largely related to the Groups ECN exchange offers completed in the second quarter.
This was partly offset by the credit from own debt volatility of 398 million which mainly reflected the change in value of the equity conversion feature of the ECNs.
There was a charge for other volatile items of 112 million 2013: charge of 457 million relating to the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange hedges in the banking book not mitigated through hedge accounting.
Negative volatility arising in insurance businesses was 228 million in 2014, principally reflecting lower than expected returns on equity markets and cash investments.
This compared to positive insurance volatility of 668 million in 2013 driven by strong equity market performance.
The fair value unwind was a net charge of 529 million compared with a net charge of 228 million in 2013.
The charge largely related to the amortisation of fair value adjustments relating to the subordinated debt acquired as part of the HBOS acquisition in 2009.
Simplification and TSB costs Total Simplification costs in 2014 were 966 million 2013: 830 million.
The total spent on Simplification to the end of December 2014 was 2.4 billion with a further 0.2 billion of redundancy costs in 2014 relating to the acceleration of the next phase of the programme.
The original programme has delivered annual runrate savings of 2.0 billion, meeting the increased target announced with the 2013 results.
In the next phase of Simplification the Group is targeting a further 1 billion of annual runrate savings by the end of 2017.
The Group holds 50 per cent of TSBs ordinary shares.
TSB build and dual running costs in the year were 232 million and 326 million, respectively.
In 2013 TSB build costs were 687 million.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 37 Financial results Summary of Group results continued PPI The Group increased the provision for expected PPI costs by a further 700 million in the fourth quarter.
This brings the amount provided in 2014 to 2,200 million 2013: 3,050 million, and the total amount provided to 12,025 million.
Total costs incurred in the fourth quarter were 700 million and as at 31 December 2014, 2,549 million or 21 per cent of the total provision, remained unutilised.
The volume of reactive PPI complaints in 2014 fell by 22 per cent compared with 2013 and by 12 per cent in the fourth quarter.
During 2014 there has been a more sustained level of Claims Management Company CMC activity and as a result the Group is forecasting a slower decline in future volumes than previously expected.
The provision remaining at 31 December 2014 assumes that we will receive a further 0.6 million complaints.
This revised forecast of complaint volumes accounts for 1,080 million, approximately half of the additional provision taken in the year and of which 300 million in the fourth quarter.
However, the provision remains sensitive to future trends: as an example, were reactive complaint levels in the first two quarters of 2015 to remain broadly in line with the fourth quarter of 2014 then the revised modelled total complaints and associated administration costs would increase the provision by approximately 700 million.
The Group has mailed the original Past Business Review PBR scope of 2.7 million policies as at 31 December 2014.
During the year response rates to mailings have been slightly higher than expected, and some limited additional mailing has been added to the scope.
This covers 300 million of the provision increase in the year and 45 million in the fourth quarter.
The Group has now commenced rereviewing previously handled cases.
During the course of the year the scope of remediation has increased, which combined with higher uphold rates following complaint handling policy changes, has resulted in an additional provision being required of 250 million for the year, of which 140 million was in the fourth quarter.
The Group has also revised its forecast for uphold rates and average redress and increased its estimate for the associated administrative expenses connected with the above which combined have resulted in an increase in the provision of 570 million, of which 215 million was in the fourth quarter.
The total amount provided for PPI represents our best estimate of the likely future costs.
The runrate of spend in the first quarter of 2015 is expected to increase as a result of cash payments for remediation and residual PBR responses.
The runrate of spend in the first half of 2015 overall however, is expected to remain broadly in line with the second half of 2014 as remediation spend reduces.
These programmes will be largely complete by mid year, and as a result the Group expects a further reduction in cash outflow in the second half of 2015.
However, a number of risks and uncertainties remain in particular in respect of complaint volumes, uphold rates, average redress costs, the cost of proactive mailings and remediation, and the outcome of the FCA Enforcement Team investigation.
The cost of these factors could differ materially from our estimates, with the risk that a further provision could be required.
Other regulatory provisions During 2014 the Group has charged 925 million 2013: 405 million in respect of other regulatory and conduct related matters of which 425 million was charged in the fourth quarter.
In July 2014, the Group announced that it had reached settlements totalling 217 million at 30 June 2014 exchange rate with the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United States Department of Justice regarding the manipulation several years ago of submissions to the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate and Sterling Repo Rate between May 2006 and 2009, as well as the associated systems and control failings.
In addition to these regulatory settlements, the Group paid nearly 8 million to the Bank of England to compensate for fees that were underpaid as a direct consequence of the manipulation of the Sterling Repo Rate in 2008 and 2009.
These costs were recognised in the first half.
Further provisions of 150 million have been made relating to the past sale of interest rate hedging products IRHPs to certain small and mediumsized businesses of which 100 million was recognised in the fourth quarter.
The further provision brings the total amount provided for redress and related administration costs for customers in scope of the agreement with the FCA to 680 million of which 109 million was unutilised at 31 December 2014.
Other provisions also included 120 million recognised in the fourth quarter given the emerging experience relative to expectations for claims relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited in Germany, bringing the total provision to 520 million of which 199 million was unutilised at 31 December 2014.
In the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other UK and overseas regulators and other governmental authorities on a range of matters.
The Group also receives complaints and claims from customers in connection with its past conduct, and where significant, provisions are held against the costs expected to be incurred as a result of the conclusions reached.
In 2014, the Group made further provisions of 430 million in respect of a number of matters affecting the Retail, Commercial Banking and Consumer Finance divisions, including potential claims and remediation in respect of products sold through the branch network and continuing investigation of matters highlighted through industry wide regulatory reviews, as well as legacy product sales and historical systems and controls such as those governing legacy incentive schemes.
Of the additional provision, 205 million was recognised in the fourth quarter.
The increase reflected the Groups assessment of a limited number of matters under discussion, none of which are individually considered financially material in the context of the Group.
Other items The Group made a number of changes to its defined benefit pension scheme arrangements in the first half of the year.
These changes and other actions resulted in a 710 million net credit which was recognised in the second quarter.
Taxation The tax charge for the year to 31 December 2014 was 263 million, representing an effective tax rate of 15 per cent.
The effective tax rate was lower than the UK corporation tax rate largely as a result of tax exempt gains on sales of businesses in the first half and a lower deferred tax liability in respect of the value of inforce assets for the life business partially offset by the effect of nondeductible expenses.
The high tax charge in 2013 was driven by the write down of deferred tax assets following the changes in corporation tax rates and the sale of the Australian business.
38 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 In December 2014 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced proposals to restrict to 50 per cent the amount of banks profits that can be offset by carried forward tax losses for the purposes of calculating corporation tax liabilities.
These proposals are expected to be included in the Finance Bill 2015 and, if passed into law, will take effect in respect of profits arising after 1 April 2015.
The Group estimates that these proposals will result in no change to the level of deferred tax recognition although it will increase the period over which it expects to fully utilise its tax losses from 2019 to 2025.
Return on required equity At 31 Dec At 31 Dec Change 2014 2013 % Underlying return on required equity 13.6% 9.7% 3.9pp Statutory return on required equity 3.0% 1.3 % 4.3pp Underlying return on equity is calculated as the underlying profit after tax at the standard UK corporation tax rate less the post tax profit attributable to other equity holders divided by the average required equity in the year.
Required equity is made up of shareholders equity and noncontrolling interests and is the amount required to achieve a common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.0 per cent after allowing for regulatory adjustments and deductions.
An adjustment is also made to reflect the notional earnings on any excess or shortfall in equity.
Statutory return on required equity is calculated as the statutory profit after tax less the post tax profit attributable to other equity holders divided by the average required equity in the year.
Both return measures have improved significantly in the year reflecting the strong growth in underlying profit and the return to statutory profit.
The Group has a target statutory return on required equity of between 13.5 per cent and 15 per cent by the end of 2017.
Capital ratios and risk-weighted assets At 31 Dec At 31 Dec 2014 2013 Change 1,3 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 12.8% 10.3% 2.5pp 1,3 Transitional tier 1 capital ratio 16.5% 11.7% 4.8pp 1,3 Transitional total capital ratio 22.0% 18.8% 3.2pp 2,3 Leverage ratio 4.9% 3.8% 1.1pp 1,3 Riskweighted assets 240bn 272bn 12 % Shareholders equity 43bn 39bn 11% 1 Common equity tier 1 ratio is the same on both fully loaded and transitional bases.

3 31 December 2013 comparatives are reported on a pro forma basis that includes the benefit of the sales of Heidelberger Leben, Scottish Widows Investment Partnership and the Groups 50 per cent stake in Sainsburys Bank.
The Group continued to strengthen its capital position, with the common equity tier 1 CET1 ratio increasing to 12.8 per cent 31 December 2013: 10.3 per cent pro forma.
The improvement was driven by a combination of underlying profit, further dividends from the Insurance business, changes to and improved valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements, and a reduction in riskweighted assets.
The positive effect of these items was partly offset by charges relating to legacy issues which reduced the CET1 ratio by 1.5 per cent, the ECN exchange and tender offers which reduced the ratio by 0.5 per cent and the recommended dividend which reduced the ratio by 0.2 per cent.
The regulatory framework in which the Group operates has continued to evolve following the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive CRD IV on 1 January 2014.
The Groups Pillar 2A requirement at 31 December 2014 was 3.8 per cent of riskweighted assets of which 2.1 per cent must be covered by CET1 capital.
This reflects a point in time estimate by the PRA, which may change over time, of the total capital that is needed in relation to risks that are not covered or fully covered by Pillar I.
The Group is now assuming a steady state CET1 ratio requirement of around 12 per cent.
Riskweighted assets reduced by 12 per cent, or 32.2 billion, in the year, to 239.7 billion 31 December 2013: 271.9 billion pro forma, primarily due to asset reductions in the Runoff portfolio, active portfolio management in Commercial Banking and improvements in economic conditions.
The Groups leverage ratio increased to 4.9 per cent from 3.8 per cent pro forma in December 2013, with the AT1 issuance in the first half, where the Group repurchased the equivalent of 5 billion nominal 4 billion regulatory value of ECNs and issued 5.3 billion of new AT1 securities, accounting for 0.5 per cent of the increase.
The Groups leverage ratio exceeds the aggregate minimum levels proposed by the Financial Policy Committee FPC which require major domestic banks to meet a minimum ratio of 3 per cent, a supplementary systemic risk based buffer of up to 1.05 per cent to apply from 2016 for GSIBs and from 2019 for major domestic banks and a timevarying countercyclical leverage buffer of up to 0.9 per cent currently set at zero per cent.
Stress tests During the year, the Group was subject to stress testing exercises carried out by both the European Banking Authority EBA and the PRA.
As announced in October and December respectively, the Group exceeded the capital thresholds set for both these tests and was not required to take any action as a result of these exercises.
The remaining issued ECNs were not taken into account for the purpose of core capital for the PRA stress test.
A Capital Disqualification Event CDE occurred allowing the Group, under certain conditions, to redeem, with the permission of the PRA, any series of ECNs.
The Group has also indicated its intention to redeem those series of ECNs listed in the announcement, resulting in a reduction in tier 2 capital resources of 0.5 billion.

The Group increased its net lending in key customer segments by 1 per cent with growth of 2 per cent in mortgages excluding books closed to new business, growth of 5 per cent and 2 per cent in SME and Mid Markets respectively and 17 per cent in the UK consumer finance business.
Overall, loans and advances to customers have fallen by 3 per cent to 477.6 billion as the growth in key segments has been more than offset by a reduction in Runoff loans and advances.
The Group reduced total Runoff assets by 49 per cent to 16.9 billion.
The growth in deposits, together with the reduction in total loans and advances, resulted in the loan to deposit ratio improving to 107 per cent from 113 per cent at the end of 2013, and has reduced the Groups wholesale funding requirement.
Wholesale funding at 31 December 2014 was 116.5 billion, with 65 per cent having a maturity of greater than one year.
The Groups liquidity position remains strong, with primary liquid assets of 109.3 billion 31 December 2013: 89.3 billion.
Primary liquid assets represent almost six times our moneymarket funding with a maturity of less than one year, and just under three times our total shortterm wholesale funding, in turn providing a substantial buffer in the event of market dislocation.
In addition to primary liquid assets, the Group has significant secondary liquidity holdings of 99.2 billion 31 December 2013: 105.4 billion.
Total liquid assets represent approximately five times our shortterm wholesale funding with primary liquid assets broadly equivalent to total wholesale funding.
Based on the Groups current understanding of the LCR standards due to be implemented in October 2015, the Group believes that it met the upcoming requirements as at 31 December 2014. Dividend The Board has recommended a dividend of 0.75 pence per ordinary share in respect of 2014, amounting to 535 million.
The Groups aim is to have a progressive dividend policy, with dividends starting at a modest level and increasing over the medium term to a dividend payout ratio of at least 50 per cent of sustainable earnings.
The intention is to pay an interim and final dividend for 2015, subject to performance.
Conclusion The Group has delivered a strong underlying performance and a statutory profit after tax of 1.5 billion in 2014 despite recognising further PPI and other regulatory provisions.
At the same time, the Group has continued to reduce balance sheet risk, with significantly improved credit quality supported by a further 16 billion reduction in the Runoff portfolio.
These achievements have helped strengthen the Groups funding position, key capital and leverage ratios and enabled the Board to recommend a dividend in respect of 2014.

Underlying basis In order to present a more meaningful view of business performance, the results are presented on an underlying basis excluding items that in managements view would distort the comparison of performance between periods.
Based on this principle the following items are excluded from underlying profit: the amortisation of purchased intangible assets and the unwind of acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments: the effects of certain asset sales, the impact of liability management actions and the volatility relating to the Groups own debt and hedging arrangements as well as that arising in the insurance businesses and insurance gross up: Simplification costs, TSB build and dual running costs: payment protection insurance and other regulatory provisions: and certain past service pensions credits or charges in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements.
