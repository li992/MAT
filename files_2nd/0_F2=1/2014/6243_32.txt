This additional volume enabled us to take advantage of available capacity Obtain Clean Industry and ISO 14001 certifications at the Fresnillo beneficiation plant, and efficiencies in the Saucito plant.
Saucito II successfully commenced operations on time and on budget in What we did in 2014 the fourth quarter of 2014, with an incurred capex of US$180 million as Saucito II plant commenced operations on time and on budget in 4Q 2014 of December 2014.
The remaining US$55 million for the total anticipated capex of US$235 million is expected to be spent in 2015 on in-mine Mine development on the Jarillas vein at Saucito was increased in development.
Saucito II will contribute an additional 8.4 million ounces preparation for the Saucito II expansion: additional material was of silver and 35,000 ounces of gold per year once at fully capacity, which processed from these development activities, partly at the Fresnillo we now expect to reach ahead of the three-year timeframe previously beneficiation plant anticipated.
The total production at Saucito including Saucito II once at Reserves decreased as a result of lower price assumptions, despite full capacity isexpected to average approximately 20 million ounces of significant conversion of resources into reserves silver and 75,000 ounces of gold per year.
Advanced process to obtain Clean Industry and ISO 14001 certifications In 2015, the average silver ore grade at Saucito is expected to be around 290 g t and going forward, is expected to average approximately 350 g t. What we plan to do in 2015 Silver reserves decreased 10.1% as a result of lower price assumptions, Continue development at Saucito II to support ramp-up: we now despite significant conversion of resources into reserves.
Similarly, gold expect to reach full capacity ahead of the three-year timeframe reserves decreased by 16.7% as a result of the lower price assumptions  and lower gold ore grade encountered in the mine development on the Saucito vein.
Continue converting resources into reserves Initiate construction of the third tailings dam Capital expenditures Obtain Clean Industry and ISO 14001 certifications Capital expenditures totalled US$114.4 million which were primarily allocated to the construction of the flotation plant at Saucito II and mine development, and the remainder to acquire components for in-mine equipment.
In 2015, capex will be allocated to mining works and sustaining capex.
In the future we will evaluate a project to further increase milling capacity at Saucito through an investment in shaking tables.

The rehabilitation participation in consolidated silver revenues rose from 29.9% in 2013, to facility has resulted in shorter recovery times from accident injuries 37.7% in 2014, underscoring Saucitos growing importance to the Groups thatotherwise would need to be treated in the public health system.
Gold remains an important revenue driver for the mine, however its participation to Saucitos revenue decreased from 24.1% in Safety 2013 to 17.8% in 2014.

Community relations We engaged with our communities in partnership with local authorities by offering workshops to develop handcrafting skills, and launched a project to develop family orchards for self-consumption, funding the irrigation system and providing training and regular follow-ups from an agronomist.
We aided community leaders in their request for local authorities to build a sewage system for Saucito and Valdecaas.
