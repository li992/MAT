Strategic report Investment Manager's review William McMorrow Non-Executive Director Chairman & CEO, Kennedy Wilson Mary Ricks Non-Executive Director President & CEO, Kennedy Wilson Europe Investment Managers review We are pleased with our progress since the IPO and have put in place the stepping stones to deliver both income growth and long-term capital appreciation.
The teams ability to execute on 1.5 billion of investments in ten months highlights our sourcing capabilities and deep local relationships across the industry and with financial institutions.
We believe the current European environment will lead to a prolonged period of low interest rates and profitable opportunities in our target markets where active asset management will generate attractive total returns.
Our pan-European remit across multiple sectors means that we can leverage our platform across property cycles in different geographies as the path to recovery remains uneven across Europe.
