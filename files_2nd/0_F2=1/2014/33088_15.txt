What standards we used: basis of our work and level of assurance We carried out limited assurance in accordance with the International Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000 ISAE 3000.
To achieve limited assurance ISAE 3000 requires that we review the processes and systems used to compile the areas on which we provide assurance.
It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls.
This is designed to give a similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim financial information.
The evaluation criteria used for our assurance are the Big Yellow definitions and basis of reporting as described at: corporate.
