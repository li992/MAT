boxworks observed in the trench and, despite being 5.67g t in quartzites, and 10.4m at 1.98g t, including 4.4m at narrow, the structural readings from the trench confirmed 4.25g t, in a porphyry.
Auger holes returned: BaA221 15m the NNW structural interpretation for the target.
Further mapping and sampling are progressing along Regolith mapping over the area highlighted a more erosional the target, with recent lithosample results of 1.33g t and regime in the north of the target area with the majority of the 4.02g t. priority area overlain by extensive paleao-alluvial gravels in the flood plain of the nearby Falm River which have been Bakolobi permit Taurus Gold JV lateritised in situ and can be up to 6m thick.
Following initial fieldmapping and ground geophysical programmes completed in late 2013, a priority corridor Geologically, the N-S corridor is interpreted to represent for detailed soil sampling was established within the Kofi a terrain boundary between a thrusted, less deformed formation on strike between the Fekola and Gounkoto package of rocks in the east and a more complex, deposits.
This work led to the generation of 11 targets folded sequence of sediments in the west.
Early where soil anomalism occurs over dolomites, siliciclastic lithosampling across this area returned an average rocks and narrow intermediate to felsic intrusive dykes, grade of 3g t from 15 samples.

A reconnaissance RC drilling programme was carried out to fast-track the location of mineralised structures Historical work from this corridor on the Bakolobi permit through the transported material in the area and this included trench results of 27m at 2.23g t, including 9m at identified a number of mineralised zones within the LEGEND JV WEST MALI Kamana target N Over 2.5km soil anomaly 100ppb and NS-NNW structures.
