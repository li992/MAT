intention to buy back The IC investment portfolio was impacted by realisations as the balance sheet contributed up to 100m of its more than third party funds to each investment prior to 2010.
A total of 80% of the assets share capital over the realised in our mezzanine and equity funds were 2008 or earlier investments.
Likewise the older vintage CLOs were also impacted by realisations.
