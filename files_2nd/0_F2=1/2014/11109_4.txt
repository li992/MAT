Business strategies and objectives The primary financial objective of the Group is to deliver long term returns to shareholders through a combination of sustainable growth in earnings per share EPS and payment of cash dividends.
Underlying EPS increased by 23% from last year.
Over the last ten years EPS has increased by almost 300%, and the share price has increased by almost 400%.
This long term value has been created through the consistent pursuit of the following strategies: Improving and developing NEXT product ranges, success in which is measured by sales performance.
Profitably increasing retail selling space.
New store appraisals must meet demanding financial criteria before the investment is made, and success is measured by achieved profit contribution and return on capital against appraised targets.
Increasing the number of profitable NEXT Directory customers and their spend, both in the UK and through international online sales.
Managing gross and net margins through efficient product sourcing, stock management and cost control.
Maintaining the Groups financial strength through an efficient balance sheet and secure financing structure.
Generating and returning surplus cash to shareholders by way of share buybacks or, more recently, special dividends.
Further information on the criteria we use to determine the method by which surplus cash is returned can be found in the Chief Executives Review.
