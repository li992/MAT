We have SIS partnerships in the Netherlands and Ireland, and currently run stores onbehalf of MNOs in Spain, Portugal and Germany.
PROVEN SUCCESS THROUGH BEST BUY MOBILE Best Buy Mobile was launched in2007 as a partnership with Best Buy, through which CPW received a profit share.
Stores, based on the Carphone Warehouse model, were rolled out across Best Buy's 'Big Box' stores, as well as on a stand-alone basis in the US.
The venture was a resounding success and in January 2012 the Group disposed of its interest in Best Buy Mobile for a total consideration of838m.
CPW aims to replicate the success of the Best Buy Mobile SIS concept, by providing a specialist connected products andservices proposition on behalf of retailers with larger store formats, who enjoy significant footfall but who lack expertise in the mobile field.
