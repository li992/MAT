In addition, wewould like to inform you that we are introducing a change to the bonus structure for executive directors and other managers for 2014 15.
While the Severn Trent Water balanced scorecard and individual performance remain highly relevant, the Committee has now decided that a significant element of the bonus for these directors should be based on demanding key business objectives, the achievement of which has the capacity to transform the business.
Finally, following a review of market practice and shareholder feedback, the shareholding guidelines for the Chief Executive have increased from 150% to 200% of salary and the guidelines for the other executive directors have increased from 100% to 125% of salary respectively.
No other significant changes are being made to the remuneration policy.
Executive director changes During the course of the year, the Committee considered the retirement of the current Chief Executive, Tony Wray and the recruitment arrangements for his successor, LivGareld.
Full details of their respective leaving and joining arrangements are set outin the Annual report on remuneration on page 75.
Structure of the report This is the first year of compliance with the new regulations on remuneration reporting and I hope you nd the remuneration report more transparent and easy to understand.
In line with the regulations, the remuneration report is split into two sections.
The Policy Report sets out the remuneration policy for the executive directors of Severn Trent Plc for the next three years and will be subject to a binding vote by shareholders at the AGM.
The Annual report on remuneration provides details of the amounts paid to the directors for the year ended 31 March 2014 and sets out how the policy will be applied for the forthcoming year.
This letter and the Annual report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
There will also be a separate binding vote to approve the new LTIP.
We have sought and carefully considered the feedback from shareholders in the changes we have made to simplify the remuneration policy.
I hope you are supportive and can approve all three resolutions at the AGM.
Richard Davey Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 60 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Policy report This section of the remuneration report, setting out the remuneration policy for the directors of Severn Trent plc, is subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on 16 July 2014 and will take effect, subject to approval, from this date.
Setting the remuneration policy The Committee sets the remuneration policy for executive directors and other senior executive managers, taking into account the companys strategic objectives over the short and the long term and the external market.
The Committee addresses the need to balance risk and reward.
The Committee monitors the variable pay arrangements to take account of the risk levels ensuring an emphasis on long term and sustainable performance.
The Committee believes that the incentive schemes are appropriately managed and that the choice of performance measures and targets does not encourage undue risk taking by the executives so that the long term performance of the business is not compromised by the pursuit of short term value.
The schemes incorporate a range of internal and external performance metrics, measuring both operational and financial performance over differing and overlapping performance periods providing a rounded assessment of overall company performance.
Linkage to all employee pay The Committee reviews changes in remuneration arrangements in the workforce generally.
It aims to ensure that executive salary increases are normally aligned to the increases for the rest of the workforce.
Furthermore, the annual bonus operates on a similar basis with the bonus schemes operated throughout Severn Trent Water using the same balanced scorecard, all UK employees may participate in the HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE scheme and UK based Severn Trent Water employees may also participate in a Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The company has not directly consulted with employees on the topic of executive remuneration: however, the Committee does consider the general base salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions for the broader employee group when determining the remuneration policy for executive directors.
Shareholder views The Committee engages pro-actively with the companys major shareholders, and takes their views into account.
The Committee reviews any feedback received from shareholders as a result of the AGM process and throughout the rest of the year and takes into consideration the latest views of investor bodies and their representatives, including the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and proxy advice agencies such as Institutional Shareholder Services.
When any material changes are made to the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee Chairman will discuss these with major shareholders in advance, and will offer a meeting for a more detailed discussion.

62 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Further details on the variable pay policy Annual bonus The performance measures and targets are carefully selected annually to align with the relevant business units strategic and key performance indicators.
The annual weighting of the bonus between the various metrics and personal contribution may vary depending on the key priorities of the business for the year ahead.
Robust and demanding targets are set taking into account the operating environment and priorities, market expectations and the business plan for the year ahead.
Long term incentives a LTIP RoRCV is used to assess performance under the LTIP.
This is consistent with the measure used by Ofwat in setting customer prices as part of the final determination the process whereby Ofwat sets the level of prices Severn Trent Water can charge customers and reects the efficiency of earnings rather than simply being an absolute measure of profit.
It is veried and published as part of the Annual Regulatory Performance Report.
The Committee believes that the use of RoRCV provides a strong alignment between the long term financial and operational performance of the group and the reward delivered to management.
Performance is measured over the three financial years with a sliding scale of targets applied.
The Committee reserves the discretionary power to adjust the formulaic outturn of the RoRCV condition to ensure that the vesting result is reective of the underlying financial and operational performance of the company over the performance period.
The use of this discretion is expected to be exceptional, but may be invoked by the Committee in order to take into account factors such as regulatory changes, changes in the nancing of the company and extreme weather events not an exhaustive list.
This discretion can be operated upwards or downwards, but the Committee would consult with its major shareholders before making any upwards adjustment.
In relation to the awards granted in 2013 and prior, there is a cap and collar limiting the extent to which this discretion can be applied if the vesting result indicated by the RoRCV condition is greater than 50% the Committee may reduce the vesting to a number not less than 50%: and if it is 0% it may increase it to any gure not greater than 50%.
This cap and collar approach will not apply to awards granted from 2014.
In addition, for any awards to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been no compromise to the commercial practices or operational standards of the group.
If the Committee is not so satisfied, then the vesting percentage may be scaled back as appropriate including to 0%.
b Legacy Share Matching Plan Until 2013, awards were also made under a Share Matching Plan SMP.
Under the SMP, the policy has been that executive directors could receive up to 0.5 matching shares for each share deferred under the annual bonus plan the maximum award level was therefore 30% of salary.
The matching awards were subject to achievement of a relative total shareholder return performance condition and financial underpin.
At the time of release participants also receive the value of the dividends paid on vested shares over the performance period.
The executive directors have outstanding awards under the SMP related to grants made in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The outstanding awards will be allowed to pay out under the approved policy subject to achievement of the performance conditions on which they were granted.
Remuneration Committee discretion The Committee will operate all plans according to the rules of each respective plan and the discretions contained therein.
The discretions cover aspects such as the timing of grant and vesting of awards, determining the size of the award subject to the policy limits, the treatment of leavers see policy on terminations, retrospective adjustment of award size e. g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or for special dividends and, in exceptional circumstances, the discretion to adjust previously set targets if events happen that cause the Committee to determine that it would be appropriate to do so.
In exercising such discretions the Committee will take into account generally accepted market practice, best practice guidelines, theprovisions of the Listing Rules and the companys approved remuneration policy.
Pension policy The executive directors participate in a variety of pension arrangements.
The policy for future appointments, which is reected in the remuneration package agreed for Liv Gareld, is a company contribution to a dened contribution scheme and or cash allowance up to a maximum of 25% of salary.
Legacy arrangements for the other directors include a 40% of salary cash allowance for Michael McKeon and Andy Smith and 30% of salary for Martin Kane.
Tony Ballance is a member of the Severn Trent Pension Scheme Pension Choices section, a dened contribution scheme.
He currently contributes 3% of salary and the company contributes 30%, plus a further 2.5% in respect of death in service and ill health benets.
The normal retirement age for the scheme is 65 although retirement prior to 65 is possible with the consent of the company.
Martin Kane, Andy Smith and Tony Wray are legacy members of the companys dened benefit pension scheme.

63 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Remuneration Committee continued External directorships Executive directors are permitted to take on external non-executive directorships, though normally only one other FTSE 100 appointment, to bring a further external perspective to the group and help in the development of key individuals experience.
In order to avoid any conicts of interest, all appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee.
Executive directors are permitted to retain the fees arising from one appointment.
Shareholding guidelines The company operates shareholding guidelines under which executive directors are expected to build and maintain a shareholding in the company.
The Chief Executive is expected to build and maintain a holding of shares to the value of 200% of salary and other executive directors 125% of salary.
Executive directors are expected to retain all of the net of tax number of shares they receive through the LTIP, SMP and deferred share bonus until the shareholding guidelines have been met.
Reward scenarios The charts below show how the composition of each of the executive directors remuneration packages varies at different levels of performance achievement.
On-target pay includes xed pay, a 60% of salary bonus and 50% vesting of the LTIP awards with grant levels of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 80% of salary for the other executive directors.
Maximum pay includes xed pay and assumes 100% vesting of both the annual bonus and the LTIP awards.
No share price growth has been factored into the above chart and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest 1,000.
Salary levels which are the base on which other elements of the package are calculated are based on those applying at 1 July 2014.
The value of taxable benets is the cost of providing those benets in the year ended 31 March 2014 estimated value used in the case of Liv Gareld.
Note that the majority of Martin Kanes taxable benets relate to his relocation to the US.
The executive directors are also permitted to participate in the company Save As You Earn Scheme and Share Incentive Plan but they have been excluded from the above graph for simplicity.
Service contracts and policy on payments for loss of office The remuneration related elements of the current contracts for executive directors are shown in the table below.
Provision Policy Notice period 12 months from either party Termination payment Under the policy and as reected in the service contract for Liv Gareld and all future appointments, payments for loss of office comprise a maximum of 12 months salary and benets only.
The policy under other executive directors legacy contracts provides for a maximum payment in the case of redundancy, payment in lieu of notice or termination in breach of the agreement by the company of 175% of base salary.
In determining actual payouts, the Committee shall have regard to the overriding requirement to be fair to both the company and the executive.
In particular, the company shall not be required to reward failure on the part of the executive which in the case of the contracts other than for Michael McKeon is reected in the financial performance of the group and shall have regard to the current corporate governance standards at the date of termination of the executive.
In such cases, the Committee may exercise its discretion to reduce the payment by up to 10% lowering the payment to 157.5% of salary and in the case of Michael McKeon it may reduce the payment as it thinks t. Mitigation Any termination payment will not be made automatically but will be subject to both phasing and mitigation including offset against any earnings from new employment.

Outstanding incentive awards would vest in line with the treatmentset out below for a good leaver except that the performance and vesting period will end on thedate of control.
Annual bonus The Committee may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus to a departing executive, subject to performance and pro-rated to reect the proportion of the year worked.
The bonus would be paid at the same time as for the other directors and if the executive has left employment by that date, it may be paid solely in cash.
Any outstanding deferred bonus shares will vest on cessation of employment unless the departure is a result of summary dismissal.
LTIP The default treatment is that awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, executives will be considered a good leaver in certain prescribed circumstances or by the discretion of the Committee.
If an executive is a good leaver, the award will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance and time pro-rating based on the proportion of the performance period that the executive has been employed rounded up to the nearest month.
The Committee may determine that the award should vest early, and in exceptional circumstances may time pro-rate the award to a lesser extent.
For the outstanding awards under the legacy 2005 LTIP, the time pro-rating is calculated by rounding up to the nearest full year.
Share Matching Plan The directors have outstanding awards relating to grants made in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The default treatment is that awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, executives will be treated as a good leaver in certain prescribed circumstances or by the discretion of the Committee, in which case the matching award will normally continue to run for the full three years subject to performance and time pro-rating rounded up to the nearest calendar month.
The Committee, however, may decide to pro-rate to a lesser extent and or allow the award to vest early.
Recruitment awards As detailed under the recruitment policy, the Committee has the discretion to grant awards to buy-out an executives awards at their previous employer if necessary to secure their employment.
The terms of any recruitment award will be determined on a case by case basis.
In relation to the one-off awards granted to Liv Gareld, on her appointment as Chief Executive, these are subject to performance conditions and will not be subject to time pro-rating in the event of the early termination of her appointment by the company.
This lack of time pro-rating was agreed in recognition of the fact that the expected value of the forfeited awards at BT was signicantly higher with much of it being nonperformance related and which would not have been scaled back for a similar event.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
Outstanding awards under the SAYE and SIP would vest in accordance with the terms of the plans as approved by HMRC.

Approach to recruitment and promotion The remuneration packages for all new executive directors will be set in line with the companys approved policy.
The Committee will take into account, in arriving at a total package, the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that level of experience, as well as the importance of securing the best candidate.
Annual bonuses and long term incentives will be awarded in line with the maximum limits set outlined in the policy on page 62.
Participation in the plans will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make additional cash and or share based awards if deferred pay is forfeited by an executive on leaving a previous employer.
Such awards would take into account the nature of awards forfeited i. e. cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions.

The Committee believes that the use of the selected 10 Severn Trent Water KPIs continues to be both an effective and challenging annual bonus metric and meets the needs of the business.
The bonus entitlement was determined by reference to the aggregate number of points awarded across all the KPIs.
The targets taken together are considered by the board to have an impact on the longer term financial performance of the company and a number of them are reported to Ofwat.
"The KPIs used to determine the annual bonus are: Key Performance Indicators Target Stretch Outturn Points Employee KPI 1 Lost time incidents per 100,000 hrs worked 0.28 0.27 0.21 130 F 0-4'""', % 1 $# 5-0 ', % KPI 2 Employee motivation 79% 80% 81% 130 environment F #4# -."
!2 KPI 16 Leakage Ml d Post MLE 456 449 441 130 Total 1,079 Each KPI has 100 target points, 130 stretch points and, in theory, extra points can be earned for above stretch performance.
For executive directors to be awarded the maximum bonus available they are required to achieve 1,300 aggregate points.
During the year, 6 of the 10 KPIs exceeded the stretch level of performance, generating an aggregate initial score of 1,443 points.
After examining the overall performance and indicative bonus outturn the Committee determined that each of the 6 KPIs should be capped at the level of stretch performance i. e. 130 points per KPI.
As a consequence the final aggregate score was 1,079 points.
The resulting bonus awarded for the Severn Trent Water portion of the annual bonus was 63.2% of its bonus element maximum, representing a strong performance in the year and continues the positive progressive trend in the outturn of the KPIs.

The Committee considered the level of RoRCV out-performance 75 of the Ofwat final determination for the 2011 LTIP award after adjusting RoRCV to exclude the impact of an exceptional tax 50 credit.
This showed the average RoRCV over the three years ending in 2013 14 had still outperformed theRoRCV Ofwat final determination by 16.5% therefore resulting in 100% vesting.
For the LTIP award this is based on the average share price over the final three months of the performance period 17.71 as the awards will not be released until June 2014. ii Tony Wray retired from the board on 11 April 2014.
As noted on page 75 he is being treated as a good leaver under the rules of the LTIP.
His award vests as normal on 1 April 2014 and will be released after the end of the close period.
In accordance with the rules, there is no pro-rata reduction since he served for the whole of the performance period.
The expected release date for the 2011 LTIP awards is June 2014. ii Additional dividend equivalent shares may be released where provided in the rules.
Long Term Incentive Plan awards The LTIP awards are granted as conditional shares.
The target range for all outstanding awards is the same as for the 2011 LTIP set out on page 70.
As noted on page 70, the 2011 LTIP vests at 100% on 1 April 2014, however as the company was in a close period the release of award will be made after this period ends.
The 2013 LTIP awards were granted on 19 June 2013.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted was 17.60.
Share Matching Plan awards Awards are granted in line with the policy outlined in the Policy Report.
For awards granted in 2011 onwards, TSR performance is measured over three different measurement periods, each commencing on the date of grant 20% of each award is measured over 18 months, 30% over 27 months and 50% over 36 months.
25% of each part of the award will become eligible for vesting for median performance increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
However, for any of the award to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the companys TSR is reective of the companys underlying performance over the full three year performance period.
The 2011 SMP awards vests, subject to performance, on 20 May 2014.
The 2013 SMP awards were awarded on 26 June 2013.
The share price on that date was 16.51.
Deferred shares under the Annual Bonus Scheme Each year, 50% of an executive directors annual bonus is deferred in shares for three years.
The awards are granted in the form of conditional shares.
The 2013 award relates to the deferral of the annual bonus for 2012 13.
The award was granted on 26 June 2013.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted was 16.51.
The deferred shares relating to the annual bonus for 2013 14 will be granted in June 2014.

Awards will vest on a takeover and in the event of a good leaver subject to performance.
There will be no scaling back on a time pro rata basis.
This lack of pro rating was agreed in recognition of the fact that the expected value of the forfeited awards is very signicantly higher with much of it being non-performance related and which would not have been scaled back for a similar event.
In addition to this one-off award she will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses in relation to her relocation.
