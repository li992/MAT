The exploration team has again focused on the thickness mineralised systems and a significant percentage of of the transported alluvium over the Gounkoto area its strike remains unexplored.
It is one of the two key and the Gounkoto SW target and were able to look structures in the Kedegou-Kenieba inlier, the other being through the cover using remote exploration techniques, the Main Transcurrent zone MTZ where Massawa is specifically targeting the 1.2km SW strike extension to the located.
It features limited work in the form of drilling which returned wide zones of alteration: As a result, the structure and its surrounding formations GSWRC11 12m at 1.12g t from 40m: GSWRC03 - the Kofi and the Keniebandi - form a key part of our 28m at 0.82g t from 152m, including 2m at 4.61g t: and exploration strategy in West Africa and our groundholdings GSWRC13 4m at 1.59g t from 248m, and is the next along the structure give us access to approximately 70km priority area for exploration on the permit.
This year, we have completed programmes over the Bakolobi project on the SMSZ in the south of Mali greenfields the inlier.
The Bakolobi project is a JV with Taurus Gold The Senegal Malian Shear Zone SMSZ on the MaliLimited Taurus Gold.
We have signed a new JV with Senegal border is one of the most prospective goldfields Legend Gold Corporation Legend Gold Djelimangara in the world with a 50Moz gold endowment along its project which lies along the SMS to the immediate 200km of strike.
