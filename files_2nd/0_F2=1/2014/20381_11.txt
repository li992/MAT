Depositary National Westminster Bank plc was appointed with effect from 1 July 2014 to carry out the duties of Depositary as specified in the Alternative Investment Fund Managers AIFM Directive in relation to the Company, including holding or controlling all assets of the Company which are entrusted to it for safekeeping: cash monitoring and verifying the Companys cash flows: and oversight of the Company and the Managers.
In carrying out such duties, the Depositary acts in the best interests of the Shareholders of the Company.
The Depositary is contractually liable to the Company for the loss of any assets entrusted to it.
The Depositary is also liable to the Company for all other losses suffered as a result of the Depositarys fraud, negligence and or failure to fulfil its duties properly.

During the year, 38,000 shares 0.04% of the Companies issued share capital with a nominal value of 380 were bought back and cancelled at a total cost of 403,000.
No shares are held in treasury.
Subject to the requirement that purchases by the Company of its own shares are made only at a level that enhances the net asset value NAV, the principal objective of any such purchase is to seek to sustain as low a discount between the Companys NAV and share price as seems possible.
Accordingly, it is the Boards intention to continue to use the share purchase facility within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
Continuation of the Company The Company has no fixed duration.
However, in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association, the Companys Shareholders are asked every three years to vote on the continuation of the Company and an ordinary resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2017.
If such resolution is not passed, the Directors will prepare and submit to shareholders for approval by special resolution proposals for the unitisation or appropriate reconstruction of the Company.
In putting forward such proposals the Directors will seek, inter alia, to provide shareholders with a means whereby they can defer any liability to capital gains tax on their investment at that time.
If such proposals are not approved, shareholders will, within 180 days of the relevant Annual General Meeting, have the opportunity of passing an ordinary resolution requiring the Company to be wound up.
On a winding up, after meeting the liabilities of the Company, the surplus assets will be paid to the holders of Ordinary Shares and distributed, pro rata, among such holders.
Going Concern In accordance with the report Going Concern and Liquidity Risk : Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued by the Financial Reporting Council, the Audit Committee has undertaken and documented an assessment of whether the Company is a going concern.
The Committee then reported the results of its assessment to the Board.
The Companys business activities, capital structure and borrowing facility, together with the factors likely to affect its development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report.
In addition, the Annual Report includes the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable equity securities, which, if necessary, can be sold to meet any funding requirements, though funding flexibility can typically be achieved through the use of the bank debt facility.
The Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to meet its dayto-day working capital requirements.
The Directors believe the Company is well placed to continue to manage its business risks and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In summary and taking into consideration all available information, the Directors have concluded it is appropriate to continue to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
