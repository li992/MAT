For Market Risk Management Inc USA Ordinary shares 100% Market maker the purposes of impairment-testing of goodwill, the carrying amount of each CGU is compared to the recoverable amount of each CGU IG Infotech India Private Limited India Ordinary shares 100% Software development and any deficits are provided.
The carrying amount of a CGU includes only those assets that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a IG Nominees Limited UK Ordinary shares 100% Nominee company reasonable and consistent basis.

This is 1.2 billion in excess extrabet Limited UK Ordinary shares 100% Non-trading of the carrying amount of the CGU.
Broker Connect Inc USA Ordinary shares 100% Software development LLC IG Dev Belarus Ordinary shares 100% Software development The estimated recoverable amount of the US CGU, however, is based upon a value-in-use calculation due to the difficulty in determining a fair value for this CGU.
For the US CGU this is calculated as the total of the present value of projected future cash flows and a terminal value.
IG Finance UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing IG Finance Two UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS IG Finance Three UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing The UK, Australian and South African CGUs reported a segment operating profit, after the allocation of central costs, of 117.5 million, IG Finance Four UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing 31.3 million and 2.1 million respectively for the year ended 31 May 2014 refer to note 4, Segment Information.
Furthermore, the UK IG Finance 5 Limited UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing CGU represents 52% of the Groups net trading revenue for the year ended 31 May 2014.
The Board-approved budget for the financial year ending 31 May 2015 and longer-term strategic plans for the Group forecast at least a similar level of performance for these CGUs to IG Forex Limited previously called UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing IG Finance 6 Limited continue.
As a result, both the single-year operating profit and thus the recoverable amount of the UK, Australian and South African CGUs IG Spread Betting Limited previously UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing is significantly in excess of the carrying value.
Accordingly, the outcome of the impairment review for the CGUs is not considered to be called IG Finance 7 Limited sensitive to the assumptions used.
IG Finance 8 Limited UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing The Directors have performed a sensitivity analysis around the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation of the goodwill associated IG Finance 9 Limited UK Ordinary shares 100% Financing with the US CGU.
The US CGU comprises both the Nadex exchange and associated market-making business the Nadex exchange ITS Market Solutions Limited UK Ordinary shares 100% Non-trading business as well as the wider commercial use of the exchange technology within the Group.
While the Nadex exchange business remains Fox Sub Limited Gibraltar Ordinary shares 100% Financing loss-making, the wider commercial use of the technology by the Group provides other significant economic benefits which, taken alone, Fox Sub Two Limited Gibraltar Ordinary shares 100% Financing support the carrying value of the goodwill.
For this reason the Directors consider that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption 1 would not cause the units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
In the event of the Nadex exchange business failing to Fox Japan Holdings Gibraltar Ordinary shares 100% Holding company generate sufficient profits, the deferred tax asset of 1.7 million held in relation to carry forward tax losses might suffer impairment.
IG US Holdings Inc USA Ordinary shares 100% Holding company Market Data Japan KK Japan Ordinary shares 100% Holding company KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS OF DISPOSAL CALCULATIONS FXOnline Japan Co. Limited Japan Ordinary shares 100% Non-trading The fair value less costs of disposal of the UK CGU has been calculated using an earnings multiple determined by reference to the 1 IG Securities Limited and Fox Japan Holdings have a year-end of 31 March due to local Japanese law.
Companys quoted market capitalisation and the Groups segmental operating profit.
As the business model of this CGU is largely synonymous with that of the Group, this methodology is deemed to be appropriate.
