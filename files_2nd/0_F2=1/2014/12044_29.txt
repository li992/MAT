The cap increases on 1 July each year in line with increases in the Retail Price Index.
Their scheme retirement age is 65 and their accrual rate is sixtieths.
As Jeff Fairburn and David Jenkinsons pensionable salaries in the DB scheme are capped, they do not earn pension on their total base salary.
They are paid a salary supplement of 9% of the difference between their pensionable salary and their base salary.
This is the same as the supplement available to monthly paid employees who have a pension scheme earnings cap or who cease pension scheme membership due to reaching the HMRC Lifetime Allowance for pension saving.
Mike Killoran and Nigel Greenaway have both ceased membership of Company pension schemes.
Mike Killoran is paid a salary supplement of 30% of his base salary, which the Committee after taking advice considers is cost neutral to the Company based onthepension benefits Mike Killoran previously earned.
Nigel Greenaway receives a salary supplement of 9% of his base salary.
No additional benefits are receivable by the Directors on early retirement.

LTIP awards Awards under the Persimmon Long Term Incentive Plan 2012 2012 LTIP have a maximum 10-year performance period specifically aligned to the Companys Capital Return Plan.
Due to the long performance period, the intention with the 2012 LTIP is to make awards with much longer performance and vesting periods, rather than making lower annual awards with shorter performance periods.
Therefore there were no 2012 LTIP awards to Executive Directors in 2014.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments for loss of office for 2014.
Payments to past Directors There were no payments to past Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014, where the total payment to the former Director exceeded a threshold set by the Company of 60,000.
