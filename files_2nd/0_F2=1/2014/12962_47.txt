gold belt in the Archean of NE DRC where Randgold holds ground over 35km strike Anomalous results had been received from one trench of the KZ structure, a regional mineralised trend which and one road cutting including 4m at 1.14g t, including has a global inferred resource of over 22Moz and which 2m at 1.35g t within a foliated, silicified metaconglomerate hosts the giant 17Moz KCD deposit with a banked LoM of with boxworks.
Brownfields exploration this year focused on the conversion of inferred resources to the indicated category at Gorumbwa and Mofu.
Follow-up work on early stage targets at the base of the resource triangle continued as part of a wider initiative along the KZ structure, which is believed to be a major transcrustal discontinuity that has focused deformation and fluid flow along its strike.
KCD The priority of brownfields exploration work moved from KCD to Gorumbwa and other satellite deposits in 2014.
Limited work was completed at KCD as the geology teams have been busy with the start of underground operations.
A target generation exercise around the development at KCD identified seven targets immediately beneath the base of the $1 000 oz pit.
Four holes were drilled into a gap on the 3000 lode where a 250m x 50m by 50m gap in drilling between 5600 and 5720 levels existed.
Results failed to highlight significant high grade continuity with the exception of hole DDD598 which intersected 59.15m at 4.07g t from 103.85m including 20m at 9.01g t from 103.85m compared to the model prediction of 71.19m at 1.53g t. The hole also intersected 16.05m at 2.35g t from 223.25m and 10.9m at 3.05g t and the potential for mineralisation continuing further to the west is being reviewed.
