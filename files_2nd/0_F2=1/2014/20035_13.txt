It produces copper realised prices.
Realised copper prices fell to $2.95 lb from $3.25 lb, significantly impacting concentrate containing gold and silver and molybdenum operating profits, and cash costs increased concentrate through a milling and flotation process.
PRODUCTION Copper production was 391,300 tonnes in 2014, which slightly exceeded the original forecast for the year, but was below 2013 production of 405,300 tonnes.
The decrease in production was due to lower ore grades 2.8% lower than in 2013 and MINE LIFECYCLE POSITION lower recoveries.
Molybdenum production decreased by 12.2% to 7,900 tonnes in 2014 compared with production of 9,000 tonnes in 2013.
This was mainly due to mining a lower grade molybdenum phase of the pit, partially offset by improved recoveries.
Gold production Start of operation: 2000 was 17.3% higher in 2014 at 66,500 ounces, Mine life: 23 years compared with 56,700 ounces in 2013.
CASH COSTS Exploration Evaluation Construction Production Cash costs before by-product credits in 2014 were slightly higher than 2013 at $1.56 lb.
