BUSINESS MODEL CREATING VALUE THROUGH THE MINING LIFECYCLE INVESTMENT VERSUS INCOME INPUTS Mining is a long-term business.
Timescales can run into decades.
The period from initial exploration to the start of production often exceeds ten years.
Then, depending on the nature of the project and market conditions, it may take more than five years of operation to recoup the initial investment.
Mines usually plan to exploit higher-grade areas towards the start of the mine life, in order to maximise returns from the operation.
As a result, average ore grades may decline over time, with production volumes decreasing along with revenues.

These tend to be cyclical, so even asproduction volumes decline revenues can increase, and vice versa.
Long-life and low-cost operations increase the likelihood of a mine being able to benefit from the peaks in the commodity price cycle while withstanding the troughs.
Also, during the life of a mine there will often be expansions that help itto keep down its unit costs of production the most important financial KPI on a mine.
