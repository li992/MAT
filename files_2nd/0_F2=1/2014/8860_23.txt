The groups underlying operating profit at constant exchange rates is shown in the table below: Underlying Operating Profit Year ended 31st March 2013 at 2014 2014 2013 exchange rates restated % restated % million million change million change Emission Control Technologies 203.6 163.5 25 163.4 25 Process Technologies 101.9 92.4 10 91.8 11 Precious Metal Products 130.9 124.4 5 124.1 5 Fine Chemicals 84.1 76.6 10 76.4 10 New Businesses 18.3 16.0 -14 16.0 -14 Corporate 33.3 24.8 25.2 Total group 468.9 416.1 13 414.5 13 The average exchange rates during the year ended 31st March 2014 were only slightly different from those of the previous financial year, with sterling strengthening slightly against the US dollar but weakening against the euro and Chinese renminbi.
Overall, the impact of exchange rates decreased reported group underlying operating profit for the year by 1.6 million.
Of the groups underlying operating profit that is denominated in the groups principal overseas currencies, the average exchange rates during 2013 14 were: Share of 2013 14 non-sterling denominated underlying Average exchange rate operating profit 2013 14 2012 13 US dollar 45% 1.591 1.580 Euro 24% 1.186 1.228 Chinese renminbi 12% 9.73 9.93 However, whilst the average exchange rates for the year were very similar to 2012 13, since the summer of 2013 sterling has appreciated against almost all currencies.
At 31st March 2014, the exchange rate of sterling against the US dollar, euro and Chinese renminbi was $1.667, 1.210 and 10.37 respectively and since then sterling has strengthened even further.
If these current exchange rates are maintained throughout 2014 15, this will adversely impact reported underlying operating profit.
Each one cent change in the average US dollar and euro exchange rates has approximately a 1.2 million and 0.8 million effect respectively on underlying operating profit in a full year: a ten fen change in the average rate of the Chinese renminbi has around a 0.5 million impact on underlying operating profit in a full year.
Whilst these currencies represent about 80% of the groups non-sterling denominated underlying operating profit, the group is also exposed to other foreign currencies.
Some of those currencies have depreciated dramatically against sterling, for example the Argentinian peso which has depreciated by more than 50% in the last year.
If current exchange rates are used to re-translate the underlying operating profit for the group in 2013 14, the reported result would have been over 20 million lower.
