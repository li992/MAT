Development opportunities, in particular, can take many years from first idea to first letting and will often involve substantial investment over a period of years before any gain is achieved.
We carefully monitor our exposure to ensure that the impact on our resources remains manageable.
Business model The main activity of the Group, as carried on through its subsidiary companies, is investment in commercial, industrial and residential property in the UK and also on the eastern seaboard of the USA.
The Group generally holds its properties for the long term in order to generate rental income and capital appreciation although in the right circumstances any property could be available for sale.
The Group operates a substantially outsourced business model.
Day to day management of the Groups properties in the UK is carried out by Highdorn Co. Limited and Freshwater Property Management Limited.
These companies also provide the staff who carry out all of the UK functions of the Group.
Further details of the relationship with these companies are set out in Note 17 to the financial statements.
Similar arrangements with local managing agents operate in the USA.

The Group aims to ensure that the cost of capital is kept to a minimum through Page 4 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 5 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 6 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report continued the maintenance of its many long standing relationships with leading banks and other financial institutions.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of sudden or unexpected rises in finance costs by way of fixed rate debt and financial derivative instruments whilst retaining some flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
As explained in Note 1 g to the financial statements, the Group does not hedge account.
Note 16 to the financial statements details the Groups exposure to the various financial instrument risks.
Managing risk has been central to the success of the Group over many years and in particular gearing has been kept at a relatively low level for the property industry: currently gearing is 17.6%.
The Board recognises that, in common with all companies, it can only have limited control over many of the external risks which it faces.
The largest of such uncontrollable factors is the economic cycle which has a major impact on the demand for and price of property and the ability of the Group to achieve its strategic objectives.
The principal risks facing the Group are described in the following paragraphs together with the steps which are taken to mitigate and manage them.
External risks Economic outlook The last year has seen a move to growth in both the UK and USA.
However, the UK recovery is still at an early stage and not uniformly established across the whole country.
A move to recovery and the likelihood of increases in interest rates provides both opportunities and risks for the businesses of our commercial tenants and the demand for space.
We seek to mitigate and manage such risk by: Continuous monitoring of the economic outlook Continued maintenance of low gearing Rigorous tenant covenant checks including independent assessments for major lets.
In the case of smaller properties we undertake such checking as is appropriate Availability of finance on acceptable terms Reduced availability of finance for property at an acceptable cost for an appropriate period would adversely affect the Groups ability to undertake acquisitions and major schemes of redevelopment and refurbishment.
We seek to mitigate and manage this risk by: Monitoring funding trends and the development of banking regulations Sustaining relationships with our principal financing partners, both banks and other lending institutions Movements in currency rates of exchange With over 20% by value of the Groups property portfolio located in the USA the Group is at risk from adverse movements in the sterling dollar exchange rate.
We mitigate and manage this risk by: Funding US assets by US dollar borrowings and local retained earnings.
This means that the impact of movements in the exchange rate is limited to accounting adjustments in the Groups consolidated accounts.
The overall impact on the results for the current year is immaterial: an Above: Entrance of accounting loss of 9.9 million arises in reserves on the re-translation of the opening net book Africa House, value of assets in the USA 70 Kingsway, London WC2 Page 6 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 7 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Regulation Regulations aimed at the control of residential rental levels or shorthold tenancy arrangements could have an adverse impact on the Group.
Similarly increased regulation on environmental matters could impose additional costs.
We seek to mitigate and manage this risk by: Careful monitoring of developments in legislation with the help of our professional advisors Catastrophic events The operations of the Group could be adversely affected by a significant catastrophe such as fire, cyber-attack, civil disturbance or terrorism which resulted in the loss of any of our principal offices and the records therein.
We seek to mitigate and manage this risk by: Physical building security Fireproof storage of leases and other documents of title Dispersal of business critical IT systems Internal risks Regional concentration in UK portfolio Within the UK the majority of our properties are situated in and around the London area.
In recent years the increase in value of our UK portfolio has been almost entirely derived from the London area which has enjoyed a period of well publicised growth.
Clearly this has been a great benefit to the Group but, until growth returns to the country as a whole, any slowdown in the London market could significantly reduce the net annual revaluation uplifts in the UK portfolio.
Changes in aggregate property value have a direct impact on the net worth of the Group.
We seek to mitigate and manage this risk by: Continuing to invest in the USA Regular monitoring of the property market for opportunities not just in London but throughout the UK Regular professional revaluations by our independent surveyors in the UK and USA Acquisitions The Group seeks well priced acquisitions which will meet the strategic objective of adding long term, low risk growth in net asset value.
There is a risk that an inappropriate or ill-judged acquisition could destroy value.
We seek to mitigate and manage this risk by: Rigorous pre-acquisition screening of all buying opportunities Tenant default Tenant default constitutes a risk to income and, ultimately, to capital value.
The multi-tenanted nature of the portfolio, with rental income derived from numerous properties, provides a natural measure of protection against the risk of individual default.
In addition, we seek to mitigate and manage this risk by: Above: Atrium Seeking tenants with strong covenants detail of Africa Careful monitoring of tenants showing signs of financial stress House Page 7 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 8 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report continued Development The Group continues to seek development opportunities principally from within the portfolio and also elsewhere.
Development provides an opportunity to enhance income and net asset values but carries risk as to planning, construction timing, costs and letting.
We seek to mitigate and manage these risks by: Rigorous screening of all development opportunities including external professional advice and, where appropriate, market research Focusing on a limited number of developments at any one time Close monitoring of active developments People The Group relies heavily on the involvement of key directors in both strategic and day-to-day affairs.
Loss of this involvement could be disruptive to business.
We have sought to mitigate and manage this risk by: The recent appointment of two new directors from the next generation of the Freshwater family Page 8 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 9 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Left: decoration of the atrium and below: the outdoor terrace on the 8th floor of Africa House, 70 Kingsway, London WC2 Page 9 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 10 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report continued Investment properties A professional valuation of all of the Groups properties was carried out at 31 March 2014.
The UK properties were valued by Colliers International, Chartered Surveyors.
In the USA, properties were valued by Joseph J. Blake and Associates Inc. and Metropolitan Valuation Services Inc. both of which are Certified General Real Estate Appraisers.
The table below shows a summary of the valuation of our investment property at 31March 2014: Valuation Percentage March 2014 change m in year Commercial property UK 694.4 8.7% USA 42.3 -5.8% Residential property UK 524.0 12.9% USA 289.5 10.3% Total 1,550.2 9.9% The reduction in the value of USA commercial property results from the re-categorisation of an office building in East Chase Street, Baltimore from commercial to residential, following the completion of its conversion during the year to create 56 high quality residential units.
The percentage changes shown above are very largely due to net surpluses arising on revaluation but also include movements attributable to purchases, capital expenditure, disposals and currency rates of exchange.
This is shown in the analysis given below: 2014 2013 m m Opening valuation 1,407.5 1,254.1 New acquisitions 26.1 37.2 Additions to existing properties 21.7 20.5 Disposals 1.8 0.6 1,453.5 1,311.2 Revaluation gain 119.6 82.7 Foreign exchange loss gain 26.4 13.6 Closing valuation 1,546.7 1,407.5 In this table and in the financial statements, the total valuation of 1,546.7 million 2013 1,407.5 million has been reduced by an amount of 3.5 million 2013 3.1 million relating to lease incentives, as required by accounting standards see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Work on the extensive refurbishment of Africa House, London, WC2 was completed in the year and has resulted in a substantial uplift in value.
The building has recently been let to a single tenant and we anticipate that this will produce a further increase in value.
The well-publicised rise in residential property values in the London area, particularly Central London, has also contributed significantly.
These uplifts have been partially offset by weakness in some provincial commercial properties.
Overall the net UK valuation surplus is 9.0% 2013 5.5%.
Above: A. C. Moore The overall growth in the value of our USA properties at 7.4% has been a little lower than that of the Arts & Crafts, previous year which benefited from significant value increases in New York 2013 10.2%.
This year Lycoming Circle the growth in New York has cooled somewhat but the rest of the portfolio has shown steady growth.
Mall, Pennsylvania, In the USA we still see opportunities to acquire well priced residential property with the potential USA for value enhancement through careful management.
Towards the end of the year we acquired Bucks Page 10 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 11 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Landing Apartments in Warminster, a suburb of Philadelphia, PA for an adjusted cost of US $41.6 million.
This consists of 456 units arranged in 9 three storey blocks in a garden apartment complex.

The result includes a net valuation gain of 119.6 million arising on investment properties 2013 82.7 million.
The table below shows the performance of our core rental business before and after valuation movements: 2014 2013 m m Total rental and related income from investment property 112.2 111.0 Property operating expenses 68.8 67.0 Net rental and related income from investment property 43.4 44.0 Profit on disposals of investment property 11.3 6.6 Administrative expenses 10.5 10.9 Net operating profit before net valuation gains 44.2 39.7 Net valuation gains on investment property 119.6 82.7 Net financing income expense 0.7 10.7 Profit before taxation 164.5 111.7 In the UK we have seen the increased rental income on assured shorthold tenancies and new commercial lettings offset by vacancies in some provincial commercial properties.
There has also been some slowdown, primarily outside the London area, in the rate of re-letting vacant residential units.
We are continuously expending significant sums on modernising older residential properties and we intend that this refurbishment and re-letting programme should continue.
It is anticipated that this programme will produce worthwhile increases in future residential rental income.
The net effect of these factors has been to hold UK rental income at 64.9 million compared to 65.0 million in 2013.
In the USA most properties have seen rental growth and this combined with some improved lettings and the acquisition of Bucks Landing Apartments late in the year gave an increase of 0.8 million.
As in recent years, the profits on disposals are derived from leasehold extensions and enfranchisement in the UK.

However, fair value movements have generated a surplus of 11.1 million 2013 0.3 million loss reflecting market expectations of increases in interest rates.
Earnings per share This year has seen continued growth in earnings per share which now stands at 9.19.
10 8 6 4 2 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Underlying profit The profit reported in the financial statements has for some years included property revaluation movements and fair value adjustments to financial instruments.
In addition to this measure of performance we also focus on underlying profits which do not include these valuation items.
Underlying profits for the last two years are set out below: 2014 2013 m m Profit before tax per the income statement 164.5 111.7 Property valuation surplus 119.6 82.7 Financial instruments fair value adjustments 11.1 0.3 Adjustment to measurement of disposal profits 1.2 0.4 Underlying profit before tax 35.0 29.7 Underlying profit represents that element of our reported results which has actually been realised and is not dependent on valuation judgements.
It represents the performance of our core rental business together with disposal profits which tend to fluctuate from year to year.
It is our underlying profit which generates the cash we use to re-invest in the business and to pay dividends and taxes.
Gearing Gearing, the ratio between our borrowings and the value of our total assets, is 17.6% 2013 18.9% for the Group as a whole.
In the UK the ratio is 9.2% whilst in the USA, where each property is financed separately on a ring-fenced basis, it is 46.0%.
It has long been fundamental to our strategic approach to avoid the higher level of risk which is associated with excessive levels of gearing.
Above: 30 Kensington It is Group policy to maintain cash deposits and undrawn facilities at levels which will enable a swift Church Street, reaction when opportunities arise.
At 31 March 2014 cash deposits amounted to 59.1 million London W8 2013 63.5 million and undrawn facilities at 35.0 million 2013 20.0 million.

Shareholders funds have grown in recent years as follows: 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Dividend The proposed total dividend for the year of 82p per share represents an increase of 3.8% 2013 79p.
Outlook As the recovery in the UK economy becomes more established over the coming months we would hope to see an upturn in the demand for business space.
Whilst there have been reports that the London residential property market may be cooling a little, these have also been accompanied by reports of improvement in the rest of the UK.
Commercial property in smaller provincial towns and cities is likely to continue to suffer from a basic lack of demand and increased vacancy rates.
An ongoing challenge over the coming years will be to establish revenue generative uses for such properties.
The successful letting of Africa House, London, WC2 will produce a worthwhile increase in the rent roll for UK commercial properties.
In the next year we will continue to progress a number of significant schemes of redevelopment which are currently under consideration.
In the USA, the economic recovery is better established, although not immune from temporary setbacks such as was experienced in the first quarter of 2014.
We anticipate a continuation of recent conditions with steady rent rises across the portfolio.
The immediate focus in the USA will be on completing the letting of the residential units created in East Chase Street, Baltimore and work to enhance the rental value of the newly acquired Bucks Landing Apartments in Philadelphia.
Employees As mentioned above, day-to-day activities are outsourced to management companies who are responsible for the provision of the services of the staff on which we rely to run the business.
As part of the arrangements with the management companies in the UK, those individuals engaged on the Groups affairs hold joint employment contracts but the management companies retain sole responsibility for setting recruitment, employment, training, health and safety, diversity and human rights policies for their staff.
Whilst the Group supports and encourages good practice in all of these areas, detailed responsibility for the establishment and execution of such policies lies with the Above: management companies.
As a result, this report does not contain the kind of information mentioned Conduit House, in The Companies Act 2006 s414C 7 b ii and iii.
Greenwich, London SE10 Page 14 million 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 163284 Daejan Holdings Plc R&A 2014 Pt1 23 07 2014 14:05 Page 15 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 So far as health and safety is concerned, the Board recognises the importance of ensuring that our properties provide a safe and healthy environment for all users.
With this in mind the Board has requested that the management companies ensure that: All its employees receive appropriate training in the identification and management of health and safety risks.
Every employee is required to be familiar with health and safety policies and has responsibility for ensuring that they are followed in their area of work Regular cyclical risk assessments are undertaken by external consultants on all properties for which the Group has responsibility.
A dedicated team is tasked with resolving issues raised by such assessments and with monitoring policy compliance The Board receives an annual presentation to ensure that awareness of the importance of this issue continues at the highest level within the Group.
All Directors of the Company are male and no new recruitment to the Board is planned which would cause this to change in the near future.
Community The Group has long recognised the importance of supporting the communities in which we operate.
Many companies encourage and facilitate their employees to donate their time and efforts to community projects: because our staffing is outsourced this route is not available to us.
Our support therefore takes the following forms: Donations, largely to educational charities: this year the donations amounted to 150,000 2013 150,000 Dividends on donated shares: following the donation some years ago to charities of shares representing 6.3% of the capital of the Company, dividend payments in the year of 919,000 2013 785,000 have passed to charitable companies Environment As mentioned above, all the staff engaged in the business and who control our buildings are provided by management companies.
We do not have responsibility for the greenhouse gas emissions related to the employment of those people.
The green house gas emissions arising from our let properties are the responsibility of our tenants.
In consequence, we have no disclosures to make in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and therefore this report does not contain information of the kind mentioned in the Companies Act 2006 s414C 7 b i.
However, when we undertake new developments or major schemes of refurbishment we strive to achieve the highest environmental standards consistent with the nature of the building and the scheme being undertaken.
For example the Africa House scheme which was completed during the year achieved a BREEAM excellent rating and included environmental features such as a bio-mass boiler, rainwater harvesting, bio-diverse planting and facilities to encourage cycling to work.
The scope for enhancing the environmental standards across the majority of our properties is limited.
In the main they were constructed before the advent of modern standards and it would be neither practically nor economically feasible to undertake a complete upgrade to meet modern requirements.
However, we do take the opportunities which arise each year as part of programmes of repair and refurbishment to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and the plant therein.
