Gross margin in both regions benefited from the Groups procurement initiative.
In Poland gross margin was also helped by increased sales of higher margin own label products.
GROUP OUTLOOK SIG anticipates that trading conditions will remain variable across the Groups countries of operation in 2015, with continued good growth in the UK & Ireland and uncertainty persisting in Mainland Europe.
While the Group also notes the continuing weakening of the Euro and potential adverse translational effect on profit, it expects this headwind to be partially offset by lower fuel costs.
With continued scope for self-help through market outperformance and the Strategic Initiatives, SIG is confident of achieving further progress this year, although strong H1 comparators mean that this will be weighted towards the second half.
