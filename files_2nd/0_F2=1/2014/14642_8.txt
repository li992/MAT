Specialist Care Centre Bristol BROADENING ACCESS TO SPECIALIST TREATMENT Our 13 million Bristol Specialist Care Centre is the first of a planned nationwide network offering diagnostics, radiotherapy and ongoing care for cancer patients.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Every two minutes, someone in the UK is diagnosed with cancer.
The NHS provides treatment for a wide range of cancers, but the incidence of cancer, and the demand for treatment, continues to rise.
We already work with Cancer Partners UK in the running of four specialist centres and offer chemotherapy in 21 of our 39 hospitals, but, in 2014, we opened our first wholly owned, purpose-built, radiotherapy centre, close to our hospital in Bristol.
The Specialist Care Centre hosts a state-of-the-art Linear Accelerator LinAc, offering Intensity Modulated, Volumetric Modulated Arc therapy, and Image Guided Radiotherapy treatment.
Its success shows that private provision can play a key role in the future of UK cancer treatment.
In December 2014, we announced plans for our second cancer treatment centre, in Great Baddow near Chelmsford, Essex.
The facility will house two LinAcs, a wide-bore CT scanner, consultant offices and consulting rooms, and an eight bay chemotherapy suite.

Radiotherapy is a highly effective way of treating cancer, yet the UK trails the rest of Europe in its use and it remains relatively undersupplied in the NHS, with just 5.2 LinAcs per million of population.
