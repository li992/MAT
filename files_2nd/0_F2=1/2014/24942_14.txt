HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 256 Appendix to Capital Capital management Audited Approach and policy Our approach to capital management is driven by our strategic and organisational requirements, taking into account the regulatory, economic and commercial environment in which we operate.
Pre-tax return on risk-weighted assets RoRWA is an operational metric by which the global businesses are managed on a day-to-day basis.
The metric combines return on equity and regulatory capital efficiency objectives.
It is our objective to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our six filters framework, exceeding both consolidated and local regulatory capital requirements at all times.
Our policy on capital management is underpinned by a capital management framework which enables us to manage our capital in a consistent manner.
The framework, which is approved by the GMB annually, incorporates a number of different capital measures including market capitalisation, invested capital, economic capital and regulatory capital.
Given that CRD IV has been in effect since 1 January 2014, during 2014 we managed our internal capital ratio target on an end point CRD IV CET1 basis of greater than 10%.
We have since reviewed this and in 2015 expect to manage group capital to meet a medium-term target for return on equity of more than 10%.
This is modelled on CET1 ratio on an end point basis in the range of 12% to 13%.
Capital measures market capitalisation is the stock market value of HSBC: invested capital is the equity capital invested in HSBC by our shareholders, adjusted for certain reserves and goodwill previously amortised or written off: economic capital is the internally calculated capital requirement which we deem necessary to support the risks to which we are exposed: and regulatory capital is the capital which we are required to hold in accordance with the rules established by the PRA for the consolidated Group and by our local regulators for individual Group companies.
Our assessment of capital adequacy is aligned to our assessment of risks, including: credit, market, operational, interest rate risk in the banking book, pensions, insurance, structural foreign exchange risk and residual risks.
Stress testing In addition to our internal stress tests, the Group is subject to supervisory stress testing in many jurisdictions.
Supervisory requirements are increasing in frequency and in the granularity with which the results are required.
These exercises include the programmes of the PRA, the FRB, the EBA, the ECB and the HKMA, as well as stress tests undertaken in other jurisdictions.
We take into account the results of all such regulatory stress testing when assessing our internal capital requirements.
Risks to capital Outside the stress-testing framework, a list of top and emerging risks is regularly evaluated for their effect on our CET1 capital ratio.
In addition, other risks may be identified which have the potential to affect our RWAs and or capital position.
These risks are also included in the evaluation of risks to capital.
The downside or upside scenarios are assessed against our capital management objectives and mitigating actions are assigned as necessary.
The responsibility for global capital allocation principles and decisions rests with the GMB.
Through our internal governance processes, we seek to maintain discipline over our investment and capital allocation decisions and seek to ensure that returns on investment meet the Groups management objectives.
Our strategy is to allocate capital to businesses and entities on the basis of their ability to achieve established RoRWA objectives and their regulatory and economic capital requirements.
Risk-weighted asset targets RWA targets for our global businesses are established in accordance with the Groups strategic direction and risk appetite, and approved through the Groups annual planning process.
As these targets are deployed to lower levels of management, action plans for implementation are developed.
These may include growth strategies: active portfolio management: restructuring: business and or customer-level reviews: RWA accuracy and allocation initiatives and risk mitigation.
Our capital management process is articulated in the annual Group capital plan which forms part of the Annual Operating Plan that is approved by the Board.
Business performance against RWA targets is monitored through regular reporting to the Group ALCO.
The management of capital deductions is also addressed in the RWA monitoring framework through additional notional charges for these items.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 257 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Report of the Directors: Capital continued Appendix to Capital Analysis is undertaken within the RWA monitoring framework to identify the key drivers of movements in the position, such as book size and book quality.
Particular attention is paid to identifying and segmenting items within the day-to-day control of the business and those items that are driven by changes in risk models or regulatory methodology.
Capital generation HSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary.
These investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings own capital issuance and profit retention.
As part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a prudent balance between the composition of its capital and its investment in subsidiaries.
Capital measurement and allocation Unaudited The PRA supervises HSBC on a consolidated basis and therefore receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the Group as a whole.
Individual banking subsidiaries are directly regulated by their local banking supervisors, who set and monitor their capital adequacy requirements.
In 2013, we calculated capital at a Group level using the Basel II framework as amended for CRD III, commonly known as Basel 2.5, and also estimated capital on an end point CRD IV basis.
From 1 January 2014, our capital at Group level is calculated under CRD IV and supplemented by PRA rules to effect the transposition of directive requirements.
Our policy and practice in capital measurement and allocation at Group level is underpinned by the CRD IV rules.
However, local regulators are at different stages of implementation and some local reporting is still on a Basel I basis, notably in the US for the reporting of RWAs for some institutions during 2014.
In most jurisdictions, non-banking financial subsidiaries are also subject to the supervision and capital requirements of local regulatory authorities.
The Basel III framework, similarly to Basel II, is structured around three pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review process and market discipline.
The CRD IV legislation implemented Basel III in the EU and, in the UK, the PRA rulebook CRR Firms Instrument 2013 transposed the various national discretions under the CRD IV legislation into UK law.
The CRD IV and PRA legislation came into force on 1 January 2014.
Regulatory capital For regulatory purposes, our capital base is divided into three main categories, namely common equity tier 1, additional tier 1 and tier 2, depending on their characteristics.
Common equity tier 1 capital is the highest quality form of capital, comprising shareholders equity and related noncontrolling interests subject to limits.
Under CRD IV various capital deductions and regulatory adjustments are made against these items which are treated differently for the purposes of capital adequacy these include deductions for goodwill and intangible assets, deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts under IRB, holdings of capital securities of financial sector entities and surplus defined benefit pension fund assets.
Additional tier 1 capital comprises eligible non-common equity capital securities and any related share premium: it also includes qualifying securities issued by subsidiaries subject to certain limits.
Holdings of additional tier 1 securities of financial sector entities are deducted.
Tier 2 capital comprises eligible capital securities and any related share premium and qualifying tier 2 capital securities issued by subsidiaries subject to limits.
Holdings of tier 2 capital securities of financial sector entities are deducted.
Pillar 1 capital requirements Pillar 1 covers the capital resources requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit risk includes counterparty credit risk and securitisation requirements.
These requirements are expressed in terms of RWAs.
Credit risk capital requirements CRD IV applies three approaches of increasing sophistication to the calculation of Pillar 1 credit risk capital requirements.
The most basic, the standardised approach, requires banks to use external credit ratings to determine the risk weightings applied to rated counterparties.
Other counterparties are grouped into broad categories and standardised risk weightings are applied to these categories.
The next level, the internal ratings-based IRB foundation approach, allows banks to calculate their credit risk capital requirements on the basis of their internal assessment of a counterpartys probability of default PD, but their estimates of exposure at default EAD and loss given default LGD are subject to standard supervisory parameters.
Finally, the IRB advanced approach allows banks to use their own internal assessment in both determining PD and quantifying EAD and LGD.
The capital resources requirement, which is intended to cover unexpected losses, is derived from a formula specified in the regulatory rules which incorporates PD, LGD, EAD and other variables such as maturity and correlation.
Expected losses under the IRB approaches are calculated by multiplying PD by EAD and LGD.
Expected losses are deducted from capital to the extent that they exceed total accounting impairment allowances.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 258 For credit risk we have adopted the IRB advanced approach for the majority of our portfolios, with the remainder on either IRB foundation or standardised approaches.
Under our CRD IV rollout plans, a number of our Group companies and portfolios are in transition to advanced IRB approaches.
At the end of 2014, global models for sovereigns, banks, large corporates and portfolios in most of Europe, Asia and North America were on advanced IRB approaches.
Others remain on the standardised or foundation approaches pending definition of local regulations or model approval, or under exemptions from IRB treatment.
In some instances, regulators have allowed us to transition from advanced to standardised approaches for a limited number of portfolios.
Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk CCR arises for OTC derivatives and securities financing transactions.
It is calculated in both the trading and non-trading books and is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may default before completing the satisfactory settlement of the transaction.
Three approaches to calculating CCR and determining exposure values are defined by CRD IV: standardised, mark-to-market and internal model method.
These exposure values are used to determine capital requirements under one of the credit risk approaches: standardised, IRB foundation and IRB advanced.
We use the mark-to-market and internal model method approaches for CCR.
Our longer-term aim is to migrate more positions from the mark-to-market to the internal model method approach.
In addition, CRD IV applies a capital requirement for CVA risk.
Where we have both specific risk VaR approval and internal model method approval for a product, the CVA VaR approach has been used to calculate the CVA capital charge.
Where we do not hold both approvals, the standardised approach has been applied.
Securitisation Securitisation positions are held in both the trading and non-trading books.
For non-trading book securitisation positions, CRD IV specifies two methods for calculating credit risk requirements, the standardised and the IRB approaches.
Both rely on the mapping of rating agency credit ratings to risk weights, which range from 7% to 1,250%.
Within the IRB approach, we use the ratings-based method for the majority of our non-trading book securitisation positions, and the internal assessment approach for unrated liquidity facilities and programme-wide enhancements for asset-backed securitisations.
The majority of securitisation positions in the trading book are treated for capital purposes as if they are held in the non-trading book under the standardised or IRB approaches.
Other traded securitisation positions, known as correlation trading, are treated under an internal model approach approved by the PRA.
Market risk capital requirement The market risk capital requirement is measured using internal market risk models where approved by the PRA, or the standard rules of the EU Capital Requirement Regulation.
Our internal market risk models comprise VaR, stressed VaR and the incremental risk charge.
Since the sale of our correlation portfolio in September 2014, there is no market risk capital requirement associated with the comprehensive risk measure.
Operational risk capital requirement CRD IV includes a capital requirement for operational risk, again utilising three levels of sophistication.
The capital required under the basic indicator approach is a simple percentage of gross revenues, whereas under the standardised approach it is one of three different percentages of total operating income less insurance premiums allocated to each of eight defined business lines.
Both these approaches use an average of the last three financial years revenues.
Finally, the advanced measurement approach uses banks own statistical analysis and modelling of operational risk data to determine capital requirements.
We have adopted the standardised approach in determining our operational risk capital requirements.
Pillar 2 capital requirements We conduct an internal capital adequacy assessment process ICAAP to determine a forward looking assessment of our capital requirements given our business strategy, risk profile, risk appetite and capital plan.
This process incorporates the Groups risk management processes and governance framework.
A range of stress tests are applied to our base capital plan.
These, coupled with our economic capital framework and other risk management practices, are used to assess our internal capital adequacy requirements.
The ICAAP is examined by the PRA as part of its supervisory review and evaluation process, which occurs periodically to enable the regulator to define the individual capital guidance or minimum capital requirements for HSBC and our capital planning buffer where required.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 259 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Report of the Directors: Capital continued Appendix to Capital Pillar 3 disclosure requirements Pillar 3 of the Basel regulatory framework is related to market discipline and aims to make firms more transparent by requiring them to publish, at least annually, wide-ranging information on their risks and capital, and how these are managed.
Our Pillar 3 Disclosures 2014 are published on our website, www.
RWA movement by key driver basis of preparation and supporting notes Unaudited Credit risk drivers definitions and quantification The causal analysis of RWA movements splits the total movement in IRB RWAs into six drivers, described below.
The first four relate to specific, identifiable and measurable changes.
The remaining two, book size and book quality, are derived after accounting for movements in the first four specific drivers.
Foreign exchange movements This is the movement in RWAs as a result of changes in the exchange rate between the functional currency of the HSBC company owning each portfolio and US dollars, being our presentation currency for consolidated reporting.
Our structural foreign exchange exposures are managed with the primary objective of ensuring, where practical, that our consolidated capital ratios and the capital ratios of individual banking subsidiaries are largely protected from the effect of changes in exchange rates.
This is usually achieved by ensuring that, for each subsidiary bank, the ratio of structural exposures in a given currency to risk-weighted assets denominated in that currency is broadly equal to the capital ratio of the subsidiary in question.
We hedge structural foreign exchange exposures only in limited circumstances.
Acquisitions and disposals This is the movement in RWAs as a result of the disposal or acquisition of business operations.
This can be whole businesses or parts of a business.
The movement in RWAs is quantified based on the credit risk exposures as at the end of the month preceding a disposal or following an acquisition.
Model updates New updated models RWA movements arising from the implementation of new models and from changes to existing parameter models are allocated to this driver.
This figure will also include changes which arise following review of modelling assumptions.
Where a model recalibration reflects an update to more recent performance data, the resulting RWA changes are not assigned here, but instead reported under book quality.
RWA changes are estimated based on the impact assessments made in the testing phase prior to implementation.
These values are used to simulate the effect of new or updated models on the portfolio at the point of implementation, assuming there were no major changes in the portfolio from the testing phase to implementation phase.
Portfolios moving onto IRB approach Where a portfolio moves from the standardised approach to the IRB approach, the RWA movement by key driver statement shows the increase in IRB RWAs, but does not show the corresponding reduction in standardised approach RWAs as its scope is limited to IRB only.
The movement in RWAs is quantified at the date at which the IRB approach is applied, and not during the testing phase as with a new updated model.
Methodology and policy Internal regulatory updates This captures the effect on RWAs of changing the internal treatment of exposures.
This may include, but is not limited to, a portfolio or a part of one moving from an existing IRB model onto a standardised model, identification of netting and credit risk mitigation.
External regulatory updates This specifies the effect of additional or changing regulatory requirements.
This includes, but is not limited to, regulatoryprescribed changes to the RWA calculation.
The movement in RWAs is quantified by comparing the RWAs calculated for that portfolio under the old and the new requirements.
Book size RWA movements attributed to this driver are those we would expect to experience for the given movement in exposure, as measured by EAD, assuming a stable risk profile.
These RWA movements arise in the normal course of business, such as growth in credit exposures or reduction in book size from run-offs and write-offs.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 260 The RWA movement is quantified as follows: RWA and EAD changes captured in the four drivers above are excluded from the total movements to create an adjusted movement in EAD and RWA for the period.
The average RWA to EAD percentage is calculated for the opening position and is applied to the adjusted movement in EAD.
This results in an estimated book size RWA movement based on the assumption that the EAD to RWA percentage is constant throughout the period.
As the calculation relies on averaging, the output is dependent upon the degree of portfolio aggregation and the number of discrete time periods for which the calculation is undertaken.
For each quarter of 2014 this calculation was performed for each HSBC company with an IRB portfolio by global businesses, split by the main Basel categories of credit exposures, as described in the table below: Basel categories of IRB credit exposures within HSBC Central governments and central banks Corporate foundation IRB Qualifying revolving retail exposures Institutions Other advanced IRB Retail SME Corporate advanced IRB Retail mortgages Other retail The total of the results is shown in book size within the RWA movement by key driver table.
Book quality This represents RWA movements resulting from changes in the underlying credit quality of customers.
These are caused by changes to IRB risk parameters which arise from actions such as, but not limited to, model recalibration, change in counterparty external rating, or the influence of new lending on the average quality of the book.
The change in RWAs attributable to book quality is calculated as the balance of RWA movements after taking account of all drivers described above.
The RWA movement by key driver statement includes only movements which are calculated under the IRB approach.
Certain classes of credit risk exposure are treated as capital deductions and therefore reductions are not shown in this statement.
If the treatment of a credit risk exposure changes from RWA to capital deduction in the period, then only the reduction in RWAs would appear in the RWA movement by key driver tables.
In this instance, a reduction in RWAs does not necessarily indicate an improvement in the capital position.
Counterparty risk drivers definitions and quantification The RWA movement by key driver for counterparty credit risk calculates the credit risk drivers 5 and 6 at a more granular level, by using transaction level details provided by regional sites.
Foreign exchange movement is not a reported layer for counterparty risk drivers, as there is cross currency netting across the portfolio.
Market risk drivers definitions and quantification The RWA movement by key driver for market risk combines the credit risk drivers 5 and 6 into a single driver called Movements in risk levels.
Leverage ratio: basis of preparation Unaudited The numerator, capital measure, is calculated using the end point definition of tier 1 capital applicable from 1 January 2022, which is set out in the final CRD IV rules.
This is supplemented with the EBAs Own Funds RTS to the extent that these have been published in the EUs Official Journal of the European Commission as at the reporting date, as well as making reference to the PRA Rulebook where appropriate.
The denominator, exposure measure, is calculated on the basis of the Leverage Ratio Delegated Act adopted by the European Commission in October 2014 and published in the EUs Official Journal in January 2015, which is aligned to the Basel 2014 leverage ratio framework.
This follows the same scope of regulatory consolidation used for the risk-based capital framework, which differs to the 2010 Basel text that required banks to include items using their accounting balance sheet.
The exposure measure generally follows the accounting value, adjusted as follows: on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures are included in the exposure measure net of specific provisions or accounting valuation adjustments e. g. accounting credit valuation adjustments : loans are not netted with deposits: the scope of netting for derivatives is extended to all scenarios where we would recognise a netting agreement for regulatory purposes: the scope for offsetting of cash variation margin against derivative assets and liabilities is extended subject to certain additional conditions including the requirement that the margin be exchanged daily and be in the same currency as the currency of settlement of the derivative contract.
For these purposes we have considered this to include any currency HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 261 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Report of the Directors: Capital Corporate Governance Appendix to Capital Letter from the Group Chairman that can be used to make payments under the derivative contract, the governing qualifying master netting agreement, or its associated credit support annex.
Such offsetting is not permitted under the Basel 2010 text: the approach to netting securities financing transactions SFTs is aligned to that permitted under IFRS, though for the purposes of the leverage ratio there is an additional counterparty credit risk add-on to the extent that an SFT is under collateralised.
This represents a stricter requirement compared with the Basel 2010 text: there is an add-on for potential future exposure for both OTC and exchange-traded derivatives: the notional amount of written credit derivatives is included in the exposure measure, subject to offsets for purchased protection.
This represents a stricter requirement compared with the Basel 2010 text: off-balance sheet items are converted into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion factors CCFs.
Depending on the risk category of the exposure a CCF of 10%, 20%, 50% or 100% is applied.
In contrast, the Basel 2010 text requires that off-balance sheet items are included in full except for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by HSBC without prior notice, where only 10% of the exposures are included: and items deducted from the end point tier 1 capital such as goodwill and intangible assets, are excluded.
