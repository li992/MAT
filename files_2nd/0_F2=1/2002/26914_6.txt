Investment Managers Report continued continuing to expand its global presence with its distinctive brand.
We believe the valuation of Orange currently more than discounts the risks associated with its debt laden parent, France Telecom.
We have reduced holdings in companies that we felt were fully valued, such as LOreal, the French personal products company, Vinci, the construction company, and Bank of Ireland.
Outlook Lack of confidence amongst companies and consumers in continental Europe and the reluctance of the ECB to lower interest rates makes a change in the downwards momentum in stock markets unlikely in the short-term.
The forced selling by insurers looking to secure their asset bases in order to remain in business continues, but many of these players have now materially curtailed their exposure to equities.
Crucially, European equities are looking attractively valued on most measures, particularly relative to history and to bonds.
In the short-term, given the lack of visibility on the timing of a recovery in investor confidence, we remain overweight in the pharmaceuticals, energy and food sectors.
We are looking to add selectively to investments in cyclical growth sectors where we believe structural momentum should be restored in an environment of low economic growth and where valuations are at historically low levels.
The Company is underweight the financials sector which continues to experience pressure on earnings in the face of weak capital markets and rising bad debts.
