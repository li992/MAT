Television commercials are discussed, analysed and written about.
They are part of our popular culture.
The power of television lies in the combination of its impact and coverage.
And ITV1 remains a potent force in the UK.
Our advertisers know that when they need to get their message seen - whether its to launch a product, roll out a service or just keep ahead of the competition, ITV1 will deliver what they need for healthy and thriving brands.
We can reach one third of the country every night and almost 90 per cent inside a week.
We have invested in programmes, strengthened our schedule and built up the UKs fastest growing new channel, ITV2.
Our clients include Unilever, Proctor & Gamble and the Government and we are working with them to achieve the fastest and most effective delivery of their messages.
Brands that maintain advertising budgets, particularly on TV, outperform competitors that dont.
