These special dividends distort the flow of income each year, but they are by their nature unsustainable.
We therefore pay particular attention to the regular underlying dividend flows.
Over the last year, despite a number of prominent cuts, most notably from BT, these flows grew and we also benefited from the purchase of some good quality preference shares.
At the year end the underlying net yield on our net assets, which are 95% invested in equities, stood at 2.1%.
Income from our mineral interests blossomed, contributing over 0.75m, of which 80% came from gas royalties, boosted by higher prices in the US and by increased production from previously unexploited coal areas.
Expenses increased by 10.5% mainly due to further recruitment of investment staff, and the total expense ratio increased to 0.19% of net assets, or 0.13% after tax relief.

Together with the healthy state of our reserves, this gives us confidence that a progressive dividend policy can be maintained without changing our conservative accounting practices or reducing the quality of our portfolio.
