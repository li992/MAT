4 Comparison of the Companys performance is made with the S&P 500 Composite Index in sterling terms.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not follow or track this index and therefore there will be a degree of divergence between the Companys performance and that of the stated index.
5 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments expressed as a percentage of average shareholders funds over the year.
6 In addition, a performance fee is payable by the Company.
Full details of the management and performance fees are given on page 22.
7 Actual gearing means total investments expressed as a percentage of ordinary shareholders funds and therefore takes into account the Companys current liquidity and treats holdings in liquidity stocks as cash.
