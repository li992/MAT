maturity dates in order to ensure continuity of funding.
The Group currently manages its interest rate exposure by obtaining the appropriate form of finance for the underlying assets.
Equity retained profits and long-term debt are primarily used to finance our goodwill, land bank, fixed assets, investment properties and commercial developments.
Fixed rate term borrowings are used to partly finance our investment properties in order to match fixed rental income and tenure of lease and also to finance our land bank.
Short-term borrowings are primarily required to finance net current assets other than land bank and commercial developments and are therefore kept at floating rate.
The Group will also use derivatives to manage interest rate exposure but only if deemed commercially appropriate and combined with underlying borrowings.
