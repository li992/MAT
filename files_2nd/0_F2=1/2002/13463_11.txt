c Rio Tinto increased its stake in Coal & Allied from 72.7 per cent to 75.7 per cent on 17 September 2002. d Resources at Mount Pleasant have decreased as a result of reclassification in order to meet JORC requirements.
e On 14 March 2002, Coal & Allied completed the sale of its interest in Narama and Ravensworth.
Coal & Allied sold its interest in the Moura coal mine with effect from 24 May 2002. f Measured resources at Gokwe North have increased as a result of the reclassification of marketable reserves in order to more accurately meet the requirements of the JORC code.
g Resources at Decker have changed following re-assessment.
h The increase in resources at the Blair Athol mine follows a resource review in 2002. i Resources at Kestrel have decreased following a review of operations.
j At Escondida, changes in the mineral resources are a result of additional drilling and revision of the geological model, geostatistical evaluation, grade interpretation methodology, change in resource classification scheme and addition of new material types.
Previously reported low grade sulphide material has been renamed low grade float.
Sulphide material with secondary copper mineralisation is declared for the first time and is termed low grade leach.
k At Escondida Norte, changes in the mineral resources are a result of additional drilling and revision of the geological model, geostatistical evaluation, grade interpretation methodology and changes in resource classification scheme.
l Resources at Grasberg have decreased as a result of the transfer of material to reserves.
m Open pit and underground resources at Northparkes have decreased following mine planning changes.
n Rio Tintos interest in the Argyle Diamond mine increased from 99.8 per cent to 100 per cent on 29 April 2002, following the purchase of the outstanding units in the Western Australian Diamond Trust.
o The increase in resources at Cortez Pipeline reflects the inclusion of the Pediment deposit for the first time.
p Resources at Kelian have decreased as a result of development of a new resource model and changes to the final pit design.
q At Lihir, resources have increased following additional drilling and significant remodelling of the West Lienetz and K Pit areas.
r Resources at Morro do Ouro have decreased as a result of the transfer of material to reserves.
s Rio Tinto signed a non binding letter of intent on 15 January 2003 to sell its wholly owned Peak Gold Mine.
t Resources at Channar have increased as a result of changes to the resource classification.
u Resources at Paraburdoo have decreased as a result of the classification of the Eastern Range as a separate deposit.
v Resources at Mt Tom Price have increased as a result of additional drilling and the development of a new resource model.
The Mt Tom Price Marra Mamba resource has been transferred from the undeveloped resources category following development of an updated geological model.
w Resources at Nammuldi have changed as a result of quoting Marra Mamba and Detrital ores separately for the first time.
x Resources in this category consist of 32 separate deposits, 18 of which are wholly owned by Hamersley Iron.
Total undeveloped resources have substantially increased following the inclusion of previously unreported inferred mineral resources that have the potential to support an expanded product range.
y Rio Tinto increased its shareholding in Iron Ore Company of Canada from 56.1 per cent to 58.7 per cent on 20 December 2002. z Comprises resources at QIT-Fer et Titane Rio Tinto 100 per cent and Richards Bay Minerals RBM Rio Tinto 50 per cent.
aa Significant changes to the mineral resources at Rssing have resulted from the combination of several factors: inclusion of additional drilling information, changes in the estimation methodology, changes to the Ore reserve Mineral resource classification scheme, modified economic cut off parameters and changes to the pit limits due to economic and geotechnical factors.
