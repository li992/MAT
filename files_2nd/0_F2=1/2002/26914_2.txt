Blended benchmark of MSCI Europe Index up to 31 May 1999 and FTSE World Europe ex UK Index thereafter.
MSCI Europe Index, in sterling terms on a total return basis, is only available at month end: performance from 11 to 31 March 1994 has therefore been estimated.
Performance calculated using the base cost of the Companys ordinary shares and warrants for capital gains tax purposes, as the ordinary shares and warrants were not traded separately until 25 April 1994.
Despite the recent substantial fall in the diluted net asset value per share NAV there has been a 38.1% increase on a total return basis since the Companys launch to 30 September 2002, slightly behind the 40.1% increase in its benchmark on the same basis over the same period.
The return to initial shareholders comprising the share price, net dividends reinvested and warrants has been 12.7% since launch.
The difference is accounted for substantially by the discount at which the Companys shares have traded to diluted NAV which, on a total return basis, was 18.6% as at 30 September 2002 31 March 2002: 13.6%.
The increase in the level of discount is in line with that of the Companys peers.
As of 28 October 2002, the discount stood at 20.0%.
