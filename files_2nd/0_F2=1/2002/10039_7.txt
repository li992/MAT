12 ACQUISITIONS Acquisitions complement organic growth.
We buy companies that fasttrack product and market development in areas of strategic importance.
Last year acquisitions increased our range of engine sensors: added world class data acquisition units and air data computing to our pioneering flight instrumentation packages: and expanded our radio frequency cabling capability.
2003 has already seen Meggitt Defence Systems agree to add groundbased targetry to its aerial systems product offering and Meggitt Aerospace Equipment become the leading technology supplier of extreme environment valve applications, which are key contributors to engine efficiency in civil and military aviation and ground-based turbines.
