Group Overview New Product Development A key component of Celltechs strategy is the creation of substantial new value through the progression of its innovative development pipeline.
Celltechs financial strength and extensive clinical development capabilities are critical to maximising the value from this pipeline, since together they allow Celltech to pursue products to a later stage of development before considering partnering, thereby enhancing the returns the company can achieve.
Celltech also seeks commercial input from its pharmaceutical business at an early stage to ensure that the programmes are optimised to deliver a compelling commercial profile.
Partnering remains a key element of Celltechs strategy, in particular to access technical or commercial expertise that the company does not possess.
In addition, these collaborations help to manage the risk reward balance when pursuing a large portfolio of innovative products through R&D funding and milestone income.
In the current business environment, it is possible to enter into genuinely collaborative agreements, where Celltechs ongoing expert contribution continues to add value to the development of these products.
For Celltechs antibody-based products, its microbial manufacturing technology, underpinned by strategic manufacturing alliances, provides a very competitive cost structure, together with substantial flexibility in product scheduling.
The extensive progress with Celltechs innovative product pipeline is exemplified by its PEGylated anti-TNF antibody fragment CDP 870, being developed in collaboration with Pharmacia.
This product is expected to have a highly competitive profile in this rapidly-growing biologicals market.
It entered Phase III studies in rheumatoid arthritis in October 2002.
Celltech is also developing CDP 870 as a new treatment for Crohns disease.
