Remuneration report continued AUDITED INFORMATION Directors pension entitlements The Company operates a contributory pension scheme for executive Directors.
A pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service.
With the Companys consent, executive Directors may retire from age 50.
After age 58, Company consent to early retirement is not required.
Pensions are reduced in the event of early retirement.
Death-in-service cover is a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings.
In addition a spouses pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Director a spouses pension of 50% of the Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5%, above which increases are at the Trustees discretion.
