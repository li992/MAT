4 Comparison of the Companys performance is made with the FTSE All-Share Index.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not follow or track this index and therefore there may be a degree of divergence between the Companys performance and that of the benchmark index.
5 Calculated on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
6 Actual gearing means investments expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
7 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments and commissions which are treated as a separate capital item expressed as a percentage of average net assets over the year.
