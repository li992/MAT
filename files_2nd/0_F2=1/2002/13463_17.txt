Luzenac Group Rio Tinto: 99.9 per cent The Luzenac Group operates talc mines, including the worlds largest in south west France, and processing facilities in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK and the US.
The Three Springs talc mine and processing plant in Western Australia was acquired in September 2001.
The mine is capable of producing up to 200,000 tonnes of higher value talc annually and broadens Luzenacs product range to Asia Pacific markets.
Luzenac products are used internationally.
Principal uses are in paper, paint and plastics.
2002 operating performance Earnings in 2002 were US$15 million.
Luzenacs production in 2002 was five per cent higher than 2001 at 1.33 million tonnes, with the increase attributable to production from the acquisition of the Three Springs mine in Australia.
Sales volumes declined in Europe but revenues were maintained year on year, due to a favourable sales mix, with particular strength noted in coatings following customer re-formulations.
The North American markets were affected by weak economic conditions in the traditional paper and pulp markets, but a sustained recovery occurred in other applications, notably in polymers and coatings.
The Three Springs mine supported increased Asian sales.
New cost reduction programmes helped offset the earnings effect of weaker demand and costs associated with some mine and plant closures.
