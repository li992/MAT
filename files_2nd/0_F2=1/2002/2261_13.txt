Finance and treasury review Net debt equity Restructuring In August 2001 the company announced a business initiative with the objectives of releasing Percentage cash tied up in unproductive assets, improving cash generation and identifying restructuring 80 opportunities.
Programmes were implemented to divest some assets and to restructure and improve returns in the businesses being retained.
60 Divestments Proceeds of 39.0 million have been received in the year, in addition to the 41.2 million received last year, making a total of 80.2 million received to date.
Management now 40 expects further proceeds of some 30 million to be received in 2003.
Proceeds from divestments will cover the cash costs of restructuring.
20 Restructuring Costs of restructuring programmes amounting to 47.2 million have been charged this year, in addition to the 35.8 million charged in 2001.
The cost of restructuring this year 00001 02 includes 34.4 million related to the programmes announced in August 2001, which are now substantially complete with remaining costs of some 4 million expected to be charged in 2003.
Net debt capital employed These programmes have resulted in 1,516 job losses with some 100 more expected.
Further Percentage restructuring opportunities have been identified resulting in an additional cost of 12.8 million 40 charged this year.
Management expects the restructuring programmes to deliver efficiency and cost savings amounting to 55 million a year when completed, of which a run rate of 36 million has 30 already been achieved.
Operational efficiency Operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions have been identified.
20 These programmes were originally targeted to achieve further savings of some 50 million a year by the end of 2003, which has already been achieved.
Further opportunities for savings from 10 operational efficiencies in Industrial and Special Products have been identified.
0 00 01 02 Corporate transactions In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its process plant operations with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC.
The transaction was completed in September 2002.
The costs of 21.3 million for closing BOCs Process Plants business have been charged this year as an exceptional item.
Management expects cost savings to be worth some 15 million a year.
This transaction is also explained in note 2 b to the financial statements.
In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional agreement to merge their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan to form a combined company to be called Japan Air Gases.
Valuations undertaken as part of the proposed business combination have resulted in an exceptional write down of 21.2 million in the profit and loss account in 2002.
The transaction remains subject to approval by the Japanese competition authority.
It is expected that Japan Air Gases will achieve synergy benefits estimated at 26 million a year by 2005.
Pre-conditional offer for the Group As indicated last year, further costs associated with the pre-conditional offer for the Group were incurred during 2002.
These were 6.1 million for share option and other costs related to the retention of key employees.
All of the costs have been taken to the profit and loss account as exceptional items.
There are no further costs to come.

44 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Financing The Group has access to a range of funding.
Debt finance is raised by issuing bonds, commercial paper, other obligations to investors and through borrowings from banks.
As well as medium and long-term borrowings, the Group maintains short-term borrowings, principally in the form of commercial paper and bank borrowings.
The Group maintains US$420 million of committed multi-currency facilities with a group of relationship banks.
These facilities mature between 2002 and 2004 and provide back-up for the issue of commercial paper.
Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
Overall, net debt increased by 53.5 million as a result of a net cash outflow of 120.3 million offset by 25.0 million inflow from the issue of shares and 41.8 million for the effect of exchange rate and other movements.
In 2001, net debt decreased by 36.3 million as a result of a net cash outflow of 2.3 million offset by 16.9 million inflow from the issue of shares and 21.7 million for the effect of exchange rate and other movements.
During the year, borrowings by the parent company increased reflecting the companys effort to centralise its longer term funding needs.
The gearing ratio net debt including finance leases as a percentage of capital employed was 36.9 per cent in 2002 compared with 32.0 per cent in 2001 and 29.4 per cent in 2000.
The decline in the value of pension fund assets following the fall in world equity markets accounted for some three per cent of the increase in 2002.
The 2002 year end net debt equity ratio was 73.6 per cent, compared with 57.2 per cent in 2001 and 49.0 per cent in 2000.
As with the gearing ratio, the increase in the ratio in 2002 was mainly due to the decline in the value of pension fund assets.
The Group has access to a diverse range of debt finance including commercial paper, public bonds and bank borrowings which, it believes, will be available to meet long-term financing needs.
The Group has sufficient facilities to cover likely borrowing needs.
Management presently anticipates that capital expenditure in 2003 will be at a slightly higher level than in 2002 and will be covered by cash inflow from operating activities.
Management of financial risks The board of directors sets the treasury policies and objectives of the Group which include controls over the procedures used to manage currency, interest rate and credit risk.
The approach to managing risk is set out below.
This approach is expected to continue during the next financial year.
On a day-to-day basis, Group treasury carries out these policies, with regular review meetings with the Group finance director.
Specific and significant activities need approval from the finance committee, which includes any two directors of the company.
Currency risk The Group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, most of which are in currencies other than sterling.
Currency movements can therefore have a significant effect on the Groups balance sheet when translating these foreign currency assets into sterling.
In order to reduce this effect the Group manages its borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to hedge its foreign currency assets.
Where possible, hedging is done using direct borrowings in the same currency as the assets being hedged or through the use of other hedging methods such as currency swaps.
Group borrowings are currently held in a wide range of currencies and, after swaps, 86 per cent of net debt 2001: 88 per cent is denominated in the principal currencies affecting the Group: US dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, South African rand and sterling.
The aggregate of the notional principal values of currency swaps was 360.7 million 2001: 359.6 million spread over a range of currencies.
The fair value of such swaps is included in note 3 d i to the financial statements.
The balance sheets of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange for the year and any exchange difference is dealt with as a movement in reserves.
This is explained more fully in the accounting policy note on page 71.
The profit and loss accounts of overseas businesses are translated at average rates of exchange and this translation impact directly affects the profit and loss account of the Group.
The Group manages its currency flows to minimise currency transaction exchange risk and forward contracts are used as appropriate to hedge net currency flows and selected individual transactions.
The Groups foreign exchange cover is mainly executed in the UK which includes cover for exposures on net trade flows of the Groups companies in the US and certain other countries, Australia, Japan and South Africa.
The aggregate principal amount of forward cover outstanding at 30 September 2002 amounted to 133.9 million 2001: 245.0 million.
Interest rate risk At 30 September 2002, the Groups net debt position after interest rate hedging activity included a net exposure of 497.3 million 2001: 379.4 million to floating interest rates.
Based on the Groups 2002 year end level and composition of net debt, an increase in average interest rates of one per cent per annum would result in a decrease in future earnings, before tax, of 5.0 million per annum 2001: 3.8 million.
45 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Finance and treasury review Interest cover In order to manage interest rate risk the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
before exceptional and At 30 September 2002, there was a 38:62 ratio 2001: 30:70 between floating and fixed rate net FRS17 financing items debt.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where Times appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary this mix and to manage the Groups 5 interest rate exposure.
At 30 September 2002, the aggregate of the notional principal values of swap agreements which 4 affect the floating rate fixed rate mix was 420.0 million 2001: 375.4 million.
3 Foreign exchange risk At 30 September 2002, the Group had outstanding forward exchange 2 contracts totalling 133.9 million 2001: 245.0 million in respect of its actual and forecast transaction exposures.
The fair value of these contracts at 30 September 2002 amounted to a 1 gain of 4.9 million 2001: a loss of 9.1 million.
A ten per cent appreciation of sterling would increase the fair value of these contracts by 7.4 million 2001: 19.2 million.
00001 02 In addition to these forward contracts, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements on its net debt position.
At 30 September 2002 net debt, after currency swaps, comprised Average cost of net sterling liabilities of 345.2 million 2001: 298.2 million and net currency liabilities of 1 net borrowings 980.4 million 2001: 973.9 million.
Based on the Groups 2002 year end level and composition Percentage of net debt, a ten per cent appreciation of sterling would result in a reduction in the value of net 10 currency liabilities of 89.1 million 2001: 88.5 million.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments nor does it enter 8 into any leveraged derivative transactions.
6 Counterparty risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from counterparties.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and 4 duration of exposure to any one counterparty depending upon its credit rating and by regular reviews of these ratings.
The possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance 2 by a counterparty is considered unlikely by management.
00001 The currency and interest rate hedging profile of the Groups borrowings at 30 September 02 2002 is shown in note 3 to the financial statements.
Further information on financial risk 1.
Before capitalised interest management is also given in note 3 to the financial statements.
Interest on net debt The net charge before deducting capitalised interest and before the Groups share of interest of joint ventures and associates was 80.6 million in 2002, which represented 6.3 per cent of average net borrowings during the year.
After taking into account capitalised interest and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates the net charge was 103.1 million.
Interest cover the number of times that the interest charge on net debt is covered by operating profit before exceptional items increased to 4.9 times 2001: 4.3 times, 2000: 4.5 times.
The amount of interest capitalised in subsidiaries during the year was 2.0 million 2001: 2.5 million, 2000: 7.1 million.
After deducting capitalised interest and excluding joint ventures and associates, the net charge was 78.6 million which represents 6.2 per cent of average net borrowings.
Net interest on pension financing items The interest on pension scheme liabilities was 106.1 million in 2002 compared with 107.2 million in 2001.
The expected return on pension scheme assets was 139.1 million in 2002 compared with 166.9 million in 2001.
The decrease was due to the decline in world equity markets which has reduced the value of the pension scheme assets on which the expected return on assets is based.
Debt maturity profile The maturity profile of the Groups gross borrowings is as follows: 2002 2001 million % million % More than five years 549.5 36.4 630.1 41.8 Two to five years 390.6 25.8 237.0 15.7 One to two years 180.9 12.0 152.8 10.2 Within one year 390.1 25.8 486.4 32.3 Total 1,511.1 100.0 1,506.3 100.0 The lengthening of the maturity profile was accomplished primarily through the issuance of one bond and two smaller medium-term notes.
These funds, raised by the parent company, were used to support acquisition activity and to re-finance existing short-term debt.
A portion of the debt which matures within one year is commercial paper issued by various Group companies.
46 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Other contractual obligations Group tax rate before exceptional items The maturity of other contractual obligations of the Group is as follows: Percentage Total Unconditional contractual 40 Operating purchase cash leases obligations obligations 30 million million million Due after more than five years 96.1 195.4 291.5 20 Due within two to five years 59.6 191.7 251.3 Due within one to two years 29.8 66.6 96.4 10 Due within one year 35.6 67.8 103.4 Total 221.1 521.5 742.6 00001 02 In addition, the Group has provided guarantees to third parties of 158.0 million at 30 September 2002.
These predominantly relate to guarantees of the borrowings of BOCs joint venture company which supplies nitrogen to the Mexican oil company, Pemex.
These borrowings are scheduled to be repaid over the next eight years.
Inflation Over the last three years, inflation has not had a material impact on the revenue or profit of the Group.
Taxation The tax charge for 2002 of 106.2 million is calculated in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS19 deferred tax, under which full provision is made for deferred taxes.
Excluding exceptional items, the effective tax rate in 2002 was 30 per cent, a reduction of 2.5 per cent from 2001.
Including exceptional items, the tax rate was 32 per cent.
The Group pays corporation tax in the UK at a rate of 30 per cent.
The Group is currently liable to pay federal tax at the rate of 35 per cent in the US.
This is reduced by the existence of tax credits.
In the other principal subsidiaries, the tax rate is typically between 30 per cent and 42 per cent.
Contingencies The Group monitors all contingent liabilities including matters relating to the environment via a process of consultation and evaluation which includes senior management, internal and external legal advisers and internal and external technical advisers.
This process results in conclusions with respect to potential exposure and provisions are made or adjusted accordingly by reference to accounting principles.
Management believes that the Group has adequately provided for contingencies which are likely to become payable in the future.
None of these contingencies is material to the Groups financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Legal proceedings Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation will be disposed of without material effect on the Groups financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Similar to many other companies, BOC has been named, in the ordinary course of its business, in civil proceedings involving claims of toxic tort bodily injury related to asbestos and certain metals and arising out of the use of certain of the companys welding products.
Since BOC acquired Airco in 1978, all proceedings that have been concluded thus far have either been successfully defended or otherwise resolved on terms favourable to the company.
To date, the costs of defending or otherwise resolving these proceedings, have not been material to the companys financial statements.
The company believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these proceedings and intends to vigorously defend such claims.
Based on the companys experience to date, together with the companys current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted, and applicable insurance, the company believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial statements.
Insurance Operational management is responsible for managing business risks.
Several Group departments advise management on different aspects of risk and monitor results.
Insurance cover is held against major catastrophes.
For any such event, the Group will bear an initial cost before external cover begins.
47 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Finance and treasury review Critical accounting policies The principal accounting policies affecting the results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 71 to 73 of the financial statements.
The application of certain of these policies requires assumptions or subjective judgements by management.
Management bases these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstances.
The application of these assumptions and judgements affects the reported amounts of profit during the year and the assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these assumptions and judgements.
Management believes that the following are the critical policies where the assumptions and judgements made could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Tangible fixed assets A significant part of the capital employed of the Group, particularly in the Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products lines of business, is invested in tangible fixed assets.
The nature of the business demands significant capital investment to renew or increase production capacity or to enable the business to achieve greater productivity and efficiency.
It is the Groups policy to depreciate tangible fixed assets, except land, on a straight line basis over the effective lives of the assets.
This ensures that there is an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and delivery of goods and services.
A key element of this policy is the estimate of the effective life applied to each category of fixed assets which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge.
In deciding the appropriate lives to be applied, management takes into account various factors including, among other things, the accumulated experience of the effective asset lives from historic business operations and an assessment of the likely impact of any changes in technology.
While Group earnings in any period would fluctuate if different asset lives were applied, in some cases the original estimated life of an asset is closely related to contractual arrangements with large customers.
Some of the earnings impact of choosing a different asset life would be mitigated, as the different life may reflect different contractual arrangements with such customers.
Nevertheless, variations in the effective lives could impact the earnings of the business through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge.
Intangible fixed assets In a similar manner to tangible fixed assets, management uses its judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
It is the Groups policy to amortise goodwill over its useful economic life.
This takes into account, among other things, the maturity of the business acquired and its product and customer base.
Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the earnings of the Group.
Retirement benefits Results of the Group include costs relating to the provision of retirement benefits for employees.
It is the directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
The assumptions are based on actual historical experience and are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries.
They include the assumptions used for regular service costs and for the financing elements related to the pension schemes assets and liabilities.
Whilst management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect both the operating profit and net interest cost of the Group.
Environmental provisions In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out environmental clean-ups at former and current production sites.
Many of these obligations will not arise for a number of years, and the costs are difficult to predict accurately.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide an appropriate amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups, and the amounts, if material, are discounted to present values.
Both the amount of anticipated costs, and the interest rates used to discount such costs, are subjective.
The use of different assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group.
Current asset provisions In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing the net realisable value of various elements of working capital principally stocks, work-in-progress and accounts receivable.
Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving stocks, bad or doubtful debts and product warranties.
Actual costs in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences would affect future earnings of the Group.
Accounting The accounts this year comply with the requirements of the new UK accounting standard on deferred tax FRS19.
In addition, the UK accounting standard on retirement benefits FRS17 has been fully adopted.
Last year the Group applied the transitional arrangements permitted under this standard.
Comparative figures for 2001 and 2000 have been restated for these two standards.
The report and accounts also continues to include US reporting requirements.
The report on remuneration follows the disclosure requirements of the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules and the UK Companies Act 1985.
Where appropriate, in order to improve clarity, voluntary disclosures are also given.
48 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Average exchange rates: As a global business the Group supports initiatives to harmonise accounting standards.
Its own accounting policies are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP US dollar but the Group also considers the implications of US GAAP and International Accounting Standards.
The Group is planning for the move to report under International Accounting Standards in line with the timetable set out in European Union legislation.
This will first apply to the report and 2.0 accounts for the year ended 30 September 2006.
The Group plays an active part in accounting developments by responding to new proposals 1.5 and by appropriate representation.
1.0 US GAAP The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
0.5 The US accounting information in note 16 to the financial statements gives a summary of the principal differences between the amounts determined in accordance with the Groups accounting 098990001 02 policies based on UK GAAP and amounts determined in accordance with US GAAP together with the reconciliation of profit before tax and shareholders funds from a UK GAAP basis to a Australian dollar US GAAP basis, presentation of the US GAAP measure of comprehensive income and a movement in shareholders funds on a US GAAP basis.
3.0 The profit before tax for the year ended 30 September 2002 under US GAAP was 413.9 million 2001: 377.1 million, 2000: 417.7 million, compared with profit before tax of 2.5 335.3 million in 2002 2001: 362.2 million, 2000: 441.8 million under UK GAAP.
Shareholders 2.0 funds at 30 September 2002 under US GAAP were 2,061.0 million 2001: 2,138.9 million, 1.5 compared with 1,684.1 million 2001: 2,086.2 million under UK GAAP.
The difference primarily results from the differing accounting treatment of pensions, goodwill, financial instruments, 1.0 restructuring costs, investments and fixed asset revaluations.
0.5 Exchange rates 098990001 02 The majority of the Groups operations are located outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling.
Japanese yen The effects of fluctuations in the relationship between the various currencies are extremely complex and variations in any particular direction may not have a consistent impact on the 250 reported results.
In 2002, sterling strengthened against three of the principal currencies affecting the Group: by two per cent against the US dollar, by eight per cent against the Japanese yen 200 and by 36 per cent against the South African rand.
Against the Australian dollar, sterling was almost unchanged.
150 In 2001, sterling weakened against the US dollar, but strengthened against the Australian dollar, 100 the Japanese yen and the South African rand.
In 2000, sterling weakened against the US dollar and Japanese yen but strengthened against 50 the South African rand.
It was almost unchanged against the Australian dollar.
The highest and lowest rates of exchange for sterling against the US dollar for the last six 49 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Finance and treasury review months were: May June July August September October High  Low  Europes single currency Europes single currency, the euro, was launched for business-to-business use on 1 January 1999.
On 1 January 2002 the euro was adopted for all purposes in those countries participating.
Sterling continued unaffected for use in the UK.
BOC businesses in Europe were able to operate in euros from January 1999.
Subsequent system upgrades have provided for full euro functionality, and BOC suffered no issues with the full changeover.
Costs to date have been fully expensed.
Principal operating companies The following operating companies principally affect the amount of profit or assets of the Group: The BOC Group Inc, a wholly-owned Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of The BOC Group Inc, a wholly-owned Nevada corporation.
BOC Limited, a wholly-owned English company.
BOC Limited, a wholly-owned Australian company.
Gist Limited, a wholly-owned English company.
Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK, a Japanese company, in which the Groups shareholding is 97 per cent.
African Oxygen Limited, a South African company, in which the Groups shareholding is 55 per cent.
Supplier payment policy The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating the terms of payment as part of the commercial arrangements negotiated with suppliers and then paying according to those terms.
In addition the UK-based businesses have committed to the Better Payment Practice Code.
A copy of the code can be obtained from the Department of Trade and Industry, DTI Publications Orderline, Admail 528, London SW1W 8YT.
For UK businesses, of amounts owing to suppliers, trade creditors represents 52 days at 30 September 2002.
Going concern The directors are confident, after having made appropriate enquiries, that both the company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Management believes that its current credit facilities provide sufficient working capital to meet the present requirements of its existing businesses and that the gearing ratio is appropriate given the nature of the Groups activities.
Substantial holdings Details of substantial holdings of Ordinary shares at 12 November 2002 are shown on page 115.
