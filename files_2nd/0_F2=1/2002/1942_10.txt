l. c. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration, the 'Committee', within a framework set by the Board and on its behalf.
The Committee consists of three non-executive directors, namely Mr D S Bramley Chairman, Mr L P Finn and Mr D G Perry.
None of the Committee members have a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The remuneration of the executive directors consists of a basic salary, benefits-in-kind, an annual performance related bonus, long term incentive schemes and pension contributions.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration which comprises all of the executive directors.
Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of the shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has given full consideration to the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice the 'Combined Code' which is set out in an annexe to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
Service contracts The executive directors have fixed term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60.
Mr H C Dawe and Mr P J Stoker have service contracts which are terminable by the Company on 24 months' notice, subject to retirement provisions, but with a condition that on termination an amount equivalent to two years' salary, benefits and bonus is payable.
They would also be entitled to exercise any outstanding share options and be credited with two years' pensionable service.
In response to the recommendations contained in both the Cadbury and Greenbury Reports and now also recommended in the Combined Code, the notice period was reduced by agreement, without compensation, from 59 months to 24 months.
It was felt that, in the circumstances, no further reduction was appropriate and that this notice period is reasonable having regard to the length of service of each director and their considerable knowledge of the industry.
Mr J K Watson and Mr A M Leitch have service contracts terminable by the Company on 12 months' notice.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually and for the year under consideration the executive directors were awarded rises varying from 5% up to 10%.
In addition, Mr A G Robson waived 68,878 of his salary during the year 2001 - 16,355.
Benefits in kind These relate mainly to the provision and use of motor vehicles.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus is determined by reference to two criteria: 1 Return on capital employed: each year the Company obtains a report prepared by its broker, ING Barings Limited, comparing Bellway's performance against its peer companies.
2 Growth in dividend per ordinary share.
This bonus is capped at a maximum of 52.5% of basic salary, of which half is payable in November each year following the announcement of the Company's annual results.
The other half is used to acquire Bellway shares, at the then current market value, which are held in the Bellway p. l. c. Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
On the third anniversary of the acquisition of the shares, the executive directors are allowed to have the shares transferred into their name.
The first tranche has been charged in these accounts.
Following the retirement of Mr A G Robson as a director, all of his annual bonus is treated as current.
None of the above fees in respect of Mr L P Finn are payable to Northern Rock plc 2001 - 7,438.

l. c. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION continued Directors' interests continued In addition, Mr P J Stoker, only in his capacity as one of the Executors of the Estate of Mr A K Bell, had no beneficial interest in ordinary shares at 31 July 2002 and 14 October 2002 1 August 2001 - 52,000.
The executive directors have a beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Bellway p. l. c. Employee Share Trust 1992 pursuant to the grant of deferred bonus entitlements.
For further information concerning the directors' bonus arrangements, see page 38.
The number of shares held in the trust in respect of each director, which excludes the deferred annual bonus on page 34, is as follows: 31 July 2002 1 August 2001 H C Dawe 73,403 79,007 J K Watson 52,162 53,103 A G Robson retired 31 July 2002 45,059 67,085 P J Stoker 52,356 55,904 There has been no change in the above holdings between 31 July 2002 and the date of this report.
The executive directors had a potential future beneficial interest in up to 350,395 ordinary shares at 31 July 2002 and 14 October 2002 1 August 2001 422,723 which are held by the Bellway p. l. c. Employee Share Trust 1992.
The directors had a joint non-beneficial interest in 18,000 ordinary shares at 31 July 2002 and 14 October 2002 1 August 2001 - 28,000 which are held by the Bellway p. l. c. 1988 Employee Benefit Trust.
Long term incentive schemes The Company operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved long term share incentive schemes to encourage the executive directors and employees to hold shares in the Company and to enhance share values.
1 The Bellway p. l. c. Executive Share Option Scheme has been in existence since 1985 and the last tranche of shares was awarded in November 1994.
Options have been granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
No further options can be granted under this scheme.
Subsisting unexercised options are still eligible for exercise subject to the rules of the scheme.
This scheme was initially superseded by the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme.
However, a number of changes to the law governing discretionary share option schemes contained in the Finance Act 1996 changed the tax treatment of share options granted under Inland Revenue approved discretionary share option schemes, such as the 1995 Scheme.
This led to the Company introducing, in June 1996, the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme, which is an unapproved discretionary scheme.
The 1996 Scheme enables members of the Board and certain other employees to be granted options to buy shares in the Company where the 1995 scheme, as statutorily amended, would have restricted or prohibited this.
With regard to the exercise of options granted under both the 1995 Scheme and the 1996 Scheme, the Committee has set objective performance conditions which apply to all options granted under both the 1995 and 1996 schemes.
Only on the achievement of such conditions will the options become capable of being exercised.
The conditions to be satisfied will be either: a the growth in earnings per share of the Company in any three consecutive years will not be less than the growth in the Retail Price Index plus six per cent over the same period: or b the growth in earnings per share of the Company in any three consecutive years exceeding the mean average growth in earnings per share in the same period of companies whose shares are quoted in the 'Building and Construction' sector of the FT-SE Actuaries Shares Indices or such other sector which from time to time lists companies whose undertakings in general are broadly similar to those of the Company On options being granted to the executive directors, it is intended that options for at least an equivalent number of shares will be set aside to be granted to the Group's other employees.
2 The Bellway p. l. c. Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which was established in 1992, is a share option scheme offered to all employees, including the executive directors.

Directors' Pension Information Accrued Transfer pension Increase in value of the entitlement accrued pension increase in Date pa  Date of service as at 31 July 2002 for the year for the year birth commenced see note 1 see note 2 see note 3 H C Dawe 7 April 1944 20 August 1961 198,125 11,448 206,865 J K Watson 21 March 1954 1 July 1978 75,025 5,265 37,724 P J Stoker 23 May 1956 2 March 1981 90,185 5,707 54,483 Notes 1.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year, but excluding any statutory increases which will reflect future inflation after the year end.
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase in respect of inflation.
The inflation rate used is that published for September 2001, i. e. 1.7%, which is in accordance with present actuarial practice.
There are no contributions from the directors to the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme 'the Scheme', therefore there are no contributions to offset the transfer value shown.
The transfer value shown has been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
This value represents the cash equivalent of the increase in accrued benefit.
For this purpose it is assumed that the benefit entitlement is increased until the normal retirement date in accordance with the Scheme rules.

The transfer values shown above have been calculated as at 31 July 2002 employing the transfer value basis for the Scheme as at that date.

The accrued pension entitlement at 31 July 2001 in respect of Mr H C Dawe, the highest paid director, was 183,556.
