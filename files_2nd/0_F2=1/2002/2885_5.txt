Creating a complementary portfolio of brands in London We offer listeners a wide variety of stations to suit their music tastes, and this enables us to provide a strong complementary advertising package in the London area: 95.8 Capital FM caters for listeners aged 15-44, Capital Gold reaches people aged 35-54, Xfm targets 15-34 year olds with a male bias.
In addition, we have recently started selling airtime for Choice FM, our associate, which particularly appeals to females aged 15-34.
