REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors present their Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2002, in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Pursuant to the Regulations, the Report will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
The sections marked with an asterix have been subject to audit.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee determines the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and St. Jamess Place UK plc formerly J. Rothschild Assurance plc, including the overall supervision of the operation of the executive share option and bonus schemes.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Committee comprises The Viscount Weir as Chairman, Derek Netherton, Charles Bailey and Michael Sorkin.
The Company Secretary, Hugh Gladman, acts as Secretary to the Committee, providing advice on legal and regulatory issues and the operation of the share option and bonus schemes.
At the Committees request, Committee meetings are also attended by Mike Wilson, the Chief Executive, who makes recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the remuneration packages of individual directors excluding himself or policy generally.
Such recommendations are discussed by the Committee and adopted or amended as the Committee sees fit.
No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when his own remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
The Committee also has access, as required, to professional advice and market data and this was provided by Monks Partnership, remuneration consultants, in 2002.
Monks Partnership were appointed by the Committee and have not provided any other services to the Company.
The Committee intends to review its appointment of remuneration consultants in 2003.
PAGE 26 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration Policy The Committee has regard to the principles set out in the Combined Code when setting remuneration policy.
Overall, the Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate executives of the necessary calibre.
The focus of the remuneration policy is not primarily on annual salary, but is on incentive plans that are aligned with the delivery of shareholder value.
The purpose of incentive plans is to provide a direct link between each individuals remuneration and their performance.
In terms of salary, the Committee aims to model salaries around the median position for companies of similar size in the UK financial services market and elsewhere.
The salaries paid to individual directors are then set taking into account the responsibilities and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and his or her marketability and future potential.
Fringe benefits are generally in line with other comparable organisations, although the Company does not operate a defined benefit final salary pension scheme for Directors.
The Committee supports the view of the Board that annual performance targets for executives should be stretching so as to incentivise above average results in terms of sales growth and other business plan targets.
Linked to these targets, the Committee puts in place an annual discretionary bonus scheme, the shape of which is geared to motivate the Directors and other senior executives to achieve and, if possible, better those targets.
50% of the benefits under the scheme are paid in cash and a matching amount is used to buy shares in the Company which do not vest to the individual for three years, thus being retentive as well as linking the value of the award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
Finally, the Committee has put in place an executive share option scheme for Directors and senior executives, with the awards being conditional on the satisfaction of performance targets linked to growth in earnings per share, so as to create further commonality of interests with shareholders.
Further details of all of the above elements of remuneration are set out on the following pages.
PAGE 27 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using data on the salaries and benefits for executives of other life assurance groups and companies in other sectors of a comparable size to the Company.
In January 2003, the Committee increased the salary of Ian Gascoigne, following his recent appointment as Group Sales Director.
The salaries of all the other executive Directors remained unchanged.
Annual Bonus In relation to 2002, no annual bonuses were awarded due to the non-satisfaction of the performance targets set by the Committee at the start of the year.
For 2003, as in previous years, the performance targets set by the Committee relate primarily to sales growth, although the achievement of other objectives set out in the business plan eg: control over expenses and individual performance will also be taken into account by the Committee when assessing individual awards.
The satisfaction of the targets will be assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of the performance targets.
No executive Director has a contractual right to receive an award and the performance targets set by the Committee are based on a sliding scale, which is geared to encourage top-end achievement.
50% of any award is payable in cash, with the remaining 50% being paid under the terms of the deferred bonus scheme.
The maximum possible award, split between cash and the deferred element, is 120% of salary.
Under the deferred bonus scheme, the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company to be held in an employee trust.
The shares held in the trust vest to the Director after three years and are not subject to further performance conditions due to the performance targets which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, although entitlement to the award is normally lost if the executive Director ceases to be employed by the Group prior to vesting.
The Committee believe that the deferred bonus scheme is an effective incentive for the executive Directors, whilst at the same time offering strong retentive characteristics going forward, as well as being aligned with shareholder interests due to the value of the award on vesting being dependent on share price performance.
PAGE 28 REMUNERATION REPORT continued As stated above, no awards under the deferred bonus scheme were made to the executive Directors in respect of 2002.
The table below sets out details of awards under the deferred bonus scheme in respect of the 2000 and 2001 financial years.
Director Balance as at Date of grant No of shares Market price Balance as at End of qualifying 1 January 2002 awarded as at date 31 December period of grant 2002 David Bellamy 23,855 28 Mar 2004 2 Apr 2002 8,108 2.86 31,963 1 Apr 2005 Ian Gascoigne 21,686 28 Mar 2004 2 Apr 2002 6,756 2.86 28,442 1 Apr 2005 Martin Moule 23,855 28 Mar 2004 2 Apr 2002 8,108 2.86 31,963 1 Apr 2005 John Newman 27,469 28 Mar 2004 2 Apr 2002 8,558 2.86 36,027 1 Apr 2005 Mike Wilson 57,831 28 Mar 2004 2 Apr 2002 18,018 2.86 75,849 1 Apr 2005 Executive Share Option Scheme Since 1997 the Company has operated a discretionary share option scheme for executive Directors and senior employees under which options are granted at market value, such options normally being first exercisable between 4 and 6 years from date of grant, subject to the achievement of certain individual and or corporate targets relating to earnings growth.
The performance condition which applies to all executive options granted to Directors under the 1997 scheme prior to March 2002 is earnings growth of St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc and its subsidiaries over a period of three consecutive years of at least RPI plus 5% per annum over the same period.
With the help of remuneration consultants, Monks Partnership, the Committee reviewed the policy for the grant of executive options to the executive Directors in January 2002, taking into account revised guidelines issued by the ABI.
The Committee decided to grant options to the executive Directors on an annual basis, starting in March 2002, to the value of 1 times salary at date of grant, subject to the discretion of the Committee to revise the level of grant, up or down, to reflect Group and or individual performance and other relevant circumstances.
A resolution was approved at the AGM in 2002 to remove the 4 times salary limit on the value of executive options to subscribe for shares held by an option holder at any one time and replace it with a limit on the value of subscription options granted to an individual in any one year of 2 times salary.
PAGE 29 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Committee also amended the performance condition for executive options in January 2002.
The new performance condition adopted for executive Director grants from January 2002 is that the earnings per share of the Company and its subsidiaries excluding interests in Life Assurance Holding Corporation and Nascent Group SA have increased over a performance period of 3 consecutive years which may be extended by the Committee to 4 or 5 consecutive years by a percentage equal to 5% for each year of the performance period more than the rate of inflation as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest over the same period.
The Committee considers that the revised condition creates a more demanding expectation of performance for executive Directors than before.
Performance will be assessed by reference to the Companys financial results due to the condition being related to growth in earnings.
The Committee reviewed the above policies at its meeting in January 2003 and decided that they continued to be appropriate, believing that the earnings per share condition is sufficiently stretching as well as being visible as a performance condition for both shareholders and managers.
Accordingly, the Committee resolved to grant all the executive Directors an option to the value of 1 times salary following the announcement of the Companys results in February 2003, such options to be granted at market value on date of grant.
Details of the options held by the Directors in 2002 under the Companys executive scheme together with any outstanding options held under the previous scheme operated by St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc and any movements during the year are as follows: Executive Share Option Schemes options held in 2002 Director Options held Granted Exercised Options held Exercise Date from Expiry at 1 January in year in year at 31 December price which date 2002 2002 exercisable David Bellamy 26,250 - - 26,250 0.57p 20 Oct 2000 20 Oct 2003 375,000 - - 375,000 1.33 1 Jul 2001 13 Jul 2007 to 1 Jul 2003 131,250 - 131,250 2.40 23 May 2005 23 May 2012 Anthony Loehnis 41,668 - - 41,668 1.57 1 April 2001 18 Dec 2007 Martin Moule 200,000 - 59,955 140,045 1.49 1 Jan 2002 8 Dec 2007 to 1 Jan 2004 100,000 - - 100,000 2.77 1 Jan 2003 18 Dec 2008 to 1 Jan 2005 121,875 - 121,875 2.40 23 May 2005 23 May 2012 John Newman 375,000 - - 375,000 1.33 1 Jul 2001 13 Jul 2007 to 1 Jul 2003 Mike Wilson 450,000 - - 450,000 3.52 11 Dec 2004 11 Dec 2010 to 11 Dec 2005 Notes: i On 19 March 2002, Martin Moule exercised options over 59,955 shares at an exercise price of 1.49 per share.
The market price of the shares on 19 March 2002 was 3.05. ii The exercise price corresponds with the market price as defined in the Scheme rules on the date on which the options were granted.
At 31 December 2002 the mid market price for SJPC shares was 1.29.
The range of prices between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2002 was between 3.50 and 1.21.
PAGE 30 REMUNERATION REPORT continued All-Employee Share Option Schemes All UK employees of the Group, including the executive Directors, are eligible to enter into a Save As You Earn SAYE contract, under which they are able to save up to 250 per month, and at the end of the 3 or 5 year savings period acquire shares in the Company at a price not less than 80 per cent of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.

Shareholders approved the establishment of an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan SIP formerly known as an All-Employee Share Ownership Plan at the AGM in 2000.
All employees, including the executive Directors, can participate in the SIP, which entitles them to a grant of free shares up to a maximum value of 3,000, subject to the attainment by their relevant business unit of pre-set performance targets.
No Director became entitled to a grant of shares under the SIP rules in 2002.
Pensions and Death in Service Benefits Until 30 June 2002, the provision of pension benefits for the executive Directors had generally been made through employer contributions of 15% of base salary to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme.
In January 2002, following a review, the Committee decided to increase the employer contribution for Directors who had served at least 10 years with the Group to 17.5% of base salary.
PAGE 31 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Accordingly, employer contributions of 17.5% of base salary were made to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme for David Bellamy, Ian Gascoigne and Mike Wilson from 1 July 2002.
John Newmans service agreement provides for a salary supplement equal to 17% of his base salary in lieu of pension contributions by the Company.
From 1 August 2002, this salary supplement was increased to 17.5% of salary.
Martin Moule receives a salary supplement equal to 12.5% of his base salary in lieu of pension contributions by the Company.
Sir Mark Weinberg received a salary supplement equal to 12.5% of his base salary in lieu of pension contributions until 30 June 2002, increasing to 17.5% thereafter.
To the extent that pension contributions were restricted by the earnings cap, such shortfalls were paid by way of taxable salary.
The costs of the pension and death in service arrangements for the executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2002 are shown on page 35.
Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should generally terminate on the executives 60th birthday and should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benefits in lieu of any outstanding period of notice.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
Details of the service agreements of the executive Directors are set out below: Sir Mark Weinbergs service agreement dated 15 May 2002 can be terminated by, inter alia, either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreement, which requires Sir Mark Weinberg to devote 50% of his time to the affairs of the Group, provides for an annual salary of 200,000 and PAGE 32 REMUNERATION REPORT continued benefits in kind, including life assurance, a salary supplement in lieu of pension provision, private health insurance and a company car together with a chauffeur.
