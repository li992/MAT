Corporate Strategy British Lands opportunistic but risk-averse strategy seeks to achieve long-term growth in shareholder value by: focusing on prime assets in the office and retail sectors: creating exceptional long-term investments with strong covenants, long lease profiles and growth potential: enhancing property returns through active management and development: and maximising equity returns through optimal financing and joint ventures.
The key to high returns is flexibility, both in terms of business organisation and financing to take advantage of shifts in the property market.
Dance, dance, dance little lady.
