Japan Portfolio Review Japan suffered a consecutive yearly drop in equity prices with the main index falling by 14.5% in yen terms.
Declines in overseas stock markets and a sharp contraction within the domestic economy pushed equities to ten year lows.
Profits fell sharply and the yen depreciated reflecting the severity of the economic downturn.
Within the marketplace technology and telecommunications stocks felt the brunt of the decline along with the banking sector where the bad debt situation deteriorated.
The more cyclical areas of the market performed relatively better as stocks began to anticipate a turn in the economic cycle.
Activity In order to create more focus within the portfolio the number of stocks was reduced although the broad sector exposure was largely maintained.
Several holdings were disposed of which included Sekisui House, Asahi Chemical and Kirin Brewery the only holding in the defensive area which was sold in anticipation of an economic upturn.
The proceeds from the stock sales were redistributed amongst existing holdings and the bias of the portfolio remains towards the service and technology areas where growth prospects are the strongest.
Outlook With the Japanese stock market back down to suppressed levels and the economy showing signs of recovery, the outlook for equities is improving.
As has been seen in the past, stocks are closely correlated to industrial activity which is beginning to recover along with a rise in exports.
Profits should rise strongly as restructuring benefits begin to filter through.
Measures to boost activity are likely to be announced by the government which should further improve the outlook for equities.
For these reasons the commitment to the Japanese stock market has been raised to account for a more meaningful portion of the overall portfolio.
With a current weighting of over 12%, the Company is well positioned to benefit from an anticipated rise in equity prices.
