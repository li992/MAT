Group Overview Celltech Pharmaceuticals Celltech Pharmaceuticals, the Companys international sales, marketing and manufacturing arm, performs two important roles for the Group.
Firstly, the existing primary care-focused business provides the cashflows that enable the Group to support its substantial investment in innovative R&D.
Secondly, the pharmaceutical business provides a robust platform upon which to build specialist-focused capabilities for the marketing of certain pipeline products.
Celltechs ability to market specialist products through its pharmaceutical business, either with or without a partner, will allow it to retain more value from its innovative R&D programmes.
A key focus for the pharmaceutical business is the optimisation of its primary care business, in particular through product line extensions and careful management of its cost base.
The longer-term goal is the establishment of specialist marketing capabilities and opinion leader relationships in the gastrointestinal area, ultimately to market products such as CDP 870 for Crohns disease, in addition to the selective acquisition of new specialist-focused products.
The pharmaceutical business also provides valuable input to Celltechs R&D programmes, ensuring these are developed to optimise their commercial potential.
Celltech continues to expand its European coverage, with the acquisition of a German sales and marketing organisation during 2001 and the establishment of operations in the Nordic region during 2002.
The establishment of specialist-focused marketing capabilities in the gastrointestinal GI area has been accelerated during 2002 with the acquisition from Pharmacia of Dipentum, a treatment for ulcerative colitis.
Celltech began retailing this product in Europe in the third quarter of 2002 and in early 2003 in the US.
This product was also reintroduced to the GI community at a major US conference in October 2002.
