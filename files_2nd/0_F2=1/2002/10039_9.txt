16 FOCUS ON DEFENCE Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2002 17 As military activity around the world increases, the need to maintain military preparedness at the highest levels continues to dominate the defence agenda.
For the first time in a decade, defence budgets are increasing and defence ministries are looking to businesses like ours to support their state of readiness.
In 2002, Meggitt benefited from increased demand for existing and derivative products.
Our products are on virtually all original equipment platforms and 36 per cent of the Groups sales are now military compared to civil aerospace at 38 per cent.
"Around three quarters of Meggitt military sales involve spares, targets, decoys and other ""disposables"", which widely yield repeat orders."
We have also started to provide commercial aviation solutions for military aircraft retrofit programmes under the United States Department of Defenses Technology Insertion initiative.
In the US and elsewhere, we see good opportunities to grow the retrofit and service side of our business.
2002s acquisitions oriented to military original equipment manufacturers are already enhancing our defence prospects.
