Regulatory compliance The Corporation is subject to continuing obligations applicable to listed companies, overseen by the UK Listing Authority, which is a division of the Financial Services Authority FSA.

21 Law Debenture Directors report continued Corporate governance developments Law Debenture is aware of the recommendations of the Higgs and Smith reviews and will consider their impact when the consultation process is complete.
Law Debentures responsibilities as an institutional shareholder The Corporation's policy is as follows: Law Debenture will normally support incumbent management and, where practicable, vote in favour of resolutions proposed by the boards of companies in which it has a shareholding, but only so long as Law Debenture is satisfied that management has in place adequate procedures to meet the standards of corporate governance laid down in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance or equivalent for non-UK companies, and elsewhere.
The board determines the Corporation's investment strategy but does not issue express instructions to the investment manager about whether it should or should not invest in any particular share.
Where Law Debenture believes that incumbent management is failing in its corporate governance duties, Law Debenture or on its behalf, the Corporation's investment manager may attempt to enter dialogue with the company concerned in an attempt to alter the management's position.
Where this is not possible, or where incumbent management declines to alter its behaviour, Law Debenture will consider abstaining or voting against resolutions proposed by the management.
Henderson Global Investors, on Law Debenture's behalf, monitors companies in which Law Debenture is invested, and from time to time may discuss matters of corporate governance with such companies.
The Henderson corporate governance unit will notify Law Debenture's investment manager who in turn will notify Law Debenture, should matters arise that might lead the Corporation to consider intervening, abstaining or voting against a particular proposal.
The Corporation will not hold shares in companies whose ethical and environmental practices are in its view likely to damage the performance of the business to the detriment of its shareholders.
Repurchase of shares During the year, the Corporation did not repurchase any of its shares.
It intends to seek shareholder approval to renew its powers to repurchase shares up to 14.99% of the Corporations issued share capital, if circumstances are appropriate.

Special arrangements exist for suppliers of certain legal services, where the Group charges these costs to its clients.
Statement of directors responsibilities in relation to the financial statements The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Corporation and the Group and of the revenue of the Group for the financial year.
In preparing the accounts on pages 35 to 54, the directors are required to select suitable accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
They consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements as the assets of the Group consist mainly of readily realisable securities.
The directors are responsible for keeping accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Corporation and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are also responsible for the system of internal controls, safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors report, the directors remuneration report and other information included in the annual report are prepared in accordance with company law in the United Kingdom.
They are also responsible for ensuring that the annual return includes information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Auditors  resigned as auditors on 14 October 2002 and the board appointed PKF on that date.
