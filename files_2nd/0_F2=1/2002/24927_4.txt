On 19 October 1998, HSBC Bank plc, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, entered into an agreement to acquire a long leasehold interest in a building at Canary Wharf, London, to be developed by Canary Wharf Limited.
The building was substantially completed, and occupation commenced in the third quarter 2002.
The final transfer of operations was completed in February 2003.
The new building accommodates under one roof approximately 8,000 staff, who previously occupied various HSBC offices in the City of London.
The disposal of surplus property interests released by this consolidation move has been managed in 2002, and will continue to be managed in 2003, through assignment, leasing or sale into the market, as appropriate.
