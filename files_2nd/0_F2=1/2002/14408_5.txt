Review of operations continued Vietnam The Group acquired its first interest in the Cuu Long Basin in Vietnam in 1999 with the award of Block 16-1 to its majority owned subsidiary, SOCO Vietnam Ltd SOCO Vietnam.
This was followed in 2000 with the award of Block 9-2.
The initial periods following the awards were spent staffing the Joint Operating Companies JOCs, non-profit entities through which operations in Vietnam are conducted.
The Hoan Vu JOC has operating responsibility for Block 9-2.
The Hoang Long JOC has operating responsibility for Block 16-1.
These JOCs are staffed by personnel assigned by the contracting parties, subsidiaries of SOCO, PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited of Thailand PTTEP and Petrovietnam, the state owned oil company of Vietnam.
The first 3D seismic acquisition programme was conducted over Block 16-1 in 2000.
The following year, a 3D seismic acquisition programme was conducted over Block 9-2.
11 SOCO International plc Annual Report 2002 Review of operations continued In January 2002 the Group increased its interests from 70% to 80% in SOCO Vietnam, the entity through which the Group holds its interests in Block 9-2 and Block 16-1 in the Cuu Long Basin offshore Vietnam.
Subsequently, in February 2002, SOCO Vietnam executed a farm-out agreement with PTTEP to fund SOCO Vietnams share of drilling a four well exploration programme on both Blocks in order for PTTEP to earn one-half of SOCO Vietnams interest.
Later in the year, in a transaction which closed in early 2003, SOCO Vietnam raised its interest in Block 16-1 from 15% to 28.5% by acquiring 50% of Amerada Hess Hess interest in this Block.

Both Blocks are contiguous to the Bach Ho and the Rang Dong producing fields with production rates of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day BOPD and 150 million cubic feet of gas per day MCFD and 65,000 BOPD and 85 MCFD, respectively, at the beginning of 2003.
The Companys capital funding requirements in Block 9-2 and its initial 15% interest in Block 16-1 were carried up to a maximum amount of US$50 million by PTTEP through the initial exploration programme under the terms of the farm-out agreement.
The initial exploration programme consisted of four wells, all of which began drilling in 2002 with three being completed during the year.
All of these wells were designed as vertical tests, which would be abandoned regardless of the drilling outcome, to gauge the prospectivity of four separate and distinct prospects, two in each Block.
Current development techniques throughout the Basin primarily employ horizontal or deviated wells, which typically achieve flow rates significantly greater than those seen in vertical wells.
Review of 2002 results The exploration drilling campaign in Vietnam got underway in May of 2002 when the first well spudded on the C prospect on Block 16-1.
The Ngua O-1X well was drilled to a depth of 3,684 metres, penetrating approximately 520 metres into Basement.
A drill stem test DST was conducted in a Basement interval of 3,174 metres to 3,563 metres after encountering multiple fracture systems.
The DST recovered oil at rates of approximately 250 BOPD over an 18 hour interval.
Although an earlier well drilled on the Block had tested approximately 500 BOPD from a Miocene interval and the mud log in the Ngua O-1X well indicated the presence of hydrocarbons in this interval, it was determined that the reservoir characteristics in the upper Miocene were not sufficiently developed to warrant testing.
Structure size is the primary concern as a decision to further appraise this prospect will be deferred until after the results of additional drilling on both Blocks.
The second well in the overall programme and the first on Block 9-2, the Ca Ngu Vang-1X, spudded on 23 July to test prospect D. The well was drilled to a total depth of 4,567 metres, entering Basement at 3,717 metres.
An unstimulated open hole test was conducted over an extended period from a Basement interval of 850 metres.
The final Basement flow test, impeded by a collapsed section at the top of the Basement interval, yielded a maximum combined rate of approximately 4,500 barrels of crude oil equivalent per day comprised of approximately 3,100 BOPD and approximately 7.9 MCFD.
Although the well was designed as a pure Basement exploration test, a minimal test without stimulation was conducted to test an oil bearing section in the lower Miocene after plugging back from the Basement interval.
The test recovered a calculated rate of approximately 125 BOPD.
The Voi Trang-1X exploration well, the second exploration test on Block 16-1 and third in the programme, spudded in October on prospect A.
The well tested a maximum sustained rate of approximately 3,500 BOPD from a section that included both Oligocene and Basement intervals.
The high quality 42 API crude was recovered from a bottom hole test conducted over an interval from 2,086 metres to 2,490 metres.
