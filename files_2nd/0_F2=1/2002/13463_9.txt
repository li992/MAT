14 Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements METALS AND MINERALS PRODUCTION Ore reserves Estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources in this report for Rio Tinto managed operations were produced in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, September 1999 the JORC Code as required by the Australian Stock Exchange ASX.
Codes or Guidelines similar to JORC with only minor regional variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, US, UK, Ireland and Europe and together these represent current best practice for reporting Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
The JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long term commodity prices, in calculating reserve estimates.
It has come to the Groups attention that the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC have recently been pressing for the use of historical average commodity prices when determining reserves in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7.
If the Group were to apply this approach for reporting purposes, its reserves might differ from those reported below.
Ore reserve and mineral resource information in this report is based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by JORC, or recognised mining professionals as defined by the ASX, most of whom are full time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies.
Each has had a minimum of five years relevant estimation experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics.
Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears.
A register of the names of the Competent Persons who are responsible for the estimates is maintained by the company secretaries in London and Melbourne and is available on request.
The estimated ore reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2002.
Summary data for year end 2001 are shown for comparison.
Metric units are used throughout.
The figures used to calculate Rio Tintos share of reserves are often more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.

f Analyses of coal from the US and Indonesia Kaltim Prima were undertaken according to American Standard Testing Methods ASTM on an As Received moisture basis whereas the coals from Australia have been analysed on an Air Dried moisture basis according to Australian Standards AS.
MJ kg megajoules per kilogramme.
g Rio Tinto increased its stake in Coal & Allied from 72.7 per cent to 75.7 per cent on 17 September 2002. h On 14 March 2002, Coal & Allied completed the sale of its interest in Narama and Ravensworth.
Coal & Allied sold its interest in the Moura coal mine with effect from 24 May 2002. i Reserves at Warkworth have increased following additional exploration and the development of a new geological model and mine plan.
j Marketable reserves at Sangatta have decreased following development of a new geological model and life of mine plan.
k Kennecott Energy has a partnership interest in the Colowyo mine, but, as it is responsible under a management agreement for the operation of the mine, all of Colowyos reserves are included in Rio Tintos share shown above.
l Marketable reserves at Fort Union have changed following the re-classification of all reserves as resources.
m Reserves have increased following the acquisition of the North Jacobs Ranch lease and a private lease.
n The term other undeveloped reserves is used here to describe material that is economically viable on the basis of technical and economic studies but for which mining and processing permits have yet to be requested or obtained.
There is a reasonable, but not absolute, certainty that the necessary permits will be issued and that mining can proceed when required.
o Marketable reserves at Gokwe North have been reclassified as measured resources in order to more accurately meet the requirements of the JORC code.
p Rio Tinto signed a non binding letter of intent on 15 January 2003 to sell its 25 per cent interest in Minera Alumbrera together with its wholly owned Peak Gold Mine.
q At Escondida, changes in the ore reserves result from a combination of changes to the geological model, application of more rigorous reserve classification, addition of new ore types, changes in recovery factors due to implementation of new long term metallurgical performance predictive models and recalculation of economic pit shells and associated cut off grades.
Previously reported low grade sulphide ore has been renamed low grade float.
A mixed ore reserve is quoted for the first time, reflecting inclusion of this ore type in the mine plan.
r Changes in the ore reserves at Fortaleza are a result of the downgrading of most of the north area from probable ore reserves to indicated resources, revision of ore reserves in the central area and the implementation of a new dilution model.
s Rio Tinto is entitled to a share in metal production from Freeports Grasberg operations due to its direct shareholding in Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold FCX.
In addition, under the terms of a joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto and FCX, Rio Tinto is entitled to a direct 40 per cent share in reserves discovered after 31 December 1994.
Rio Tintos share of reserves due to these two entitlements are shown separately.
t Following negotiations with Foskor, 12 million tonnes of the surface sulphide stockpile has now been re-allocated to Palabora.
Palabora retains the right to purchase copper from the remaining 30.3 million tonnes of stockpiled material that belongs to Foskor.
u Rio Tintos interest in the Argyle Diamond mine increased from 99.8 per cent to 100 per cent on 29 April 2002, following the purchase of the outstanding units in the Western Australian Diamond Trust.
v At Cortez, ore reserves have increased as a result of the transfer of material from mineral resources.
w Proved reserves at Kelian, Lihir and Ranger #3 include 12.9, 25.8 and 7.1 million tonnes respectively stockpiled at the end of December 2002 for future treatment.
At Kelian, reserves have decreased as a result of development of a new resource model and changes to the final pit design.
At Lihir, reserves have increased following additional drilling and significant remodelling of the Lienetz deposit.
x Reserves at Peak include the individual deposits of Peak, New Occidental, Perseverance and New Cobar.
y At Rawhide, mining operations have ceased and processing of stockpiled ore is planned to continue until April 2003.
Heap leaching operations are scheduled to continue for a further four years.
z Reserves at Eastern Range are shown for the first time.
This deposit was previously included in the reserves for Paraburdoo, one of the Hamersley Iron mines.
aa Reserves shown for Hamersley Irons wholly owned operating mines are quoted by material type for the first time.
In addition, some reserves from Paraburdoo have been transferred to the separate Eastern Range mine.
bb The reserves of pisolite ore at Yandicoogina are quoted for the first time and are being stockpiled for future processing.
cc Rio Tinto increased its shareholding in Iron Ore Company of Canada from 56.1 per cent to 58.7 per cent on 20 December 2002. dd Comprises reserves at QIT-Fer et Titane Rio Tinto 100 per cent and Richards Bay Minerals RBM Rio Tinto 50 per cent.
ee Significant changes to the Ore Reserves at Rssing have resulted from the combination of several factors: inclusion of additional drilling information, changes in the estimation methodology, changes to the Ore Reserve Mineral Resource classification scheme, modified economic cut off parameters and changes to the pit limits due to economic and geotechnical factors.
Rio Tinto 2002 Annual report and financial statements 19 ORE RESERVES Mineral resources As required by the Australian Stock Exchange, the following tables contain details of other mineralisation that has the potential to become economic in the future but which is not yet classified as proved or probable reserves.
This material is defined as mineral resources under the JORC Code.
Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors.
While in the judgement of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the mineral resources will eventually become proved or probable reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.
Resources are stated as additional to the reserves reported earlier.
