The performance condition approved by Logica shareholders in 1998 was that growth in EPS should be a minimum of UK RPI plus 7% per annum for each year of the three-year period following the date of grant for the award of matched shares to vest in full.

This performance condition was applied to awards granted in 1998 and 1999.
For awards granted in 2000 and 2001, the performance criteria required EPS growth to be a minimum of UK RPI plus 12% per annum in each year of the three-year period following the date of grant for the award of matched shares to vest in full.
Between 20% and 100% of the shares may again be released on a sliding scale provided EPS growth exceeded UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
