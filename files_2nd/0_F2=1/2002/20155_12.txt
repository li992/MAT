Subject to annual appointment by shareholders, auditor performance is monitored on an on-going basis and formally reviewed every five years, the next review being scheduled for 2003.
Safeguards have been put in place to reduce the likelihood of compromising auditor independence, including the following principles which are applied in respect of services provided by the auditors and other accounting firms.
Services required to be undertaken by the auditors, which include regulatory returns and formalities relating to borrowings, shareholder and other circulars.
This work is normally allocated directly to the auditors.
Services which it is most efficient for the auditors to provide.
In this case, information relating to the service is largely derived from the Companys audited financial records, for example, corporate tax services.
This work is normally allocated to the auditors subject to consideration of any impact on their independence.
Services that could be provided by a number of firms including general consultancy work.
All significant consultancy projects are normally put out to tender and work would be allocated to the auditors only if it did not present a potential threat to the independence of the audit team.
Other services under this category include due diligence within the investment process.
If this service were to be provided by the auditors, the specific team engaged would be independent of the audit team.
The Audit and Compliance Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the independence and objectivity of the Companys auditors.
It reviews the nature and extent of the services provided by them, the level of their fees and the element comprising non-audit fees.
It also monitors compliance with the above principles.
Auditors In accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Companys auditors will be put to members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
