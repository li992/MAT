S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 R EVIEW OF O PERATIONS continued USA Paginations and pricing in this market have both been affected by the fall in advertising expenditure resulting from the reduction in internet related activity and the events of September 11.
In conjunction with our businesses serving the direct response and commercial markets in the USA, we have concentrated on the development and sale of value added services to our publication customers.
We have won additional work from existing customers such as Editorial Televisa and Ideas and Capital, part of the Cond Nast Group.
M ULTIMEDIA Levels of activity in music and multimedia markets throughout the year were at an unprecedented low across our entire customer base due to a dearth of blockbuster new titles and disappointing high street sales.
Few of the major releases that did occur achieved their expected levels of unit sales.
As a result, we experienced a significant reduction in revenue from CD-related products for both the music and computer games markets, which was only partly offset by growth in DVD volumes.
Despite the reduction in volumes and the resultant ercely competitive pricing, we were successful in at least maintaining market share.
In response to these market conditions, we took steps to reduce capacity at our sites in Tunbridge Wells and Uden.
At the end of the financial year our factory at Blackburn was successfully relocated to a larger and more suitable long leasehold site nearby, which will afford more scope for growth in the coming years.
The lack of visibility afforded by this market makes it difficult to achieve satisfactory utilisation of our equipment and people.
Accordingly we have recruited additional sales people to target product areas which complement those we currently supply and have had some early success from this initiative.
