In September 2001, Hays Mail and Express was awarded the first ever licence to compete with Royal Mail.
The licence has enabled Hays DX to introduce DX Metro, a pre-8 am direct-to-the-door delivery service to business addresses in central London, Edinburgh and Manchester.
The licence also allows collection of a customers entire mail output.
Using state-of-the-art automation technology, the items that are appropriate for delivery by Hays DX are then extracted, with the residue being forwarded by Royal Mail.
The licence also enables selected customers to receive a door-to-door service, with extended benefits including the ability to follow the path of individual letters, via the web, from origin to destination.
As a result of the licence, major financial services companies such as AXA have returned to Hays DX, attracted by better quality service and lower costs.
In line with our strategy to focus on time critical mail for business-to-business customers, we have applied for a number of long-term licences for specific activities and have recently had our interim licence amended to provide additional services in the event of industrial action from the Universal Service Provider.
However, market development is still impeded by the interim nature of the licences.
We are also continuing to build on the existing Hays DX and Hays Specialist Courier businesses.
Notably, the Inland Revenue has agreed to establish document exchanges at all of their 750 offices, enabling businesses, including accountancy practices, to send documents to these locations, and to each other, using Hays DX.
Major contracts have been signed with Marks & Spencer, Somerfield and Dixons for the movement of inter-branch pouches, parcels and point of sale material.
In addition, the BBC now uses Hays DX to move documents and parcels.
An exciting development in the life sciences sector has been the adoption by DEFRA of a specimen delivery service for the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and new contracts have been won in mailroom management for , Compass and Thomas Cook.
It was an excellent year for Hays DX in Continental Europe, with both the French and Belgian businesses returning to profit after taking firm measures to strengthen their operations.
