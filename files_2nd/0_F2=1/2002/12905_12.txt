Sir Trevor Chinn A career driven by service Sir Trevor Chinn retires as Chairman of RAC plc on 30 April 2003 after 47 years service with Lex and RAC.
Trevor has had a lifelong vision to develop a business with a strong brand founded on customer service.
His passion for promoting service quality in Lex has been well known for many years, and the final part of his vision was achieved when Lex acquired RAC, one of the UKs top brands, in 1999.
As Managing Director and then Chief Executive from 1968 to 1996, Trevor established Lex as a key player in the motoring industry.
His focus on people development has given the business strength and depth in its leadership, while his personal integrity has acted as the rock for the Companys corporate integrity.
As Chairman, Trevor has been an invaluable source of support and advice during Lexs transformation over the past four years from a vehicle distribution group into a unique support services company under the RAC brand.
He hands over a strong and growing company to our Chairman-elect Peter Smith.
On a personal note, Trevors passion for business is inspiring and I am proud to have worked with him over the last seven years.
We wish him continued success with the charitable causes to which he devotes tireless energy, and with his work on the Commission for Integrated Transport and the Motorists Forum, where his knowledge and expertise on transport issues makes a positive contribution to the governments policy development.
