20 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2002 Directors report 11 Purchase and cancellation of Ordinary shares At the 2001 Annual General Meeting shareholders gave the Company renewed authority to purchase a maximum of 7,564,024 shares of 1p each.
During the year under review, the Company purchased and cancelled 847,678 Ordinary shares of 1p each under the authority 2001: nil representing 1.1% of the called up share capital.
The purchase by the Company of its own shares demonstrates the Companys continued commitment to ensuring that its balance sheet is managed in the long term interests of the shareholders.
A resolution seeking renewal of the authority will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
12 Annual General Meeting In addition to resolutions to adopt the accounts, declare a final dividend, re-elect Directors and reappoint the auditors, three further resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The first is to give the Directors general power to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 247,677 equal to approximately 32.9% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority which will lapse at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
The second is to disapply the statutory rights of pre-emption contained in section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to rights issues and issues for cash not exceeding 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power which will terminate at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
The third resolution will renew an existing authority which gives the Company power to purchase its own shares within limits as to number of shares and price.
The Directors will only exercise the authority if they are satisfied that any purchase will increase the earnings per share of the Ordinary share capital in issue and will be in the interests of the shareholders.
Options over 84,000 Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company were outstanding as at 21 June 2002 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report representing 0.11% of the issued share capital of the Company as at that date.
If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under the proposed resolution, the options outstanding as at 21 June 2002 would represent 0.12% of the Ordinary share capital in issue following such exercise.
13 Auditors KPMG Audit plc have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company and, in accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing their re-appointment will be put to the members at the Annual General Meeting.
