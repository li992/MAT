It is, therefore, Group policy to agree terms of payment in advance, to ensure suppliers are made aware of those terms and to abide by such terms.
Unless other terms have been agreed the Group will usually ensure that all creditors, where the goods or works have been of a satisfactory quantity and quality, are paid by the end of the month following the month in which the invoice is received.

Should any employee become disabled it is the Groups policy to continue where possible the employment of that person and to provide equal opportunities for the career development of employees with disabilities.
There is an ongoing commitment to the training and development of the Groups employees and there is a positive approach to all matters concerning Health & Safety at work.
The Group regards compliance with statutory requirements as a minimum standard and a copy of the Groups formal Health & Safety Policy Statement is available at all Group construction sites.

The Groups ability to achieve its commercial objectives and to meet the needs of its customers in a profitable and competitive manner depends on the contribution of employees throughout the Group.

In many areas ongoing programmes, focused on quality and customer service, provide an opportunity for employees to be involved in making improvements.
Financial participation is encouraged through the Groups SAYE share option scheme and the AESOP SIP scheme, providing employees with the opportunity to have a direct stake in the growth and prosperity of the business.
