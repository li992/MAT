Directors Report The Directors submit their annual report together with the accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2002.
Results and dividends The revenue available for equity Shareholders for the year amounted to 12,051,000.
Three interim dividends of 3.45p per share each were paid on 16 August 2002, 15 November 2002 and 17 February 2003.
The Directors now recommend a final dividend of 5.95p per Ordinary share, payable on 23 May 2003 to Ordinary Shareholders on the register at close of business on 25 April 2003, making a total distribution to Ordinary Shareholders of 14,113,000.
The sum of 2,001,000 has been deducted from the Companys revenue reserve.
The Directors also recommend: 1 that three interim dividends each of 3.45p per share on the Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in issue on 27 June 2003 be paid on 15 August 2003, 17 November 2003 and 16 February 2004 to the persons who, at the close of business on 25 July 2003, 17 October 2003 and 16 January 2004 respectively, are the holders of such shares.
2 the distribution to B Ordinary Shareholders by way of capitalisation of reserves of 4.62299 B Ordinary shares created as fully paid for every 100 B Ordinary shares held at the close of business on 25 April 2003.
This capitalisation issue is in accordance with the dividend provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company and is equivalent in asset value to the final and interim dividends now recommended on the Ordinary shares but excluding any tax credit thereon.
Subject to the approval of Shareholders, definitive certificates in respect of the capitalisation issue will be posted on 23 May 2003.
Applications will be made to the UK Listing Authority for 52,548 B Ordinary shares of 25p each to be admitted to the Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for admission to trading.
Dealings are expected to commence on 28 May 2003.
7 to approve the above distribution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting, as printed in the Notice of Meeting on page 51.
The Net Asset Value per Ordinary and B Ordinary share at 31 December 2002 was 352.8p 2001 468.1p.
Share repurchases The principal aim of a share buy-back facility is to enhance shareholder value by acquiring shares at a discount to Net Asset Value, as and when the Directors consider this to be appropriate.
By utilising the power to purchase shares when they are trading at a discount to Net Asset Value per share, the resulting Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Ordinary and B Ordinary Shareholders should increase.
Any purchase of shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
Under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the maximum price that may be paid on the exercise of this authority must not exceed 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the shares over the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase.
The minimum price which may be paid will be 25p per share.
Shares which are purchased will be cancelled.
It is currently proposed that the purchase of shares by the Company will be made from the realised capital reserve of the Company.
The purchase price will normally be paid out of the cash balances held by the Company from time to time.
8, in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, will be put to Shareholders for their approval to renew the authority to purchase in the market a maximum of 14.99% of shares in issue on 22 Murray International Trust PLC Directors Report 14 March 2003 12,947,010 Ordinary shares and 170,386 B Ordinary shares.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means in effect that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, share repurchases totalling 2,062,000 Ordinary shares 2.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital at 31 December 2001 took place at an average share price of 369.1p within the established guidelines.
From the date of renewal of the authority at the Annual General Meeting on 13 May 2002 to 14 March 2003, 845,000 Ordinary shares 0.97% of the issued Ordinary share capital at 13 May 2002 and 0.96% of the issued Ordinary share capital at 31 December 2001 were bought back at an average share price of 319.8p within the established guidelines.
In addition, during the year ended 31 December 2002, 79,947 B Ordinary shares 6.7% of the issued B Ordinary share capital at 31 December 2001 were bought back at an average share price of 445p.
Following these repurchases, the issued Ordinary share capital as at 14 March 2003 amounted to 86,370,984 Ordinary shares of 25p each and 1,136,666 B Ordinary shares of 25p each.
Issue of shares In terms of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, the Directors may not allot unissued shares unless so authorised by the Companys Shareholders.
9 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, will therefore give the Directors the necessary authority to allot the unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,093,845 equivalent to 4,375,382 Ordinary shares and B Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued Ordinary and B Ordinary share capital at 14 March 2003.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of the passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
When shares are to be allotted for cash, Section 89 1 of the Act provides that existing Shareholders have preemption rights and that the new shares are offered first to such Shareholders in proportion to their existing holding of Ordinary shares.
However Shareholders can, by special resolution, authorise the Directors to allot shares otherwise than by a pro rata issue to existing Shareholders.
10 will, if passed, also give the Directors power to allot for cash, equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,093,845 as if Section 89 1 did not apply.
This is the same amount of share capital which the Directors are seeking the authority to allot pursuant to Resolution No.
This authority will also expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months, whichever is the earlier.
This authority will not be used in connection with a rights issue by the Company.
The Directors intend to use the authority given by Resolution No.
10 to disapply pre-emption rights only in circumstances where this will be clearly beneficial to Shareholders.
As such, issues will only be made where shares can be issued at a premium of 2.5 per cent or over to Net Asset Value.
At present, the Companys Ordinary shares are available under the Savings Schemes operated by the Aberdeen Group.
In circumstances where the share price of the Company stands at a premium of 2.5 per cent or over to Net Asset Value, it may be advantageous for the Company to issue new shares directly to participants in the Savings Plans or to other prospective purchasers.
As such issues would only be made at prices greater than Net Asset Value, they would increase the assets underlying each share.
The issue proceeds would be available for investment in line with the Companys investment policy.
No issue of shares will be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without the prior approval of Shareholders in a general meeting.
