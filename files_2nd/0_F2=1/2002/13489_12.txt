Outlook As we look ahead, a number of our key markets face considerable economic uncertainty.
Trading in 2002 was weaker in the second half than in the first, and we expect broadly similar conditions in the first half of 2003 as in the second half of 2002.
This economic fragility might well be compounded as a result of events in Iraq, either through the impact of high oil prices or lower consumer confidence.
However, reduced net debt, lower interest rates, refocusing on our core businesses and the performance improvement measures now being implemented should assist us to counter the downward pressures we face in key markets during the course of 2003.
Any improvement in trading conditions is likely to come in the second half of the year.
