Continental Europe Portfolio Review As with other areas, it has been a turbulent year for the European markets.
Technology has borne the brunt of the weakness and, until early May, many of the more traditional quality growth companies had held up relatively well.
European economies have also been experiencing lower rates of growth, but just as the boom was not as dynamic, so the recession has so far been somewhat milder than that seen in the US.
As we write this report, it is also encouraging to note that European economies are now showing good signs of recovery, interestingly, coincident with the US recovery rather than with a nine-month delay.
Portfolio Comment The percentage of the fund invested in Continental Europe has declined to 15%, the lowest for some years.
We have also cut back on the number of holdings, with only 26 compared to 36 a year ago.
Our intention has been to have larger positions in mid cap, well-managed and soundly financed companies.
As we reported last year, in the European part of the portfolio we have tried to concentrate on what we have considered to be reliable growth companies on a reasonable valuation level.
Technology stocks have continued to disappoint and the combination of declining rather than growing profits coupled with the markets unwillingness to pay a multiple of the growth rate has been devastating for many stocks.
To a large extent we have avoided the worst of this in the European area, particularly in the second half of the Companys financial year, with both Ericsson and Nokia sold at significantly higher levels.
