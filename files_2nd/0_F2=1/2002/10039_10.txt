18 FOCUS ON AFTERMARKET From the date a first plane goes into service until the last one retires, it would not be unusual for a typical commercial aircraft type to be in service for 50 years.
Military programmes can last even longer.
Meggitt products and systems feature on virtually all military and civil aircraft.
Once installed, we look after that technology for the rest of its natural life.
We are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, responding over a 50-year cycle with product support all over the world.
Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2002 19 Current civil and military aftermarket business derives from previous years original equipment contracts.
We always have an eye to the future, of course, constantly seeking products that work harder, for longer, in extreme environmentsready to earn their place on tomorrows airframes.
The new product development we undertake today enables us to win the original equipment contracts that will generate the aftermarket sales of tomorrow.
Thats why, as military and civil airframe build rates ebb and flow, our involvement with the worlds aerospace industry scarcely falters.
