Members of the Friends Provident group will abstain from voting on such ordinary resolution.
Power to issue ordinary shares Special resolution 14 will be put to the Annual General Meeting to renew the present power to allot ordinary share capital for cash without first being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders.
Such power will cover a maximum of 14,942.197 of unissued ordinary share capital and, if renewed, will apply to any ordinary shares issued in accordance with the relationship agreement referred to above conditional upon the passing of the ordinary resolution referred to above, any ordinary shares issued pursuant to a rights issue or other pre-emptive offering and otherwise to ordinary shares representing 5% of the companys issued ordinary share capital as at the date of this report.
The directors consider that such power is necessary in order to take advantage of opportunities as they arise and to retain exibility.

If the outstanding amount of the existing buy-back authority is utilised in full prior to the 2003 AGM and if the buy-back authority is renewed at the 2003 AGM and is then utilised in full, the options outstanding at 4 March 2003 would represent 4.8% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company.
While the directors recognise that, due to the free oat requirements, the scope for buy-backs may currently be limited, recent events have focused attention on having in place the power to take action in terms of buying back shares where circumstances exist where the board believe that future shareholder returns can be enhanced by taking such action.
This authority, if renewed, will only be exercised if to do so would result in an increase in earnings per ordinary share and if it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
During the year to 31 December 2002 no share buy-backs were undertaken by the company.
ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 33 Report of the Directors Reduction of share premium account At the Annual General Meeting held on 19 April 2002 shareholders approved a 20 million reduction in the share premium account of the company which, subject to the usual court approval, was converted into a new special distributable reserve of the company to be used for the purposes of purchases of its own shares or future dividend payments.
The order from the Court of Session was received by the company on 4 September 2002 and lodged with the Registrar of Companies on 6 September 2002 at which time the reduction took effect.
In similar fashion to last year, special resolution 16 in the Notice of AGM is a special resolution to further reduce the share premium account of the company.
The company currently has approximately 17 million standing to the credit of its share premium account.
Your directors are recommending that the amount standing to the credit of the share premium account be reduced by 15 million and that the amount of such reduction, subject to the usual court approval, be used by the company for the purposes of purchases of its own shares or dividend payments in the future.
This will result in a reduction of the share premium account from approximately 17 million to approximately 2 million.
Subject to special resolution 16 being passed, application will be made to the Court of Session in Edinburgh to confirm the reduction.
This conrmation must be granted before the reduction of the share premium account can become effective.
The Court of Session will need to be satisfied that the interests of the companys creditors will not be prejudiced as a result of the reduction.
The company anticipates that it may be able to satisfy the Court of Session that its liquid assets are sufficient to ensure that the creditors of the company are not prejudiced by the proposed reduction of its share premium account.
If it is unable to do so, the company will take such alternative steps as may be required by the Court of Session for the protection of its creditors.
The reduction will only take effect once the order of the Court of Session conrming the reduction has been lodged with the Registrar of Companies.
