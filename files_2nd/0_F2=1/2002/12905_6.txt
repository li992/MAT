Simon Danzine right from Buckinghamshire has been an RAC member for two years.
He joined RAC when he passed his driving test because most of his family are members and he was attracted by the companys reputation for quality of service.
Simon also insures his car with RAC.
Ive found RAC to be reliable, professional and easily accessible, says Simon.
Most of my family are with RAC and I felt it was important to go with a good name.
I went to RAC for both breakdown cover and insurance because it was very straightforward.
I also like to know that I can go abroad and Im covered instantly.
RAC contact centre colleagues like Emma Brown, left, make it easy for our 2.15 million members to renew their membership each year and to buy additional services quickly and simply by phone.
