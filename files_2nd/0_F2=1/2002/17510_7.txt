The downturn in the US economy, specifically in the automotive market, and the continued growth of Chinese exports of magnesium 18% up between January and November 2002 at prices well below that of US magnesium suppliers, have pushed down magnesium prices further during 2002.
The most dramatic change in prices has been for Western grades of pure and alloy magnesium, where prices have fallen by up to US$0.2 per pound since the beginning of 2002.
Following consideration of the outlook and options available for the plant, the Board of Xstrata plc has decided to record a total impairment charge of US$22.2 million, reducing the carrying value of the magnesium business to nil at 31 December 2002.
As indicated in the Interim Report in July 2002, a new chief executive was appointed from Xstrata Alloys at the half-year, to expedite the plants commissioning and to undertake a thorough review of Xstrata Magnesiums business plan.
While the operational problems have been resolved, enabling the line to produce at design capacity, and while the high quality of its product was confirmed by extensive automotive certication leading to a full order book for 2003, ongoing ownership of the facility is not consistent with Xstratas strategy of not investing in smaller, niche businesses.
Xstrata has been approached by various parties to discuss a possible sale of the business, and the management of Xstrata Magnesium is pursuing several initiatives to maximise a possible exit value.
The net impact of any such exit is unlikely to be material in the context of the Groups accounts.
52 Xstrata plc corporate social involvement CSI In keeping with our mission, Xstrata recognises that genuine partnerships with stakeholders, and with local communities in particular, are an essential part of business success.
Each business therefore devotes time, effort and resources to engage as a good corporate citizen with the wider society of which it is a part.
From 2003, the Xstrata Group has committed to set aside an amount each year, the minimum of which will be based on 1% of the previous years profit before tax, to support its corporate social involvement CSI.
This will be allocated by the Group Executive Committee, as part of the business plan approval process, to fund the initiatives of the commodity businesses, as well as those funded directly from the corporate centre.
The Group made charitable donations totalling US$634,000 in 2002.
A wide range of initiatives and projects are supported by the Groups CSI policy: enterprise and job creation environment education development health culture and art.
Xstrata does not provide support for the following: political parties individuals church religious activities which are exclusive to a one faith community.
Funding priority is given to those projects associated with Xstrata companies and employees, or with areas linked to our operations.
Recognising its greater social and developmental needs, some 90% of Group CSI expenditure is earmarked for South Africa.
Given their scale, Xstratas CSI initiatives in South Africa are the responsibility of a Director Corporate Development, who reports directly to the Chief Executives of Xstrata Alloys and Xstrata Coal South Africa and who is also responsible for a range of transformation programmes associated with the governments Empowerment Charter.
Further information on the Groups CSI policies and projects is set out in the separately published HSE, Labour & Community Report available on the Groups website.
