Our 1,350 RAC patrols, like Richard Callam right, attend on average nearly 7,000 customers at the roadside every day.
The circumstances of each breakdown are as individual as our members.
Sometimes the situation can be dramatic, but more often what delights our customers is simply the straightforward story of a patrol arriving on time, nding the problem and xing it quickly so that they can get on with their day.
Our investment in people, training and systems supports us in doing this.
Margaret Harrison, a member for 5 years, called out RAC in January 2002 when her car wouldnt start.
A patrol arrived within 30 minutes, xed the problem and she went ahead with her journey as planned.
There was no fuss, she says, I rang RAC, they sent out a very nice patrolman and he sorted out my car right away.
I was very pleased with the service, it was exactly what I had expected from RAC.
