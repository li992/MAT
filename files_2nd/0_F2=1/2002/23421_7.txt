Investment Managers Review Portfolio Portfolio Review New Investments Under Electra's investment policy, investments can be made to enhance or protect the value of existing portfolio companies and also in new situations outside the current portfolio.
The majority of these new situations are anticipated to be in funds managed by Electra Partners or in private equity opportunities generated by Electra Partners.
Over the year to 30 September 2002, total investment amounted to 116 million of which 42 million was in new investments and 74 million was in existing portfolio companies.
The largest single new investment was made in Esporta, one of the market leaders in the operation of premium health clubs with 60 clubs in the UK and Continental Europe.
Previously a listed company, Esporta was acquired by a private equity entity and subsequently purchased the whole of Electra's interest in Invicta.
As part of this transaction Electra acquired 26.0 million in equity and Over the year to 30 September loan securities in Esporta.
Other new investments included 5.7 million in 2002, total investment amounted Hemingway for the purpose of acquiring a portfolio of commercial properties.
In to 116 million... addition to these new investments, commitments were made to Electra Partners European buy-out fund 19 million and to the Property Venture Capital Fund 15 million, a property fund co-managed by Electra Partners.
During the year 5.7 million was drawn down in respect of the European buy-out fund, to purchase an interest in five buy-out transactions.
Of the 74 million invested in existing portfolio companies, 40 million was invested to finance acquisitions by portfolio companies or to acquire additional equity and 34 million was invested principally for the purpose of securing new financing arrangements.

This has provided Energy Power Resources with significant opportunities to create value in the future and has greatly enhanced the company's prospects.
Support was given to Deutsche Woolworth, Swifty Serve, Inchcape Shipping Services and International Garden Products to facilitate reconstruction of the companies or their finances.
In the case of Deutsche Woolworth the capital injection was provided through the purchase of seven properties from that company through a new investment in Forthpanel.
Electra Investment Trust PLC 15 Investment Managers Review Portfolio Realisations Realisations from the portfolio amounted to 137 million during the year, an amount equal to 18.1% of the opening portfolio.
This compared to 167 million in the previous year or 16.4% of the portfolio at the beginning of that year.
Thus although the value of realisations fell during the year the percentage of the opening portfolio realised was marginally higher.
Although market conditions remain unfavourable, progress continues to be made in realising the portfolio.
During the year 68 million was realised from the sale of unlisted companies, 28 million from the sale of previously restricted listed securities, 23 million through redemption of loans and 18 million was returned from private equity funds.
The largest disposal involved Electra's investment in Invicta Leisure which was sold to Esporta for 39.4 million of which 26 million was reinvested in equity and loans of the purchaser.
A portion of the loans may be redeemed if a refinancing of Esporta is completed in the future.
Other significant disposals included Merlin Communications 15.2 million and Fairbridge Estates 10.3 million.
In September 2002 Electra disposed of its interest in Porter & Haylett, one of the oldest investments in the portfolio.
This company was sold to First Choice for a consideration of 5.9 million which compared to its book value immediately prior to disposal of 3.5 million.... Electra's portfolio performed Realisations of Unlisted Investments Year to 30 September robustly.

Against this background Electra's portfolio performed robustly.
The net decrease in valuation of 47 million was equivalent to a reduction in the portfolio of 6.2% compared to a fall in the FTSE All-Share Index of 23.0%.
Investments realised from the portfolio continued to show an increase over book value.
In the case of direct unlisted investments aggregate proceeds of sale exceeded the book value by 24%.
Net profits realised on the disposal of investments amounted to 13 million during the year.
This was however offset by a 57 million reduction in unrealised appreciation in relation to unlisted investments and a 3 million reduction in the value of restricted listed securities.

The performance of the portfolio depends largely on the valuations of these twenty investments.
Two of these investments, Esporta and Forthpanel, were valued at cost in view of their recent acquisition.
Five of these investments were written up over the year to reflect their individual circumstances.
Investments written up included Heath Lambert and Vendcrown which were revalued by 7.3 million and 5.7 million respectively to reflect profit improvements resulting from buoyant conditions in the insurance sector.
Leiner Health Products, a US investment was written up by 5.7 million in view of a successful restructuring and Freightliner was revalued by 5.8 million to reflect on improvement in profit and cash position.
Five of the top twenty investments were reduced in value to reflect reductions in earnings multiples used for valuation purposes.
The reduction in the valuation of Amtico by 5.9 million was the most significant of these.
Five portfolio companies including Baxi, Allflex and Safety-Kleen Europe remained at the same valuation throughout the year as the reduction in earnings multiples used to value the Electra Investment Trust PLC 17 Investment Managers Review Portfolio investment was offset by increases in earnings and debt reductions, or as in the case of Agricola, the investment continued to be valued at the redemption value of Electra's loan notes.
Of the remaining companies in the top twenty, Deutsche Woolworth, which is in a turnaround phase, continued to be valued at a significant discount to its attributable net assets while Inchcape Shipping Services has been valued at significant discount to cost until the success of its current operations has become more established.
Outside the top twenty investments a number of provisions were made against portfolio companies.
The largest of these was a 23 million reduction in the valuation of Swifty Serve, a US convenience store chain with 550 stores and a turnover of circa $1 billion.
Over the past twelve months the company had been undergoing an extensive restructuring programme and substantial progress had been achieved.
However, delays with the bank restructuring led to a reduction of supplier credit and the necessity for Swifty Serve to file for bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11.
Electra's investment was substantially written down to reflect this change of circumstances.
The valuations of four private equity funds in South America were reduced by 50% during the year with an aggregate provision of 13.3 million.
At 30 September 2002, 56% of the portfolio was valued on an earnings basis, 10% was valued against listed prices and 6% on a cost basis where the investment has been acquired within the previous 12 months.
Of the remaining investments 12% represented private equity funds at the relevant managers' valuation, 10% at cost less provision and 6% on other valuation bases.
