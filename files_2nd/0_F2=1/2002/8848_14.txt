Remuneration Report Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Pensions Pensions and life assurance benefits for executive directors are provided through the companys final salary occupational pension scheme for UK employees The Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS which is constituted under a separate Trust Deed.
JMEPS is an exempt approved scheme under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and its members are contracted-out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
The pensions benefits earned by the executive directors are as follows: Total Increase in Directors Increase in accrued the transfer Years of contribution accrued pension at value as at FURBS FURBS Age as at service at to JMEPS pension 31st March 31st March contribution related tax 4 2 1 3 6 6 31st March 31st March in the year in the year 2002 2002 in the year payments 2002 2002 000 000 000 000 000 000 C R N Clark 60 39 17 42 371 705 N A N A N A P Carson 44 21 8 13 82 104 N A N A D W Morgan 44 13 4 3 26 21 40 27 J N Sheldrick 52 11 4 3 31 36 66 44 D G Titcombe 59 41 12 21 203 333 N A N A Notes: 1 The entitlement shown under Total accrued pension at 31st March 2002 is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to 31st March 2002.
The pension would however be subject to an actuarial reduction of 0.3% per month for each month that retirement precedes age 60.
2 The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
3 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note 11 less directors contributions.
No allowance has been made in the transfer values for any discretionary benefits that have been or may be awarded under JMEPS.
4 Members contributions are at the general scheme rate of 4% of pensionable pay, i. e. basic salary excluding bonuses.
5 On the recommendation of the actuary, the company has suspended contributions to JMEPS until the next actuarial valuation.
6 The JMEPS benefits and contributions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick are restricted by reference to the earnings cap imposed by the Finance Act No.
Contributions have therefore been paid to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme FURBS established by the company, independently of JMEPS, with effect from 1st April 2000.
The purpose of the FURBS is to provide retirement and death benefits in relation to basic salary in excess of the earnings cap on the same basis as the JMEPS.
Because the FURBS is not exempt approved under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988, payments have been made to meet the tax liabilities in respect of these contributions.
