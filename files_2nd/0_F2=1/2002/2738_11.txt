In India and Bangladesh absolute title to any hydrocarbon reserves is vested in the host government.
However, under the terms of the PSCs, Cairn is entitled to receive a share of the hydrocarbon production and associated revenues.
Group reserves have, therefore, been presented both on a direct working interest basis and a direct entitlement basis.
The direct entitlement basis takes into account projections of government share of production calculated in accordance with certain price and expenditure assumptions.
Direct working interest basis is Cairns share of production calculated by reference to our joint venture participating interest as shown in the table on the following page.
Total production by region during the year in the table above differs from the total production for the year as stated in the financial review 8,051 Mboe due to condensate production not being included in booked reserves.
