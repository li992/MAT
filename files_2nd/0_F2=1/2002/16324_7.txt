In the event of early termination, it is the Committees policy that the amount of compensation paid to executive Directors will be considered in light of all the relevant circumstances, subject to the overriding caveats that: the Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance: the duty of the relevant executive Director to mitigate his loss will be taken into account: and no compensation payment can exceed one years salary.
