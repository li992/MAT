Resolution number 10 purchase of own shares by the Company The Companys articles of association permit the purchase of the Companys own shares for cancellation, subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts.
The Directors consider it desirable, and in the Companys interests, for shareholders to grant the Company authority to exercise this power, within certain limits, to enable it to purchase its own shares in the market.
We undertake that the authority will only be exercised if we are satisfied that the purchase will result in an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders generally.
We propose an authority for the Company to purchase its own shares in the market, up to a total of 11,063,978 ordinary shares of 29.5p each, having an aggregate nominal value of 3,263,873, being 14.99% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 28 September 2002.
