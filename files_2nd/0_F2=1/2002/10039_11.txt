While the subject of numerous refinements over the years, many of its distinguishing features have never been bettered and the product is still providing outstanding service on thousands of Boeing aircraft worldwide.
Like Boeing, all our customers are distinguished and our relationships with them longstanding.
Their performance requirements, in a market which demands the highest standards of resilience and utilisation from safe products and systems, are stringent.
Suppliers must not only create innovative products and be quick to solve technical problems.
They must meet the high management and service standards required to deliver the kind of complex products we make, on time, on budget and to the required specification.
We are proud to meet those standards consistently.
As you can see, while some of our relationships are decades old, others are, relatively speaking, just starting.
We work with younger companies involving brand-new applications for core technologyat the forefront of pacemaker development, for example, using the world class sensors expertise of our electronics division.
