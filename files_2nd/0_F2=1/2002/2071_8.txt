CUSTOMER SECTOR GROUP REVIEW Aluminium Results Alumina production increased from 2.9 million tonnes to 3.9 million tonnes, mainly attributable to the acquisition in Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBIT excluding exceptional items were US$492 million, compared with US$523 million in January 2001 of an additional 56 per cent interest in Worsley, 2001, a decrease of US$31 million or 6 per cent.
taking our stake to 86 per cent.
Development activities The main reasons for the decrease were lower LME prices and We strengthened our position as one of the leading low-cost lower production from the Brazilian operations, due to temporary producers of aluminium through our commitment to brownfield power rationing imposed by the Brazilian Government.
These expansions at Hillside and Mozal.

Project construction commenced in April 2002, with first production planned for the 2004 financial year.
The expansion Markets and operations will increase our production at Hillside by 25 per cent 132 000 The year witnessed the largest percentage decline in global tonnes over current levels, at a projected cost of US$449 million.
The aluminium market remains in surplus, with LME stocks progressively increasing from Mozal is one of the lowest-cost producers of aluminium in the 600 000 tonnes at the start of July 2001 to approximately world.
With our partners, we are now in the process of doubling 1.2 million tonnes at the end of June 2002.
