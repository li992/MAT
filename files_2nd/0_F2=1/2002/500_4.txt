Special Business Directors Fees Resolution 8 proposes that the Company exercises its power under Article 96 of its Articles of Association to increase the aggregate amount of annual fees payable to its Directors from 200,000 to 300,000.
The Board believes that this increase is required in order to allow sufficient fees to remunerate its Non-executive Directors as the existing limit for fees was set in 1997 and during 2002 the role of Chairman became Non-executive.
Executive Share Option Schemes Resolution 9 proposes minor amendments to the Executive Share Option Schemes the effect of which will be that options may be granted to participants up to six months prior to their expected retirement date, as opposed to two years as is currently the case.
This proposed change is explained more fully on page 33 of the Remuneration Report.
Power to Allot Securities Resolution 10 proposes, as an ordinary resolution, to authorise the Directors to exercise the powers of the Company to allot relevant securities.
This resolution is limited to shares with a nominal value of 16,380,000, which is approximately 30% of the issued share capital, and replaces the authority granted by Shareholders on 29 April 1998 which will expire on 28 April 2003.
The authority under this resolution would expire on the earlier of 29 April 2008 and the date of the Annual General Meeting in that year.
Allotment for Cash Resolution 11 proposes as a special resolution to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights of Shareholders on allotment of equity securities for cash up to a limit of a total of shares with a nominal value of 2,678,000, being approximately 5% of the current issued share capital.
The resolution also disapplies these rights to the extent necessary to facilitate rights issues.
The authority under this resolution would expire on the date of the Annual General Meeting in 2004 or on 29 July 2004, whichever is the earlier.
This resolution is on the same basis as approved last year and the Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
Purchase of Own Shares The final item of special business is the Directors recommendation that Shareholders renew the authority of the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares as permitted under Article 7 of its Articles of Association.
Accordingly, Resolution 12 will be proposed as a special resolution seeking authority to make such purchases in the market.
The Directors will only use such authority when they consider it to be in the best interests of Shareholders generally and an improvement in earnings per share would result.
Any ordinary shares purchased under this authority will be cancelled and the number of ordinary shares in issue will be reduced accordingly.
Resolution 12 species the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased representing approximately 10% of the Companys existing issued ordinary share capital and the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought, reecting the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and of the Financial Services Authority, as set out in the Listing Rules.
The Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
