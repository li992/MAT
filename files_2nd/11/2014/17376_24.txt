We believe that this, in conjunction with the five-year performance period under our long-term incentive plans, the deferral of at least half the annual bonus into WPP shares and the personal shareholdings of our executive directors will afford considerable protection of share owner interests over the long-term.

WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2014 127 How we behave and how were rewarded Implementation report Statement of share owner voting During the period immediately preceding the 2014 AGM there was limited consultation with share owners due to the extensive consultation that took place prior to the 2013 AGM and since no subsequent changes had been made to the Executive Remuneration Policy or Practices.
The level of voting in favour of the remuneration resolutions was similar to that received in 2013.
While the overall level of support remains lower than we might hope for, the committee remains aware of the reasons why some share owners feel unable to support our resolutions.
In particular, in respect of 2013, some share owners were generally concerned at the overall level of pay for the executive directors.
While large, compensation levels were driven by the maturing of a five-year LEAP award and the rise in the Companys share price.
The committee acknowledges these concerns, but also recognises that the majority of share owners supported the remuneration resolution last year see below and LEAP III when it was approved in 2009.
Furthermore, the committee is content that the LEAP program has performed as intended and in the manner approved, with very strong share returns and share price performance delivering significant value to both share owners and management.

The key financial short-term incentive plan STIP objectives for all the executive directors are consistent with 2013 and provide a robust basis for assessing financial achievement.
As illustrated on page 131, the 2014 financial performance of the Group and WPP Digital was very strong.
For the Group CEO and CFO, strong PBT and net sales growth produced performance above target, achieving 72% and 83% of the maximum award respectively.
The net sales margin resulted in target performance equivalent to 60% of the very ambitious maximum.
WPP Digital performance was very strong against both operating profit and revenue targets and solid against the margin improvement target.

Short-term incentive weightings and measures for 2015 The committee has reviewed the performance objectives and weightings for 2015 to ensure continued alignment with Company strategy.
The weighting of financial objectives 70% and individual strategic objectives 30% will remain unchanged as will the Group financial objectives of Headline PBT growth, net sales margin improvement and net sales growth.
However, the associated targets have been updated to reflect 2015 performance expectations.
Mark Read stood down from the Board of WPP on 1 February 2015.
Therefore, his 2015 objectives will be set in reference to his new role and are out of scope of this report.
As stated in the Executive Remuneration Policy, the committee is of the view that the targets for the STIP are commercially sensitive and it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
To the extent targets are no longer commercially sensitive they will be disclosed at the end of the relevant performance period in that years Annual Report.
WPP 132 ANNUAL REPORT 2014 How we behave and how were rewarded Implementation report Long-term incentives audited 2010 2014 LEAP III awards vesting The 2010 awards were granted under LEAP III, the long-term incentive plan which in 2013 was replaced by the EPSP.
Vesting of awards was solely dependent on WPPs relative TSR performance measured in common currency, against a custom group of WPPs comparators Aegis, Arbitron, Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Omnicom and Publicis weighted by their respective market capitalisation.
Over the five-year investment and performance period, WPP out-performed 91% of the weighted peer group including both Omnicom and Publicis, WPPs largest and most comparable multi-line competitors.
Over the period, WPP delivered TSR of 172.5% which means that a shareholding of 100 at the start of the period would be worth 272.50 at the end, including reinvested dividends.
On a relative basis, underlying financial and operational performance was also strong over the five-year period, consistent with the TSR outcome.
Aegis and Arbitron, two of the comparator companies, were taken over during the investment and performance period by Dentsu and Nielsen, respectively.
In line with the guidelines established by the committee, the two companies remained in the comparator group as they were both listed for more than 40% of the investment and performance period.
Their TSR performance was calculated assuming reinvestment into a synthetic stock of the remaining comparators.
This was with effect from the date immediately before which it was independently determined that the share price was affected by either a takeover premium or speculation.
WPPs TSR performance relative to the comparator group resulted in a match of 500%, equating to 100% of the maximum award.

The 2014 awards are subject to three equally weighted independent performance conditions, being relative TSR, EPS and ROE.
Performance is measured over the five financial years starting in 2014 as follows: Measure Total Shareholder Return TSR Earnings Per Share EPS Return On Equity ROE Weight One-third One-third One-third Nature Relative to peers WPP growth WPP absolute Performance zone Median to upper decile 7% 14% compound annual growth 10% 14% annual average threshold to maximum Payout Below threshold: 0% of element vests Threshold: 20% of element vests Maximum or above: 100% of element vests Straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum Performance period Five years ending on 31 December 2018 As in previous years, WPPs TSR performance is compared to companies representing our most relevant, listed global competitors, weighted by market capitalisation.
In 2014, the comparator group comprised Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis.
TSR performance will be calculated on a market  basis in both common and local currency weighted equally.
Using a dual basis ensures that the interests of both local and international investors are reflected in the performance measures.
The following interests were awarded on 4 June 2014 at the preceding five-day average share price of 12.908 ordinary shares or $107.996 ADRs.

The measures and their respective weightings will not change, nor will the targets or comparator group for the EPS and TSR measures.
The ROE performance range has been increased to an average of 15% 18%, reflecting the strong performance over the last two years and future expectations.
This will be measured as the average annual achievement over the five-year performance period.
