The specic 2014 targets are therefore not disclosed.
However, the following illustrates the performance achieved in the year against the target for each of the four measures.
Individual performance multipliers set for 2014 were also substantially lower than 2013.

Strong sales performances were delivered in several important parts of the business, including Emerging Markets 5%, Japan 1%, ViiV Healthcare 15% and oncology 33%.
Europe, helped by the benets of refocusing the commercial organisation, delivered another relatively stable performance despite ongoing government and competitive pressures.
In addition, a tight rein on costs, added to the delivery of incremental savings in 2014 from restructuring and structural initiatives approximately 400 million, helped to offset a substantial portion of the impact from top line pressures while, importantly, protecting key investments required for the long-term success of the Group.
Vaccines performance and R&D value drivers Targets for the year around pipeline growth and value were achieved.

Global sales of vaccines were down 1% as several strong performances Boostrix, Rotarix, Synorix, Infanrix Pediarix offset most of the impact of the ongoing suspension of HPV vaccines in Japan, the return to the market of competing vaccines and supply constraints.
The business also delivered exciting phase III data for the Groups vaccine to prevent shingles and achieved major milestones in the programmes for Malaria and Ebola.

The performance achieved in the three years to 31 December 2014 and the actual vesting levels are set out in the table below.
The Committee previously provided estimates of vesting for 2012 awards in GSKs 2012 and 2013 Annual Reports.
Those estimates were based on performance achieved at that time and the following reects performance achieved over the course of the whole performance period.
No discretion was exercised in determining their vesting levels.
Due to commercial sensitivities, the targets for R&D new products and business diversication were not disclosed at the time of grant and the Committee committed to disclosing them at the time of vesting.
These targets are shown in the table below.

Use of malus and clawback The companys policy on malus and clawback is set out in the 2014 Remuneration policy report on page 121.
The Committee has jurisdiction on malus and clawback in respect of the executives.
The Recoupment Committee exercises this authority for the wider employee base.
It is comprised of senior executives with relevant oversight and appropriate experience, including the Senior Vice President, Global Ethics and Compliance, and the Senior Vice President & General Counsel.
From 1 January 2015, in respect of each financial year, the Committee will disclose whether it or the Recoupment Committee has exercised clawback or malus.
Disclosure will only be made when the matter has been the subject of public reports of misconduct, where it has been fully resolved, where it is legally permissible to disclose and where it can be made without unduly prejudicing the company and therefore shareholders.
The Committee has determined that the release of some shares under the LTI plans may be delayed in the case of leavers, to reinforce the implementation of the malus and clawback policy.
Also, in the case of deferred bonus awards under the DABP granted to executives who then retire or are made redundant, the vesting of those awards will normally be delayed so that they vest on their original timescales rather than vesting earlier at the end of the year in which the termination date falls.
102 GSK Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Update on performance of ongoing awards The Committee reviewed the performance of the PSP and DABP matching awards granted to Executive Directors in 2013 and 2014.
The following tables provide an estimate of vesting taking into account performance to date.
Actual vesting levels will only be determined based on performance over the full three-year performance periods.
The indications below should therefore not be regarded as predictions of the final vesting levels.
It is also noted that in relation to some measures, adjustments may be required following the close of the three-part transaction with Novartis, which is expected to complete during the week commencing 2 March 2015, to reect the impact of the transaction on the business.

The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares or ADS and the total value of the shares or ADS on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
No options vested for Executive Directors during 2014.
In respect of nil-cost options under the DABP, the bonus which is deferred by the Director is recorded as remuneration under annual bonus for the year to which it relates.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises this remuneration, the total of the amounts received in re-invested dividends prior to vesting and the gains or losses resulting from movements in the share price between the dates of grant and exercise for the initial bonus amount deferred and the dates of dividend reinvestment and exercise for the re-invested dividends.
For the matching element of the DABP, the remuneration of the Director is recorded in the year that the performance criteria end and represents the number of vested shares multiplied by the price at vesting.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises the total of this remuneration and the gain or loss resulting from the movement in the share price between vesting and exercise.
For Sir Andrew Witty: The total gain of 719,050 following the exercise of 177,500 options granted under the SOP comprises remuneration of nil in respect of 2007 the share options granted on 2 December 2004 were subject to performance criteria for a three year period ended 2007 and vested on 20 February 2008 with a vesting price of 11.23 and an investment gain of 719,050.
The gain of 604,951 recorded following the exercise of the 37,182 nil-cost options relating to the deferral of bonus earned in respect of 2010 comprises remuneration of 376,668 recorded in 2010 as annual bonus and a net gain of 228,283 relating to the re-investment of dividends prior to vesting and movements in the share price between grant and dividend re-investment dates and the exercise date.
The gain of 240,780 recorded following the exercise of the 14,799 nil-cost options relating to the DABP matching award comprises remuneration of 249,067 recorded in 2013 in relation to the DABP see page 113 and an investment loss of 8,287 relating to the movement in the share price between the vesting and exercise dates.
For Dr Moncef Slaoui: The total gain of 78,792 following the exercise of 26,800 options granted under the SOP comprises remuneration of 45,828 in respect of 2007 these options vested in 2007 and an investment gain of 32,964. j For Non-Executive Directors, total interests include shares or ADS received as part or all of their fees under the Non-Executive Director Share Allocation Plan see page 117 for further details and balances.

112 GSK Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Deferred Annual Bonus Plan matching awards Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP matching awards are made annually to Executive Directors, based on the individuals mandatory deferral and voluntary bonus deferral election.
The company will match shares or ADS up to one-for-one depending on the companys performance during a three-year performance period.
Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 102 to 104 of this report.
Awards to UK-based Executive Directors are made in the form of nil-cost options.
Once an award vests, the UK-based Executive Director may choose to exercise the award at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
Awards to US-based Executive Directors are made as conditional awards of ADS.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of the matching shares or ADS is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant award vests.
If the award vests after the date of the Remuneration report, the calculation is performed using the average share or ADS price over the last quarter of the financial year.
If an Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil-cost options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
Dividends are reinvested on the nil-cost options or conditional awards of shares or ADS made to Executive Directors up to the date of vesting.
The following tables provide details for each Executive Director in respect of DABP matching awards.
Market price at grant and at vesting represent the closing share prices on those dates.

114 GSK Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Performance Share Plan awards Performance Share Plan PSP awards are made to Executive Directors on an annual basis.
Under the terms of the PSP, the number of shares or ADS vesting is determined following the end of the relevant performance period and is dependent on GSKs performance during that period.
Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 102 to 104.
Dividends are reinvested on the performance shares or ADS awarded to executives throughout the performance period and up to the date of vesting.
At vesting, UK participants receive the relevant number of shares and US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of performance shares is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant PSP award vests.
The PSP awards made to Sir Andrew Witty in 2012, 2013 and 2014 have three year performance periods.
However, the deeds of award specify that 25% of the awards will be subject to a further two year vesting period five years in total.
During this two year period, there are no additional performance criteria and the awards will only lapse if Sir Andrew is dismissed for cause.
The remuneration in respect of these awards will therefore be considered to be realised in full following the determination by the Remuneration Committee of the vesting levels of the initial 75% of the awards i. e. full remuneration will be recognised at the end of the three-year performance period.
For the 2015 awards, the whole of the award made to each Executive Director has a three year performance period, but will vest after five years.
During the final two years of the vesting period, the award for each Director will only lapse if he is dismissed for cause.
The remuneration in respect of the awards will therefore be recognised at the end of the three year performance period i. e. in the 2017 Remuneration report.
The following tables provide details for each Executive Director in respect of PSP awards.
He elected to receive his shares from the Non-Executive Directors Share Allocation Plan immediately upon retiring from the Board.
Dividend entitlements in respect of the Q3 and Q4 2013 and the Q1 2014 dividends were paid in cash in accordance with the plan rules.

GSK Annual Report 2014 121 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 2014 Remuneration policy report continued Long-term incentive measures The Committee has selected three equally weighted performance measures to focus Executive Directors long-term remuneration on the delivery of GSKs key strategic priorities.
From 2014, PSP and DABP awards made to Executive Directors are based on R&D new product performance, adjusted free cash ow and relative TSR.
In addition to setting robust targets, the Committee has implemented a number of safeguards to ensure the targets are met in a sustainable way and any performance reects genuine achievement against targets and therefore represents the delivery of value for shareholders.
For each performance measure, the impact of any acquisition or divestment will be quantied and adjusted for after the event.
Any major adjustment in the calculation of performance measures will be disclosed to shareholders on vesting.
The principal safeguards are detailed under each measure below.
The Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee and other members, who are also members of the Remuneration Committee, provide input on the Audit & Risk Committees review of the Groups performance and oversight of any risk factors relevant to remuneration decisions.
The rationale behind each performance measure and how it is calculated are as follows for vesting schedules please see page 103 of the 2013 Annual Report on Remuneration : Performance measure Rationale Calculation methodology R&D new Recognises the importance of R&D to future business The target is based on sales of new products launched in the product growth performance period and the preceding two years.

For any internal appointments, entitlements under existing remuneration elements will continue, including pension entitlements and any outstanding awards.
However, where not already the case, internal appointments will be required to move to Executive Director contractual terms, including termination provisions.
GSK Annual Report 2014 123 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 2014 Remuneration policy report continued Loss of ofce payment policy The following table sets out the contractual framework for Executive Directors.
The terms specically relating to termination are set out in more detail below.
Policy Duration of The company does not have a policy of xed term contracts.
Generally, contracts for new appointments will expire in line contracts with the applicable policy on retirement age, which since 2009 has been 65.
Contracts for existing Executive Directors will expire on the dates shown on page 123 of the 2013 Annual Report.
Notice period Notice period on termination by employing company or Executive Director is 12 calendar months.
Mitigation The ability to impose a 12-month non-compete period and a non-solicitation restriction on an Executive Director is considered important by the company to have the ability to protect the Groups intellectual property and staff.
In light of this, the Committee believes that it would not be appropriate to provide for mitigation in the contracts.
Termination of employment In the event that an Executive Directors employment with the company terminates, the following policies and payments will apply.
Element of Remuneration Loss of ofce payment policy Termination Termination by notice: 12 months annual salary payable on termination by the company pro-rated where part of the notice payment period is worked.
No termination payment is made in respect of any part of a notice period that extends beyond the contract expiry date.
A bonus element is not normally included in the termination payment.
However, the terms of the contracts seek to balance commercial imperatives and best practice.
If the company enforces the non-compete clause for the current CEO and Chairman, Global R&D and Vaccines, up to 12 months on-target bonus will be payable.
Redundancy: As above, for termination by notice.
In the UK, only statutory redundancy pay will apply.
In the US, general severance policy does not apply.
Retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: No termination payment.
LTI awards PSP and DABP matching awards are governed by the Plan Rules as approved by shareholders.
Termination by notice: Unvested awards lapse.
Redundancy and retirement: Generally, awards vest over the original timescales, subject to the original performance conditions.
Awards made in the last 12 months are forfeited.
Death and ill-health, injury or disability: Generally, awards will vest following the end of the financial year, normally taking into account performance to that date.
Awards may be pro-rated for time.
In the event of a change of control, PSP and DABP matching awards will vest, taking into account performance to date and normally taking into account the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed.
Alternatively, the awards may be exchanged for new awards.
Annual bonus Termination by notice by individual: If an individual serves notice and the termination date falls before 31 December, the bonus is forfeited.
Termination by notice by the company, redundancy, retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: If the termination date falls during the financial year, eligible for pro-rated on-target bonus if employed on 31 December, bonus payable based on actual results.
DABP deferred Termination by notice: Deferred shares vest in full on the date of termination.
bonus awards Redundancy, retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: Generally, deferred shares vest in full at the end of the financial year in which the termination date falls.
Benets Generally, benets will continue to apply until the termination date.
Termination by notice by the company and retirement US executives : In line with the policy applicable to US senior executives, the Chairman, Global R&D & Vaccines may become eligible, at a future date, to receive continuing medical and dental insurance after termination retirement.
Termination by mutual agreement: In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the company for the Board to manage proactively succession planning and the development of the senior talent pipeline.
In such circumstances, the Board may therefore agree that an executives departure will be by mutual agreement.
In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated performance in line with expectations, where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession, and they should have completed at least 20 years service with the Group on the termination date.
In the case of an Executive Director, they would then be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of GSKs long-term incentive plans.
If the termination date falls during the financial year, they would be eligible for a pro-rated on-target bonus and if they are employed on 31 December, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
In the case of the CEO, as a member of the UK dened benefit pension scheme, his pension would then be payable from the later of his termination date and age 55 without actuarial reduction.
