Message from the Chairman and Financial Highlights Message from the Chairman It has been another strong year for Scottish Mortgage: the net asset value and share price rose considerably and well ahead of the Benchmark.
Of more relevance, given the long term approach, the five and ten year figures are likewise excellent.
During the year the share price crossed the 10 threshold, gross assets exceeded 3bn and by some measures Scottish Mortgage is now the UKs largest investment trust.
The Managers currently find no shortage of companies which they see as being capable of making sustained and attractive long term returns.
