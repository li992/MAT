Governance overview We would like to reassure all our stakeholders that we fully recognise the need to rebuild a stronger Board and executive team as quickly as possible.
Mr Egbert Imomoh Executive Chairman Dear Shareholder The Chairmans and Chief Executives statement on pages 10 to 15 reports the challenging issues that we faced during the second half of the year following the unauthorised payments issue and the aftermath of the fall in oil prices.
It also outlines the steps we have taken to address these alongside the information reported on page 68 within the corporate responsibility section relating to our new Code of Business Conduct.
In light of the unusual circumstances that we were presented with at the end of July, the Board decided to appoint myself as Executive Chairman, Mr Toby Hayward as Interim Chief Executive Officer and retain the composition of the Board as a whole.
The Board believed that this approach was in the best interests of shareholders as it promoted stability and continuity.
During 2015, the Board intends to strengthen Board membership and improve Afrens internal control framework.
Board committee membership will also be reviewed and refreshed in the first half of 2015.
The Board intends to enhance corporate governance principles in line with best practice.
Afren governance structure The Board is collectively responsible to the Companys shareholders for the long-term success of the Group and for its overall strategic direction, its values and its governance.
It provides the leadership necessary for the Group to meet its business objectives within the framework of its internal controls, while also discharging the Companys obligations to its shareholders.
