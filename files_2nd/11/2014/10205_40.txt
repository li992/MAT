Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements Additional information and notes and notes Corporate governance Executive Chairmans introduction The board of Micro Focus International plc is committed to delivering outstanding shareholder returns and believes this is underpinned by high standards of corporate governance and by a strong corporate governance framework.
To support this framework, the board has established and embedded procedures and processes throughout the whole Group.
During the financial year ended 30 April 2014, the board has considered future succession planning in relation to my role as Executive Chairman and has announced that there will be a transition back to the separate roles of a Chairman and a Chief Executive in 12 to 24 months.
Following a review of the balance and skills of the board as described in the nomination report a new non-executive director and a Chief Operating Officer were appointed during the year.
I believe that the board is well balanced, with a broad range of skills and a good understanding of the market in which we operate and the challenges which we face.
During the next financial year, we will continue to review proactively the business decisions made and the governance framework in which we operate.
