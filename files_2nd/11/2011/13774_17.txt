Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Chairmans introduction The Board of Sage is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance Anthony Hobson, Chairman Dear Shareholder, The Board of Sage is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance.
The Board provides leadership to the business as a whole, having regard to the interests and views of its shareholders.
In this report, I have looked to explain how the Board achieves these goals.
This year the Board has faced a number of challenges, particularly the changes to key executive personnel both at Board level and within the senior executive leadership of the Group.
This report also sets out the Groups approach to these issues together with the other challenges which have been faced over the last 12 months.
The year to 30 September 2011 is the first year to which the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code published in May 2010 has applied in full.
The Financial Services Authority requires UK listed companies to explain how they have applied the main principles set out in the Code and whether they have complied with the principles set out within the Code throughout the financial year.
This report, therefore, sets out how we have applied the Code and confirms our compliance with it throughout the year.
I trust you will find the report informative and helpful.
