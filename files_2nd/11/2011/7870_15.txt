BOARD REPORTS CHAIRMANS GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION I became Chairman in November 2011, following the retirement of Norman Askew.
As Chairman, I intend to play a leading role in shaping the governance agenda and taking the Company forward.
First, I would like to pay tribute to Norman Askew for his excellent stewardship of the Company during his six years as Chairman.
His legacy includes an open and engaged Board working within a well developed corporate governance structure, all of which together provide rm foundations to build on for the future.
To help me assess and nd ways to improve Board effectiveness, I arranged workshops with the non-executive directors and with the executives, both of which were facilitated by an external consultant.
I will be using this input to develop some changes in practice aimed at enhancing the role of the Board.
A full, externally facilitated Board evaluation exercise will be conducted later in the year.
On the non-executive side of the Board, we have a strong team of four independent directors with varied backgrounds and experience.
They have all been IMI directors for several years and all are familiar with the businesses and enjoy opportunities for contact with the wider management group at formal Board meetings, management conferences and visits to IMI facilities.
In 2011 the non-executives and I have each visited a number of facilities around the Group.
In January 2012 most of the non-executive team again joined the top senior managers at IMIs annual senior management conference, which was held in Milan and combined with visits to IMI operations in Italy.
I am keen to engage with shareholders and have already met with a number of larger institutional investors since my appointment in the autumn.
I look forward to meeting many more shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
