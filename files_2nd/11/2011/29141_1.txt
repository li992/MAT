MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Message from the Chairman Scottish Mortgage has had a good year in absolute and relative terms performing well ahead of the benchmark index: our discount has narrowed and the five year figures, which are important, are also strong.
A 6.2% increase in the total dividend is proposed making it the 29th successive increase greater than the prevailing rate of UK inflation.
While not every year will be as impressive as this one, it is pleasing to report that Scottish Mortgage was the top performing trust in the Global Growth Sector over five years in NAV terms as shown by the Association of Investment Companies rankings.
Performance is, and will be, driven by the success of the choice of individual companies as investments.
Meanwhile, expenses have again been controlled and represent a highly competitive 0.51% of shareholders funds.
