B6 RISK MANAGEMENT B6.1 STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEEE Dear Shareholder The year ended 30 September 2015 has been the first full year of operation for the Committee, a year which has seen significant changes in the Groups risk management structure and the regulatory environment in which it operates.
Whilst the Committee continues to develop its role, it is pleasing that the annual board effectiveness review concluded that the Committee was operating effectively.
The Risk and Compliance Committee is the senior risk committee within the Group.
It operates under an authority delegated by the Board and assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for risk management across the Group.
The Committee met on four occasions during the year and the attendance records of the members are detailed in section B3.1 of this report.
As a Committee, our responsibility is to maintain oversight of the effectiveness of the Groups risk management framework and of the Groups systems and controls for compliance with its statutory and regulatory obligations.
The Committee also oversees the Groups risk culture to ensure that risk appetite is appropriate, adhered to and that key risks to the Group are identified, managed and monitored satisfactorily.
One of the principal tasks for the Committee was monitoring the development of the Groups risk management framework in the year, which saw the embedding of an enhanced executive risk committee structure, described in section B6.2, the setting of thresholds for material risk event reporting and the formation of an independent Group Risk and Compliance division, including the appointment of the first Group Chief Risk Officer.
This process of development will continue in the forthcoming period.
In addition to its regular business, during the year the Committee: Reviewed the ICAAP report Reviewed key documentation relating to the application for FCA Consumer Credit authorisation by the Groups principal trading subsidiary, Paragon Finance PLC During the coming year the Committees main priorities will include: Overseeing the further development and implementation of the Groups risk management framework, ensuring it is in line with emerging regulatory, corporate governance and industry best practice Monitoring managements progress in securing relevant regulatory permissions Monitoring the Groups implementation, where applicable, of the FCA PRA requirements in relation to the Senior Managers and Certification Regime Monitoring the Groups implementation of the FCAs revised rules on complaint handling Reviewing the effectiveness of risk management in relation to the integration of the acquired Five Arrows Leasing Group business The Committe e considers that it has made significant progress in its first year of operation and we look forward to further developments in the Groups risk management and compliance framework as the business expands and the regulatory environment evolves.
