Message from the Chairman and Financial Highlights Message from the Chairman I am pleased to say that performance has again been strong in terms of the net asset value and share price returns over the twelve months to the end of March.
Even more satisfactory are the strong long term performance figures, consistent with the investment philosophy of your Company.
There have been some significant developments during the period.
As highlighted in the Half Yearly Report, the past year has seen Scottish Mortgage pass the milestone of becoming the UKs largest conventional investment trust both by market capitalisation and total assets.
Scottish Mortgages shares reached an all time high in March 2015 and have since risen further after the financial year end.
The strength of the demand for our stock has repeatedly moved the price to a premium to the John Scott, Chairman underlying Net Asset Value NAV over the last six months and the Company has been issuing shares to provide market liquidity, in line with our stated desire to see the shares trade broadly around NAV.
Finally, in January, we were delighted to announce Tom Slaters promotion to Joint Manager of the Trust in recognition of the contribution he has already made to the portfolio.
Yet some things remain the same.
There has been no change to the investment philosophy which underpins the Company: the Managers resolutely remain stock pickers, simply looking to invest in the best growth companies across the globe for the next five to ten years and beyond.
Looking to the future, they are even more excited than they were twelve months ago by the prospects for the companies within the portfolio and the pool of potential investments, as the pace of change in the world accelerates.
