S STR TRA ATE TEG GI IC C R RE EP PO OR RT T G GO OVE VER RNAN NANC CE E F FI INAN NANC CI IAL ALS S Chairmans Letter Audit and Risk Committee David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee Dear Shareholder I am pleased to have taken on the role of Audit and Risk Committee Chairman at an exciting time in the development of the Group.
This is the Groups first report following its IPO and I hope that it will give shareholders a helpful insight into how the Committee carries out its responsibilities.
Thanks to the work done both by the Card Factory team and KPMG LLP, as reporting accountants on the IPO, the Committee began its role in the public company arena with a thorough understanding of the strengths of the businesss control framework and with a clear agenda of items to evolve further.
Both in anticipation of and following the IPO, the Committee has made progress in a number of areas: before the IPO, the Group carried out a thorough review of the existing governance and control structure of the Group with its advisers KPMG LLP and Linklaters LLP to ensure it had procedures in place which provided a reasonable basis for the Board to make proper judgements as to the Groups financial position and prospects: immediately prior to the IPO, the independence of the Committee was strengthened to ensure that it complied with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and it is now entirely made up of Independent Non-Executive Directors: the Committee has formalised the Groups policies with regard to auditor rotation and use of the auditors for non-audit services: the Group has decided to expand its internal audit function to reinforce controls and procedures and to supplement the work of the Groups existing operational audit function which is focused on loss prevention: and the Group has developed a more formalised approach to risk management with regular reviews by the senior management team and the Committee of the key risks affecting the Groups business.
More details are provided in the formal report of the Committee that follows but the Directors understand the importance of continuing to develop the work of the Committee to ensure that it remains aligned with the strategic goals of the Group whilst also continuing to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM.
Yours sincerely David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 24 March 2015 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 43
