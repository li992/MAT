The annual performance of The committee carefully reviewed the reasons why 20% of the Company is measured and rewarded under the shortshare owners felt they needed to abstain or vote against the term incentive plan.
In 2015, performance against our key report and considered what was necessary to address their measures of like-for-like PBT growth of 9.3%, like-for-like concerns.
The primary reason for their vote related to the net sales growth of 3.3% and constant currency net sales 2014 total compensation for the CEO.

The committee, Since 2013, WPP has granted long-term incentive while aware of the concerns, needs to remind share owners awards under a new plan: the Executive Performance Share that the LEAP stock awards are contractual and it is not Plan EPSP.
The design of this plan was strongly informed possible to reduce awards if the targets have been achieved.

As a result, this benefit was removed, with the CEOs 121 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2015 How we behave and how were rewarded Letter from the chairman of the Compensation Committee The 2011 awards, which vested in full on 14 March Performance targets for 2016 2016, were based on performance over the five financial years to 31 December 2015.
Over this period WPP achieved As part of the Committees normal practice, in preparation TSR of 134.9%, out-performing our peers and broader for the 2016 EPSP awards, we have reviewed the ranges market indices in Europe and the US.

While the value of Sir Martin Sorrells award is very large, it was the result of an outstanding set of returns to Sir John Hood share owners.
Chairman of the Compensation Committee 15 April 2016 Pay policy and implementation At the end of January 2015, Mark Read stood down from the Board to take up the role of CEO of Wunderman.
We have pro-rated his compensation and benefits to reflect his time on the Board, as outlined in the report that follows.
During the year, the committee reviewed the base salary of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.
The committee decided that in light of other pay and incentive rewards, no change to the level of base salary would be made.
This means there havent been any changes to the Executive Directors base salaries since January 2013 for Sir Martin Sorrell, when his salary was reduced to its current level, and July 2013 for Paul Richardson.
Finally, in accordance with commitments made last year, we have implemented clawback arrangements to the cash bonus and EPSP awards.
These arrangements take effect for 2016 and subsequent awards and permit a clawback of incentives for a period of up to three years after payment in the case of a prescribed event occurring.
This amendment will work in tandem with the pre-existing malus clauses in the incentive plans.

The Committee acknowledges these concerns, but also recognises that the majority of share owners supported the remuneration resolution last year see below.

Performance against financial objectives Performance against all financial objectives is calculated on a pro forma like-for-like basis other than Net Sales margin that is calculated on a constant currency basis.
The key financial short-term incentive plan objectives for all the Executive Directors are consistent with 2014 and provide a robust basis for assessing financial achievement.
As illustrated below, the 2015 financial performance of the Group was very strong.
For the Group CEO and CFO, strong PBT and net sales margin improvement produced performance well above target, achieving 93% and 90% of the maximum award respectively.
The net sales growth achieved an above target performance equivalent to 82% of the very ambitious maximum.

These shares are granted post determination of the annual bonus achievement and will vest, subject to continued employment, two years later.
Short-term incentive weightings and measures for 2016 The Committee has reviewed the performance objectives and weightings for 2016 to ensure continued alignment with the Companys strategies.
The weighting of financial objectives 70% and individual strategic objectives 30% will remain unchanged as will the Group financial measures of headline PBT growth, net sales margin improvement and net sales growth.
As stated in the Executive Remuneration Policy, the committee is of the view that the targets for the STIP are commercially sensitive and it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
To the extent targets are no longer commercially sensitive they will be disclosed at the end of the relevant performance period in that years Annual Report.
129 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2015 How we behave and how were rewarded Implementation report Long-term incentives audited 2011 2015 LEAP III awards vesting The 2011 awards were granted under LEAP III, the long-term incentive plan which in 2013 was replaced by the EPSP.
Vesting of LEAP awards was solely dependent on WPPs relative TSR performance measured in common currency, against a custom group of WPPs comparators Aegis, Arbitron, Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Omnicom and Publicis weighted by their respective market capitalisation.
Over the five-year investment and performance period, WPP out-performed 93% of the weighted peer group including both Omnicom and Publicis, WPPs largest and most comparable multi-line competitors.
Over the period, WPP delivered TSR of 135% which means that a shareholding of 100 at the start of the period would be worth 235 at the end.
On a relative basis, underlying financial and operational performance was also strong over the five-year period, consistent with the TSR outcome.
Aegis and Arbitron, two of the comparator companies, were taken over during the investment and performance period by Dentsu and Nielsen, respectively.
In line with the guidelines previously established by the committee, the two companies remained in the comparator group as they were both listed for more than 40% of the investment and performance period.
Their TSR performance was calculated assuming reinvestment into a synthetic stock of the remaining comparators.
This was with effect from the date immediately before which it was independently determined that the share price was affected by either a takeover premium or speculation.
WPPs TSR performance relative to the comparator group resulted in a match to the executive directors pledged shares of 500%, equating to the maximum award.

130 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2015 How we behave and how were rewarded Implementation report 2015 EPSP awards granted In 2015, the executive directors, along with a select number of senior executives within the Group, were granted awards under the Executive Performance Share Plan EPSP.
The 2015 awards are subject to three equally weighted independent performance conditions, being relative TSR, EPS and ROE.
Performance is measured over the five financial years starting in 2015 as follows: Measure Total Shareholder Return TSR Earnings Per Share EPS Return On Equity ROE Weight One-third One-third One-third Nature Relative to peers WPP growth WPP absolute 1 Performance zone Median to upper decile 7% 14% compound annual growth 15% 18% annual average threshold to maximum Payout Below threshold: 0% of element vests Threshold: 20% of element vests Maximum or above: 100% of element vests Straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum Performance period Five-years ending on 31 December 2019 1 The ROE measure for EPSP awards issued in 2013 and 2014 was a 10% to 14% average return.
As in previous years, WPPs TSR performance is compared to companies representing our most relevant, listed global competitors, weighted by market capitalisation.
In 2015, the comparator group comprised Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis.
TSR performance will be calculated on a market  basis in both common and local currency weighted equally.
Using a dual basis ensures that the interests of both local and international investors are reflected in the performance measures.
The following interests were awarded on 9 June 2015 at the preceding five-day average share price of 15.172 ordinary shares or $115.88 ADRs.

131 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2015 How we behave and how were rewarded Implementation report Aligning pay and performance As set out in the Executive Remuneration Policy, the Committee seeks to align variable remuneration with the key strategic priorities of WPP, maximising the dynamic between pay and performance.
This dynamic is contingent upon the Committee setting challenging targets each year.
The following graph and table demonstrate the relationship between pay and performance over the last seven years for the Group chief executive.

As a result, the population for the taxable benefits consists of UK employees only.
