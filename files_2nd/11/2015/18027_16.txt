Chairmans Letter Nomination Committee Geoff Cooper Chairman of the Nomination Committee Dear Shareholder I am pleased to have taken on the role of Nomination Committee Chairman as the Company, having completed its IPO, enters the next phase of its development.
Given the relatively short period of time since the completion of the IPO, the Committee met only twice in the year to approve the appointment of Paul McCrudden as an additional Independent Non-Executive and to discuss succession planning.
However, I hope this report gives you a helpful insight into how the Committee intends to carry out its responsibilities as the Company begins its life as a premium listed company.
Immediately prior to the IPO, the Company undertook a search and selection process with the aim of introducing a level of balance to the Board that would be appropriate for a premium listed company and which would create the right diversity of skills within the Board.
Following that process, myself Independent Non-Executive Chairman, Octavia Morley Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and David Stead Independent Non-Executive Director were all appointed to the Board in anticipation of the IPO.
Looking forwards, Board composition will continue to be a focus of the Committee to ensure the Board benefits from skills and experience that can support the growth and development of the business from individuals who fit Card Factorys culture.
Additionally, we will begin to develop a formal succession plan that addresses the future needs of the business.
Yours sincerely Geoff Cooper Chairman of the Nomination Committee 24 March 2015 66 66 C Ca ar rd F d Fa ac ct to or ry p y pl lc c A Annu nnua all R Re epo por rt t and and A Ac cc cou oun nt ts s 2 20 01 15 5
