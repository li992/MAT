Message from the Chairman and Financial Highlights Message from the Chairman This has been another good year for Scottish Mortgage with the share price up 22% in the year to 31 March, as compared, for example, to the FTSE All World Index up by 3% in total return terms.
However the emphasis must continue to be on long term performance.
Short term performance whether good or bad is a poor way to judge the success or otherwise of the Companys long-term strategy and I would remind investors that Scottish Mortgage is best suited to those who share the Managers more patient approach of investing over periods of at least 5 years.
I am therefore particularly pleased to report that total returns for shareholders from the Companys shares over five and ten years remain very strong, at 185% and 335% respectively.
The long term performance Fiona McBain, Chairman record and steady share issuance that took us into the FTSE 100 last year have continued, with net issuances of 145 million and a market capitalisation now standing at over 6 billion.
The Managers, with the full encouragement of the Board, continue to focus on investing in the best growth businesses with extraordinary potential over the coming years.
The rationale for this is set out in detail in the Managers Review and in the statement of the Managers Core Beliefs on pages 11 to 17: please do take the time to read these.
The longer-term track record suggests that Scottish Mortgage is on the right path but neither the Board nor the Managers are complacent.
We will not stop trying to improve all aspects of what we do for our shareholders.
