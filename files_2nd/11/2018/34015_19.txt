IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17.
The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees leases of low-value assets and short-term leases i. e. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments i. e. the lease liability and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term i. e. the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.

Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Board of Directors and management use their judgement Standards issued but not yet effective continued and make estimates in determining the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
The most Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events e. g. a change in significant judgements and estimates are as follows: the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments.
The lessee will generally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment Fair value of financial instruments to the right-of-use asset.

The input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where operating and finance leases.
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values Note 28.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
Measurement of fair value of investment properties The fair value of investment properties is determined by independent professionally qualified appraisers.

The Standard will be applied to contracts that were previously identified as leases in accordance with The Group performs valuation of its investment properties with a sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
The Group will apply the recognition exemptions on lease contracts for which the lease term ends amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting within 12 months as of the date of initial application, and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value.
Results of this valuation are presented in Note 11, while valuation inputs and techniques are presented in Note A lease liability will be measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessees 28.

the available comparable sale prices.
These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, however, actual results could be different.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact of transition to IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.
Based on the data as at 1 January 2019, the Group estimates that the adoption of the new Allowance for financial assets standard will result in an increase in the Groups liabilities by GEL 75,517 and recognition of right-of-use assets of GEL 89,869, of which GEL 14,352 is expected to be reclassifiedfrom prepayments to right-of-use assets.
IFRS 9 requires management to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates that affect the allowance for ECL.
Estimates and judgements are based on managements knowledge and historical experience.
A summary of Annual improvements 2015-2017 cycle the key judgements made by management is set out below.
IAS 12, Income Taxes The amendment to IAS 12 clarifies that the income tax consequences if any of dividends as defined in IFRS 9 Definition of default, credit-impaired and cure Note 27 i. e. distributions of profits to holders of equity instruments in proportion to their holdings must be recognised: The Groups definition of default is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.
The definition may differ across at the same time as the liability to pay those dividends is recognised: and products.
The definition is consistent with the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes and it in profit or loss, other comprehensive income, or the statement of changes in equity according to where the entity corresponds with internal financial instrument risk classification rules.
A counterparty is classified as defaulted at originally recognised the past transactions or events that generated the distributable profits from which the the latest when payments of interest, principal or fees are overdue for more than 90 days or when bankruptcy, fraud, dividends are being paid.
insolvency proceedings of enforced liquidation have commenced or there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met.
The determination of whether a Financial Instrument is credit-impaired focuses on default risk, without The amendment to IAS 12 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, although earlier application taking into consideration the effects of credit risk mitigations such as collateral or guarantees.
Entities must apply the amendment to income tax consequences of dividends recognised on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
The Group is currently assessing the impact.
An instrument is classified as credit-impaired if the counterparty is defaulted and or the instrument is POCI.
Once the financial asset is classified as credit-impaired except for POCIs it remains as such unless all past due amounts have been rectified or there is general evidence of credit recovery.
A minimum period of six consecutive months payment is applied as exit criteria to Financial Assets restructured due to credit risk other than corporate loan portfolio and debt instruments measured at FVOCI where exit criteria are determined as exit from bankruptcy or insolvency status, disappearance of liquidity problems or existence of other general evidence of credit recovery assessed on individual basis.
For other credit-impaired Financial Instruments, exit criteria is determined as repayment of the entire overdue amount other than through refinancing or foreclosure.
Once a credit-impaired financial asset meets default exit criteria, it remains in Stage 2 at least for the next 12 consecutive months.
After 12 consecutive payments it is transferred to Stage 1 if its credit risk is not significantly higher than at origination date.

Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Significant Increase in Credit Risk SICR Assets considered in the ECL calculations A significant increase in credit risk is not a defined term per IFRS 9, and is determined by management, based on their IFRS 9 requires cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancements to be reflected in the ECL experience and judgement.
In assessing whether the credit risk has significantly increased the Group has identified calculation.
The treatment and reflection of collateral for IFRS 9 purposes is in line with general risk management a series of qualitative and quantitative criteria based on undertaking the holistic analysis of various factors including principles, policies and processes of the Group.
The Groups accounting policy for collateral assigned to it through its those which are specific to a particular financial instrument or to a borrower as well as those applicable to particular lending arrangements under IFRS 9 is the same is it was under IAS 39.
Collateral, unless repossessed, is not recorded sub-portfolios.
These criteria are: on the Groups statement of financial position.
The fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs.
It is generally A significant increase in credit risk, expressed in the relative and or absolute increase in the risk of default since assessed, at a minimum, at inception and re-assessed on an annual basis for all material exposures.
SICR is determined based on comparison between credit risk ratings internal or external as of the origination date and credit risk ratings as of the reporting date for each financial asset individually.

indicate that the level of risk has been increased significantly since origination.
Macroeconomic variables covered by these forecasts and which the Group incorporated in its ECL assessment model include GDP growth, foreign exchange rate and inflation rate.
These forward-looking macroeconomic variables are The above noted SICR indicators are identified at Financial Instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk updated on a semi-annual basis for Georgian companies and on a quarterly basis for BNB.
The determination of the probability weighted ECL requires evaluating a range of diverse and relevant future economic Measurement of expected credit losses conditions.
To accommodate this requirement, the Group uses three different economic scenarios in the ECL calculation: ECL reflects an unbiased, probability-weighted estimate based on a combination of the following principal factors: an upside weight 0.25, a baseline weight 0.50 and a downside weight 0.25 scenario relevant for each respective probability of default PD, loss given default LGD and exposure at default EAD which are further explained below: portfolio.
A weight is computed for each scenario by using a probabilistic economic model that considers recent information as well as historical data provided by National Bank of Georgia.
PD estimation: The Group estimates PD based on a combination of rating model calibration results and a migration matrices approach which is further adjusted for macroeconomic expectations for a minimum three years onwards for The Group considers these forecasts to represent its best estimate of the possible outcomes based on reliable all portfolios, to represent the forward-looking estimators of the PD parameters.
The migration matrix is built in a way available information.
to reflect the weighted average yearly migration over the historical data period.
The risk groups are determined in a way to ensure intra-group homogeneity and differentiation of expected PD levels.
For loan portfolios other than corporate Forward-looking variable assumptions loans, PD is further adjusted considering time since financial instrument origination.
The models incorporate both The most significant period-end assumptions used for ECL estimate as at 31 December 2018 per geographical qualitative and quantitative information, and where practical, build on information from top rating agencies, Credit segments are set out below.
