THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This year weve made big progress honing our skills, tools and techniques, taking our overall ultrafast footprint to more than 1.5m homes and businesses.
Having consulted our communications provider customers during the summer, we now have an accelerated plan to make FTTP connections available to three million homes and businesses by the end of 2020.
But we want to go a lot further to 10 million premises and ultimately most of the UK.
So we now have a Fibre First approach to every network expansion decision we make.
