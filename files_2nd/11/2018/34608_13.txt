Strategic Report Governance Financials Chairmans Letter Audit and Risk Committee David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee Dear Shareholder The Committees activities during the year consolidated its work over previous years in developing and refining the structures and processes which ensure there is confidence and trust in the Groups internal controls, how it manages risk and in the integrity of its financial statements.
The Committee has clear terms of reference and a programme of activities that set the agenda for Committee discussions.
Whilst these address the key topics the Committee should always be considering, the Committee retains sufficient flexibility to consider other issues when they arise.
The report that follows provides further detail on the Committees activities during the year.
The Committee will continue to ensure that its activities are focused on business issues that add to, or preserve value and that they remain aligned with the strategic goals of the Group whilst also continuing to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
Roger Whiteside joined the Committee in December and his knowledge and experience will greatly support the Committees future work.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM in May.
Yours sincerely David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 9 April 2018 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 47
