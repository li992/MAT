Sale of crude oil and by products Sales revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT, of liftings in the year together with the gain loss on realisation of cash flow hedges.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
Revenue from sale of crude oil and by products is recognised when performance obligations have been met, which is typically when goods are delivered and title has passed.
