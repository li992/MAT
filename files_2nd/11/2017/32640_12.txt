Chairmans Letter Audit and Risk Committee David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee Dear Shareholder The Audit and Risk Committee plays an important role in ensuring that the interests of shareholders are properly protected by monitoring the activities and conduct of management and auditors, including those providing internal audit services, and ensuring they are operating in accordance with the control frameworks in the business and with all applicable rules and standards.
The Committee has clear terms of reference and a programme of activities designed to give assurance as to the continuing effectiveness of the Groups internal controls, its financial and business reporting and its framework for identifying and managing risk.
This programme of activities sets the agenda for Committee discussions and, whilst addressing the key topics which the Committee should always be considering, provides sufficient flexibility for the Committee to consider additional issues when they arise.
I am pleased to report that the Committee has continued to build on its work since its formation at the time of the Companys IPO.
In particular, I would highlight the following activities carried out during the year: overseeing and reviewing the work carried out by Deloitte LLP our internal audit service provider including their reviews of the Group IT network resilience and cyber security, the Groups point of sale technology systems, the Groups inventory management systems and its crisis management arrangements: continuing to monitor the control structure of the Group that supports the Boards ability to make judgements about the Groups financial position and prospects including the continued tracking of progress with actions identified in the reviews carried out at the time of the IPO.
These activities have been supplemented by the internal audit work carried out by Deloitte: continuing to monitor the Groups approach to risk management, ensuring that effective and robust risk management is an integral part of the Groups business planning and decision-making processes with the principal risks being regularly reviewed by the senior management team, the Committee and the Board: and following the review carried out by Deloitte, overseeing the introduction of a cyber security steering group and regular reporting to the Committee to monitor and support the implementation of Deloittes recommendations.
The formal report of the Committee that follows provides further detail on its activities during the year.
The Committee is committed to ensuring that its activities are focused on business issues that add to, or preserve value and that they remain aligned with the strategic goals of the Group whilst also continuing to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM in May.
Yours sincerely David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 27 March 2017 48 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
