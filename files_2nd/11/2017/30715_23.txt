The Committee set role specific objectives for them for this period.
As the two individuals ceased to be Executive Directors before the 2017 Remuneration policy was approved, the target bonus opportunities were as set out in the policy approved by shareholders in 2014 i. e. 125% of salary for Sir Andrew and 85% of salary for Dr Slaoui.
These contractual payments are shown under Other in the table on page 117.
The table below provides more detail on delivery against the Core Group PBIT target, now called Adjusted Group PBIT: Financial performance Core Group PBIT Group turnover was 30.2 billion, an 8% increase AER and 3% CER Adjusted Group Adjusted operating profit 8,568 million, 5% higher on a CER basis, and 12% higher AER PBIT The Adjusted operating margin of 28.4% was 0.9 percentage points higher than in 2016 and 0.4 percentage points higher on a CER basis.
This reflected improved operating leverage driven by sales growth and a more favourable mix in all three businesses.
The margin also benefited from continued tight control of ongoing costs across all three businesses as well as restructuring and integration benefits in the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses, partly offset by continued pricing pressures, particularly in respiratory, and investments in R&D and the supply chain.

Dr Moncef Slaoui did not exercise any options during the year.
The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
In respect of nil-cost options under the DABP, the bonus which is deferred by the Director is recorded as remuneration under Annual bonus for the year to which it relates.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises this remuneration, the total of the amounts received in re-invested dividends prior to vesting and the gains or losses resulting from movements in the share price between the dates of grant and exercise for the initial bonus amount deferred and the dates of dividend reinvestment and exercise for the re-invested dividends.
For the matching element of the DABP, the remuneration of the Executive Director is recorded in the year that the performance period ends and represents the number of vested shares multiplied by the price at vesting.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises the total of this remuneration and the gain or loss resulting from the movement in the share price between vesting and exercise.
For Emma Walmsley: The gain of 242,961 recorded following the exercise of the 14,860 nil-cost options relating to the deferral of bonus earned in respect of 2013 comprises remuneration of 205,315 recorded in 2013 as Annual bonus and a net gain of 37,646 relating to the re-investment of dividends prior to vesting and movements in the share price between grant and dividend re-investment dates and the exercise date.
