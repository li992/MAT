Message from the Chairman and Financial Highlights Message from the Chairman This has been a good year for Scottish Mortgage, with the share price increasing by over 40% on a total return basis.
The long term share price total returns over five and ten years remain very strong, at 177% and 302% respectively.
This year, we have continued to see high levels of demand for our shares and have issued a net amount of 155 million in new share capital.
As a result of this long term performance record and steady share issuance, the assets of the Company have grown substantially in recent years.
In March of this year, our market capitalisation reached a level that resulted in the Company entering the FTSE 100 index, and it now stands at over 5 billion.
This will inevitably bring a higher profile for Scottish Mortgage and already some new shareholders have John Scott, Chairman invested in the Company.
Yet fundamentally nothing has changed in what we do.
The Managers remain resolutely committed to their philosophical approach of making long term investments in what they believe to be the most exciting growth businesses from around the world.
Over time, this benefits both our shareholders and the companies they enable to thrive.
The world needs more of this supportive and patient investment capital and I very much hope that Scottish Mortgage will continue to be one such provider well into the future.
