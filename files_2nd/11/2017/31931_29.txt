As the Offer process is continuing longer than anticipated we will be re-engaging with our shareholders and should the Pay for performance outcomes Offer not proceed we will present a new policy for approval at the 2018 The fundamentals of our existing remuneration policy remain sound AGM.
I set out the rationale for this decision below.

There is a clear focus on linking pay outcomes directly to The Committee believes that the current remuneration structure has the achievement of the stretching performance targets which are served the business well and has contributed to sustained long-term the key drivers of our performance.

This is sector-leading and the fifth consecutive year of growth at Taking account of this strong performance overall the Committee agreed or above 5%.
Achievement was slightly below stretch target due the following pay outcomes: to headwinds in the UK advertising market and post-Brexit pressure Base salaries for the Group CEO and Group COO & CFO were increased on the consumer environment by 2.5% on 1 July 2017, which is in line with increases for our employees.

50 Sky plc Governance Other decisions made during the year Impact of the 21st Century Fox Offer The Committee reviewed its policy on disclosure of performance targets.
Remuneration Policy Review It remains of the opinion that early disclosure of targets within two years In my 2016 statement I committed to undertaking a thorough review of of the end of the performance period would be commercially sensitive our remuneration policy prior to seeking approval for a new policy at our given the highly competitive nature of the market in which the Company 2017 AGM.
The review progressed through the first half of the year and operates.

to understand their views directly.
Activity in the coming year The 21st Century Fox Offer was announced to shareholders in December The activity for the coming year will be shaped by the outcome of the 2016 and the Committee decided that, in light of this, the pragmatic 21st Century Fox Offer.
Should the Offer be withdrawn or lapse in sufficient approach was to pause the policy review until the outcome became clear.
time prior to the 2018 AGM, the Committee will complete its review of the I wrote to our key shareholders to explain that if the Offer were still in remuneration policy and will seek the views of our major shareholders progress at the time of the 2017 AGM we would present the existing prior to putting the new policy to a shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
Remuneration Policy for re-approval, and should the Offer be withdrawn or lapse in sufficient time prior to the 2018 AGM, we would re-engage Tracy Clarke with our shareholders and submit a new policy for approval at that time.
Committee Chairman This approach has enabled us to provide a degree of certainty to our executive directors during this period and ensure that they remain focused on the business.
The policy set out in the following pages is therefore unchanged from that approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Share awards due to vest in July 2017 The Committee reviewed the impact of the Offer on the existing remuneration structure.
It concluded that the relative TSR performance measure which applies to 30% of the LTIP award due to vest in July 2017 would no longer be a fair measure of the Companys performance, due to the distortive impact of the Offer on the share price.
The TSR measure was therefore removed and vesting of the awards was based solely on the operational metrics of revenue growth, operating cash flow and average EPS growth.
The Committee considered that these metrics were no more difficult nor easy to satisfy than the TSR conditions were intended to be in the absence of the Offer, and are the most appropriate to ensure that management remains focused on the key operational metrics which continue to drive the business.
Ongoing Share awards In light of the ongoing Offer the Committee agreed to continue with the scheduled Year 2 award of the 2016-19 Long Term Incentive Plan and the 20172020 Co-Investment Plan awards that would normally be due at the end of July and in August.
These awards will vest either at the end of their normal performance period, or will be subject to early vesting conditions should the Offer complete.
