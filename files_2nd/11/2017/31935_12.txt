Chairmans Letter STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE THE BOARD CONTINUES TO PROVIDE HIGHDear Shareholder QUALITY LEADERSHIP The contribution of strong corporate governance to business TO THE GROUP success is widely recognised, and it remains an area of keen focus for investors, the government, standard setters and society more broadly.
At Genus, we are highly aware of the critical role the Board plays.
We were therefore pleased that the latest evaluation of the Boards performance showed that it continues to provide high-quality leadership to the Group.
During the year, we have devoted considerable time to analysing the Boards range of skills and planning succession for the Directors.
This will remain a priority for us in the coming year.
We have also reviewed the Groups diversity policy, recognising that diversity contributes to better business decisions.
We continue to look at how we report on corporate governance, so we provide real insight into the Boards work and how it leads the Group.
This year we have given more emphasis to our activities and offered opportunities for some of our Non-Executive Directors NEDs to share their impressions of Genus and the Board.
Set out opposite are some of this years governance highlights.
More information on each area can be found on pages 42 to 83.
