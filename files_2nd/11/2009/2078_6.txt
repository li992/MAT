6 Remuneration Report This Report outlines the remuneration policies for the Chief Executive Officer, the Group Management Committee GMC and the non-executive Directors.
The Report is structured as follows: Chairmans introduction Remuneration policy and structure Summary of remuneration for Marius Kloppers Remuneration and performance Non-executive Directors Remuneration Committee Remuneration in detail Remuneration Committee Chairmans introduction Dear Shareholder A few comments on BHP Billitons Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2009.
The year has been one in which remuneration committees and boards have been called to account for their overall governance practices, and in particular their remuneration practices, as shareholders have questioned whether those practices have contributed to the prevailing global financial crisis.
Against this background, the Committee looked again at our remuneration policy and the principles that have been used to design all of the components of executive remuneration.
We believe they remain sound.
We will continue to take guidance from shareholders and thought leaders on these issues.
We believe that while stability in our remuneration structures is an imperative from both the Companys and executives perspective, where modifications can be made that better align interests they will be actively considered.
The year saw the end of the first performance period of the Long Term Incentive Plan that applies to our most senior executives, including the Chief Executive Officer.
That plan was introduced in 2004 with a five-year performance period: something that was, and remains, unusual both in and outside our industry.
The period is an important design feature for us as we believe it reflects not only the long-term nature of our business, but gives sufficient time to ensure that there is real alignment with shareholders.
I am very pleased to report that over that period our total shareholder return was 220 per cent.
In contrast the average total shareholder return for the peer group that you will find listed in section 6.6.
9 of this Remuneration Report against which we measure our performance was 71.8 per cent.
BHP Billitons performance meant that US$80.6 billion of value has been added since 2004 over and above performance in line with the average of the peer group: an outstanding result for which the management should be commended.
As in prior years, we have continued to strive for a Report that is clear, concise and effective and we thank you for your interest.
John Buchanan Chairman, Remuneration Committee 8 September 2009 BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 147 6 Remuneration Report continued 6.1 Remuneration policy and structure The Remuneration Committee recognises that we operate in a global environment and that our performance depends on the quality of our people.
Remuneration is used to reinforce the Groups strategic objectives and the Committee keeps the remuneration policy under regular review to ensure it is appropriate for the needs of the Group.
1 Key principles of our remuneration policy The key principles of our remuneration policy are to: provide competitive rewards to attract, motivate and retain highly-skilled executives willing to work around the world apply demanding key performance indicators KPIs, including financial and non-financial measures of performance link a large component of pay to our performance and the creation of value for our shareholders ensure remuneration arrangements are equitable and facilitate the deployment of people around our businesses limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements that do not commit us to making unjustified payments.
The Committee is confident that these principles, which were applied in the year under review and are expected to be applied in FY2010 and beyond, continue to meet the Groups objectives.
2 Components of remuneration The remuneration paid and payable to members of the GMC including the CEO comprises fixed and at risk components.
The manner in which these components are determined and their alignment with BHP Billitons strategy is outlined below.

148 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 6.2 Summary of remuneration for Marius Kloppers Section 6.6.
3 of this Report contains a remuneration table that has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 made thereunder, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and relevant accounting standards.
It contains actual remuneration and an estimate of future share-based remuneration that might be earned under incentive plans.
Because the statutory remuneration table contains estimates as well as actual payments it may be difficult to ascertain what the CEO, Marius Kloppers, has been paid in the year.
This section has been prepared to give a clearer picture of what has been paid and is designed to assist shareholders in seeing how our remuneration policy translates into practice for Mr Kloppers.
An annual cycle of remuneration actually received by Mr Kloppers includes four components: a fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary paid in cash together with retirement and other benefits b at risk short-term incentive paid in cash after the end of the financial year and paid only if pre-determined performance conditions have been satisfied c at risk Deferred Shares, which were awarded approximately two years earlier as a match to the short-term cash incentive paid for that prior period and which vest only if Mr Kloppers remains with the Group until the date the shares vest and become exercisable d at risk Performance Shares, which were awarded approximately five years earlier under the Long Term Incentive Plan and which vest only if the pre-determined performance hurdle has been satisfied.
The first two components are detailed under the heading Cash and benefits received below, and the remaining components are detailed under the heading Shares received.
Cash and benefits received The table below shows the amount Mr Kloppers has been paid in cash and benefits.
It contains: the fixed remuneration received during the year ended 30 June 2009, which is made up of base salary, retirement benefits and other benefits: and the at risk remuneration paid in cash after the end of the financial year, which was earned because performance conditions for the year were met.
Annual cash Base salary Retirement benefits Other benefits short-term award 1 2 FY2009 fixed fixed fixed at risk Total US$ 2,002,455 800,982 40,598 1,732,726 4,576,761 Notes 1 Other benefits include medical insurance, professional fees paid in respect of tax compliance and life assurance-related benefits.
2 Annual cash short-term award was equivalent to 53 per cent of maximum cash award.
This will be matched with a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options after the 2009 Annual General Meetings.
Shares received In December 2007, Mr Kloppers was awarded 27,582 Deferred Shares, representing a match to his short-term cash incentive for the year ended 30 June 2007.
The end of the holding period was 30 June 2009.
The shares vested and became exercisable on 12 August 2009.
In December 2004, Mr Kloppers was awarded 225,000 Performance Shares as his long-term incentive award for 2004.
The conditions on which they would vest were set out in the Long Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2004.
Those conditions required BHP Billiton to deliver a total shareholder return of 30.7 per cent above the median of an index of peer companies over the five-year performance period, which ended on 30 June 2009.
BHP Billitons actual performance was 220 per cent compared with the comparator groups 71.8 per cent, resulting in full vesting.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 149 6 Remuneration Report continued 6.3 Remuneration and performance This section provides details of the performance components of the remuneration package, as well as information on the Groups performance.
1 Short-term incentives Short-term incentives in respect of FY2009 were earned by the CEO and members of the GMC under the Group Incentive Scheme GIS.
Mr Kloppers earned a cash award of 85 per cent of base salary, being 53 per cent of the maximum award he could have achieved.
Further details on the cash awards are provided in section 6.6.
Following shareholder approval, the target cash award for the CEO and members of the GMC was increased to 80 per cent of base salary and the maximum award was increased to 160 per cent of base salary with effect from 1 July 2008.
The cash awards are matched with a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options after the Annual General Meetings.
The GIS incentivises the executives to achieve annual goals linked to the business strategy, budget and personal objectives.
Measures are set to reflect the critical KPIs of the Group in a combination of financial and non-financial areas.
The key Group measures for the GMC in FY2009 and assessment against those measures are set out below.
Eighty per cent of Mr Kloppers measures were Group-based and 20 per cent were personal.
The Committee believes that the KPIs set and the relative weightings given to the different categories of KPI effectively incentivises short-term performance.

2 Long-term incentives Long-term incentives, in the form of Performance Shares, were awarded to the CEO and members of the GMC in December 2008 under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Duration of performance period Five years, commencing 1 July 2008.
Performance hurdle BHP Billitons TSR relative to TSR of an index of peer companies Index.
Vesting conditions For all Performance Shares to vest, BHP Billitons TSR must exceed the Index TSR by 5.5% per annum equates to exceeding the average TSR over the five-year performance period by more than 30%.
No Performance Shares vest if BHP Billitons TSR is at or below the Index TSR.
For performance between Index TSR and 5.5% per annum above the Index, vesting occurs on a sliding scale.
In the event that the Committee does not consider the level of vesting that would otherwise apply based on BHP Billitons achievement of the TSR hurdle to be a proper reflection of the financial performance of the Group, it retains the discretion to lapse some or all of a participants Performance Shares.
It is anticipated that such discretion would only be used in exceptional circumstances.
Peer group Weighted 75% to mining and 25% to oil and gas.
Maximum award each financial year An Expected Value EV not exceeding 200% of base salary.
EV can be defined as the average outcome weighted by probability, and takes into account the difficulty of achieving performance conditions and the correlation between these and share price appreciation.
The valuation methodology also takes into account factors including volatility and forfeiture risk.
EV has been used because it enables the Committee to set total target remuneration levels for the CEO and the GMC, taking into account the degree of difficulty of the LTIP Performance Hurdle and the consequent probability of awards vesting, together with ensuring that awards are externally competitive.
The EV of the 2008 LTIP awards was calculated by the Committees independent advisers, Kepler Associates, to be 31% of face value.
Retesting if performance hurdle not met Not permitted.
Treatment on departure The rules of the LTIP provide that should a participant cease employment for any reason other than death disability, resignation or termination for cause, participants would have a right to retain entitlements to Performance Shares that have been granted, but that are not yet exercisable.
The number of such Performance Shares would be pro-rated to reflect the period of service from the commencement of the relevant performance period to the date of departure and would only vest and become exercisable to the extent that the performance hurdles are met.
The Committee regards it as an important principle that where a participant resigns without the Committees consent or their employment is terminated for cause, they forfeit the entitlement to their unvested Performance Shares.
100% For full vesting to occur, BHP Billitons TSR must exceed the Index TSR 80% by more than 30% over the five-year performance period.
60% 40% 20% If BHP Billitons TSR is equal to the Index TSR, there is zero vesting.
0% Index Index 5.5% p. a. BHP Billiton TSR Details of the interests held by members of the GMC in BHP Billitons long-term incentive schemes are provided in section 6.6.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 151 LTIP vesting schedule 6 Remuneration Report continued 6.3.
2 Long-term incentives continued 2004 LTIP The Long Term Incentive Plan was first introduced following shareholder approval in 2004.
The first of the awards granted to GMC members was made in December 2004 with a performance period that ended on 30 June 2009.
2, the plan runs over a period of five years and has a performance hurdle that requires BHP Billitons total TSR to exceed the TSR of a group of peer companies by 5.5 per cent per annum.
BHP Billitons TSR performance from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2009 was 220 per cent compared with the Index TSR of 71.8 per cent.
This outperformance of 148.2 per cent on the Companys starting market capitalisation of US$54.4 billion represents outperformance of US$80.6 billion.
This is sufficient for the 2004 LTIP awards to vest in full.
The aggregate value of 2004 LTIP awards at 30 June 2009 was US$132 million for all participants.
The Remuneration Committee considered the TSR outcome in the context of Group financial performance over the five-year performance period and determined that the recorded TSR outperformance was a genuine reflection of BHP Billitons underlying financial outperformance.
Over the same period, the Company also outperformed both the ASX 100 and FTSE 100.
BHP Billiton outperformance of Index Value of US$100 invested on 1 July 2004 over the 2004 LTIP cycle %, US$B BHP Billiton vs ASX 100 and FTSE 100 160 $600 Excess BHP Billiton value creation $80.6B BHP Billiton Plc ASX 100 Index 5.5% p. a.
3 Group performance The two charts below illustrate the performance of the Group relative to the markets in which it operates over the past five years.
The first compares our TSR performance with that of the ASX 100 and the FTSE 100, both of which are broadly-based indices.
The second illustrates performance against the LTIP peer group index the relevant companies are listed in section 6.6.
The Committee believes that the broadly-based indices and the index of peer group companies are the most appropriate benchmarks for measuring our performance.
As illustrated by the charts below, BHP Billiton has strongly outperformed both the market and the LTIP Index in the level of returns it has delivered to shareholders.

Marcus Randolph 13 December 2005 The Committee regards it as an important principle that where a participant resigns without the Committees consent or their Alex Vanselow 14 June 2006 employment is terminated for cause, they forfeit the entitlement to Karen Wood 21 February 2006 their unvested Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares.
J Michael Yeager 21 March 2006 The rules of the GIS outline the circumstances in which participants would be entitled to a cash award for the performance year in which they cease employment.
Such circumstances depend on the reason for leaving.
The only circumstances in which the Committee has considered using its discretion to allow members of the GMC to receive a cash award in event of departure is for those individuals who have retired or are retiring.
On retirement, the CEO and the other GMC members will receive any entitlements accrued under the rules of their respective retirement plans and as defined under their contractual arrangements.

2 Prior to his appointment as CEO, Marius Kloppers had the choice of a 1 defined benefit, 2 defined contribution underpinned by a defined benefit promise, or 3 cash in lieu pension entitlement for each year since 1 July 2001.
He elected to take cash in lieu for each year except for FY2004 when he elected to take a defined contribution entitlement with a defined benefit underpin.
Mr Kloppers retains the option to convert the entitlement accrued in the defined contribution fund to a defined benefit entitlement.
In the past, since the value of his defined contribution entitlement has exceeded the transfer value of the defined benefit underpin that he would be entitled to should he revert to the defined benefit promise, the entitlement was treated on a defined contribution basis.
However, as measured at 30 June 2009, the transfer value of the underpin US$489,700 was greater than the defined contribution fund US$374,100.
The Company expects that over the long term the value of the defined contribution element will revert to being in excess of the transfer value of the underpin and therefore continues to treat the entitlement on a defined contribution basis.
Upon his succession as CEO on 1 October 2007, Mr Kloppers relinquished all future defined benefit entitlements.

An estimate of a maximum possible value of awards for members of the GMC can be made using the highest share price during FY2009, which was A$44.40 and 18.41, multiplied by the number of shares awarded for each scheme.
13 Chip Goodyear Prior to his retirement in January 2008, Charles Chip Goodyear was in discussions with the UK Inland Revenue regarding tax liabilities arising from the apportionment of his services to BHP Billiton Plc in the UK.
In 2009, Mr Goodyear reached an agreement with the tax authorities regarding settlement of the tax liability.
As the enquiry arose as a result of the way in which BHP Billiton apportioned his employment between BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc, the Company entered into a loan arrangement with Mr Goodyear to facilitate the settlement.
The tax liability will be eligible to be claimed as foreign tax credits by Mr Goodyear, and the terms of the loan agreement require Mr Goodyear to repay the loan amount within 30 days of receiving such credits.
The total amount of the loan was US$1,299,528 plus interest.
An estimate of this liability was disclosed in the 2008 BHP Billiton Remuneration Report as a non-monetary and other benefit of Mr Goodyear.

The appeal will be set down for hearing on 19 October 2009.
The Decree authorises and requires groundwater remediation and facility-specific source control activities, and the members of the RAL has notified its insurers of the application and has advised Pinal Creek Group are jointly liable for performing the non-facility other third parties of possible claims against them in respect specific source control activities.
Such activities are currently of matters alleged in the application.

These amounts are based on Popular Actions numbers 1,029, 1,032 and 1,048 against the provisional equal allocation of these costs among the three various defendants in connection with the privatisation of members of the Pinal Creek Group.
BHP Copper is seeking a 50 per cent of the Cerrejn Zona Norte mining complex in judicial restatement of the allocation formula to reduce its share, Colombia in 2002.

noted above incurred by BHP Copper.
Accordingly, the only action still on foot is popular action 1,032, against CZN, which remains in discovery phase.
CCT alleges, in part, that the defendants failed to comply with the privatisation process, and that the offer price for shares in CZN between Stages 1 and 2 of the privatisation process was not correctly adjusted for inflation.
Our share of the alleged adjustment of the CZN share price would be approximately US$4 million.
In the alternative, CCT seeks declaration that the privatisation is null and void and forfeiture of the transfer price paid, of which our share would be approximately US$133 million.
In both instances, CCT also seeks unquantified sanctions, including payment of stamp taxes, an award of 15 per cent of all monies recovered by the defendants, together with interest on all amounts at the maximum rate authorised by law.

As a result, an impairment charge and increased provisions for contract cancellation, redundancy and other closure costs of US$3,615 million US$1,076 million tax benefit were recognised.
This exceptional item does not include the loss from operations of Ravensthorpe nickel operations of US$173 million.
Announced sale of Yabulu refinery: On 3 July 2009, the Group announced the sale of the Yabulu operations.
As a result, impairment charges of US$510 million US$ nil tax benefit were recognised in addition to those recognised on suspension of the Ravensthorpe nickel operations.
As a result of the sale, deferred tax assets of US$175 million are no longer expected to be realised by the Group and were recognised as a charge to income tax expense.
The remaining assets and liabilities of the Yabulu operations have been classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2009.
Withdrawal or sale of other operations: As part of the Groups regular review of the long-term viability of operations, a total charge of US$665 million US$23 million tax expense was recognised primarily in relation to the decisions to cease development of the Maruwai Haju trial mine Indonesia, sell the Suriname operations, suspend copper sulphide mining operations at Pinto Valley US and cease the pre-feasibility study at Corridor Sands Mozambique.
The remaining assets and liabilities of the Suriname operations have been classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2009.
Deferral of projects and restructuring of operations: As part of the Groups regular review of the long-term viability of continuing operations, a total charge of US$306 million US$86 million tax benefit was recognised primarily in relation to the deferral of expansions at the Nickel West operations Australia, deferral of the Guinea Alumina project Guinea and the restructuring of the Bayside Aluminium Casthouse operations South Africa.
Newcastle steelworks rehabilitation: The Group recognised a charge of US$508 million US$152 million tax benefit for additional rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the Newcastle steelworks Australia.
The increase in obligations relate to changes in the estimated volume of sediment in the Hunter River requiring remediation and treatment, and increases in estimated treatment costs.
Lapsed offers for Rio Tinto: The Groups offers for Rio Tinto lapsed on 27 November 2008 following the Boards decision that it no longer believed that completion of the offers was in the best interests of BHP Billiton shareholders.

Deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2009, the Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$2,522 million 2008: US$2,400 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities At 30 June 2009, deferred tax liabilities of US$1,421 million 2008: US$1,873 million associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not been recognised because while the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Other factors affecting taxation The Australian Taxation Office ATO issued amended assessments during the period from 2005 to 2008 denying bad debt deductions arising from the investments in Hartley, Beenup and Boodarie Iron and the denial of capital allowance claims made on the Boodarie Iron project.
The Company lodged objections against all the amended assessments, which related to the financial years 1999 to 2006.
The Boodarie Iron and Beenup bad debt disallowance matters and the Boodarie Iron capital allowance matter were heard concurrently in the Federal Court in January 2009.
BHP Billiton was successful on all counts.
The amount in dispute at 30 June 2009 for the bad debts disallowance is approximately US$1,167 million net of tax, being primary tax of US$560 million and US$607 million of interest and penalties after tax.
The amount in dispute at 30 June 2009 for the denial of capital allowance deductions is approximately US$641 million, being primary tax of US$314 million and US$327 million of interest and penalties after tax.
An amount of US$679 million in respect of both disputed amounts has been paid pursuant to ATO disputed assessments guidelines, which require that taxpayers generally must pay half of the tax in dispute to defer recovery proceedings.
The amounts paid have been recognised as a reduction of the Groups net deferred tax liabilities.
In the event that BHP Billiton is ultimately successful in challenging the assessments, any sums paid will be refundable with interest.

b Diluted earnings are calculated after adding back dividend equivalent payments of US$22 million 2008: US$12 million: 2007: US$14 million that would not be made if potential ordinary shares were converted to fully paid.
c The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton share repurchase scheme, the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and the BHP Bonus Equity Plan Trust, and adjusting for the BHP Billiton Limited bonus share issue.
Included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share are shares contingently issuable under Employee Share Ownership Plans.
d Diluted earnings per share calculation excludes 320,094 of options 2008: nil: 2007: nil which are considered antidilutive.

The future realisation of these investments is intended to fund environmental obligations relating to the closure of the South African coal operations, Rio Algoms, Samancors and Selbaies mines, and consequently these investments, while under the Groups control, are not available for the general purposes of the Group.
Any income from these investments is reinvested or applied to meet these obligations.
The Group retains responsibility for these environmental obligations until such time as the former mine sites have been rehabilitated in accordance with the relevant environmental legislation.
These obligations are therefore included under non-current provisions.

In order to equalise the contribution value of the two companies, BHP Billiton will pay Rio Tinto US$5.8 billion at financial close to take its interest in the joint venture to 50 per cent.
There is a US$276 million break fee associated with this transaction which is payable by either party under certain circumstances.

216 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 30 Financial risk management The Group financial risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Groups operations are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups Portfolio Risk Management Strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is the portfolio CFaR which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
The CFaR framework includes Board-approved limits on the quantum of the CFaR relative to the Groups financial targets.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in four distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes.
Activity Key risk management processes 1 Risk mitigation Assessment of portfolio CFaR against Board-approved limits Hedging of revenues with financial instruments could be executed to mitigate risk at the portfolio level when CFaR exceeds the Board-approved limits.
Similarly, and on an exception Execution of transactions within basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific and significant expenditure approved mandates on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Groups strategic objectives.
2 Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs and debt instruments Assessment of portfolio CFaR against Board-approved limits Where group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from the relevant index target, and where a relevant derivatives market exists, financial Measuring and reporting the exposure instruments are executed as an economic hedge to align the revenue price exposure with in customer commodity contracts and issued the index target.
debt instruments Executing hedging derivatives to align the Where debt is issued with a currency or interest rate profile that deviates from the relevant total group exposure to the index target index target, fair value hedges are executed to align the debt exposure with the index target.
Similarly, where specific and significant operating costs are contracted in a currency that deviates from the relevant index target, financial instruments are executed as an economic hedge to align the currency exposure with the index target.
3 Strategic financial transactions Exposures managed within value at risk and stop loss limits Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value from perceived market over under valuations.
Execution of transactions within approved mandates 4 Proprietary trading Measuring and reporting the exposure in mandated activities Certain of our business units are mandated to undertake trading activities in specifically approved commodity derivatives.
These activities are in support of our underlying commodity Exposures managed within approved mandates businesses and provide market and commercial insight.
including position limits, value at risk limits and stop loss limits Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 217 Notes to Financial Statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
The majority of the Groups debt is raised under central borrowing programs.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally raised debt into US dollar floating rate exposures.
As at 30 June 2009, the Group holds US$8,277 million 2008: US$1,524 million of fixed interest borrowings that have not been swapped to floating rates, arising principally from debt raised during the financial year and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
The Groups strategy has not changed and the intention is to swap the fixed debt raised during the year to floating interest rates when conditions to do so are appropriate.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in fair value hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are as follows: Fair value 2009 2008 US$M US$M Interest rate swaps US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than one year but not later than two years 30 Later than two years but not later than five years 156 59 Later than five years 180 69 Cross currency interest rate swaps Australian dollar to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 344 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 162 Later than one year but not later than two years 147 Later than two years but not later than five years 114 190 Later than five years 125 Total fair value of interest rate swaps 627 949 Included within Cross currency and interest rate swaps in note 11 are derivatives held to hedge currency risk on Euro Bonds raised during the year.
These are discussed in Currency risk below.
Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2009, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will increase the Groups profit after taxation and equity by US$23 million 2008: decrease of US$41 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the debt profile of the Group may not remain constant in the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues The Groups foreign currency risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy within the overall CFaR limit.
218 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 30 Financial risk management continued Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk on the financial assets and liabilities of the Groups operations denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operations.
Net financial assets liabilities US$ A$ SA rand GBP Other Total 2009 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Functional currency of Group operation US dollars 1,895 306 87 248 1,750 Australian dollars UK pounds sterling 3 3 3 1,895 306 87 248 1,747 Net financial assets liabilities US$ A$ SA rand GBP Other Total 2008 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Functional currency of Group operation US dollars 1,114 186 39 1,318 351 Australian dollars UK pounds sterling 12 12 12 1,114 186 39 1,318 363 In March 2009, the Group issued a two tranche Euro Bond, comprising 1,250 million of 4.75 per cent Euro Bonds due 2012 and 1,000 million of 6.375 per cent Euro Bonds due 2016.
Cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts were taken out to hedge the currency risk on these bonds.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risk associated with the Euro Bonds.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognised in the hedging reserve.
Amounts accumulated in the reserve will be transferred to the income statement through to maturity of the contract.
The fair value of these derivatives is as follows: Fair value 2009 2008 US$M US$M Cross currency swaps Euro to US dollar swaps Pay fixed received fixed Later than five years 63 Forward exchange contracts Euro to US dollar foreign exchange contract Pay US dollar receive Euro Not later than one year 79 Total fair value of derivatives 142 The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, South African rand and UK pound sterling.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2009, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would have affected post-tax profit and equity as follows: 2009 2008 US$M US$M Currency movement Post-tax profit Equity Post-tax profit Equity 1 cent movement in Australian dollar 11 11 8 7 0.2 rand movement in South African rand 35 13 1 pence movement in UK pound sterling 11 1 1 The Groups financial asset and liability profile will not remain constant, and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 219 Notes to Financial Statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
In September 2007, the Group chose to discontinue the capital hedging policy for projects over US$100 million and as a result all existing hedges were closed out in the market by taking opposite positions.
Gains and losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve at the time of discontinuing this hedge policy have been recognised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment acquired over the period of the original hedge.
All such gains and losses have been recognised in the year ended 30 June 2009.
The fair value of these hedges at 30 June 2009 is US$ nil 2008: US$2 million.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is a liability of US$5 million 2008: an asset of US$2 million.
Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts are used when available to return realised prices to the index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are those entered into for the following activities: economic hedging of prices realised on commodity contracts as described above proprietary trading purchases and sales of physical contracts that can be cash-settled cash flow hedging of revenues derivatives embedded within other supply contracts All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
In addition, the Group is exposed to commodity prices on derivatives embedded in host contracts.
The significant derivative contracts recognised on the balance as at 30 June 2009 relate to electricity purchase contracts in which the power price is linked to the aluminium LME price.
A 10 per cent increase in the aluminium LME price would decrease the Groups equity and profit after tax by US$8 million 2008: US$10 million in relation to these contracts.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with shortand long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
During the year ended 30 June 2009, Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1.
The ratings outlook from both agencies has changed back to stable from negative following the announcement that the Groups proposed offers for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have lapsed.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
In March 2009, the Group issued a two tranche Global Bond under a debt shelf registration statement, which had been previously filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Global Bond comprises US$1,500 million 5.5 per cent Senior Notes due 2014 and US$1,750 million 6.5 per cent Senior Notes due 2019.
In the same month, a two tranche Euro Bond was issued, comprising 1,250 million US$1,686 million of 4.75 per cent Euro Bonds due 2012 and 1,000 million US$1,353 million of 6.375 per cent Euro Bonds due 2016.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.

This facility is used for general corporate purposes and as backup for the commercial paper programs.
The interest rates under this facility are based on an interbank rate plus a margin.
The applicable margin is typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Groups credit rating.
b Following the announcement that the Groups offers for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have lapsed, the US$55 billion acquisition facility agreement was cancelled.
c Other bank facilities are arranged with a number of banks with the general terms and conditions agreed on a periodic basis.

The Group also holds derivatives related to net debt, commodities and currencies that are expected to generate cash inflows, which are classified as other financial assets refer to note 11.
These contracts are excluded from the table above.
222 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 30 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group.
To manage credit risk the Group maintains group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily monitoring of exposures against these limits.
As part of these processes the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and assessed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: Receivables counterparties The majority of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
Payment guarantee counterparties A proportion of sales to Group customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
Derivative counterparties Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
Cash investment counterparties As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa, Australia, the US, Japan and China.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Groups receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile thereon.

These terms and conditions are determined on a case by case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer.
For an analysis of movements in impaired receivables, refer to note 10.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
In certain circumstances, the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 223 Notes to Financial Statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued Fair values All financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate, and subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost, as indicated in the tables below.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
This measurement of fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
The financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the tables below at their carrying values, which generally approximate to the fair values.
In the case of US$7,696 million 2008: US$1,304 million of centrally managed fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2009 is US$8,277 million 2008: US$1,524 million.

The Group manages capital with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing designed to optimise the cost of capital and return on capital employed, while also growing the business consistently through project developments and acquisitions.
The Groups priorities for cash flow are: reinvestment in projects that carry attractive rates of return regardless of the economic climate commitment to a solid A credit rating returning excess capital to shareholders via dividends and capital management for example share buy-backs The Groups strategy is focused on upstream, large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, export-oriented assets and the Group continually reviews its portfolio to identify assets which do not fit this strategy.
The Group will invest capital in assets where they fit our strategy.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets.

The Projected Unit Credit valuation method is used.
The Group operates final salary schemes that provide final salary benefits only, non-salary related schemes that provide flat dollar benefits and mixed benefit schemes that consist of a final salary defined benefit portion and a defined contribution portion.
Defined benefit post-retirement medical schemes The Group operates a number of post-retirement medical schemes in the US, Canada, Suriname and South Africa.
Full actuarial valuations are prepared by local actuaries for all schemes.

Actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages for defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: Australia Americas Europe South Africa 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % % % % % % % Discount rate 5.3 6.5 6.3 6.6 6.2 6.4 9.0 10.8 Future salary increases 3.9 5.0 3.8 4.4 4.9 5.2 6.9 9.3 Future pension increases 2.3 3.0 2.8 3.0 5.9 8.2 Expected rate of return on pension scheme assets 5.2 6.5 6.6 7.2 5.6 6.7 10.0 11.7 The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages for post-retirement medical schemes are as follows: Americas South Africa 2009 2008 2009 2008 % % % % Discount rate 6.0 6.3 9.1 10.5 Medical cost trend rate ultimate 5.0 5.0 7.6 9.3 Assumptions regarding future mortality can be material depending upon the size and nature of the plan liabilities.
Post-retirement mortality assumptions in the Americas, Europe and South Africa are based on post-retirement mortality tables that are standard in these regions.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the long-term target asset allocation as at the reporting date.
For bonds, the expected rate of return reflects the redemption yields available on corporate and government bonds, as applicable, as at the reporting date.
For all other asset classes, the expected rate of return reflects the rate of return expected over the long term.
For the main funds, these tables imply the following expected future lifetimes in years for employees aged 65 as at the balance sheet date: US males 17.5, US females 19.8: Canadian males 19.0, Canadian females 21.6: Netherlands males 18.8, Netherlands females 21.0: UK males 21.7, UK females 24.0: South African males 15.9, South African females 20.0.

These awards take the form of Performance Shares, Deferred Shares and or Options, and Restricted Shares in either BHP Billiton Plc or BHP Billiton Limited.
Awards made are subject to performance hurdles LTIP and service conditions all plans.
Subject to the performance conditions and service conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the award will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options over the relevant number of ordinary shares.
A description of the plans follows: i GIS and GSTIP The GIS awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
During FY2009, the Group has introduced the GSTIP, which is a replacement plan to the GIS for employees below GMC.
Awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
Deferred Shares and or Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they can be exercised.
If, during that period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited.
Deferred Shares and or Options in respect of FY2009 will be awarded during FY2010.
ii LTIP and MAP The LTIP awards are in the form of Performance Shares, and are awarded annually.
The Performance Hurdle applicable to the awards granted requires BHP Billitons Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period to be greater than the weighted average TSR of a peer group of companies.
To the extent that the Performance Hurdle is not achieved, awards are forfeited.
For all Performance Shares to vest, BHP Billitons TSR must exceed the weighted average TSR of the Index by a specified percentage, determined each year by the Committee.
Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has been set each year at 5.5 per cent.
For performance between the weighted average TSR of the Index and 5.5 per cent per annum above the Index, vesting occurs on a sliding scale.
During FY2009, the Group has introduced the MAP, which is a replacement plan to the LTIP for employees below GMC.
Under the MAP participants receive an Award of Restricted Shares, the number of which is determined by role, performance and organisation level.
There are no performance conditions attached to the Award and all the shares that have been granted will vest at the end of three years providing participants remain in employment over that time.
Participants in all award plans are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares represented by the Deferred Shares, Options, Restricted Shares and Performance Shares awarded to those participants the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants once the underlying shares are issued or transferred to them.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares that lapse.
b Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan, commenced in April 2007.
Employees may contribute up to US$5,000 to acquire shares Acquired Shares in any Plan year.
On the third anniversary of a Plan year, the Company will match the number of Acquired Shares held by the employee at that time.
The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched Shares until they are awarded.
Acquired Shares are purchased on a quarterly basis with the first purchase occurring in September 2007.
If, prior to the third anniversary, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited.
c The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date.
The fair values of awards granted were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, Black-Scholes option pricing technique and net present value technique.
d The risk-free interest rate used for the LTIP is an annual compound rate.
The risk-free interest rate used for the GIS Options and Deferred Shares is a government bond rate.
e Historical volatility has been used to estimate the volatility of the share price.
f Awards issued under these plans occurred before 7 November 2002 and as such are exempt from the provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Details of these plans have been provided here for information purposes only.
g Exercise price on awards issued is equal to the exercise price as per awards outstanding.
h Shares issued on exercise of awards under BHP Billitons employee share ownership plans include shares purchased on-market.
i In respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the following trusts: i The Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust is a discretionary trust for the benefit of all employees of BHP Billiton Plc and its subsidiaries.
The trustee is an independent company, resident in Jersey.
The Trust uses funds provided by BHP Billiton Plc and or its subsidiaries as appropriate to acquire ordinary shares to enable awards to be made or satisfied under the LTIP, MAP, GIS, GSTIP, RSS, CIP, Shareplus and other employee share schemes operated by BHP Billiton Plc from time to time.
The ordinary shares may be acquired by purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value.
ii The BHP Performance Share Plan Trust PSP Trust is a discretionary trust established to distribute shares under selected BHP Billiton Limited employee share plan schemes.

BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 - 255 Supplementary oil and gas information unaudited continued Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves Standardised measure The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised measure is based on the BHP Billiton Groups estimated proved reserves as presented in section 2.14.1 Petroleum Reserves and this data should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section.
The Standardised measure is prepared on a basis which presumes that year end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year end proved reserves would be produced.
The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates and expected future changes in technology, taxes and operating practices have not been included.
The Standardised measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing that future production at prices in effect at year end to derive future cash inflows.
Future price increases may be considered only to the extent that they are provided by fixed contractual arrangements in effect at year end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate changes.
Future cash inflows are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the year end proved reserves based on costs in effect at year end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices.
Future development costs include the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves owned at year end.
They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of production platforms and rehabilitation of drilling sites.
Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect at year end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at year end.
The resultant annual future net cash flows after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes are discounted at 10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised measure.
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised measure, the most important of which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof.
The Standardised measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of the BHP Billiton Groups oil and gas reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and gas.
b Future costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves over the next three years are expected to be US$2,185 million 2010, US$2,102 million 2011 and US$1,131 million 2012.

The beginning of year and end of year totals are shown after reduction for income taxes and these, together with the changes in income tax amounts, are shown as discounted amounts at 10 per cent per annum.
