Strategic report Governance Financials Chairmans Letter Nomination Committee Geoff Cooper Chairman of the Nomination Committee Dear Shareholder The main focus of the Nomination Committee over the last year has been the initiation of a succession planning process, and dealing with the highest impact outcome from that process the succession of our Chief Executive Officer.
Richard Hayes, who has been with the Company for 13 years including the last 7 as CEO, informed the Board during 2015 of his wish to retire at some point, once a suitable successor was identified.
Whilst the Company is fortunate in having a long serving, high quality executive team, the succession planning process revealed there were no internal candidates for the CEO role.
A professional search firm was consequently appointed.
Their brief was to identify and approach experienced retail candidates with the skills and experience to: continue to drive our existing four pillar strategy: help identify longer-term opportunities available: and lead our strong team and develop their capabilities and careers.
The search firm undertook a rigorous, balanced and thorough search process and the Committee was further assisted in its work by Darren Bryant, our Chief Financial Officer, who was also fully involved in the selection and interviewing process.
We also directed the search firm that at every stage, from desk research to final shortlist, without compromising the quality of candidates, we wanted as far as possible to ensure men and women were equally represented.
As shareholders will now be aware, Karen Hubbard, formerly Chief Operating Officer of a value-orientated general retailer, with experience in supermarkets and convenience stores, was appointed Chief Executive Officer Designate in January 2016, and will take over from Richard in April 2016.
Looking forwards, the Nomination Committees priority will be to extend the succession planning process so that it covers all key roles in our senior management team.
Yours sincerely Geoff Cooper Chairman of the Nomination Committee 4 April 2016 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 67
