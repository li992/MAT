JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2016 16:47 Page 3 Strategic Report Over the year to 31st January 2016, your Company outperformed its benchmark with a Net Chairmans Asset Value return of 12.9% cum income, debt at par against 4.7% for the benchmark.
Share price total return was 18.6%.
This result is good in itself, but to put it in perspective, Statement 1 and no less importantly, your Company has outperformed its benchmark by 11.0% and 6.7% over three and five years respectively.
Measured against the FTSE 100 Index, outperformance is even more marked.
The Company 2 has beaten the FTSE 100 performance by 41.6%, 50.5% and 76.9% over three, five and ten years respectively.
Please refer to the graph on page 12 for details of performance.
The performance of the portfolio is addressed more fully in the Investment Managers Report.
Returns and Dividends Earnings per share increased from 42.1p to 51.5p over the year, compared with the year ended 31st January 2015.
The major reason for the increase was the rise in underlying and special dividend receipts.
Your Company has paid three interim dividends of 10.0p per ordinary share over the year under review, and the Board has declared a fourth quarterly interim dividend of 13.0p, giving a total dividend of 43.0p for the year, an increase of 2.0p on last years total dividend of 41.0p.
The yield continues to compare favourably with the Companys peers.
The Board intends to pay the first three interim dividends for the current year ending 31st January 2017 at 10.25p per ordinary share.
The level of the fourth interim dividend will be determined by the Board towards the end of the financial year and will depend on the level of dividends received and anticipated by the Company.
The Board recognises the importance to shareholders of a smooth flow of dividends over the course of the year, and also of maintaining a strong revenue reserve to protect the dividend flow for shareholders.
As at the year end, taking account of the payment of the fourth interim dividend, the revenue reserve stood at 28.8million, which is the equivalent to 30.0 pence per share.
The Board recognises the importance to Discount and Share Buybacks shareholders of a smooth Over the year under review, the discount narrowed from 14.6% to 10.6% on the basis of a ow of dividends over the cum income calculation with debt at par.
Using a cum income calculation with debt at fair value, the discount would be shown to have narrowed over the course of the year from course of the year, and 10.8% to 7.4%.
I would urge you to refer to page 20 where there is an explanation of the also of maintaining a calculation methodologies.
strong revenue reserve to During the year a total of 1,747,595 shares were repurchased for cancellation, amounting protect the dividend ow to 1.79% of issued share capital at the beginning of the year, at a total cost of 28.0 million.
Share buy backs during the year under review have added approximately 4.3p to the net for shareholders.
The Board intends to continue to use the share repurchase authority to enhance value and manage imbalances between the supply and demand of the Companys shares, thereby reducing the volatility of the discount.
The Board believes that, to date, this mechanism has been helpful and therefore proposes and recommends that the powers to repurchase up to 14.99% of the Companys shares, be renewed for a further period.
It is proposed that the authority permit either that these shares be cancelled or held in treasury.
Gearing The Company ended the year with net cash of 4.6%.
During the year gearing varied between 0.7% geared and 5.0% net cash.
It is the Boards intention to continue to operate within the range of 10% net cash to 20% geared, under normal market conditions.

4 JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2016 16:47 Page 5 Strategic Report continued Outlook In last years review of performance I commented that geopolitical events had taken centre stage, increasing market volatility and overshadowing what had been the UK economys strongest year since the recession.
In many respects this year has been much the same, with political events dominating once again.
No sooner had we navigated the General Election than market focus switched to Britains future within the European Union and the upcoming referendum.
The uncertainty surrounding a possible exit is likely to remain the key focus point for investors in the UK market over the coming few months.
More broadly, the path for global economic growth and monetary policy has become more uncertain as we enter a period of economic adjustment and expected central bank divergence in the major global economies.
In spite of this, UK GDP continued to grow at an estimated 2.3% in 2015, and the economy is forecast to grow 2.0% in 2016, providing opportunities for earnings growth for medium and small sized companies.
Given the considerable market volatility expected in the lead up to the June referendum, the Company has retained a net cash position since the year end.
However, the Investment Managers remain confident in the long term growth prospects of medium and small sized companies and expect the coming twelve months to provide opportunities to reinvest the Companys gearing facilities.

However, this number masks the divergent performance of different pockets of the market, and particularly important for our shareholders was the continued trend of outperformance of companies outside the FTSE100 relative to their larger counterparts.
They rose 4.7%, as Contributions to total can be seen in the chart below.

This was demonstrated in profits: for the 2015 calendar year the FTSE All-Share delivered an aggregate decline in profits of 16%, driven predominantly by the FTSE 100 where they fell 17%, compared with a more moderate 3% decline for the FTSE 250.
Such divergence in growth was also evident between industries for example profits in the oil & gas and basic materials sectors fell over 50% while consumer goods and consumer services managed to deliver a small rise.
We maintain that this underlines the importance of active management, where the manager has the freedom to target companies with attractive growth prospects while avoiding those areas under the most pressure.
UK companies were not alone in experiencing weakening profits as economic growth across the world has been below trend.
If anything, the UK economy has continued to demonstrate resilience, delivering in 2015 real GDP growth of 2.3%, the second highest of the G7 group of major economies, behind the US.
However, we should differentiate between the UK stock market and the UK economy, as the companies in the FTSE 100 derive the majority of their revenue from international markets, as shown in the pie charts on page 7, while those companies outside of the FTSE 100 where we focus are more heavily weighted to domestically sourced revenue and thus more representative of the UK economic performance.

The most significant contributions came from the beverages sector with our holding in the premium mixer brand Fever-Tree performing particularly well.
In the leisure sector our holdings in Betfair, the online betting exchange, and Dominos Pizza, the market leading pizza delivery business, were notable contributors.
At a sector level, the largest detractor from performance was the Software & Computer Services sector, as the fund did not hold Telecity, which outperformed following bid approaches from two of its peers.
The largest individual detractor at a stock level was the Our investment holding in Poundland, where a Phase II competition review delayed the proposed acquisition philosophy seeks to of 99p stores and underlying trading was impacted by lower footfall on the high street.

The business is highly cash generative, and has a strong balance sheet.
In 2013 the new CEO set out a strategy to make the group leaner and return it to revenue growth by attracting more casual players.
Having met him at this time, we saw the management team on three further occasions before investing while we tracked the progress of a number of key performance indicators, including first time depositors, which provided evidence of progress in attracting casual players to the site.
As these indicators ticked up it gave us confidence that the company could outperform market expectations, a factor that was not reflected in the valuation.
8 JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2016 16:47 Page 9 Strategic Report continued Through the course of 2015 Betfair repeatedly exceeded the markets revenue expectations, which prompted a significant rise in the share price.
In August 2015 the company announced a possible merger with Paddy Power.
Among other benefits, this deal offered the potential to accelerate the transition of bricks and mortar only players into multi-channel users with higher expected lifetime values.
Following the completion of the merger the company has been promoted into the FTSE 100 index and is no longer held in the portfolio.
Portfolio Positioning and the year ahead where are the current and future opportunities?
Our investment approach is primarily focused on company specific analysis and stock selection, but we remain cognisant of the broader macro-economic conditions and trends that may influence the relative attractiveness of different industries over time.
At an aggregate level, the key end market exposures of the portfolio remained largely unchanged through the year overweight in domestic, consumer exposed stocks while being underweight stocks in resources and resource exposed industries.
This positioning served our investors well in 2015 and we believe it will continue to do so.

Outlook Key themes for the year-ahead In our outlook statement last year, we explained our positive view of the domestic consumer, driven in part by the dramatic fall in commodity prices during the second half of 2014, and how this would lead to consumers experiencing real wage growth for the first time in the last five years.
This view has been reinforced over the past year, as the slight uptick in earnings combined with negligible inflation has ushered forth a period of sustained real wage growth.
8% Real wage growth of the UK consumer earnings 6% growth vs. inflation 4% 2% 0% -2% -4% -6% -8% 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Dierence Earnings Regular Pay Ination CPI The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 9 JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2016 16:47 Page 10 Strategic Report continued This relatively small increase in real wages feeds through to a significant increase in disposable income i. e. income available for discretionary spending after the basic cost of living.
The bar chart below shows the ASDA income tracker data, a measure of the weekly disposable income available to the average UK household in nominal terms, and which has been growing in mid to high single digit percentage terms for the past year.
This leads us to remain positive on those companies that were already hold in the portfolio, such as retailers and leisure companies, which should benefit directly from an increase in consumer spending, and where we view that this is not yet reflected in their share price.
200 ASDA Income Tracker average UK household weekly disposable income 180 160 140 120 The collapse in the price of crude oil and other commodities is clearly negative for those companies that either extract them or service the extractors.
Share prices in many of these companies have seen significant pressure, and while we remain negatively positioned in energy, resources and related industries, believing that the risks are not yet fully reflected in share prices or market expectations, we continue to monitor these companies closely.
The timing of any action is hard to predict, but we still expect that the next major shift for the portfolio will be to reduce or even reverse this negative positioning, albeit selectively.
Guy Anderson In terms of aggregate market exposure, we view the coming months with a certain amount of trepidation due to the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum irrespective of the advantages or disadvantages of an exit, it is clear that such a journey would be fraught with uncertainty and therefore market volatility.
Reflecting this and a host of other exogenous risks, the portfolio currently holds 4% net cash, leaving us with plenty of capacity and poised to take advantage of any market driven opportunities for reinvestment.
Furthermore, we believe that the favourable dynamics of investing in medium and small sized companies will continue to drive superior returns for shareholders over the long-term.
