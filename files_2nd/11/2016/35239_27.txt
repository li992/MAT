106 GOVERNANCE Letter from the Chairman of the Audit Committee Stephen Young Chairman of the Audit Committee Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present this years report of the Audit Committee.
During the year, in order to implement EU legislation, the FRC completed its latest update of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and also revised its Guidance on Audit Committees.
The main change to the Code is an additional requirement that the Committee as a whole shall have competence relevant to the sector in which the Company operates.
Following the review of the membership of all the Board Committees carried out at the start of the year by the Nominations Committee, the Committee is satisfied that it meets this requirement.
The new requirements apply to accounting periods commencing on or after 17 June 2016 which means that they are not mandatory for Derwent London until next year.
However, we believe that, in most aspects, the report of the Audit Committee that follows complies with the new requirements.
With regard the regular duties of the Committee, it was again asked by the Board to consider whether the Groups report and accounts were, taken as a whole, fair balanced and understandable: it considered the appropriateness of the Groups Going Concern and Viability statements: and it reviewed the integrity of the financial reporting and internal controls.
In each of these instances, after carrying out appropriate procedures, the Committee was satisfied with the proposed disclosure.
Details of this and other work carried out by the Committee are set out in the following report.
The annual review of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee was carried out by Lintstock.
It concluded that the Committee was very effective and made recommendations for further improvement which we shall look to implement in 2017.
Stephen G. Young Chairman of the Audit Committee 28 February 2017
