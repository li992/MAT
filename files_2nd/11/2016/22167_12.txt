Chairmans Letter Audit and Risk Committee David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee Dear Shareholder The Audit and Risk Committee plays an important role in ensuring that the interests of shareholders are properly protected by monitoring the activities and conduct of management and auditors.
Following the Groups IPO and the Committees establishment in 2014, a clear agenda was put in place for the Committee to ensure that appropriate assurance could be given to shareholders as to the continuing effectiveness of the Groups internal controls, its financial and business reporting, and its framework for identifying and managing risk.
I am pleased to report that the Committee has made progress in a number of areas during the course of the year.
In particular we have: continued to monitor the control structure of the Group that supports the Boards ability to make judgements about the Groups financial position and prospects: appointed Deloitte LLP to provide internal audit services to the Group, reviewed and agreed their detailed internal audit plan and received reports from their initial work: further developed our approach to risk management, ensuring that effective and robust risk management is an integral part of the Groups business planning and decision making processes with the principal risks being regularly reviewed by the senior management team and the Committee: and carried out a review of the Groups business resilience arrangements identifying areas for development and practical solutions that will support the continuing evolution of processes in this area.
More details are provided in the formal report of the Committee that follows, but the Directors recognise the importance of continuing to develop the work of the Committee to ensure that it remains aligned with the strategic goals of the Group whilst also continuing to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM in May.
Yours sincerely David Stead Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 4 April 2016 44 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
