119 GSK Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor information Pay for performance audited Annual bonus The annual bonus opportunity is based on a formal review of performance against stretching financial targets.
This outcome is then adjusted to reect individual performance by applying an Individual Performance Multiplier IPM.
The IPM is set by the Committee taking into account performance against individual objectives.
The multiplier may be set between 0% and 150%.
2016 performance against targets For 2016, the financial measures and weightings were as follows: Weighting 2016 performance Performance Positioning 1 2 2 measure Sir Andrew Witty Simon Dingemans Dr Moncef Slaoui 2016 Target Outcome against target Core Group Operating profit 75% 75% 6,706m 6,914m 103% Core Group PBIT 25% 25% 25% 6,386m 6,592m 103% Vaccines performance 75% 1,038m 1,207m 116% 1 Threshold and maximum performance targets were set at 90% and 110% of Target respectively.
2 The Core Group Operating profit and Core Group PBIT targets and outcomes for the purposes of annual bonus differ from Core Group Operating profit and PBIT disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, primarily because both the target and outcome numbers are calculated applying GSK budget exchange rates and not actual exchange rates.
The following table shows actual bonuses earned compared to opportunity for 2016: 2016 bonus opportunity 2016 bonus outcome Financial performance Base salary Target Maximum outcome Total 2016 Total 2016 Bonus $000 % of salary % of salary % salary IPM % % of salary $000 Sir Andrew Witty 1,115 125 200 162 120 194 2,167 Simon Dingemans 736 80 180 104 120 124 915 Dr Moncef Slaoui $1,242 85 200 126 110 139 $1,726 The table below sets out the matters which the Committee considered in respect of the financial measures and weightings set for the Executive Directors.
Financial performance Core Group Operating Group turnover increased 6% CER on a reported basis to 27.9 billion and 5% CER on a pro-forma basis.
profit and Core Group Core Group Operating profit increased by 14% CER on a reported basis and 17% CER on a pro-forma basis.
Core Group PBIT PBIT grew 14% CER on a reported basis.
Both of these were ahead of target performance for 2016 but below the maximum targets.
Core operating margin of 27.9% was 4.6 percentage points higher than in 2015 and 2.6 percentage points higher in CER terms on a pro-forma basis.
This reected improved operating leverage driven by sales growth and a more favourable mix across all three businesses as well as delivery of restructuring and integration benets and tight control of ongoing costs, partly offset by continued price pressure, particularly in Respiratory, and supply chain and R&D investments.
Vaccines performance Vaccines sales increased 14% CER on a reported basis to 4,592 million and 12% CER on a pro-forma basis.
Overall results benefited from the strong performance of Bexsero, as well as higher demand for Fluarix Flulaval in the US and International and Menveo in International.
Further growth was driven by Synorix due to market expansion in International and a tender award in Europe and Boostrix, which grew in Europe and International.
Vaccines core operating profit increased by 38% in CER terms.
The operating profit margin of 31.7% was 7.6 percentage points higher than in 2015 in CER terms on a pro-forma basis.
The results were driven primarily by improved product mix and enhanced operating leverage from strong sales growth, together with integration and restructuring benets in costs of sales, SG&A and R&D, and higher royalty income.
120 GSK Annual Report 2016 Annual report on remuneration continued Pay for performance audited continued In determining the appropriate Individual Performance Multiplier IPM that should be applied to the annual bonus outcome for each Executive Director, the Committee took into account performance against a number of key strategic objectives that were set for each individual at the start of the year.

Malus and clawback policy The companys policy on malus and clawback is set out in the companys Remuneration policy report, page 140 and is also available at www.
com in the Investors section.
From 1 January 2015 in respect of each financial year, the Committee discloses whether it or the Recoupment Committee has exercised clawback or malus.
Disclosure will only be made when the matter has been the subject of public reports of misconduct, where it has been fully resolved, where it is legally permissible to disclose and where it can be made without unduly prejudicing the company and therefore shareholders.
In line with these disclosure guidelines, neither the Committee nor the Recoupment Committee has exercised malus or clawback during 2016.

The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares or ADS and the total value of the shares or ADS on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
In respect of nil-cost options under the DABP, the bonus which is deferred by the Director is recorded as remuneration under annual bonus for the year to which it relates.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises this remuneration, the total of the amounts received in re-invested dividends prior to vesting and the gains or losses resulting from movements in the share price between the dates of grant and exercise for the initial bonus amount deferred and the dates of dividend reinvestment and exercise for the re-invested dividends.
For the matching element of the DABP, the remuneration of the Executive Director is recorded in the year that the performance period ends and represents the number of vested shares multiplied by the price at vesting.
The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises the total of this remuneration and the gain or loss resulting from the movement in the share price between vesting and exercise.
For Sir Andrew Witty: The gain of 503,628 recorded following the exercise of the 36,442 nil-cost options relating to the deferral of bonus earned in respect of 2012 comprises remuneration of 452,400 recorded in 2012 as annual bonus and a net gain of 51,228 relating to the re-investment of dividends prior to vesting and movements in the share price between grant and dividend re-investment dates and the exercise date.
