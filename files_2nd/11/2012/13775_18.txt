Corporate governance Introduction Dear fellow shareholder Statement of compliance Throughout the year ended 30 September 2012, the Company has complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code published in May 2010.
Good corporate governance is about helping to run the Company well.
It involves ensuring that an effective internal framework of systems and controls is put in place which clearly defines authority and accountability and which promotes success whilst permitting the management of risk to appropriate levels.
It involves the exercise of judgement as to the definitions of success, the appropriateness of risk and the levels of delegation to the executive.
The exercise of this judgement is the responsibility of the Board and involves consideration of processes and assumptions as well as outcomes.
It also involves the creation of a sensitive interface for the views of shareholders and other stakeholders to be given appropriate consideration when reaching these judgements.
The Financial Services Authority requires UK listed companies to explain how they have applied the main principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and whether they have complied with the principles set out within the Code throughout the financial year.
This report, therefore, sets out how we have applied the Code and confirms our compliance with it throughout the year.
I trust you will find the report informative and helpful.
