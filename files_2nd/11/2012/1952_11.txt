Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 30 Governance Chairmans Statement on Corporate Governance I am pleased to report that the Company has complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code throughout the year under review.
As Chairman, I am responsible for the leadership of the Board and ensuring that it conducts itself in an effective manner.
The Board has agreed clearly defined roles for myself and the Chief Executive and the non-executive directors challenge management and contribute to strategy.
The Board, its committees and individual directors are subject to annual performance evaluation and all directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Appointments to the Board will always be made on merit against objective criteria, and the Board strongly supports the principle of boardroom diversity, in all aspects.
In the current financial year, the Nomination Committee will be commencing a search for a new non-executive director to strengthen the Board's non-executive element in light of Mr Watson's forthcoming appointment as non-executive Chairman on 1 February 2013.
I am also pleased to confirm that the Board will, in this financial year, for thefirst time be carrying out its annual performance evaluation, using external third party facilitators, inaccordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
