3.1 | Chairmans introduction Welcome to our second Corporate Governance report.
In preparing this report we have been mindful of the conflicting challenges of governance reporting the objective on the one hand of keeping the report concise and the aim on the other of providing a full and complete report.
Throughout 2012 the Company believes that it has been fully compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code as published in June 2010 the Code except in respect of board evaluation as stated below.
We have sought to report on our governance in a user friendly and direct a manner as possible, giving a clear summary of the considered leadership which the Board and its Committees provides to the Group.
We would welcome feedback on this report.
