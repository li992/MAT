Corporate governance Governance overview I believe that we use our committees effectively to carry out the required oversight and governance of risk.
The Gulf of Mexico committee has continued to work to cover the wide range of litigation in which we remain involved as a result of the Deepwater Horizon accident.
This allows the board to focus on key areas of strategy.
The SEEAC visited several operations to evaluate our safety culture and implementation of operational standards.
As a board we focus on the delivery of long-term value to our shareholders, but given the nature of our business we must do so in a way that is sensitive to the societies in which we work.
This means setting values and standards of behaviour both inside and outside the company.
Fair, balanced and understandable During the year, the board considered the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code in the context of BPs governance practices.
One of these changes has been the requirement for directors to make a statement that they consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be Safety, strategy, project selection and project fair, balanced and understandable.

continued to work well and learn.
Shareholders will see that the number of meetings of the board and the committees has appropriately decreased since 2012.
We are moving to what we hope will be a more established rhythm.
During the year, the nomination committee carried out a detailed review of current board skills Carl-Henric Svanberg and the needs of the board in terms of knowledge, expertise and diversity Chairman over the coming years.
As part of this review directors were asked how the board should operate in future.
In January, as part of the 2013 board evaluation, we reviewed this work in the context of the results of the evaluations over the past three years.
In looking at the past year I would like to highlight just some of the areas upon which we have focused.
In 2011 the board agreed the 10-point plan, setting a clear strategy for the company and determined the measures by which that strategy should be evaluated.
We want to be judged on the value we generate for our shareholders and not the volume of hydrocarbons that we produce.
To do this we have to invest our capital wisely and be clear on how we will execute our projects so that value is maximized.
All of this needs to be done without compromising on safety.
So safety, strategy, project selection and project execution have been at the forefront of our discussions as a board.
