CHAIRMANS INTRODUCTION ALASTAIR LYONS, CBE CHAIRMAN Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the fi financial year ended 31December 2013.
The Board remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance.
This Report sets out the Admiral framework of governance and the approach the Board has taken during 2013 to achieve the standards of good corporate governance for which it is accountable tothe Groupsshareholders.
The year has seen considerable changes tonarrative and remuneration reporting regulations and we have set out inthe report how we have met the requirements of these new regulations.
We also confi rm the Groups compliance, during the year under review, with the principles and provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code theCode.
We believe that having a sound corporate governance framework enables effective and effi cient decision making and ensures that there is the right balance of skills and experience toassess and manage the risks in the markets inwhich the Group operates and inherent in theGroups activities.
However we also believe that good governance should be proportionate andthat individual responsibility and accountability should not be lost within amulti-layered committee structure that distances senior management from the day-to-day reality of operational activity.
This year, in line with corporate governance best practice, the Group undertook an external Board evaluation facilitated by anindependent external consultant.
This process confi rmed that the Board and its Committees continue to operate effectively and that each Director demonstrates the required commitment to the role and makes a valuable contribution to Board decision making.
The results of the evaluation and the areas for development identifi ed by it are set out at pages 42 and 43.
This Corporate Governance Report is structured in order to demonstrate to shareholders that the Board has complied during 2013 in all respects with each section of the Code: Leadership: Effectiveness: Accountability: andRelations with Shareholders.
Remuneration is dealt with in the separate Directors Remuneration Report.
