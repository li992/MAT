MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Message from the Chairman During a year when the share price reached an all time high, exposure to UK listed companies was reduced from 33 to 18 as part of the move to a truly global approach.
This approach, adopted over the past four years, has been embraced enthusiastically by the Board and the Managers.
The Benchmark now changes to a more global one.
The total number of holdings is now likely to stay at around 75 and the Managers will continue to focus on individual companies rather than allocating funds regionally.
They will also continue to take a long term view with an intended average holding period for individual investments of 5 years or more.
Performance over the four years has been good in both absolute and relative terms: the share price is up 131% while the benchmark rose by 78%.
The longer term performance is illustrated by the graphs overleaf.
