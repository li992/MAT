together with the presence of north-south belt discordant mafic dykes.
The main alterations observed are .
The interaction between these two structural trends, pyrite.
Trench results from west to east include: in this case primary dextral movement along north-south NYTR17: 34 metres at 0.16g t and 24 metres at 0.51g t, including 14 metres at 0.82g t. trending faults, causes reaction of the northeast belt parallel NYTR21: 16 metres at 0.10g t and 18 metres at 1.10g t. structures and in turn creates dilation on the east-northeast NYTR31: 22 metres at 0.61g t and 20 metres at 0.10g t. structures.
An RC drill programme will follow-up these results in 2007.

region were incorporated into the current joint venture agreement with Randgold Resources.
TANZANIA In Tanzania, generative work is the driver to build a new portfolio of projects: we are relooking at the Southern Lake Victoria Goldfield, the Proterozoic mobile belts and new greenstone belts within the Craton.
An evaluation of the old Kiabakari mine was completed: RC and diamond core drilling tested the immediate vicinity of the old mine and a 2 000 metre strike along the Kiabakari fault.
Anomalous values were returned along a 1 800 metre segment of the fault associated with three structures within a 300 metre wide corridor.
However the main mineralisation is constrained to a 500 metre long by 35 metre wide zone grading 2 to 6g t, within which the high grade payshoot, measuring approximately 100 metre by 30 metre grading plus 6g t has been mined out to 350 metres below the surface and selectively to 500 metres below the surface.
Randgold Resources has fully tested the Kiabakari target and concludes that there is no big mineralised system which fits its criteria for further investment.
This project has been handed back to the government.
In the Mara Region, mapping and trenching have tested the Mara fault corridor which has been traced for 3 kilometres within the Nyabigena South permit.
This fault system hosts the Nyabirama mine 1 million ounce resource, the Komarera deposit 400 000 ounces in addition to two old colonial mines Mara and Pontama.
The results are encouraging with two 15 to 30 metre anomalous zones, within a 70 to 90 metre wide east-west structural corridor, locally mylonitic.
Geologically the target is underlain by granodiorite gneisses with highly deformed and carbonated Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 41
