plc Low cost with care convenience Corporate and social responsibility report easyJet and the environment easyJets goal is to ensure that its existing business is as efficient as possible, both in the air and on the ground, and to strive to find ways to minimise its environmental impact in the future.
Below are the details of how easyJet will monitor and manage its environmental impact.
easyJets impact on the environment involves the following: Greenhouse gas emissions: carbon dioxide CO2, water vapour, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide together NOx, some of which at altitude: Particulate emissions: sulphate particles formed from sulphur oxides and soot, some of which at altitude: Waste: chemicals involved in aircraft maintenance, onboard waste and office waste: and Noise.
Noise As of September 2006 all of the aircraft in easyJets fleet were compliant with the latest international noise standards, known as Chapter 3.
Beyond this, 91% of easyJets fleet as of September 2006 conformed to a more stringent standard, known as Chapter 4. easyJet fleet conforming to chapter 4 international noise standards % chapter 3 100 16 37 33 51 71 91 84 67 63 49 29 9 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 Emissions and waste One gramme g of CO2 emitted from an aircraft has the same climatic effect as 1g of CO2 emitted from a ground source.
The scientific understanding of the effects of CO2 emissions is well advanced.
The non-CO2 environmental effects of aircraft are not well characterised by the Kyoto Global Warming Potential metric GWP.
According to the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC special report on aviation the non-CO2 effects of aircraft are not as well understood because of the many scientific uncertainties remaining.
For example, NOx emissions at altitude have both a warming and cooling effect.
The IPCC considered the best measure of the combined effects of greenhouse gas GHG emissions, particulate emissions and contrail formation from aviation to be radiative forcing.
According to the IPCC the best estimate for 1992 of the radiative forcing by aircraft is 0.05Wm-2, or about 3.5% of the total radiative forcing by all anthropogenic activities.
The IPCC will report on aviation again in 2007, but more recent estimates suggest 2 that for 2000 radiative forcing by global aviation has remained at a similar proportion to that seen in 1992.
According to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, aviation CO2 emissions currently account for 0.7 Gt CO2 1.6% of global GHG emissions.
In 2050 under business as usual projections, CO2 emissions from aviation would represent 2.5% of global GHG emissions.
However, taking into account the non-CO2 effects of aviation would mean that it would account for around 5% of the total warming effect 3 radiative forcing in 2050.

42 Annual report and accounts 2006 easyJets business is to fly passengers between European cities.
easyJet does not carry cargo.
Therefore, for easyJet, the most appropriate measures of environmental efficiency with regard to CO2 emissions are: grammes per passenger kilometre and kilogrammes per passenger flight.
In 2006, easyJet flights produced an average CO2 emission of 95.7g per passenger kilometre and 91.8 kg per passenger flight.
All aspects of easyJets business model are designed around safety and efficiency.
This focus on efficiency minimises easyJets and the airline industrys environmental footprint.
From its inception in 1995, easyJets network development has focused on substituting services in markets dominated by inefficient former state-owned airlines with its more efficient product.
easyJet stimulates demand through its low fares when it enters a market: the efficiency that easyJet brings to a market, though, can mean an overall reduction in emissions in absolute terms.
easyJets network development has the following attributes: 80% of easyJets current and future capacity is employed in established markets: easyJet aims to grow those markets but in the process easyJet aims to substitute existing, less efficient services.
easyJet also competes on some of its routes against rail and road transportation: however, there are only two routes London to Newcastle, and London to Paris where the city-centre to city-centre rail journey would be less than four hours.
These routes represented less than 2% of passengers carried by easyJet in 2006.
In both cases, easyJet caters for demand which is not necessarily travelling city-centre to city-centre.
There is no accepted single measure for an airlines environmental efficiency.
In the absence of such a measure, easyJet has set itself the target of being a leading environmentally efficient and responsible airline.
easyJet has established an environmental code, which it aims to use to monitor progress towards this target.
The environmental code is centred around three promises: 1 easyJet strives to be efficient in the air.
2 easyJet strives to be efficient on the ground.
3 easyJet aims to lead the way in shaping a greener future for aviation.
The easyJet environmental code 1 easyJet strives to be efficient in the air A Investment in the latest technology easyJets policy is to grow its fleet using the latest technology aircraft, whilst retiring older aircraft usually within seven to ten years of delivery.
New technology aircraft are more fuel efficient than older models.
At 30 September 2006, easyJets fleet had an average age of 2.2 years, a reduction of 0.8 years from September 2005.
Since FY 2000 easyJets emissions of CO2 per passenger kilometre has reduced by 18%.
easyJet CO emissions passenger km 2000 1 2 1.000 0.968 0.947 0.920 0.899 0.851 0.824 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 Annual report and accounts 2006 43 plc Low cost with care convenience Corporate and social responsibility report continued B Efficient use of aircraft Our standard aircraft is the Airbus A319.
The typical seating configuration of an Airbus A319 is 124 seats source: Airbus.
Our no-frills service allows us to reduce the space and weight inside the plane devoted to galleys, lavatories and storage.
Our Airbus A319s fly with 156 seats.
Each of our Airbus A319s carries 26% more seats than the norm.
Our simple automated pricing allows us to sell significantly more seats than a typical European airline.
Our average load factor percentage of seats 4 sold in 2006 was 84.8%: the average load factor for European airlines in 2005 was 68.3%.
easyJet sells on average 132 seats per flight: a typical European airline would sell 84 seats per flight.
Each of our Airbus A319s potentially carries 57% more passengers per flight than the European norm.
Using a conservative estimate and assuming the carriage of no cargo plus the same baggage allowance the weight of the additional passengers carried by easyJet in this calculation would require an additional 23% more fuel for the same route length than carriers flying with 84 passengers.
easyJet estimates that, compared to easyJet, the typical European airline operating an Airbus A319 would burn 27% more fuel per passenger.
C Direct point-to-point flights, no connections Conventional airlines operate networks based on a hub and spoke system.
In these networks, the majority of passengers will take two flights to reach their destination, connecting through the hub.
easyJet always flies direct, or point to point, and does not offer any connecting services.
A direct service between two points will produce lower emissions than two flights via a hub.
Example: easyJet offers a direct service from Berlin to Madrid.
If a customer chooses to fly the same route via Paris Orly, which lies on the path of the direct flight, easyJet estimates that this routing would result in 19% more CO2 emissions than if the customer had taken the direct flight.
Example: on a shorter route, the effect of changing aircraft at an airport positioned away from the direct route adds considerably more to the fuel burn per passenger trip.
easyJet estimates that a trip from Berlin to Nice via Paris Orly would add 45% to the direct route distance and would add 57% to the CO2 emissions generated per passenger.
A small proportion of easyJets customers do buy combinations of flights to reach their final destination, where a direct easyJet service does not exist.
If numbers of customers build up on certain routings, easyJet will actively look to open direct services to satisfy this demand.
Example: in July 2006, easyJet opened a direct service to Malaga from Glasgow, after having seen an increasing trend in our customers choosing to fly that route via one of our three London airports.
easyJet believes this flight will give our passengers a better, quicker service, reduce congestion at the London airports and reduce fuel burn per passenger trip.
D Avoidance of air congestion easyJet prefers to avoid the largest, most congested hub airports.
easyJet does not fly to London Heathrow or to Frankfurt Main.
It should be noted that easyJets network is very different to that of a conventional hub and spoke carrier.
easyJet has no hubs but places capacity at the airports that local demand requires airports serve no other operational purpose than to allow passengers to board or leave an aircraft.
easyJet therefore has 16 local crew and aircraft bases in five countries.
Example: large central hubs such as London Heathrow and Frankfurt tend to require aircraft to fly longer holding patterns and longer taxi times to and from the runway.
Below are the average time each aircraft spends in a holding pattern, the proportion of aircraft held plus the proportion of easyJet flights at each of the four main London Airports for January to June 2006: Average Proportion of Number Proportion of time held aircraft held of easyJet easyJets fleet London airport mins % aircraft based % Heathrow 4.4 54 0 0 Gatwick 1.06 19 18 16 Stansted 0.79 16 13 11 Luton 0.17 4 17 15 Source: NATS Operational Performance Report: July 2006 4 Association of European Airlines AEA Annual Results 2006.
44 Annual report and accounts 2006 E easyJet monitors its performance relative to other transport options Comparison with long-haul flying Many of easyJets passengers are using easyJet to fly to specific destinations.
A proportion of easyJets passengers have a choice of holiday destination.
In making this choice, length of flight is the major determinant of the total emissions produced per passenger.
easyJets average length of flight in FY 2006 was 954 kilometres.
Example: the chart below benchmarks a typical easyJet passenger journey London to Nice, 1050 kilometres against a range of long-haul alternatives.
A typical long-haul flight to Miami would create approximately ten times more emissions per passenger than an easyJet flight from London to Nice.
easyJet short haul vs long haul number of London Nice flights 31.0 28.1 17.5 16.2 14.1 13.9 12.6 10.7 10.0 9.4 7.7 3.9 Source: easyJet based on climatecare.
Comparison with rail In contrast to aviation, data on the fully-costed environmental impact of rail journeys is poor.
The comparison with rail journeys should include some assessment of the environmental cost of the infrastructure used to provide the service, rather than just the marginal energy use of the single train journey.
The environmental cost of rail infrastructure is unclear, but considerable.
5 According to the Association of Train Operating Companies, the average CO2 emissions ie.
 marginal impact, as opposed to full impact for passenger rail in the UK were 49g per passenger kilometre in 2004.
Comparison with road The European Environment Agency estimates that the average specific CO2 emissions of the total EU15 passenger car fleet were 164g per kilometre in 2003.
Its estimate for average car occupancy is 1.6 passengers.
This equates to 102.5g of CO2 per passenger kilometre, or 7.1% more than easyJets average.
5 Rail and the Environment, 1994 http: www.
Annual report and accounts 2006 45 Cairo New York Delhi Miami Vancouver Los Angeles Bangkok Cape Town Singapore Honolulu Sydney Auckland plc Low cost with care convenience Corporate and social responsibility report continued The EUs key instrument for reducing emissions from passenger cars is the voluntary commitment agreed to by the European, Japanese and Korean car industries to reduce average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars: a target of 140g per kilometre for 2008 in the EU and 2009 in Japan and 6 Korea has been set.
The EUs aim is to reach, by 2010, an average CO2 emission figure of 120g per kilometre for all new passenger cars marketed 7 in the Union.
According to the Stern Review, transport accounts for 14% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, three-quarters of these emissions are from road 8 transport, while aviation accounts for around one-eighth and rail and shipping make up the remainder.
2 easyJet strives to be efficient on the ground A Short dwell time on ramp quick turns easyJets business model is designed to achieve high aircraft utilisation.
Key to this is minimising the turnaround time measured as the time between the aircraft arriving at the gate and pushing back for departure.
During a turnaround, the crew secure and prepare the aircraft for the next flight before boarding passengers and their baggage.
This process includes safety checks, cleaning the aircraft cabin and in most cases refuelling.
By operating to this standard, to service the same number of passengers through the day, easyJet requires fewer gates and other airport infrastructure than full-service airlines.
B Minimal use of ground equipment easyJets policy is to use the most efficient and simple ground equipment in order to facilitate our quick turnaround time.
As such, easyJet prefers, where possible, not to use air bridges.
easyJet also prefers not to use motorised steps.
As a no-frills airline, easyJet typically loads catering onto the aircraft only twice a day, which further reduces the amount of ground activity and related emissions involved in every flight.
easyJet cabin crew clean the cabin interior: a full-service airline will require a separate cleaning crew to be delivered to each turnaround.
C Simple airport infrastructure easyJet has simple airport infrastructure requirements.
As a short-haul point-to-point airline with one class of service and no cargo offering, easyJet has no need for segregated check-in areas or for complex baggage handling systems and facilities to transfer passengers between flights.
Wherever possible, easyJet works with airports to adapt and develop existing facilities efficiently to minimise airport capital expenditure, and reduce environmental impact.
easyJet is launching an online check-in product, which helps reduce the need for expensive airport infrastructure.
D easyJet keeps surface journeys to a minimum easyJet prefers to use local, convenient airports connected to good public transport links.
As part of our airport selection process, easyJet assesses the convenience of an airport with respect to surface transport options.
According to latest census data, 200 million people in Europe live within 60 minutes local journey of an easyJet airport.
easyJet analyses address data supplied by customers when they book, in order to draw conclusions about how far customers are travelling to their departure airport.
Where a particular destination appears to be drawing customers from a very wide field, easyJet will actively look to serve that destination from multiple departure airports.
Example: in easyJets 2006 summer schedule, half of the daily departures at easyJets three London airports Gatwick, Luton and Stansted were to destinations served from all three airports, allowing customers in South-East England to travel from their most convenient airport, reducing the emissions from ground transport.
Example: 5.4 million people live within 30 miles of Stansted Airport, according to the 2002 census.
On routes that easyJet serves from all three of its London airports, typically between 45% and 50% of outbound passengers have given easyJet an address within 30 miles of Stansted.
In contrast, on a route which is only served from one of easyJets London airports, the proportion of outbound passengers giving easyJet an address within this catchment can be as low as 15%.
E Minimal waste easyJets no frills service is designed to reduce waste in all areas.

46 Annual report and accounts 2006 Office waste easyJet is a ticketless airline and also has a policy of operating a near paperless office, where the majority of paper documents including all post are scanned into a document management system.
All paper is disposed of through our recycling programme.
This programme principally covers papers, including printer toner cartridges.
Paper sent for recycling represented 13% of all waste by weight generated by head office activities Onboard waste By not offering free food, easyJet eliminates meals that people do not want.
At the same time, the food that easyJet sells in-flight does not require preparation on board.
At present, the small volume of food waste contained within easyJets onboard waste generally means it cannot be accepted for recycling.
easyJet is initiating a programme to collect paper waste separately so that it can be sent for recycling at as many airports as possible.
If this is successful, other recyclable waste may also be segregated.
Chemicals easyJet monitors closely its use of fluids for aircraft fide-icing.
The majority of fide-icing fluid used by easyJet have been designed to meet stringent environmental requirements i. e. do not contain triazole and are considered to be non-hazardous and readily biodegradable.
The transfer and shipment of oils is maintained to a level as low as is practicable.
Solvents and oils used in aircraft maintenance are either recycled or treated through approved licensed operators.
3 easyJet leads the way in shaping a greener future A Shaping European policy on emissions trading easyJet has the chair of the European Low Fares Airlines Association ELFAA environment working group and in that capacity was invited to join the European Commissions Aviation Working Group set-up to review how international aviation could be included into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ETS.
easyJet supports the inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS, but not at any cost.
A legislative proposal is due to be published by the EU at the end of 2006. easyJet has been pressing for a scheme that will cover the largest carbon footprint i. e. include flights both within Europe and all departing and arriving flights, and reward airlines that are environmentally efficient and punish those that are not.
B Shaping European policy on making ATC more efficient The implementation of the EUs Single European Sky SES legislation is fundamental to improving the safety, reducing the cost and increasing the productivity of Europes highly fragmented and inefficient air traffic management ATM system.
easyJet is actively supporting the delivery of the SES initiatives, especially through its involvement in ELFAA and ELFAAs participation in the SESAR programme.
SESAR is the operational part of SES, which is proposing a new approach to reform the ATM structure in Europe.
C Actively engaging with aircraft manufacturers to influence next generation technology With new aerospace technologies emerging and their application primarily directed at the new generation of wide-body long-haul aircraft, easyJet is actively engaging with both airframe and engine manufacturers in a dialogue aimed at the application of these technologies to a new generation of short-haul aircraft.
However it is not currently anticipated that a new generation of short-haul aircraft will come to market before 2015. easyJet and its people As an employer, easyJets aim is to create an environment where people feel that easyJet is a great place to work: to nurture pride in the Company and peoples individual efforts: to deliver outstanding performance to our internal and external customers and to promote our low-cost model.
Our aspiration to be the best is underpinned by our five pillars of safety, customers, people, operational excellence and shareholder return together with our cultural values.
A Equality and diversity easyJet is a committed equal opportunities employer.
Our policy aims to ensure that no job applicant or employee receives less favourable treatment on the basis of their age, colour, creed, disability, fullor part-time status, gender, marital status, nationality or ethnic origin, race, religion or sexual orientation.
Annual report and accounts 2006 47 plc Low cost with care convenience Corporate and social responsibility report continued Pilot retirement age In order to ensure compliance with the new laws against age discrimination in October 2006, easyJet is raising the normal retirement age for all pilots to 65, the maximum age limit allowable under the regulatory regime in force.
Prior to this it was compulsory for pilots to retire at the age of 60.
Now all pilots have a choice as to whether they wish to keep flying until they are 65.
B Training and development easyJet is committed to providing high-quality training to support the safe operation of the business, and the cultural and personal development of our people.
During the year, the easyJet Academy opened a 30,000 square foot training facility, which will contribute towards achieving these objectives.
easyJet Academy The easyJet Academy has now completed its first successful year and has seen approximately 5,000 pilots, cabin crew and contact centre and management and administrative staff pass through its doors, along with an additional 3,500 people passing through our recruitment and assessment centres.
The facility is a state-of-the-art training centre, primarily for the flight crew, but with facilities for training telesales and customer service agents for our contact centre.
The 30,000 square foot building is home to easyJets flight crew recruitment and training teams, as well as its ID processing cell, which produces all employee IDs in-house.
The facility also houses a cabin simulator and aircraft slides that are used to train cabin crew and pilots.
Employee induction In addition to our already well-established and thorough induction training programme for crew, all new employees to easyJet management and administration functions can now look forward to a thorough induction process that will take three months to complete.
easyJet wants new people to the organisation to settle in as quickly and efficiently as possible, and has introduced a new process to ensure that this happens.
C Employee information and consultation The process of designing efficiency into easyJets core business extends to a flat management structure, where few organisational layers exist between the operational and customer-facing teams.
easyJet is committed to providing open information to its people, and to consulting over key issues.
A number of forums exist where issues of concern can be raised across the board.
easyJets business forum allows for high level consultations with both staff groups and recognised unions.
easyJet has a good relationship with its Management and Administration Consultative Group and recognised trade unions, Amicus, BALPA and the TGWU.
easyJet has lost no days to industrial action during the year.
easyJet has also developed a new Culture Network, which recognises the airlines European personality and the location of staff.
This Network gives everyone an opportunity to get involved in communicating issues and ideas to management.
The goals of the Network are to support the aspirations, vision and values of the Company and its employees.
easyJet has a number of means of keeping its people informed about both internal and external news.
The easyJet intranet is the official portal to a wide range of Company information, which is actively updated and expanding in subject coverage.
This is a proven, successful communications medium and events ranging from daily operational performance to long-term plans are posted here.
Using the intranet, access is provided to both common policies and procedures, such as in the People Handbook, or specific activities related to one of the business groups e. g. aircraft technical discussions.
Our people also publish their views on any topic via open discussion forums covering technical, employment, cost issues and more: in fact anything our people wish to debate.
A measurement of travel delivery achievement to our customers is a key performance indicator.
easyJet reports the end result of its efforts by publishing the preceding days on-time performance on the intranet front page each weekday morning.
A wide range of topical news from inside and outside the business, management announcements and general social activities, is also available.
To connect the management with any person in the business, Directors have instigated a monthly online chat forum, which draws a wide audience with lively discussion.
To supplement the general intranet information, a range of magazines and newsletters are published.
These include the business development focused Plane Times, in electronic form every three weeks, the quarterly Plane People, containing articles on a wide range of subjects and which is delivered to the home address of each of our people.
Individual business groups produce specialist publications such as The Stable Approach for pilots, Cabin Fever for cabin crew and Crew Safety for the operations team.
People opinion survey In May 2006 easyJet launched its new annual people opinion survey easyJet Pulse in order to fully understand its peoples issues and measure progress.
With a commitment from the Board to share the results of Pulse warts and all 67% of easyJet people responded to Pulse higher than average for a first survey, particularly in the airline industry with an overall satisfaction score of 68%.
Linked to an engagement index, Pulse not only measured satisfaction, but also levels of motivation, pride, commitment, engagement and advocacy.
A key positive headline for easyJet was the high degree in which easyJet people are advocates of the Company and the service it provides, while there is more work to be done in the areas of employee engagement communication.
Corporate and local level action plans have been drawn up throughout the business and targets have already been set to better the response and satisfaction rates in Pulse 2007.
48 Annual report and accounts 2006 New employee uniform One of the things our uniform-wearing staff were keen to let us know about was their opinion on our current uniform.
As a result of their feedback, Chief Executive Andrew Harrison initiated Project Uniform, the aim of which is to give easyJet employees the uniform they want at no extra cost.
All easyJet employees were invited to submit their designs for their dream uniform and the best three designs were put on the easyJet intranet for the people to choose their favourite two.
The final two designs have now been chosen and both are being put into production so the crew can make the decision about which one they want to wear.
easyJet expects crew to be in their new uniform early in 2007.
Flight Plan 2007 To improve two-way communication around easyJet and to galvanise our people behind our strategy for the next three years, our Directors have taken easyJets Flight Plan for 2007 out to the network and across the whole Company.
Through a series of roadshows delivered to crew and support functions, easyJet people have heard all about easyJets performance last year and the part everyone can play to reach our targets for next year and beyond.
D Staff rewards and recognition Share schemes easyJet once again offered all employees the opportunity to join its popular all employee share plans easyJet Shares 4 Me through our Save As You Earn SAYE and Buy As You Earn BAYE schemes.
Take-up of the schemes is very positive with 40% of eligible staff participating in one or both plans.
These are HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved schemes open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Under SAYE participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three-year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a price based on the market price of the shares at the time of the grant.
At the end of the savings period, a tax-free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
The Company made grants under the Sharesave scheme in June 2005 and June 2006, with options being granted at a discount of 20% to the market price at the time of the grant.
For those employees who are on non-UK payrolls, an international scheme has been established with similar terms and conditions to the UK scheme, albeit without the UK tax benefits.
BAYE is a share incentive plan and is open all year.
This scheme is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum, to purchase partnership shares in easyJet.
For every share purchased through the partnership scheme, easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain in employment with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of partnership shares in order to qualify for matching shares, and for five years for shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee retains rights over both their own shares and the matching shares, receives dividends and is able to vote at meetings once the shares are purchased.
For those employees who are not paid on the UK payroll, an international scheme has been established with similar terms and conditions to the UK scheme, albeit without the UK tax benefits.
Free shares To further encourage share ownership, easyJet has given all employees a one-off award of free easyJet shares, equivalent to two weeks pay.
This is also under the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan.
Employees who are not paid on the UK payroll are included in the international Share Incentive Plan.
easyJet Shares 4 Me has been the recipient of three major industry awards this year: Best New Share Plan at the ifsProShare Annual Awards 2005.
Most Effective All-Employee Share Plan Strategy Award from Employee Benefits magazine.
Most Innovative Employee Share Plan at the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators Company Secretary Awards 2006.
Staff Travel In April 2006, easyJet introduced an improved staff travel incentive for all employees.
Without adding any further cost to the business, a team of people from within easyJet implemented a number of enhancements to the system already in place, which meant that staff could be on more of our seats that would have departed empty.
Part of the development programme was to widen the number of people who could use the easyJet staff travel facility.
Each employee now has three named others on their staff travel account, plus dependants up to the age of 21.
The result saw a year-on-year increase in use of staff travel by almost 100%.
Go the Extra Mile Awards One of the key differentiators between easyJet and other low-cost carriers is our people.
Regardless of where in the Company our people are working, they work hard and give their all.
For this reason, easyJet introduced a new employee incentive scheme called the GEM Go the Extra Mile awards.
The awards are designed to recognise employees who go beyond what can rightly be expected of them in the role they are in.
There are five different types of GEMs which recognise different areas of an employees contribution and these are matched by an exciting range of rewards.
This year, 253 people have been recognised with GEMs, and five have been awarded the ultimate accolade of a diamond GEM.
Annual report and accounts 2006 49 plc Low cost with care convenience Corporate and social responsibility report continued E Health and safety Safety is the number one priority for the business.
easyJet aims to provide a safe and efficient work environment for all its people.
Beyond those engaged in office-based work, the large majority of people are aircrew.
They have been one of the mainstays to easyJets success, giving a great deal of effort to their role.
easyJet is continuing to invest substantial effort and money into rostering practices and systems.
easyJet is committed to the development of an industry leading Fatigue Risk Management System FRMS for its pilots, as an integral part of the airlines safety management processes.
The aim of the programme is to detect any sources of fatigue risk within the airline operation and act upon them.
F Charitable donations Our charity policy is to recognise and devote efforts to a single charity each year.
This year the charity, chosen for the first time by a staff vote, was The Anthony Nolan Trust.
easyJet has worked with The Anthony Nolan Trust to help promote the Trust, with activities including onboard collections, a click and give campaign from our website, staff fundraising, being featured in the in-flight magazine and other public relations activities.
Close to 560,000 was raised to 30 September 2006 and the Anthony Nolan Trust received coverage in European press, UK regional press and national television.
easyJet also donated 50,000 to the Anthony Nolan Trust.
Money raised from onboard collections was also donated to other bone marrow registers in Europe: close to 15,000 to the German register, DKMS and over 5,000 to the Italian register IBMDR.
G Ethical easyJet is committed to the highest standards of corporate behaviour from its Directors and employees.
easyJet requires all of its people to perform their duties with efficiency and diligence and to always behave to customers and other people alike with courtesy and decorum.
easyJets procurement process has strong controls to ensure that any dealings are open and transparent, and avoids any suspicion of conflicts of interest.
In particular, easyJet has specific clauses in each employees contract of employment, which set tight rules in respect of accepting gifts or gratuities.
Gifts and gratuities Some easyJet employees are sent gifts from various companies throughout the year.
The airline has a strict policy that prevents any employee accepting gifts over a nominal value.
Every Christmas and less frequently, at various times through the year easyJet holds a staff raffle of all the gifts that are received.
Every employee across Europe is entered into the draw and allocated a unique reference number.
Numbers are then drawn at random and winners have the gifts sent directly to their home in time for Christmas.
