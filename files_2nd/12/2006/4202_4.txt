Secretary 20 February 2007 During the year the Committee has undertaken a review of total remuneration for Croda executive directors and senior executives following the acquisition of the Uniqema business, with its consequent reorganisation of executive responsibilities and increase in the size of the Groups operations.
NBSC was commissioned by the Committee to carry out a benchmarking exercise in respect of base salaries, benefits, annual bonuses and long term incentives.
As a result, adjustments were made to basic salaries to bring them within or towards the median range of the benchmark data.
Components of executive directors remuneration Basic salary The Committee considers that it is difficult to identify companies who are true comparators with the Companys operations.
The basic salaries of the executive directors are, therefore, set by reference to those paid by companies comprising FTSE 250 manufacturing companies similar in size and scope of operations to those of Croda and a group of companies with comparable market capitalisations and international scope to those of Croda.
The salaries are paid monthly in cash and are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January.
