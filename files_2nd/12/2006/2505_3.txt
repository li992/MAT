We believe that all low carbon options, including nuclear, will be needed.
Benefits of nuclear A special report of the World Energy Council, published in July 2004, confirmed that, when assessed on a life-cycle basis, the Co emissions associated with nuclear generation are 2 similar to those from renewable sources and are insignificant when compared with operational emissions from coal and gas generation.
