Sustainability Marshalls continues to support the work being carried out by The British Precast Concrete Federation Sustainability Committee.
During 2005 the Group published its own Sustainability Document.
It is developing a Sustainability Policy based upon its IMS systems which provides a basis for decision making.
Economic activity is considered, reinforced by the targets and objectives in the ISO 9000 accreditation.
Environmental activities are considered by the targets and objectives in ISO 14001 and in addition Maltby Biodiversity Project social activities are supported by the OHSAS Health and Safety accreditation.
