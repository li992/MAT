Health, Safety & Environment Report The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of health and safety and understands that the health and safety of employees and others who may be affected by the Groups operations is of primary importance in the conduct of its business.
The Groups policy is embodied in the Health and Safety Policy Document and the Chief Executive is the Board member responsible for health and safety matters including keeping the Board fully informed on current issues.
The Group recognises that complying with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and regulations made under it is a legal requirement, not a matter of choice, and our policy is to exceed the minimum requirements of the law wherever possible.
Sufficient resources are allocated to meet this commitment and management procedures are designed to promote health and safety as a business issue.
Systems are also in place which allow us to assess, maintain, monitor and improve safety performance.
Looking forward, we will continue to refine our approach to site safety and develop ideas into Best Practice so as to minimise the number of accidents and working days lost through injury or ill health.
As a distributor, our activities generally have a lower impact on the environment than might result from manufacturing processes or extractive industries.
Nonetheless the Group recognises the importance of responsible environmental management and its obligation to protect the environment.
Consequently, priority is afforded to all environmental matters and concerns and the Group is committed to complying with applicable environmental regulations in the key areas of energy consumption, waste management, air quality and noise emissions.
The nature of the Groups activities is such that there is no contamination of land or water and environmental disturbance is limited to the movement of vehicles.
The majority of the products handled are non-hazardous.
