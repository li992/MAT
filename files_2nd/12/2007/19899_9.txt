The Group recognises the link between good environmental practices and good business.
For us, Sustainable Development is a concern for the well-being of the environment: the communities in which we invest: a concern about our customers views: the health and welfare of our employees: the ethical treatment of our suppliers: and the considered development of new products and services.
