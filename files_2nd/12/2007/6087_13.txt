In a year when Group turnover increased, and thereby the underlying levels of activity increased, four out of FKIs five safety and environmental indicators showed improvement.
Environmental improvements All Group businesses have adopted the corporate environmental policy.
One example of how businesses This year, 18% of FKI businesses, accounting for 24% of are applying policy in practice is the implementation of Group turnover, have introduced environmentally friendly lean operations.
Most FKI businesses are implementing initiatives, in many cases with the focus directed towards or are planning to implement Lean in order to streamline the customer.
These initiatives include: processes and improve efficiency through elimination of Introduction of solvent recovery plant waste and non-value adding activities Environmental performance Installation of a facility-wide computerised heating control system Assessment of environmental risks occurs during Supply of diesel engines with low noise, low emissions day-to-day business operations as part of FKIs risk and lower fuel consumption in refurbished locomotives management process.

One FKI company based in Denmark reported that 50% of its supplied electricity is sourced from renewable energy: 20% from wind turbines, 30% from biomass.
Another UK-based business is currently undertaking a study into the possible use of wind turbines.

This allows a year-on-year direct comparison, where the term carbon dioxide emissions represents the best estimate of overall energy consumption.
The bar-chart opposite shows a continuing reduction in absolute CO2 emissions.
Total CO2 emissions for this year have reduced by 3.5% compared to last year, exceeding the Groups target of 1% reduction.
This years emissions are also 22% less than those recorded in 2001.
2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 The line graph represents relative CO2 emissions adjusted for business activity levels by dividing by Group turnover Water consumption in 000s.
The resultant figures indicate that business unit m3 m3 000 turnover actions reduced CO2 emissions by 7% compared to the 2,945,000 2,431,005 2,152,499 2,121,480 1,999,656 2,084,930 2,057,405 prior year.

Water consumption The bar chart below shows that the Groups absolute water consumption has decreased this year by 1.3%.
In relative terms, water consumption m3 000 turnover decreased this year by over 4%.
The changing nature of FKIs business portfolio means that absolute values are 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 not directly comparable year-on-year.
Relating water consumption to the Groups turnover allows for a much more accurate picture and gives a better indication of the environmental performance.
The Groups level of fresh water consumption is considered by FKI to have a great impact on the environment.
Businesses globally are therefore constantly evaluating ways to recycle, or reduce fresh water consumption.
29 FKI plc Corporate social responsibility report Liquid waste disposal Waste disposal and recycling 000 disposal cost 000 turnover FKI businesses are required to report on both liquid and 1,097 994 792 627 789 489 551 solid waste within the CSR review process.
The disposal 0.63 0.61 0.55 0.47 0.57 0.34 0.37 costs are reported within the CSR report along with the disposal cost per 000 turnover to allow a year-on-year comparative figure.
These figures are presented below.
Each unit which produces solid or liquid waste is responsible for disposing of that waste through cost effective and environmentally acceptable methods.
No environmental permits were revoked in 2006 07.
Liquid waste disposal FKI produces waste liquid mainly from water used 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 for cooling purposes, surface treatments, washing down products during the production process and sanitary purposes.
Some businesses which produce relatively large quantities of waste water and liquid as a result of manufacturing processes have water treatment plants that are monitored regularly by local water authorities.
Where water meets strict standards, discharge into rivers is permitted.
Permitted discharge into sewers is also regulated and occurs only with approval.
Liquid waste may also be removed by registered disposal companies.
Where petroleum, bulk hazardous chemicals or acid wastes are required to be stored on site, appropriate permits are held by the relevant businesses.
Where businesses cannot treat liquid waste they have permits in place for the removal and treatment of the waste off site.
Consistent and suitable monitoring and reporting of liquid waste processing procedure are in place in all businesses.
The graph above shows an increase in liquid waste disposal costs in 2006 07 compared to the previous year.
This is due to increased turnover and underlying levels of activity for 2006 07 in those businesses that produce high levels of liquid waste.
Improvements in environmental reporting are believed to be the foundation of controlling waste levels and associated costs.
30 FKI plc Corporate social responsibility report 25% reduction in solid waste disposal costs: aided by better recycling Solid waste disposal Solid waste disposal 000 disposal cost 000 turnover The Groups expenditure on processing solid waste 732 668 645 459 571 480 360 reduced this year by 25% on last years costs.
It is the aim of FKI to continue to reduce solid waste levels and hence disposal costs across the Group.
FKI businesses make use of opportunities to recycle solid waste produced during operations.
Over 68% of businesses, producing 88% of Group turnover, recycle part or all of the solid waste they produce, the overall income from which is substantially higher than the disposal costs of the remaining solid waste and liquid waste together.
2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Recycling therefore not only offers a solution to reduce net waste output levels but is also commercially beneficial if fully embraced.
Summary The Group remains committed to driving continuous improvement in all areas of CSR performance.
In a diversified Company such as FKI, a balance must be maintained between application of policy by the corporate centre and delegation of responsibility to the local businesses.
The growth of Group wide communications continues to have a positive influence on CSR performance in all businesses.
This is displayed through more ambitious target setting, external benchmarking, company reporting and performance.
As businesses share examples of best practice and communicate their local strategies, experiences and performance levels, further improvements are targeted.
