different flights are not the same: the season, time of day, geographic location, altitude and duration of a flight will all influence the non-CO effects of the flight.
2 The IPCCs 1999 report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere acknowledged some of the issues with applying the metric of radiative forcing to aviation: Because carbon dioxide has a long atmospheric residence time 100 years and so becomes well mixed throughout the atmosphere, the effects of its emissions from aircraft are indistinguishable from the easyJet and the environment same quantity of carbon dioxide emitted by any other In aggregate with other man-made greenhouse gas source.

easyJets goal is to ensure that its existing and remain concentrated near flight routes, mainly in business is as efficient as possible, both in the air and on the northern mid-latitudes.
These emissions can lead to the ground: to find ways to minimise its environmental radiative forcing that is regionally located near the flight impact both now and in the future: and to lead the way routes for some components e. g. ozone and contrails in shaping a greener future for aviation.

Furthermore, easyJets European and Mediterranean cities.

All aspects of easyJets business model are designed around safety and efficiency.
