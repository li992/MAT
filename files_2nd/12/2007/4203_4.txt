In respect of termination, the Committees policy is to deal with each case on its merits, in accordance with the law and any further policy adopted by the Committee at the time.
In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant directors then current salary and contractual benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of the Company.
The principal contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of a car, pension and medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
