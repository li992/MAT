Winning a contract on the scale of Terminal 1 set off a sequence of events: intensive local recruitment, opening an ASIG school in a disused passenger lounge and getting the new employees 100% up to speed with values, culture and health and safety practices.
Handing the responsibility for health and safety training to a man of Dennis Duncans experience and calibre is vital if ASIG is to maintain and enhance its reputation among the worlds airport authorities and airlines.
Increasingly, airports would rather see ASIGs trucks and personnel on their tarmac than any other service provider.
Luis Anchondo is a similarly reassuring figure: 25 years ago I started out working on the ramps in Minneapolis.
I worked my way up to manage a department.
Ten years later, I got into training and I still have the passion for showing people the right way to do things.
Aviation may be global but its a very close-knit family.
Most of the managers are deeply rooted in the business.
A $26 million investment in a brand new fleet of service trucks was essential to ASIG meeting the demands of the Terminal 1 contract.
