AMEC works closely with FES to design and create the most appropriate wind farm at each location.
The work is diverse and demanding: it requires AMEC to have a clear understanding of all the relevant engineering, environmental and forestry issues.
AMEC has been working with Forestry Commission Scotland on renewable energy proposals since 2000.
We have enjoyed working closely with AMECs people on exciting and challenging sites such as Aultmore in Moray.
Weve often worked quite visibly as AMECs partners, which has helped to build credibility with local communities.
