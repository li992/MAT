We were clear when we developed our plan to return M&S to growth that improving service should be one of our three top priorities, alongside improving products and modernising stores.
While theres more we need to do here, I believe we have made progress.
This has been driven in large part by our service training programme, which involved over 60,000 store staff and was completed in June 2006.
This Our Service Style training is now incorporated into all store induction programmes with our 8,000 specially trained coaches taking on the responsibility for continuous service training.
Mystery shopping We wanted to make sure this training was translating into improvements in-store.
In May, we introduced a mystery shopping programme to measure the quality of our customer service.
Stores are visited by mystery shoppers once a month, with our biggest stores checked twice a month, in total around 6,500 visits a year.
Each is scored on a range of measures chosen by customers, from product knowledge to tidiness and respect.
Our overall scores showed steady improvement during the year, rising from 70% in May 2006 to a progressive average of 79% for 2006 07.
This is a good result not least because we recruited 19,000 extra staff at Christmas and faced a big challenge in bringing them up to speed at a very busy time.
However, some stores are still not performing as they should and we have work to do to make sure improvements continue.
Mystery shopping In addition, the senior management team, myself included, visit stores frequently.
