Environmental & Social Review A Measure of Our Progress We place a high emphasis on our environmental and social performance as it is an important element in achieving our business strategy, as is communicating with stakeholders on our progress in these areas.
The HSE & Social Review 2000 was our first stand-alone environmental report and we have now produced our third.
The Environmental & Social Review 2002 summarises our activities, describes how we manage any associated environmental and social impacts, reports on progress made in meeting our objectives in these areas and presents statistical data on our performance in India and Bangladesh during 2002.
In addition to the Groups financial and operational successes during the year, there has been a significant improvement in our environmental and social performance during 2002.
