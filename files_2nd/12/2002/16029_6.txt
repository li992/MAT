TRA V IS PERKINS PLC Environmental report For the year ended 31 December 2002 The group recognises its corporate responsibility to carry out its operations whilst minimising environmental impacts.
We have maintained accreditation of our Environmental Management System to the ISO 14001 standard during 2002.
A revised environmental policy was published in June 2002 and the full version is available on the corporate website at www.
We intend to meet the above policys objectives by implementing nine key commitments - we report below progress against each of these: 1.
TO IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE A FORMAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The system has been in operation since August 2001 and has been certified to ISO 14001 since November 2001.
TO ASSIGN ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE GROUP The detailed policy statement describes the structure of environmental responsibility, which mirrors our operational structure.
TO SET AND MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS IN ORDER TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS We are now monitoring and have set improvement targets to be achieved principally by 2004 relating to the issues identified as being significant aspects by the ISO 14001 system, details of which are given below.
TO INTEGRATE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS INTO BUSINESS DECISION MAKING AT ALL LEVELS We have maintained our internal audit programme, risk management audits and our focus on environmental issues at all formal review meetings.
TO CONSULT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES We have engaged in dialogue through specific tailored meetings with several key shareholders, seeking their guidance on the issues we should be addressing.
We continue to engage in open communication with neighbours, regulatory authorities and non-governmental organisations as particular issues arise.
TO DEVELOP PROCUREMENT POLICIES CONSISTENT WITH ISO 14001 We have continued to challenge our suppliers to improve their performance on environmental issues, in particular by asking them to complete the management engagement section of the Business in the Environment questionnaire.
TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RELATING TO PRODUCTS THAT WE DISTRIBUTE We have set an internal target to increase the proportion of timber and forest products that are certified and have challenged suppliers to improve their performance in this area.
A number of suppliers have now committed to improving the percentage of their supplies to us that are from certified sources.
We have commenced a project to achieve chain of custody relating to FSC Forest Stewardship Council and PEFC Pan European Forest Certification certified products.
TO PROVIDE TRAINING A general environmental awareness video continues to be provided to all new employees.
Updated guidance material has been prepared and provided to all branch managers during the year, and a presentation on best practice is now available on the corporate intranet.
TO FORMALLY REVIEW THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AT REGULAR INTERVALS The Policy continues to be reviewed annually as part of the corporate governance report on environmental issues provided to the PLC Board.
Environmental improvement plan We have continued with the implementation of our Environmental Improvement Plan during 2002 and report below our progress to date.
The data covers all operations except for City Plumbing Supplies and Commercial Ceiling Factors these will be included from the beginning of 2003.
Whilst the data is prepared from a combination of specific measurements and some estimates we are continually refining the accuracy of the data - we believe that the information presents a fair representation of our environmental performance improvement.
Carbon dioxide co emissions 2 Our CO emission data includes that arising from fuel use in commercial 2 CO emissions 2 T m Tonnes per million of sales - inflation adjusted 60 vehicles and forklift trucks, consumption of fuel oil for heating, and gas and 49 T m electricity consumption.
The figures currently exclude CO generated from 50 2 8 % 10 % car drivers business miles, though we will have systems to aggregate this 40 data by the end of 2003.
We estimate our total CO emissions on this basis 2 30 to have been approximately 62,500 tonnes equivalent to 49 tonnes per 1 20 million of sales in 2001.
In October 2002 we transferred the electricity 10 supply for our largest 17 consumption sites including our head office 0 2001 2002 2004 Target buildings and over 200 further branches to carbon neutral sources.
On this basis we estimate that just over 50 per cent of our total electricity demand is satisfied from these carbon free sources - this has been the main reason for the reduction in CO emissions 2 shown in the adjacent chart.
In 2002 we estimate that our total CO emissions also fell in absolute terms to 2 approximately 59,300 tonnes.
With a full year of use of these sources we are confident that we will see a further significant fall in CO emissions during 2003.
2 19 TRA V IS PERKINS PLC Volatile organic compound voc emissions We have achieved a major reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds through a programme of replacing organic solvent-based treatment fluids with aqueous based solutions.
From a base of an estimated 234 tonnes of emissions in 2001, we have reduced this in absolute terms to T VOC emissions Tonnes 300 approximately 120 tonnes in 2002.
Six of nineteen plants remain with 250 234 T organic solvent-based treatment and several plants will be converted to aqueous during 2003.
In addition we have converted all six of the copper 200 chromated arsenate based treatment plants to solutions that avoid the use 150 49 % of chromium and arsenic based compounds.
We have already met our 25 100 67 % per cent reduction target set at the beginning of 2001, but will continue to 50 convert as many additional plants as possible however, there are some 0 2001 2002 2004 Target applications for which aqueous treatment may not be suitable.
Our revised target for 2004 has been set at a reduction of 67 per cent.
Timber certification As shown in the chart, approximately 41 per cent of the raw material Timber and timber product certification Content of certified material as a % of total purchases 80% content of our purchases of timber and timber based products were from 66% certified sources at the end of 2001.
We made good progress in 2002 and 60% this figure has moved up to 45 per cent at the end the year.
We have 45% 41% completed a review programme with all major suppliers and have a wide 40% range of commitments from them to improve the percentage of timber 20% supplied to us that is from certified sources.
We continue to challenge all suppliers who are not currently providing certified material to work towards 0% 2001 2002 2006 Target certification and as a minimum we ask all suppliers to certify that timber supplied has been handled in accordance with all relevant legislation.
Waste sent to landfill We have placed our main emphasis on the avoidance of waste, as well as T m Waste sent to landfill Tonnes per million of yard sales - inflation adjusted 40 the segregation of waste streams to reduce the cost of waste and enhance recycling opportunities.
We now sell damaged blocks, bricks and pavers as 33T m 30 9 % 15 % hardcore from many branches rather than disposing of them as waste.
Cardboard segregation is improving at our branches, though in some areas 20 of the country recycling opportunities are limited and the waste cardboard 10 still goes to landfill.
Major timber machining centres continue to seek recycling opportunities, and large volumes of chippings and sawdust are 0 2001 2002 2004 Target collected and recycled.
During the year we have set up a number of pallet 20 TRA V IS PERKINS PLC collection arrangements with pallet recyclers across the country.
In total we estimate our waste sent to landfill in 2001 at 33,400 tonnes.
We have reduced this in absolute terms to approximately 31,000 tonnes in 2002.
Fuel consumption and vehicle emissions More than 250 commercial vehicles amongst our fleet of over 1,600 are now Particulate emissions filters Percentage of commercial fleet fitted 40% fitted with particulate emissions filters, with a further tranche planned to be fitted during 2003.
These filters reduce particulate emissions by more than 30% 25% 98 per cent and hence we estimate that our particulate emissions arising from the vehicle fleet have been reduced by over 15 per cent since the 20% 16% programme commenced.
Our efforts to reduce overall fuel consumption 8% 10% continue and we have to this end recently upgraded our fuel consumption monitoring systems.
In addition we are encouraging enhanced efficiency 0% 2001 2002 2004 Target through a system of allowing orders to be delivered from the branch closest to the delivery address.
Our fuel consumption during 2001 for commercial vehicles was 13.3 million litres.
We have set a reduction target of 10 per cent in litres per pound of inflation adjusted delivered sales by the end of 2004.
Consumption on this measure in 2002 was at the same level as 2001, but we are confident that enhanced efficiency monitoring will lead to savings in future.
Other Further data covering packaging, water, electricity and gas is available on our website at www.
Complaints and notifiable events The total number of complaints received in respect of environmental matters is fairly limited with sixteen instances recorded during 2002: most related to local noise issues.
This is a slightly lower figure than that for 2001.
We investigate each complaint and endeavour to rectify these situations promptly.
Our target is to have no complaints.
Our emergency procedures are written to ensure that even relatively minor events are reported to the Environment Agency and as a result we contacted them on seven occasions during 2002 the same level as in 2001 all relating to minor events.
Our target is to have zero notifiable events.
Prosecutions We are pleased to report that we had no prosecutions for environmental matters during 2002.
Further information We welcome comments on this report and our policy statement.
