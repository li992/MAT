easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Social, environmental and ethical report Safety Health and safety is of paramount importance to easyJet.
Safety forms a central pillar of the easyJet culture.
For example, safety is the first agenda item at Board and Executive Committee meetings.
The airline has a comprehensive system of processes to proactively monitor and manage safety and risk issues.
These processes are continually monitored, evaluated and revised to respond to changing circumstances.
easyJet undertakes to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment as required by law.
The easyJet Operations Manuals contain detailed health and safety information with which employees must comply.
The Chief Executive has ultimate responsibility for the implementation, achievement and monitoring of safety policy and is responsible for ensuring the promotion of safety awareness throughout easyJet: the auditing of accidents: the devising of fire protection and other safety measures: and the publishing of safety rules and regulations pertinent to the work duties of employees.

Everyone has a duty to ensure that duties are discharged in accordance with our procedures and rules which are devised specifically to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all employees, our customers and the public.
Environment The nature of the easyJet business model reduces the impact of the airlines activities on the environment.
easyJets stated aim is to operate a fleet of young aircraft.
These have lower noise emissions and use less fuel than earlier models.
easyJet is implementing a fleet replacement plan that will result in a fleet entirely composed of Boeing 737 New Generation and Airbus A320 family aircraft, which will have all been purchased from new by easyJet.
Compared to most full-fare airlines, easyJet has high passenger load factors.
This, coupled with a young modern fleet, means that noise emissions and fuel burn per passenger is significantly better than many airlines.
Also, easyJet actively manages and investigates incidences of fuel spillages related to our flights.
easyJet aids the reduction of demand for private car transport to and from the main airports from which it operates.
easyJet provides support for the regular bus link between London Luton Airport and Luton Airport Parkway railway station, and has commercial arrangements with the Stansted and Gatwick express rail services.
easyJet offers its customers incentives in the form of cost subsidies to use public transport to travel to both Luton and Stansted.
Waste production is reduced through the design of our business model.
Unlike most of our full-service competitors, we do not have printed tickets, and we do not offer free newspapers or meals on board.
easyJet believes that this results in lower usage of packaging and paper and therefore less waste.
We operate an almost paperless administration office, with almost all filing, copying and faxing based upon the use of electronic images.
Although some waste paper is produced, procedures are in place for collecting it for recycling.
Social easyJet seeks to provide a unique and rewarding work environment for employees.
The organisation has relatively flat management structure and it does not have the trappings of hierarchy that many businesses have.

Individual employees are able to search and retrieve information electronically.
There is a dedicated director responsible for people development and cultural issues, in addition to a human resources director.
This ensures that people issues are given a high profile and are considered at the highest levels within the airline.
