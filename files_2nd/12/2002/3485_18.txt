Report of the board on remuneration Mr M J Pilsworth As previously reported, Mr Pilsworth was granted shadow share options over a notional 250,000 Chrysalis Ordinary resigned 2nd May 2002 Shares of 2p each granted at the mid-market price on 3rd December 1997 114.3 pence.
The bonus terms mirrored the rules of the Chrysalis 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme.
To partially mitigate the potential liability to the Group, the ESOP purchased a similar amount of the Groups shares at 235 pence per share.
These shares were sold and the proceeds were used to partially fund the payment made to Mr Pilsworth as detailed in the table on page 72.
Mr Pilsworth also had a bonus arrangement to incentivise him towards the long term capital growth of the TV Group whereby he would receive a percentage of the excess value over and above the amount the Group has invested in the division in the event that the Group should realise its investment prior to 3rd May 2003.
The amount of this bonus is capped at an amount not exceeding 500,000.
The potential to receive this bonus in those circumstances remains outstanding as set out on page 76 of this report.
Mr P S Riley As fully reported in previous years, Mr Riley is entitled to receive 0.145% of the value of the Groups Radio Division as at 31st August 2002 adjusted for the amount of any investment in the Division since 1st September 1999, together with a bonus equivalent to 0.75% of the excess value of the Chrysalis Radio division as at 31st August 2002 over and above an agreed base valuation to be adjusted for any additional funding and a return on the opening value.
The Remuneration Committee agreed during the year that Mr Rileys LTIP should be rolled on and payable at Mr Rileys option after the announcement of either the Groups interim or final results but in any event no later than 31st August 2009 and should be based on the value and the excess value of the Chrysalis Radio division at that time.
Any bonus payable had been capped at 1.5 million and the Committee agreed during the year under review to alter this by placing a cap on the value of the Chrysalis Radio division of 300 million at 31st August 2002, rising to 400 million at 31st August 2004.

The Committee agrees with the recommendation contained in the Code that there is a strong case for setting notice or contract periods at, or reducing them to, 12 months or less.
The Committee has had and will continue to have regard to these recommendations but is conscious of the need to secure the services of key executives for the benefit of the Company and the shareholders which may, on occasions, necessitate contracts for longer periods.
However, the Committee have agreed, with the exception of Mr C N Wright, that wherever a service agreement is entered into for a term longer than 12 months, it will contain a clause whereby it can be terminated by the Company for any reason upon a payment not exceeding 12 months salary, bonuses and benefits subject to mitigation by the Executive.
The Committee believes that, in view of Mr C N Wrights unique position, it was appropriate to agree a contract for a fixed three year period.
However, this agreement now continues to run on the basis of 12 months notice on either side and it is not intended to extend this notice period.
All of the other executive Directors service agreements can also be terminated by either party by giving 12 months notice.
Compensation for early termination The arrangements for termination of the senior executives contracts are decided by the Committee following consultation with the Executive Chairman and Group Chief Executive.
As stated above, in the majority of cases, service agreements may be terminated by the Company for any reason upon a payment not exceeding 12 months salary, benefits and bonuses subject to mitigation by the Executive.
Mr M J Pilsworths service agreement, which was subject to 12 months notice, was terminated on 2nd May 2002 by reason of his resignation.
Mr Pilsworth was paid 128,606 upon termination and it was further agreed that Mr Pilsworth would receive further payments of up to 21,384 per month, paid monthly in arrears, for the period from 3rd November 2002 to 2nd May 2003 in respect of any part of that period for which Mr Pilsworth has not obtained alternative employment.
Mr Pilsworth was also paid his long term incentive bonus, details of which are disclosed in the table on page 72 of the report.
Mr Pilsworth was also granted 12 months to exercise his award over his 17,019 restricted shares which he did on 16th July 2002 when the mid market price of the Chrysalis shares was 165 pence.
It was also agreed that Mr Pilsworth would remain entitled to his long term incentive plan whereby he would receive a percentage of the excess value over and above the amount the Group has invested in Chrysalis TV Group in the event that the Group realises this investment prior to 3rd May 2003.
