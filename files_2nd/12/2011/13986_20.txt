We also report back on the progress we have made at our Head Office in Maidenhead relative to the baseline measured in 2010.
We have established an overall target to progressively reduce our tCO2e FTE emissions by over 5% per annum over three years for these four offices in the 2011 scope.
Conservation of the environment is an integral part of our corporate social responsibility network.
Effective carbon management plans optimise resource usage, generate commercial return and enhance the SDL brand.
