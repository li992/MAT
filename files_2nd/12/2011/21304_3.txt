com annualreport Citizenship At Barclays, we have a clear sense of our business purpose: to help individuals, businesses and economies progress and grow.
For us, the term Citizenship captures this purpose and directs how we use our resources and expertise to create long term value for all our stakeholders.
Citizenship is one of Barclays four execution priorities and is integral to our business.
In the first instance, Citizenship is about contributing to growth in the real economy, creating jobs and supporting sustainable growth.
Second, it is about the way we do business: putting our customers interests at the heart of what we do, and managing our impact responsibly.
Third, it is about supporting our communities through investment programmes and the direct efforts of our employees.
Our approach Throughout the year, we engaged with a diverse set of stakeholders to understand the challenges they face and how we can best help.
Stakeholders play a pivotal role in helping us determine how we prioritise the issues we need to address.
This involves listening to our customers and clients, our shareholders and employees, while working in collaboration with charities and governments.
We made rm progress in 2011 but still have a long way to go.
Thats why in 2012 we will launch a Citizenship Plan outlining our longer term commitments to 2015.
These objectives will be aligned to rigorous Banks need to become better citizens.

com annualreport Key performance indicators Key Performance Indicators KPIs are used to measure our success against each of the four execution priorities.
We have made solid progress in 2011 through improving the competitive position across all of our businesses but we recognise there is still work to do to achieve our medium term targets.
Core Tier 1 ratio Capital We have further improved our Core Tier 1 ratio to 11.0% through 11.0% 10.8% 10.0% generating capital organically and reducing risk weighted assets.
We therefore do not expect to seek additional capital from our shareholders to meet future regulatory requirements.
Our diverse funding sources and strong liquidity pool of 152bn has minimised the cost of funding and provided protection against unexpected market uctuations, despite the Eurozone crisis and subsequent market stress.
2009 2010 2011 Return on equity Returns The Group continues to evolve and the strength of our universal banking 7.2% 6.7% model helped to achieve balanced profits across our retail and business 5.8% banking and corporate and investment banking businesses but we recognise that our Return on Equity was below our stated goal of 13% for 2013.
Although the worse than predicted macroeconomic conditions as well as new regulatory constraints mean that we may not be able to deliver 13% returns by 2013, we will continue to focus on delivering a steady improvement in returns and achieve 13% over time.
2009 2010 2011 Total income Income growth Total income has increased 3% and benefited from gains on own credit 32,292m 31,440m and debt buy-backs.
Excluding these items, total income declined 8% 29,123m impacted by the macro environment.
However, we have improved the competitive positions of all our major businesses and all businesses have grown adjusted net operating income, with the exception of Barclays Capital, which was most affected by difficult trading conditions.
As we deliver income growth, we remain focused on improving the quality of assets to ensure that we do not grow at the expense of future impairment.
2009 2010 2011 Gross new lending to UK Citizenship households and businesses We have a clear sense of our business purpose to help individuals, 45.0bn 43.5bn businesses and economies progress and grow.
We clearly demonstrated this by delivering 45.0bn gross new lending to UK households and 35.0bn businesses.
We exceeded Project Merlin targets in providing 43.6bn to UK businesses, including 14.7bn to SMEs.
We also supported 10,000 first time buyers in the UK.

Our capital, funding and liquidity positions remained strong throughout 2011 and we are well protected against further economic stress.
For 2011 we reported a slight decrease in profits, as a reduction in income at Corporate and Investment Banking was partly offset by income improvements in all other businesses, a significant improvement in credit impairment and cost reductions.
Prudent capital management led to a further increase in our Core Tier 1 ratio.
Our funding and liquidity remains strong.
Income Statement Barclays delivered adjusted profit before tax of 5.6bn in 2011 which was well balanced across the Group.
Statutory profits were broadly similar at 5.9bn.
The adjusted basis helps to provide a more consistent basis for comparing business performance between periods and principally excludes gains on own credit and debt buy-backs of 3.8bn, impairment on our stake in BlackRock, Inc. of 1.8bn, a 1bn provision for PPI, and almost 600m of goodwill write offs, mainly in Spain.

Excluding these one-off items, income declined 8% to 28,512m, principally reecting a decrease in income at Barclays Capital.

Excluding the UK bank levy of 325m introduced in 2011, operating expenses were down 4% to 18,855m, which included 408m 2010: 330m of restructuring charges taken now in order to deliver future benets.
Despite cost savings, the adjusted cost: income ratio increased to 67% 2010: 64%, reecting lower income, increased restructuring charges and the UK bank levy.

Conclusion The Group continued to generate Core Tier 1 capital from retained profits To summarise, we delivered resilient adjusted profits of 5.6bn, with excluding own credit, impairment of investment in BlackRock, Inc. and adjusted net operating income growth in every business except Barclays goodwill impairment, which are added back for regulatory capital Capital.
We delivered a 33% improvement in credit impairment, managed purposes.

Our Core Tier 1 ratio increased to 11%, and our funding foreign currency movements, resulting in an increase in Core Tier 1 capital and liquidity strength continues to give us a competitive advantage.
Risk weighted assets decreased slightly to 391bn 2010: 398bn largely reecting foreign exchange movements and decreases in Barclays Capital from lower levels of activity, risk reduction and sales of credit market exposures, which more than outweighed the approximate 30bn increase resulting from the implementation of CRD3 in December.
