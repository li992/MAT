We also engage with our tenants to improve the environmental performance of our managed assets.

From this we have identified In 2011, the Tea Building contributed 7% of the carbon emissions actions that can be implemented across the portfolio to reduce in the managed portfolio.
Monitoring at the Tea Building identified energy consumption a bottom up approach.
A phased refurbishment is therefore being undertaken to improve the performance of the In 2011, we began our roll-out of smart metering to improve building.
Key aspects of the refurbishment include doublethe granularity and accuracy of energy data.

As a result of our initiatives, energy intensity across the portfolio 2 has reduced by 13% this year from 104.93kWh m in 2010 to 2 91.31kWh m in 2011.

We will aim to achieve these targets by continuing our bottomup approach of reviewing individual properties to identify opportunities for improvement that can be applied throughout the managed portfolio.
On our development projects, we continue to target BREEAM and Energy Performance Certificate EPC ratings during design.
In 2011 we undertook our first study of embodied energy at one of our refurbishment projects, demonstrating that our approach used approximately 70% less carbon than a new development of a standard office building.
