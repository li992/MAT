Mining, by its nature, affects the environment in a number of ways.
We are aware of the Environment impacts our activities have on the environment wherever we operate.
To mitigate these we pay particular attention to water consumption, waste management, emissions and to biodiversity, in the form of our land reclamation projects.
NWR operations total direct energy Performance Gigajoules Total direct energy consumption consumption Total energy consumption decreased 2010 2011 Total direct energy consumption approximately 10 per cent in 2011 reported 5 million in gigajoules, GJ includes direct in GJ mainly due to the lower consumption primary energy purchased and produced of compressed air OKD and thermal 4 million minus direct primary energy sold.
This decrease was 3 million driven by the substitution of compressed air with more efficient electricity.
2 million Note: The total direct energy consumption is 1 million not available for 2008 and 2009 due to the unavailability of reportable audited data due to a significant change in the reporting base.
