Annual electricity We are proud to note that four out of our seven offices consumption achieved reductions in annual electricity consumption.
For example, our Frankfurt and Putney offices managed reductions of 10% and 5% respectively.
Carbon intensity We reduced our carbon intensity related to office per employee electricity per employee by 10% between 2009 10 and 2010 11 employee numbers increased 12%.
