South Africa is in the process of developing national legislation on climate Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 1 and 2 change.
We continue to engage with policy makers through industry 2,000 1.50 associations.
We are working with members of our industry, as well as other stakeholders, to understand the potential impacts of climate 1,800 1.35 change and take action to minimise them in areas likely to be most 1,600 1.20 affected and where we can to have the most impact.
1,400 1.05 1,200 0.90 Strategy We have made significant progress on the development of our Climate 1,000 0.75 Change Strategy since 2010.
It is intended that this strategy is integrated 800 0.60 into our Corporate Business Strategy.
To this end, the strategy builds on 600 0.45 Lonmins existing values and policies and focuses on priority areas.
The 400 0.30 strategy outlines four key strategic objectives and key performance indicators reflective of these: 200 0.15 0 0.00 Adaptation: Increasing resilience in the face of an uncertain future: 07 08 09 10 11 Financial year Governance: Embed consideration of climate change in the fabric of the business: Total greenhouse gas emissions Total GHG efficiency Resource Management and Efficiency: Minimise our environmental footprint and continually improve performance: and Capacity Building: Foster the commitment of all employees and contractors.
Carbon Footprint by Scope A key feature of the process adopted in the development of the strategy 6.14% is the identification of risks and opportunities.
In line with our risk process Total Scope 1 0.32% emissions we conducted a top-down and bottom-up risk and opportunity 101,248 kt COe 2 identification exercise.
The process also involved mapping out all climate change risks and opportunities, building capacity within Lonmin and Total Scope 2 emissions assessing the likely impact of climate change on our business.
1,541,748 kt COe 2 We identified numerous climate change related risks across our business Total Scope 3 at operational and corporate levels: and separated into various risk emissions 93.53% categories.
Low, medium and high scenarios were developed, based on 5,348 kt COe 2 available historical weather data and scientific climate change models.
Our Approach We developed a financial model to help us understand the potential implications of these risks and provide an initial indicative cost.
We are currently assessing the impact of each risk and allocate to the appropriate resources.
Our understanding of our carbon footprint continues to improve.
Our Scope Three emissions profile is currently limited.
We are implementing an action plan to expand this scope and report more comprehensively on it in 2014.
Our GHG efficiency this year of 1.14 tonnes COe per 2 PGM ounce is equal to our 2007 baseline emissions.

com TJ GJ PGM oz [ 56 ] Planet Managing our Atmospheric Emissions Our operations affect air quality in and around our Company.
We acknowledge our responsibility to continually manage this and reduce our impact on the environment.
Our principal atmospheric emissions are sulphur Average SO Emissions 2 dioxide emissions SO, greenhouse gases as 2 16 presented under our Climate Change section and Total Suspended Particulates TSP, which includes dust.
14 12 Managing our Air Emissions 10.58 The two main management focus areas include 10 emissions and ambient management.
An important component of the emissions focus area is the update 8 of our emissions inventory which was completed and 6 updated in 2011.
We undertook the Hazemeter Campaign which provided us with evidence to do air 4 quality management planning.
This project has proved 2 that both Lonmin sources and activities not owned by Lonmin influence the ambient air quality within and 0 outside our mining boundary.
We will investigate the 07 08 09 10 11 Financial year opportunity of mitigating activities within our communities which affect the ambient environment.
The most significant air quality issue for our smelting and refining operations at Marikana are SO.
During 2 2011 we were granted an Atmospheric Emissions Licence AEL for our smelting operations.
Conditional upon the issuing of the AEL is the inclusion of an impact and emissions reduction strategy.
This strategy outlines our actions and fugitive management plan to meet the 2015 and 2020 emission commitments as promulgated under the National Environmental Management Air Quality Act NEMAQA and to reduce the amount of ground level fugitive SO emissions by 2 40% 2010 baseline by 2014.
Quarterly reports tracking our commitments are submitted to the regulating authority.
Our average SO emissions for 2 2011 were 10.58 tonnes per day t d : a decrease of 3.51t d 24.9% from 2010.
This is attributed to the improved efficiency and availability of our SO air 2 pollution control equipment at the Smelter.
Sources that contribute to the release of particulate matter include tailings facilities, unpaved roads, crushing operations, opencast mining and the handling of materials, such as the tipping of waste rock.
All these sources are captured in our emissions inventory that will inform our atmospheric dispersion modelling studies currently undertaken.
This year we piloted the use of chemical suppression on the tailings dams at our Marikana operations.
This method of suppression has proved to be very effective.
We continue to maintain and operate the suppression methods on our tailings facilities.
During 2011 we spent in the order of US$0.4 million.
