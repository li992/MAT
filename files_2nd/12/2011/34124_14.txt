Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 3.
STAKEHOLDERS Big Yellow engages with its main stakeholders to provide information and gain useful feedback from a variety of groups, as described below: 3.1 Our Customers During the year, we joined the 10:10 Campaign, a business networking opportunity to engage thousands of potential customers and businesses across the UK in adopting more ambitious carbon reduction targets.
We have signed up because we have been aiming to reduce our carbon emissions since 2008 and we aim to continue to do so.
We have placed Energy Performance Certificates on display in our store reception areas dating back to October 2008, and real time renewable energy generation display screens in our store loading bays, where solar PV and wind turbines have been installed.
We aim to raise customer awareness of our efforts to provide compliant, cost effective, efficient and low carbon storage.
Also, through the Sunday Times Best Green Companies survey, we want future customers to know about the actions we are taking to reduce the impact of our business on the environment.
3.2 Our Staff CSR training was provided to our store staff in response to feedback from our annual staff survey.
Presentations were held at our Tunbridge Wells, Edmonton, Birmingham and Twickenham stores.
Topics covered included our CSR policy, carbon reduction, energy efficiency, and renewable energy initiatives.
New staff environmental inductions were provided at our High Wycombe, Camberley and Eltham stores and Green Travel Plans were established at Camberley and Eltham.
Following a staff travel carbon footprint survey in October 2008, a tax efficient bicycle purchase scheme was implemented.
This scheme has resulted in staff purchasing 30 bicycles in the first 15 months of the scheme to 31 March 2011.
Cycle ownership and use has risen from 3% to 11% of staff.
We also participated in the Sunday Times Best Green Companies 2011 employee survey.
The aim of participating in the survey is to gather staff opinions on our green business policies and to help us recognise what we are doing well and where we need to improve.
3.3 Governmental Organisations We participated in the Green Deal ministerial event on improving energy efficiency in non-domestic buildings, in October 2010.
Discussions were held on key business roles and the funding mechanism for businesses that would involve energy efficiency technology providers, certifiers and energy supply companies.
We also participated in a consultation and workshop in February 2011, for the review of the Governments Carbon Reduction Commitment Climate Change Act 2010 in order to prepare for changes in reporting on our Carbon Footprint, our Annual Report and the provision of our Evidence Pack.
3.4 The Investment Community Big Yellow took part in the seventh Carbon Disclosure Project CDP7 which aims to create a shareholder value relationship between institutional investors and companies that have strong climate change policies.
We achieved a B rating in the Financials sector along with Hammerson, Great Portland Estates, Segro, British Land Company, Derwent and Shaftesbury.
The top A rated Financials were the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC Holdings and Barclays.
CDP7 provides a coordinating secretariat for institutional investors with a combined US $57 trillion of assets under management.
Big Yellow also presented at the Maastricht Universitys international Green Building Finance and Investment conference, organised by the managers of the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB.
It was an exchange of insights and knowledge from investors, businesses and governments on green building finance and investments.
Eleven of the worlds largest pension asset managers sponsored the event, representing $1.4 trillion in assets under management.
These asset managers have joined forces to create the GRESB annual survey that Big Yellow participates in.
The survey will scrutinise the sustainability of companies in the real estate industry.
The GRESB real estate index compares property companies environmental credentials based on the evidence of their environmental management practices and implementation.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Big Yellows most significant environmental impact is its carbon emissions from electric lighting use in operational stores.
We have calculated carbon dioxide CO emissions using the latest DECC conversion factors.
2 4.1 Store Energy Use Carbon Dioxide Emissions Electricity is used for lighting, lifts, heating, cooling and ventilation.
This type of emission is classified as Scope 2 or offsite power station fossil fuel emissions.
We are reporting and re-stating carbon intensity data by gross internal area GIA, rather than final storage area, because it is more representative of lighting use in reception, office, store corridors and stairwells.
Independent Energy Statements estimate that about 3% of our store electricity use comes from external store signage, security and parking lighting.
The table below summarises the Companys store electricity usage and emissions over the last three years: Store Electricity Use & CO Emissions 2 Year 2009 2010 2011 % Change 2012 Target Electricity Use kWh 12,866,186 12,730,855 13,925,217 9.4% Carbon Emissions kgCO 6,986,725 6,913,236 7,541,898 9.1% 2 2 Occupied space m 164,898 177,904 198,063 11.3% 2 KgCO2 m occupied space 42.4 38.9 38.1 2.1% 2.5% 2 GIA m 475,789 528,604 545,884 3.3% 2 Kg CO m GIA 14.7 13.1 13.8 5.3% 2 Due to growing storage occupancy in the last year and new store openings, electricity use and carbon emissions rose for the first time since the financial year ending 31 March 2008.
Carbon emissions for occupied space indicate that we still achieved a reduction in carbon intensity of 2.1%.
The carbon intensity measure for gross internal area GIA takes into account our new store portfolio growth.
Our target will be to continue to reduce carbon intensity as we achieve occupancy growth by our continued investments in store energy efficiency.
4.2 Store Lighting Energy Efficiency Programmes Our new stores at High Wycombe and Camberley were opened with energy saving motion sensor lighting and energy efficient T5 lamps, installed by Big Yellow Construction.
LED lighting is also being trailed in the Camberley store reception area.
New energy efficient stores, from our Kennington store opening onwards, now number 14 Eco-stores.
A further 26 stores from the older portfolio have been re-lamped by our Facilities Management team, with energy efficient T5 lamps or energy efficient power adaptors fitted to existing T8 lamps to achieve a 30% energy saving.
Seven stores were converted to energy efficiency upgrades Battersea, Dagenham, Hounslow, Croydon, Guildford, Ilford and Hanger Lane in the financial year ending 31 March 2011.
Our Facilities Management energy efficiency lighting programme is now 41% complete.
Zoning of sensor lighting was carried out at Bow in September 2010, which has increased the control of lighting use further.
Sensors only activate energy efficient lighting in zones where customer activity is detected.
Facilities Management intend to roll-out this control to eight further stores and also carry out 10 energy saving re-lamps in the financial year ending 31 March 2012 to achieve a 57% completion.
4.3 Stores Gas Use Carbon Dioxide Emissions Flexi-office services are provided alongside self storage in twelve of our sixty two stores.
Stores Flexi-offices Gas Use & CO Emissions 2 Year 2009 2010 2011 % Change Flexi-office gas energy use kWh year 479,354 482,229 656,017 36.0% Carbon dioxide emissions Kg CO 88,000 88,528 121,265 37.0% 2 2 Flexi Office Occupied Space m 2,680 2,836 2,909 2.6% 2 Carbon intensity kg CO m occupied space 32.8 31.2 41.6 33.3% 2 2 Final Office Area m 3,282 3,401 3,526 3.7% 2 Flexi-office carbon intensity Kg CO m 26.8 26.0 35.6 36.9% 2 Gas carbon emissions only make up 1.56% of our total carbon footprint and these have increased by 37.0% in flexi offices due to increased business activity and the severity of the 2010 11 winter.
Eight of these offices use gas heating systems and Kennington and Bromley are heated and cooled by renewable energy from ground source heat pumps.
Two flexi-offices have heating provided by electricity.
Gas heating, which involves direct onsite combustion are known as Scope 1 carbon emissions.
Gas carbon emission reductions are planned for future stores with flexi-office services by increased contributions from solar PV installations for electric heating.
51 Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 4.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS continued 4.4 Construction Fit-Out Carbon Dioxide Emissions Store fit out is the final and only stage of construction that Big Yellow manages directly.
Diesel energy generation and grid electricity use amount to about 0.96% of carbon emissions.
High Wycombe, Camberley and Eltham account for these carbon emissions to the year ending 31 March 2011.
Construction Fit Out Energy Use & CO Emissions 2 Energy Use 2009 2010 2011 % Change Total fit out diesel use litres 37,962 50,571 13,481 73.3% Diesel generator tCO 101.5 133.5 35.6 73.3% 2 Fit out grid electricity use kWh 177,047 127,643 69,933 45.2% Total construction fit out energy use 95.1 69.3 37.9 45.3% Number of stores fit outs 6 6 3 50% Absolute total metric tons tCO 196 203 74 63.5% 2 tCO per new store fit out 32.7 33.8 24.7 26.9% 2 Diesel consumption was reduced by 73.3% due to a 50% reduction in store fit outs and the use of grid electricity on the Eltham site where we also trialled well insulated construction site eco cabins.
These factors contributed to a significant reduction in CO emissions of 63.5%.
2 4.5 Big Yellows Carbon Footprint In summary, Big Yellows carbon footprint is set out in the table below: Big Yellow Absolute Carbon Foot Print Operations 2009 2010 2011 % Change 2011 target Store electricity carbon dioxide emissions tCO 6,987 6,913 7,542 9.1% 2 Fit out diesel & electricity carbon dioxide emissions tCO 196 203 74 63.5% 2 Store flexi-office carbon dioxide emissions tCO 88 89 121 36.0% 2 Total carbon dioxide emissions tCO 7,271 7,205 7,737 7.4% 5% 2 Expressed as metric tonnes of carbon dioxide Total carbon dioxide emissions for combined store and operational emissions increased in absolute terms by 7.4%, due to increased business activity in self storage and flexi-office occupancy, the opening of three new stores and a higher demand for heating in the 2010 11 winter period.
This is the first year since the financial year ending 31 March 2008 in which Big Yellow has not achieved an absolute carbon reduction.
Only in fit out construction was there a significant carbon reduction mainly due to a lower development programme.
The number of new stores opened two and under construction six remained relatively low compared to previous years.
Construction diesel use was reduced due to the slower development rate and by switching from diesel generators to grid electricity at the earliest opportunity.
In the year ended 31 March 2012, Big Yellow plans to continue its energy efficiency programme for store lighting and increased capacity for solar PV installations providing up to 50 kWp on new stores.
We aim to reduce carbon intensity per square metre of occupied space by 2.5%, as our business activity increases.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS continued 4.6 Renewable Energy Generation In the year ended 31 March 2011, Big Yellow added one solar photo-voltaic installation at its new store in Camberley.
Our renewable energy assets now consist of eleven solar installations, five ground source heat pumps and two wind turbines over twelve stores.
Solar PV generation data has been restated this year based on more accurate meter readings, rather than the use of display screen monitors.
Ground source heat pump GSHPs annual generation estimates have been added to the renewable energy totals and these have been restated based on independent performance reports from Tate Engineering and Faber Maunsel Energy Statements.
GSHPs, supply heating and or cooling to reception and office areas in Balham, Fulham, Kennington, Sheen and Bromley.
Renewable Energy Generation Year 2009 2010 2011 % Change 2011 Targets Renewable energy generation kWh 76,424 151,045 168,356 11.5% 12% Carbon dioxide emission reduction tCO 41.4 81.8 91.2 11.5% 2 Grid electricity savings @0.9 kWh 6,878 13,594 15,152 11.5% Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs 857 1,683 n a Total renewable energy income & savings kWh 8,583 16,290 n a Total store energy use electricity & gas kWh 13,345,540 13,214,084 14,555,897 10.2% Renewable energy % of store energy use 0.6% 1.1% 1.2% 9.1% Renewable energy generation, carbon emission savings and revenues increased by just over 11.5%.
Revenue payments for Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs only include Balham and Merton Solar PVs because the majority of installations were transferred directly from ROCs to the more generous Feed in Tariff.
Renewable energy revenues will be reported in financial year end 31 March 2012 and backdated to 1 April 2010.
Headline performances include a cumulative solar energy generation approaching 255 MWh and a cumulative total renewable energy generation of 398 MWh since the first installation at the end of financial year to 31 March 2008.
4.7 Store Waste Management In May 2011 we changed our waste contractor to Severnside Recycling, who recycle and manufacture cardboard in addition to providing standard waste collection services.
In the financial years 2009 and 2010, the waste volume was estimated from the number of bin lifts and volume of bins.
Estimates of Store Non Hazardous Bulk Waste Volume Year 2009 2010 2011 % Change Tonnage of store waste t 266 Percentage further sorting and landfill % 28% Percentage for direct recycling % 72% Number of stores 54 60 62 3.3% Tonnage of waste per store 4.3 From May 2010, store waste has been sorted on site into mixed dry recyclables MDR, mixed papers and general waste.
Due to the change in waste contractors we can estimate twelve months total waste based on the eleven months data 244t from May 2010 to the year ending 31 March 2011.
However, from 2011 12 onwards we will be able to measure our tonnage and recycling percentage more accurately for future years in this report.
During the last 11 months, 72% of the total tonnage of store waste was sent directly for recycling with a further 1% of mixed papers sent for recycling.
A further 28% was sent for further sorting and or landfill.
4.8 Store Water Use We have been monitoring store water use for our staff kitchens, WCs and customer WCs.
Estimates of Store Water Volume Use Year 2009 2010 2011 % Change Number of stores open 54 60 62 3.3% 3 Estimated average volume used m 12,502 13,890 14,353 3.3% In preparation for future commercial building Water Performance Certificates WPCs we aim to improve our measurement of water use.
New stores have low flow aerated taps and showers and duel flush WCs.
Five stores have rainwater harvesting systems Sutton, Barking, Merton, Liverpool and Sheffield and supply water for WC flushing and irrigation for enhanced landscape areas with green walls and trees.
53 Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 5.
STORE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Our High Wycombe store has a Green roof and timber clad walls adjacent to the River Wye, where the banks have been enhanced with wildlife and habitat features such as log piles and bird boxes.
The front reception boundary area is enhanced with a variety of formal landscape species.
Our Camberley store required a large capacity sustainable urban drainage system SUDS installed to reduce the risk of local flooding from the River Blackwater.
Landscaped areas have been increased and enhanced with hundreds of plant species.
Internally, we are trialling energy efficient LED lighting and have a solar PV installation on the store roof.

They record how energy efficient the property design is and allow investors, buyers and tenants to see a predicted carbon emission figure so they can consider energy costs and future efficiencies.
Our High Wycombe store 2 has been certified at one level above the expected energy efficiency benchmark for new buildings Reception area 50 kg CO m emissions.
2 2 Our Camberley store is two levels above the expected energy efficiency benchmark for new buildings Reception area 20 kg CO m emissions.
2 5.2 The Considerate Constructors Scheme CCS Our construction sites are monitored against the Code of Considerate Practice providing guidelines that are beyond statutory requirements.
Areas of management performance include the environment, the workforce and the general public.
Points can be gained by site workers for: being considerate: protecting the environment: maintaining cleanliness: being a good neighbour: respectability: safety: responsiveness: and accountability.
CCS auditors visit our construction sites and assess performances out of a maximum score of 40 points.
Reports are then sent to the Construction Director and CSR Manager for review and actions if required.

Out of 6 sites, 5 scored above the UK average of 31 points.
We exceeded our average points score target set for 2011 30 points.
Our Camberley store shell construction stage achieved 35.5 points, a certificate for Performance Beyond Compliance and was ranked in the top 10% of construction companies in the UK and will be reviewed for the CCS National Awards Scheme.
STORE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION continued 5.3 Construction Waste Management Big Yellow Construction achieves high percentages of waste recycling at the fit-out stages of new stores with minimal waste taken to landfill.
Timber, top soil, cardboard, plasterboard, plastics and smaller amounts of metals 1% are in demand for recycling or supplier take back.
A waste data study for eleven construction sites in financial years 2009 and 2010 indicated typical recycling rates approaching 100% CSR Report 3 3 2010.
An average volume of 335 m per site of general waste and 38 m plasterboard supplier take back per site, is typical.
Total annual waste 3 volumes for five to six stores are under 2,000 m per year, just under half of that compared with store waste.
This waste excludes demolition and shell construction waste.
Big Yellow Construction has sourced a specialised recycling contractor with a large scale recycling plant for site clearance, demolition and ground work phases of construction which is on trial at our Chiswick development.
6.0 HEALTH AND SAFETY The Health and Safety Policy covers our wholly owned stores, partnership stores and managed stores.
Construction health and safety data is recorded in weekly site meeting minutes.
Facilities Management record health and safety incidents for all stores directly on to spreadsheets.
A Health and Safety Committee, made up of the Operations Director, Construction Director, Head of Facilities and the Property Director, reviews performance on a quarterly basis and the Board receives bi-monthly departmental reports which highlight any relevant health and safety issues recently experienced.
6.1 Store Customer and Visitor Health and Safety Year 2009 2010 2011 Total number of customers by move-ins 36,868 41,781 51,049 Minor Injuries 75 53 41 Reportable Injuries 1 RIDDOR per 100,000 customers 2.39 RIDDOR Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulation 1995 This year we restate our number of customers by move-ins and RIDDOR performance to take into account our managed store customers.

56 Independent assurance statement by Deloitte LLP to Big Yellow Group PLC on their Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2011 the Report Scope of our work Big Yellow Group PLC engaged us to perform limited assurance procedures for the year ended 31 March 2011 on the following subject matters: Carbon footprint indicators: Store electricity emissions tCO 2 Fit out diesel and electricity emissions tCO 2 Store flexi-office gas emissions tCO 2 Absolute carbon dioxide emissions tCO 2 Store electricity use, CO emissions and carbon intensity: 2 Electricity use kWh Absolute carbon emissions tCO 2 2 Carbon intensity Kg CO m gross internal area 2 2 Carbon intensity Kg CO m occupied space 2 Renewable energy generation and CO emissions reduction: 2 Total renewable energy kWh Carbon dioxide saved by renewable energy tCO 2 Renewable energy percentage of total energy use Considerate Constructors Scheme: Number of construction projects Percentage of registered sites UK average Average points score for all sites Staff health and safety: Average number of employees Minor Injuries Reportable injuries RIDDOR Annual Injury Incidence rate AIIR per 100,000 staff Notices Assurance process and standard We carried out limited assurance in accordance with the International Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000 ISAE 3000.
To achieve limited assurance ISAE 3000 requires that we review the processes and systems used to compile the areas on which we provide assurance.
It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls.
This provides less assurance and is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement.
The evaluation criteria used for our assurance are the Big Yellow Group definitions and basis of reporting as described at: bigyellow.
com csr Key procedures Considering the risk of material error, our multi-disciplinary team of CSR assurance specialists planned and performed our work to obtain all the information and explanations we considered necessary to provide sufficient evidence to support our assurance conclusion.
Our work was planned to mirror Big Yellow Groups own group level compilation processes, tracing how data for each indicator within our assurance scope was collected, collated and validated by corporate head office and included in the Report.
Key procedures we carried out included: Gaining an understanding of Big Yellow Groups systems through interview with management responsible for CSR management and reporting systems at head office Reviewing the systems and procedures to capture, collate, aggregate, validate and process source data for the assured performance data included in the Report 57
