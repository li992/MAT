Frank Act in the US and EMIR and MiFID II in Europe.
This reshaping could profoundly change the overall structure of the financial industry and thereby potentially the role and position of interdealer brokers.
The buy-side and the so-called shadow banking industry could become much larger players in this new financial world obliging interdealer brokers to adapt their offering to cater to new regulatory and customer needs.
R The implementation of the new financial regulations will potentially redefine some aspects of interdealer broking and create new types of competition between interdealer brokers and other market intermediaries for execution business.
In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain classes of derivatives trade on Designated Contract Markets or on hereby created swap execution facilities.
In Europe, there are parallel proposals for MiFID II that classes derivatives traded on exchanges, multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities.
The precise scope and impact of these proposals on market operating models are yet to be defined but, given ICAPs leading position in the market and its balanced portfolio of electronic, voice and post trade businesses, the Group remains well positioned to take advantage of the proposed legislative and regulatory changes.
R Finally, the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and MiFID II present technical challenges as they fundamentally redefine the relationship between broking platform operators and their customers.
This will require additional investments in a number of control areas to accommodate the increased level of compliance monitoring required for these new-market structures.
The progressive move from voice-brokered products to hybrid or fully electronic platforms implied by the regulations could also disrupt trade flows from market participants concerned about the public availability of prices.
34 Business review continued The board monitors the risk profile of the Group using eight broad risk categories: liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, strategic risk, credit risk, reputational risk, financial risk and market risk.
Within each risk category we have a taxonomy of the specific risks that we face.
Liquidity risk, operational risk and legal and compliance risk are the principal risk categories to the Group.
These risks and the way in which they are managed and mitigated are described below.
