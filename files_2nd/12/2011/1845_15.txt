An excellent example of this is Dalston Square where we are delivering 553 units, of which 90 were legally completed in the 2010 11 financial year.
We expect that the entire scheme will be completed by summer 2013.
This site was acquired from the London Development Agency LDA and Hackney Borough Council in conjunction with Transport for London.
We were selected on our track record for delivery and good working relationship with the LDA.
It is a challenging site including four towers constructed on top of a new railway station.
In order to minimise any vibrations from the trains below, vibration pads have been installed and the towers have been constructed using steel rather than concrete.
The development provides much needed affordable housing and 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom flats incorporating energy efficiency measures including green roofs and combined heat and power.
Many of the flats incorporate winter gardens.
The development provides a lasting legacy for the community including the construction of a major new public square and commercial space including a new library.
