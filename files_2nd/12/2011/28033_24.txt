PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 23 from the issue of 203,607 ordinary shares following the exercise of the same number of subscription shares.
The Company also received 1,680,704 from the issue of 645,880 new ordinary shares for cash.
Financial Instruments The Companys use of financial instruments is disclosed in note 1 c and note 19 to the financial statements.
Gearing Policy Gearing policy is under the control of the Board.
The maximum limit for gearing is 25% of total net assets measured at the time new borrowings are incurred for investment in companies where there are stock-specific opportunities.
The gearing is not an expression of confidence in the performance of the overall UK stock market, but rather an endorsement of the potential for selected securities.
In this respect both the Board and the Manager are content that the flexibility which the overdraft facility provides offers the most appropriate means of gearing, supplementing the longer-term gearing of the debenture stock.
30,000,000 6.125% Debenture 2014 The debenture was issued in July 1999, is secured by a floating charge over all the Companys assets and has a fixed rate of 6.125%.
It is redeemable in July 2014 and interest is payable on 8 January and 8 July.
Environmental Matters, Employees and Social and Community Issues As an investment trust company with no employees, property or activities outside investment management, the disclosure of information about environmental matters, the Companys employees and social and community issues is not given.
The Manager considers various factors when evaluating potential investments.
Some are financial ratios and measures, such as free cash flow, earnings per share and price to book value.
Others are more subjective indicators which rely on first hand research: for example, quality of management, innovation and product strength.
While a companys policy towards the environment and social responsibility is considered as part of the overall assessment of risk and the suitability of the company for the portfolio, the Manager does not necessarily preclude an investment being made on environmental and social grounds alone.
The Company may send or supply documents or information to shareholders in electronic form e. g. by e-mail or by means of a website.
This delivers environmental benefits through the reduced use of paper and of the energy required for its production and distribution.
