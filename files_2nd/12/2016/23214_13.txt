Disruptive behaviour easyJet does not tolerate disruptive behaviour on its flights.
Its crew are trained to assess all situations to make sure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised atany time.
This year easyJet signed the British Air Transport Association BATA s Code of Conduct on this issue which seeks to minimise instances of disruptive behaviour and ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for passengers and employees.
The airline has introduced measures to discourage and try to prevent disruptive behaviour, as well as further increasing the support for its crew to respond when it does occur.
This work isbeing targeted at particular flights which are known to be at higher risk of disruptive behaviour.
This has included: Security communicating with customers in advance and at the gate The easyJet security team works closely with government and that easyJet does not tolerate disruptive behaviour and that regulatory agencies throughout easyJet's network in order to they cannot drink alcohol purchased in the airport on board: minimise the vulnerability of easyJet's customers and people to placing security guards at departure gates for security risks.
