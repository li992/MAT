EPRA Best Practice Recommendations for decreased compared with last year as a result of Like-for-like portfolio energy consumption and greenhouse gas GHG emissions The primary source of our GHG emissions is the energy consumed within our buildings.
This equates to 97.4% of the total emissions reported this year.
We have achieved a 3% reduction in like-for-like energy consumption this year vs 2014 15.
This has contributed to a decrease in associated 2 carbon emissions of 8.4%.
Overall carbon intensity tCO m has also dropped by 9% this year.
These strong carbon reductions are a result of lower 2 local based emission factors and energy efficiency improvements across the portfolio.
Further reductions are anticipated next year as our company wide EEnMS continues to drive energy reductions.
