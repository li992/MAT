RESTORATION OF PARK LAKE Park Lake, a former china clay pit on Bodmin Moor, has been transformed by South West Water from a moonscape of waste sand and mica to a designated County Wildlife Site and home to rare plants and animals.
Park Pit was turned into a reservoir by South West Water after we entered into an agreement with the former owners, Imerys, to manage the surrounding land as an exemplar of post-industrial restoration.
Planning conditions were met by 2012 but, working in partnership with local environmental groups and volunteers, we have continued with an integrated management programme of restoration.
Work has included restoration of wetlands, control of invasive species and the introduction of managed grazing, which has led to it being described by local conservationists as one of the best sites on Bodmin Moor for wildlife.
It is now home to the second largest colony of the tormentil mining bee in Cornwall, breeding populations of the nationally scarce small red damselfly, 15 species of dragonfly including the keeled skimmer and black darter and the marsh fritillary butterfly, making it a nationally important site for conservation.
