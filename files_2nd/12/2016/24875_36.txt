Sustainability continued MINIMISING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT At Hikma, we consider environmental stewardship to be a key aspect of our sustainability strategy.
We take active steps to track and reduce our adverse environmental impacts and promote awareness about responsible environmental practices both internally and amongst the public.
Efficiency improvements in 2016 contributed to sizeable reductions in our emissions versus the previous year.
GHG emissions disclosure Total tCO e by category 2 This section has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory obligation to report greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Section 7 of The Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013.
The table below shows our emissions performance for the years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016.
GHG Source 2014 2015 2016 Scope 1 Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities tCO e 20,506 tCO e 26,422 tCO e 24,114 tCO e 2 2 2 2 Scope 2 location-based Electricity tCO 57,459 tCO 79,061 tCO 78,279 tCO 2 2 2 2 Scope 2 market-based Electricity tCO n a n a 81,140 tCO 2 2 Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions Purchased electricity for location-based 77,965 tCO e 105,483 tCO e 102,393 tCO e 2 2 2 own consumption 76% tCO e per FTE employee 2 Natural gas combustion 12% Scope 1 & 2 location-based 13.38 tCO e 17.11 tCO e 16.17 tCO e 2 2 2 Diesel combustion 8% Data notes: Vehicle emissions 2% Emissions from the consumption of electricity are reported in tCO rather than tCO e Refrigerants 1% 2 2 since the International Energy Agency emission factors for electricity currently account Petrol combustion 1% for carbon dioxide emissions only.
LPG Propane combustion 1% The full time equivalent FTE employee figures used to calculate the reported intensity metric cover the sites for which emissions data was provided rather than the total FTE figure for the organisation as a whole.
