Employees targeted for training are those in client-facing roles and relevant support teams.
During 2014 a new policy framework was launched, requiring a significant level of training to be delivered between 2014 and 2015 and thus a one-off increase in training attendance Equator Principles Project advisory Project finance mandates Project-related corporate loans mandates 1 2 3 Cat A Cat B Cat C Cat A Cat B Cat C 4 Total 2013 9 29 3 5 Total 2014 3 11 1 4 0 Total 2015 4 9 1 2 Total 2016 7 6 2016 Sector Mining 1 N A Infrastructure 3 N A Oil & Gas 2 N A Renewables N A Telecoms N A Power 2 3 N A Other 2 N A Region Greater China 1 1 N A North East Asia N A South Asia 1 1 N A ASEAN N A MENAP 3 4 N A Africa 2 N A Americas N A Europe N A 4 Designation Designated N A Non-designated 7 6 N A Independent review Yes 7 6 N A No N A 1.
Cat A or Category A are projects with potential significant adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented 2.
Cat B or Category B are projects with potential limited adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures 3.
Cat C or Category C are projects with minimal or no adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts 4.
Designation is split into designated and non-designated countries.
Designated countries are deemed by the Equator Principles to have robust environmental and social governance, legislation systems and institutional capacity designed to protect their people and the natural environment.
Non-designated countries are countries that are not found on the list of designated countries.
The list of countries can be found at equator-principles.

Scope 3 emissions calculated from total energy consumption from our outsourced global data centres 3.
Indirect non-renewable energy refers to purchased electricity from non-renewable sources 4.
Indirect renewable energy refers to purchased electricity from off-site renewable sources 5.
Direct non-renewable energy refers to the gross calorific values of fuels consumed on-site 6.
Direct renewable energy refers to the gross calorific values of renewable fuels consumed on-site 7.
On-site renewable energy refers to renewable energy generated and consumed on-site 8.
The 2014 measured energy total of 287 GWh includes an estimated 18 GWh of energy for locations where invoices were not available at the reporting date 9.
com 315 SUPPLEMENTARY SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION Additional notes on environment data The emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016.
This is to allow sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results.
Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting.
This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice.
Measured data is collected from Global Environment Management System GEMS properties, defined as all properties that are over 10,000 square feet for energy and water.
For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee.
Scaled-up data is an extrapolation made from measured data to account for 100 per cent of the Groups occupied property footprint for energy and water.
For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee as at the end of the reporting period.
Carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account.
Total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.
Net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas.
Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation.
Scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 20 countries, based on seating class and distance flown.
As we operate largely outside of the UK, all flights domestic or international with flight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy DBEIS as domestic flights, have been classified as short haul.
All flights with distance flown ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DBEIS as short haul have been classified as medium haul.
The Carbon Trust is our independent third-party assurance provider for Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions.
In 2016, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were assured by The Carbon Trust, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting.
