Shares in trust and shareholder dilution At 31 December 2016, there were 1 13,299,984 shares held in employee share ownership trusts ESOTs for the purposes of collaterising some of the obligations under the Groups employee share incentive schemes.
The usual strategy is to ensure that, with the exception of Black Economic Empowerment-related ESOTs, at least sufficient shares are held to satisfy restricted share forfeitable shares awards.
In calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any share option or share award that has lapsed or has been cash-settled are disregarded.
At 31 December 2016, the Company had 4.58% of share capital available under the 5%-in-10-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 8.64% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
