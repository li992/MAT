Strategic Report Embedding responsibility Responsible operator Managing our environmental impact SSE understands that its principal environmental impact arises from carbon emissions as a result of the production, distribution and use of energy.
It recognises that providing energy in a sustainable way means it has an important part to play in helping to address the potential impact of climate change on the UK and Ireland, the markets in which it operates.
Responding to the challenge about a shift in SSEs electricity generation mix SSEs performance in managing climate of climate change increasing 12% between 2014 15 and 2015 16 change impacts, led CDP to award SSE an To support the transition to a low carbon for renewables whilst coal reduced by nearly 100% disclosure rating in 2015 and include it in electricity system SSE has: invested over 33% in the same period.

The figure corresponds to the contracted position set out in the Annual Report.
2 Scope 1 comprises generation, operational vehicles, sulphur hexafluoride, fuel combustion, gas consumption in buildings.
3 Scope 2 comprises distribution losses, electricity consumption in buildings and substations.
4 Emissions intensity relative to MW is calculated against generation emissions only, rather than total emissions.
5 GHG emissions from SGNs and SHETLs activities are excluded SGN reports these separately and SHETL is operated by National Grid Company.
A The figures have been assured to the ISAE3000 and ISAE3410 standards by PwC.
