This assures us the efficiency of the way we cut chipboard.
We have invested in that we have good environmental management processes in place.
software that allows us to take the actual production demand It also encourages us to look for further improvements in areas for different-sized panels and to make sure that we get the most such as sustainable energy, waste and materialmanagement.

Weve taken what we learnt We have invested in a number of energy-saving projects at our from this and have worked with our chipboard supplier to look for factories in 2016.
The most significant of these involved replacing additional benefits.
The result of this is that our supplier now makes old lighting and compressor technology with modern energya new size of chipboard sheet for us.
This allows us to reduce our efficient versions.
These initiatives should give us a total energy waste as well as allowing our supplier to make more efficient use saving of 2,500 MWh per year.
Our factories already operate at high levels of efficiency, but this change has allowed us to reduce waste from 2016 saw us begin to use our new 650,000 sq ft warehouse at cutting patterns by a further 2%.
Since we were involved in the design Nevertheless, we still generate a lot of sawdust waste.
At both of and construction of this warehouse from scratch, we were able to our factories, we have highly efficient biomass boilers which burn specify various energy-efficiency measures such as: this waste to generate energy to heat the factories.
They allow us to efficient door seals to reduce the use of heating and reuse waste, they reduce our emissions and they save us the cost of cooling systems the equivalent bought-in fuel.
In 2016, we converted around 12,000 tonnes of sawdust into energy at our Howden and Runcorn sites.
This a solar thermal system which will reduce our need to is enough sawdust to fill 15 Olympic swimming pools.
Burning it onsite use additional heating means that it doesnt have to go to landfill and it doesnt have to be LED lighting and skylights transported elsewhere to be reused.
We generated approximately 42,000 MWh of energy from our biomass boilers, equivalent to the average annual electricity consumption of over 10,000 households.
Nine years ago, we started repairing broken pallets rather than scrapping them.
In 2016 we repaired over 165,000 pallets and put them back into use, reducing waste and saving money.

We upgraded our core truck fleet to meet the latest Euro 6 emissions standards in In 2016 we became one of the first companies to gain the 2015, and this also helped us to improve our miles per gallon by Freight Transport Associations Truck Excellence accreditation.

Being able to get more cabinets in each delivery means that weve made an annual reduction in trailer loads equivalent to 800 standard trailers.
