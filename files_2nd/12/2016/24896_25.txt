The programme was inspired by an initiative introduced in the USA and has now been established in the UK, France, Spain and Italy.
The programme leverages our existing service infrastructure and financial resources to help homeowners in need.
It is managed locally and is used in a number of different ways to help homeowners in need.
Examples include low income households facing an emergency situation but who do not have a policy and existing policyholders whose policy might not cover the work required.
