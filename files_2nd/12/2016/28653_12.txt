the amount of energy and water we use in manufacturing, and the waste we produce.
Water We reduced water consumption by 2.6% across our operations in 2016 vs 2015.
We have improved metering systems in our plants, to better understand where we can reduce water use, and invested in What were doing initiatives to deliver reductions, including reusing reject water in cooling towers and chillers.
Greenhouse gas emissions Using water in our production processes and for cleaning creates Energy use is a major source of our carbon footprint and we have waste water, which we treat and clean before we release it from our focused on using renewable energy and reducing consumption.
All our sites must comply with local legislation and monitor In2016, we implemented new energy programmes across our water discharge parameters.
In 2016, we strengthened compliance manufacturing sites.
We made our biggest investment in renewables by setting water management and waste water discharge standards to date, installing a 2.5MW solar energy system at our Belle Mead across all our global manufacturing sites.
We have also invested in factory in New Jersey.
We purchased renewable electricity at our our facilities, including a new waste water treatment plant at our manufacturing sites in Derby and Hull UK, Nowy Dwor Poland, site in Cali, Colombia.

This helped to decrease overall carbon emissions by 7.8% tonnes globally.
We also invested in low-carbon technologies.

sites to find new ways to divert waste from landfill.
It has helped us to make significant progress and in 2016, 46 of our sites sent zero waste to landfill, with the remaining one facility having clearly defined plans to meet the target by 2020.
During 2016, the average waste sent to landfill across our factories was less than 1%, which translates to a reduction of over 22,570 tonnes of hazardous and non-hazardous waste being diverted from landfill since 2012.
In 2015, we increased our waste reduction goal to 20% by 2020.
We continued to lower our waste production throughout 2016 and given our strong progress, we have further increased the target to 30% by 2020 against a 2012 baseline.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 35 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements What were doing GHG and water footprint for products Our carbon footprint per dose of product is broadly unchanged since 2012.
While we have made good progress in the areas under our control, consumer demand for products with high carbon intensity especially in hygiene is offsetting reductions elsewhere.
Water use per dose has decreased since 2012.
We are developing water efficient products such as Dettol Squeezy and are working to see how we can further reduce impacts in the largest part of our footprint consumer use of our products.
Our products Packaging waste We continue to focus on reducing GHG We continually look to reduce, reuse and recycle our packaging through our sustainable innovation and efficiency programmes.
We emissions and water use for our products, measure the sustainability impact of packaging for all new products across the value chain through product through our Sustainable Innovation App, to encourage packaging reductions and the use of more sustainable materials.
As a result, innovation although savings made are approximately 40% of the products in our pipeline now have less offset by impacts at the point packaging than their predecessor.
What were doing Palm oil Since 2014, we have focused on tracing the palm oil we procure back through the supply chain, from supplier to refinery, and refinery to mill.
In 2016, we achieved traceability to mill for 87% of our supply base outside of India, and 55% traceability to port in 1 India.
Traceability in India is challenging and we have run multiple workshops with suppliers and other brands to address this.
We have continued to support on-the-ground transformation programmes, and in partnership with The Forest Trust we launched two smallholder farmer programmes to educate farmers in good farming techniques and crop diversification.
