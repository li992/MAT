We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy All of the Groups share-based payments are equity-settled.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m BMP 2.6 3.7 SAYE 2.6 1.6 5.2 5.3 150 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 6.2 Share-based payments continued Share Incentive Plan SIP Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to 1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year.
Matching shares wereawarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group.
Therehave been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.
Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Companys control as a result of the SIP were as follows: Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at Cost at value at value at 1 January acquired transferred 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2016 during year during year 2016 2016 2016 2016 number number number number 000 000 000 SIP 188,465 35,431 153,034 1,436 18 578 Bonus Matching Plan Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus.
A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The fair value of the 2016, 2015 and 2014 BMP awards, of 2.6million, 3.3 million and 5.4 million respectively, is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three year vesting periods.
The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting.
The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2016 awards are the share price at the grant date 249.7 pence, expected volatility 41%, and risk free interest rate 0.45%.
The fair value of each option granted was 153 pence.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the BMP awards is as follows: 2016 2015 BMP BMP number number At 1 January 3,411,792 4,053,414 Granted 1,686,095 1,560,552 Forfeited 623,597 505,781 Exercised 337,146 958,566 Expired 943,212 737,827 At 31 December 3,193,932 3,411,792 50% of the BMP options granted in 2016 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard 2015: 50% TSR-linked, 50% scorecard-linked.
The share price on the grant date for BMP options awarded in the year was 250 pence 2015: 397 pence and the weighted average fair value of the BMP options granted during the year was 153 pence 2015: 213 pence.
For the BMP options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 232 pence 2015: 397 pence.
All of the BMP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of nil 2015: nil.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 17 months 2015: 14 months.
The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil 2015: nil.

Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 203 pence 2015: 319 pence, representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules.
The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts.
The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE Plan of 3.9 million 2015: 4.4 million is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts.

The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out in the table below: 5 April 5 April 2 April 2 April Grant date 2016 2016 2015 2015 Share price at grant date pence 286 286 399 399 Vesting period 3 years 5 years 3 years 5 years Exercise price pence 203 203 319 319 Dividend yield 2.9% 5.0% 1.9% 1.9% Annual risk free interest rate 0.81% 0.95% 1.08% 1.36% Expected volatility 40.0% 37.6% 43.0% 43.0% Fair value of options granted pence 101 82 142 160 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three and five years respectively.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 337 pence 2015: 400 pence.
The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 216 pence 2015: 331 pence.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 31 months 2015: 32 months.
The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil 2015: 10,894.

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes.
The Drax Power Group DPG section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS is a defined benefit scheme: a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules.
Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401 K Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.
152 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Accounting policy Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the contributions.
For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable and the return on scheme assets excluding interest, is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating andadministrative expenses in the period in which they occur.
The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
Significant judgement areas Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2016 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates three defined contribution schemes, The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass inc. 401 K Plan, for all qualifying employees.
Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Total included in staff costs note 6.1 5.6 5.9 As at 31 December 2016, contributions of 0.5 million 2015: 0.4 million due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit scheme The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS.
Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets equities, property and direct lending which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long term objectives.
Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect against extreme inflation.
153 Annual report and accounts 2016 Drax Group plc SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Other risks include operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks such as the Government increasing the burden onpension schemes through new legislation and other demographic risks such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group.
The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016 is not yetcomplete: however the actuarial review at 31 December 2016 is based on the same membership and other data as the initial results of this funding valuation.
The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost.
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows: As at 31 December 2016 2015 % p. a.
Discount rate 2.8 3.9 Inflation RPI 3.2 3.1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.7 Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2016 will live, on average, for a further 27 years if they are male 2015: 27 years andfor a further 29 years if they are female 2015: 29 years.
Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 isassumed to be 28 and 31 years respectively 2015: 28 and 31 years respectively.
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets, determined as follows: As at 31 December 2016 2015 m m Defined benefit obligation 311.4 244.6 Fair value of plan assets 281.3 215.1 Net liability recognised in the balance sheet 30.1 29.5 The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Included in staff costs note 6.1 : Current service cost 6.0 6.4 Included in finance costs note 2.5 : Interest on net defined benefit liability 0.9 1.1 Total amounts recognised in the income statement 6.9 7.5 Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Cumulative actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme at 1 January 70.8 72.0 Actuarial losses gains on defined benefit pension scheme recognised in the year 8.4 1.2 Cumulative losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 79.2 70.8 154 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 244.6 242.1 Current and past service cost 6.0 6.4 Employee contributions 0.2 0.2 Interest cost 9.4 8.9 Actuarial gains losses 58.8 5.8 Benefits paid 7.6 7.2 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 311.4 244.6 The actuarial losses of 58.8 million 2015: 5.8 million gains reflect losses of 71.4 million arising from changes in financial assumptions 2015:gains of 2.3 million, offset by 1.9 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and gains arising from scheme experience of 10.7 million 2015: gains of 1.8 million and 1.7 million respectively.
The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.75% 2015: 3.9% following reductions in corporate bond yields.
Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 215.1 207.8 Interest income on plan assets 8.5 7.8 Remeasurement losses gains 50.4 4.6 Employer contributions 14.7 11.1 Employee contributions 0.2 0.2 Benefits paid 7.6 7.2 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 281.3 215.1 Employer contributions included payments totalling 8.3 million 2015: 5.1 million to reduce the actuarial deficit.
The actual return on plan assets in the period was 58.9 million 2015: 3.2 million.
The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2016 2015 m m Gilts 105.9 1 Equities 65.2 64.6 2 Fixed interest bonds 61.3 113.9 Property 29.5 27.9 3 Cash and other assets 19.4 8.7 Fair value of total plan assets 281.3 215.1 Notes: 1 At 31 December 2016 the schemes long-term asset strategy was: global equity 20%, direct lending 10%, emerging market equity 5%, fixed interest bonds 15%, corporate bonds 6%, liability driven investing 29% and long lease property 15%.
2 Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds.
Approximately 27% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating i. e. BB or lower.
3 Other assets include 19.1 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market 2015: 7.9 million.
155 Annual report and accounts 2016 Drax Group plc SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual asset allocation forthe scheme.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension deficit at31 December 2016 to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Increase in net liability % m Discount rate Increase 0.25 15.6 Decrease 0.25 16.2 1 Inflation rate Increase 0.25 14.0 Decrease 0.25 13.6 Life expectancy Increase 1 year 10.9 Decrease 1 year 11.0 Note: 1 The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation.
The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
As at 31 December 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 m m m m m Defined benefit obligation 311.4 244.6 242.1 220.9 199.0 Fair value of plan assets 281.3 215.1 207.8 179.2 156.9 Deficit 30.1 29.5 34.3 41.7 42.1 Experience adjustments on plan liabilities 10.7 1.7 1.6 8.7 1.7 Experience adjustments on plan assets 50.4 4.6 13.6 9.4 3.0 The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group 60%, former employees of the Group who are yet to retire 5% and retired pensioners 35%.
The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.
The Group expects to contribute 23.8 million to the defined benefit pension plan during the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 and make regular deficit contributions over the period to 2025.
The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the 31 March 2013 funding valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.
