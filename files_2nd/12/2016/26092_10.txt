Scope1 emissions increased by 30 kt or 8% to 416 kt, mainly due to the increase in consumption of diesel by the Bozshakol and Aktogay mining fleets.
Scope 2 emissions rose from 529 kt to 1,056 kt as power consumption at the Bozshakol sulphide concentrator and the Aktogay SX EW processing facility increased during the year.
Bozymchak also raised output in 2016 compared to the prior year, but this had a negligible impact on Group CO emissions since 2 power is drawn from mainly hydroelectric sources which have lowcarbon emissions.

Two of these locations are at underground mining operations which are situated large distances from the processing plants, making it uneconomic to pump the water back for reuse.
The third discharge occurs at waste rock dumps adjacent to a closed open pit mine, where acidic drainage water is collected.
In each of these locations the water is treated prior to release to the environment and the quality of discharged water is monitored.
com 49 Corporate responsibility report Waste Generation of waste rock from the mining of overburden atBozshakol and Aktogay is not considered to be a significant stakeholder issue due to the remote locations of the mines and their separation distances from local communities.
Waste rock generation increased to 19.1 million tonnes in 2016 2015: 10.4 million tonnes as the new open pit mines ramped up in 2016.
Aktogay generated 1.3 million tonnes of waste rock in 2016 and will generate less waste per unit of ore mined due to its lower stripratio of 0.2 compared to 0.7 at Bozshakol.

Remedial works to be performed will include the closure of all mine access points and shafts, the contouring of waste heaps, long-term monitoring and treatment of water runoff and the clearance of buildings and infrastructure.
The site will be returned as closely aspossible to its pre-development state as required by legislation.
