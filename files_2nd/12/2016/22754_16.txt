Highlights Carbon verification During 2016 and the start of 2017 we worked with Carbon Smart to verify the measurement of our energy consumption, and associated Externally Verified 9.5% greenhouse gas GHG emissions.
At the end Group scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions reduction in Group water consumption of the verification process we were very byCarbonSmart compared to 2015 pleased to receive limited verification of our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for 2016, as well as for 2015, our baseline year.
In 2016, we set ourselves a new Group target to reduce total energy intensity 3.2% 10.4% by 5% by the end of 2020.
Our chosen reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 reduction in energy intensity measure of energy intensity is energy GHG emissionscompared to 2015 compared to 2015 consumption divided by value added, where value added is defined as operating profit before depreciation and employee 1 costs.
In 2016 our energy intensity was 6394 GJ per million, a fall of 10.4% from 2.5% 90% the 2015 figure of 7135 GJ per million.
