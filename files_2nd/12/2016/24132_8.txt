Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 14 Dedicated to Meeting Our Commitments Safety and support of the workforce The sustainability of our Company relies first and foremost on our people: their safety, health and wellbeing, personal and professional growth, and workplace satisfaction.
We recognise that we fell short of our own expectations and the needs of our people in 2016, with an unacceptable fatality rate.
Our management systems and organisational effectiveness programmes are increasingly centred on personnel safety, with zero tolerance for violations.
As a result, our local sustainability investments in peso terms will continue to rise.
