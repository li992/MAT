GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION BOARD COMMITTEES REPORTS CONTINUED THE SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT Dear Shareholder I am pleased to introduce the Sustainability Committees report on its annual activities.
Sustainability remains an integral part of Pennons strategy, and the Group continues to take this responsibility very seriously in all its business and operational practices.
Our investment and our commitment to high levels of service and performance will contribute to meeting our communities long-term needs for water, energy and waste management.
The role of the Sustainability Committee is to bring together and review initiatives that drive sustainability, to approve targets and to monitor the progress made in achieving Pennons strategic sustainability objectives.
Those objectives are set out on page 72.
The implementation of the new governance structure as explained on page 62 was introduced formally on 1 April 2016, and we have been pleased to welcome two South West Water non-executive directors to the Committee.
Neil Cooper stood down from the Committee on 1 April 2016.
We continue to apply the best practice framework published by Business in the Community BitC, a leading business-led charity that promotes responsible business, and use the structure provided through BitCs key areas of sustainability marketplace, workplace, community and environment for reviewing our programmes and the performance of both South West Water and Viridor as they work to achieve the highest standards of corporate responsibility.
On pages 10 and 11 we show how a thorough approach to sustainability helps us to draw together the needs of society with the delivery of commercial success.
This theme is expanded upon by Chris Loughlin in his Group Chief Executives review, which explains how the Groups strategy of investment for growth allows us to deliver for the benefit of our customers, the environment and the communities we serve, as well as build shareholder value.
Details and examples of how South West Water and Viridor are implementing this strategy are provided in the sections on Customers and Communities and Our Environment.
We are pleased to note the results in both businesses, which confirm sustainability is indeed integrated in all we do.
