MARKET DYNAMICS Successive tax increases over the past few years continue to impact the overall market size in Germany and we estimate that the total tobacco market in 2005 was down by 4 per cent to 144 billion cigarette equivalents 2004: 150 billion.
The cigarette market decreased by 15 per cent to 101 billion cigarettes partially offset by strong growth in other tobacco products, up by 39 per cent, as consumers sought value brands and products.
Reflecting this trend, the low price branded cigarette sector continued to grow and accounted for 7.5 per cent of cigarette sales in September 2005.
The third and final stage of the current round of tobacco tax increases was introduced in September 2005, following those in March and December 2004.
We passed on this tax increase to consumers which, for the majority of our cigarette portfolio, entailed reducing pack sizes from 19 to 17 cigarettes and lowering prices by 20 euro cents.
In the case between the German Government and the European Court of Justice ECJ regarding the taxation of the Singles make your own product category, the Advocate General published his opinion in July stating that the Singles category should no longer be taxed as fine cut tobacco but at the same higher rate as cigarettes.
The ruling of the ECJ is expected on 10 November 2005.
OUR PERFORMANCE Despite a challenging trading environment, operating profit rose by 24 per cent to 295 million, due to growth in our cigarette share, increased other tobacco product volumes, price increases and the benefits of cost efficiencies in both manufacturing and trading.
We were pleased with the growth in our cigarette share up to 19.4 per cent 2004: 18.9 per cent.
The market share development of JPS was particularly impressive with the brand capturing 1.7 per cent of the cigarette market in the 18 months since its launch, finishing the year at 2.8 per cent.
Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant and R1 all continued to perform well in the premium sector and West remained the second largest cigarette brand in Germany with market share of 8.5 per cent.
Within other tobacco products our volumes have grown strongly, largely driven by the growth in Singles, up by 36 per cent, although our annual market share in this sector declined to 24.2 per cent as a result of increased competitor activity.
In the second half our share stabilised reflecting good performances from JPS and the recently launched Fairwind.
OUTLOOK The German market will continue to be challenging and particularly if the awaited ECJ ruling is adverse, but we have prepared a variety of portfolio responses depending on the outcome.
Our flexible approach has ensured the improving profitability of our operations in Germany and we believe that this flexibility, combined with our broad product portfolio and our strength in value cigarettes and other tobacco products, will continue to mean we are well positioned.
