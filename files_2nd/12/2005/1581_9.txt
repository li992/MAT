Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility The company endeavours to be honest and fair in its relationships with customers and suppliers and to be a good corporate citizen respecting the laws of the countries in which the company operates.
While the company is accountable to its shareholders, the company also endeavours to take into account the interests of all of the companys stakeholders, including its employees, customers and suppliers, and the local communities and environments in which the company operates.
As a result the company takes regular account of the significance of social, environmental and ethical matters to the business of the company.
Sushovan Hussain, Finance and Board Director, has been appointed by the Board as the Director responsible for all matters relating to corporate social, ethical, employment and environmental policies.
The Board has adopted an ethics policy which sets forth procedures for communication of staff issues.
The Board is committed to monitoring the companys corporate social responsibility policies in key areas.
Through monitoring of day-to-day activities by management the company is able to assess risks in these areas and identify actions that may be taken to address these risks.
Whilst specific targets in these areas have not yet been set given the companys relatively small size and operations, as monitoring continues the Board will consider the setting of specific targets.
At present, the Board does not consider it appropriate to link the management of these risks to remuneration incentives, given the difficulties in objectively measuring the changes to those risks.
Given the company's relatively small size and low social and environmental impact, the company believes that there are few risks to its short and long term value arising from these matters.
The Board believes the company has adequate information to assess these matters, and effective systems for managing any risks.
The companys website includes a section dedicated to corporate ethical, employment and environmental issues.
Whilst the Board considers that material risks arising from social, ethical, employment and environmental issues are limited, given the nature of the companys business, policies have been adopted in key areas to ensure that such risks are limited.
Examples of policies and practices in these areas are given below.
Employment Policies Autonomy employs over 800 people and in order to continue to grow as a business, the company needs to continue to recruit and retain only the best talent.

This policy includes, where practicable, the continued employment of those who may become disabled during their employment.
The companys policies strive to ensure that all decisions about the appointment, treatment and promotion of employees are based entirely on merit.
Environmental Policies It is the companys policy to ensure, by encouraging environmental best practice in the business, that its operations have as little environmental impact as is consistent with its business needs.

Outmoded office equipment and computers are resold or recycled to the extent practicable 17 Autonomy Corporation plc Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility The company recognises the increasing importance of environmental issues and these are discussed at board level if appropriate.
A number of initiatives have commenced in 2005.
An environmental action plan is implemented at group and departmental level through various initiatives.
These include monitoring resource consumption and waste creation so that when targets are set for improvement they are realistic and meaningful, ensuring existing controls continue to operate satisfactorily and working with suppliers to improve environmental management along the supply chain.

Renewable energy sources are also being investigated.
The provision of cycle sheds, showers and changing facilities at the companys Cambridge and San Francisco offices facilitate greener commuting, and the extensive provision of telephone and video conferencing equipment offer an alternative to international travel, where appropriate.
