TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Corporate responsibility statement For the year ended 31 December 2005 The company has not produced a separate corporate responsibility statement in the report and accounts since it believes these matters are sufficiently important to receive the personal attention of individual directors rather than risking less focus through the exercise of collective responsibility.
Instead full details of those areas normally covered by such a report are contained in the reports of the directors responsible for such matters: Environment chief executives review: Health and safety chief operating officers report: Supply chain chief operating officers report: Employees chief operating officers report: Community relations chief executives review.
The board takes account of the significance of social, environmental and ethical matters in its conduct of the companys business and, as part of the system of internal control, receives reports on the risks associated with the above matters.
