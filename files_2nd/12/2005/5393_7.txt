38 Social responsibility We believe it is important to run our company in a way which benefits the wider community as well as our shareholders, artists and employees.
We are committed to transparency in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility CSR and publish a full social responsibility report every year, which is made available on our website.
EMI continues to be included in both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and FTSE4Good.
This year, we achieved the number two and a best in classranking respectively in two European surveys of the media sector that were undertaken by socially responsible investment organisations Oekom and Storebrand.
We were also named as one of The Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For and one of Management Todays Most Admired Companies for 2004.
The UKs Media CSR Forum, in which we have played an active role since its inception, has helped identify and define some of the key CSR issues for our sector.
We will be using the findings of that work to develop our CSR programme going forward.
Employment Our Social responsibility policy includes the key points of our employment policy framework equal opportunity, health and safety, open communication and fair reward.
Responsibility for management of employment matters rests with each business operation within that framework.
We promote five key values in the company: creativity, integrity, accountability, adaptability and empowerment.
Our Standards of Business Conduct reinforce aspects of integrity and accountability and are distributed across the company.
Creative businesses such as ours rely strongly on their people.
We are working hard to ensure that our investment in staff mirrors our investment in artists by building for the long term.
Two good examples of this are EMI Music UK and the Christian Music Group in the US, where all staff on the senior management teams have come up through the company.
For the second year running, EMI Music UK was named as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For in an annual survey by The Sunday Times, moving up to 39th from 73rd position.
The results are based on independent and confidential employee surveys covering a range of workplace issues: EMI was ranked in the top 10 for leadership, finding work stimulating and being proud to work for the company.
We believe that EMI continues to expand its worldwide management development programme, seeking out the talented people in the business and providing targeted workshops and our investment in development support.
Approximately 15% of our executives received training this year in areas such as leadership and global thinking.
These worldwide programmes are in staff should mirror addition to the training individual operating companies provide for their staff.
our investment Our executive review programme, a formal performance management system first introduced three years ago, has now achieved a global uptake of over 90% and in artists building ensures that individual performance targets are set collaboratively with managers and are aligned to business strategy.
It also drives training and development plans and is for the long term.

39 During the year, we had 19 reportable injuries illnesses 4.4 per 1,000 employees based on UK standards and an average of 3.3 days absence from illness per employee.
We did not incur any health and safety enforcement notices or convictions.
Community Our commitment to supporting music education and access to music produced a number of new initiatives during the year.
In the UK, we continued our involvement in the development and implementation of the governments Music Manifesto, a strategy to enhance music provision in schools and the wider community.
The Manifesto was launched by government ministers at Abbey Road Studios in July 2004, together with Sir George Martin and EMI artist Jamelia.
Together with Yamaha, the BBC, The Princes Trust and the Music Manifesto, EMI also became a partner in Lloyds TSBs Note for Note a new community-related marketing initiative launched by the UK bank.
Note for Notes aim is to bring more music to schools nationwide: it will raise funds by inviting Lloyds TSB current account customers to round down their credit balance to the nearest pound each month or donate via their debit card.
Customers can nominate up to two schools to receive their donations or choose the Music Boost Fund, which supports schools facing challenging circumstances.
Schools can use the money raised for in-school workshops, Yamaha instruments and concert tickets and Lloyds TSB has committed 10m over the next three years to subsidise these offers.
As part of our contribution to the programme, we produced Bringing Music to your Classroom, a DVD designed to be a useful teaching aid, which was sent to all 29,000 primary and secondary schools in Great Britain.
It includes Simon Rattles version of Brittens A Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra and a collection of interviews and videos from 12 of our classical and crossover artists.
EMI Classics UKs artist Keedie was on hand at the Note for Note launch, performing and working with young primary Keedie school pupils.
The EMI Music Sound Foundation see below is administering the EMI Classics artist programmes Music Boost Fund.
Keedie with school children in London The EMI Music Sound Foundation, the independent charity we established in 1997, as part of the Note for Note scheme.
has now awarded a total of 2.3m to boost music education in the UK.
The Foundation is the largest single sponsor of specialist performing arts schools and is now extending its support to the new category of specialist music schools: it also makes grants for instruments and training to individuals and to non-specialist schools as well as funding seven annual bursaries at music colleges in the UK and Ireland.
More information can be found on www.
Teach First is a new UK programme that recruits top university graduates to teach for two years in under-resourced secondary schools, while also preparing them to succeed as long-term leaders in careers both inside and outside of education.
In its first two years, it is estimated that the programme has made a positive impact on tens of thousands of pupils across 65 London schools.
EMI is involved in several ways: providing support to Teach First in adding music teachers to the programme and then providing networking and industry engagement opportunities for them: offering participants summer work placements: and providing business and career coaching to second year participants as they decide what to do next.
In the US, EMI Music equipped a recording studio at the Bronx House in New York, a Music for Youth facility that runs an innovative after-school music programme.
Having studio hardware and software installed on site will enable the young people who use Bronx House to do more than just learn about other peoples music now they can explore their creativity through making and recording their own music.
40 EMI in the US was also involved with the Grammy Jazz Ensembles Programme.
In association with this years Grammy awards, 29 talented high school students from the US and Canada travelled to Los Angeles where they met and performed with Grammy-nominated artists.
The week included a recording session at EMIs Capitol Studios.
While they were there, EMI Gospel artist and Grammy winner Smokie Norful paid them a visit to share some of his knowledge and experience.

Smokie Norful Health and welfare is another area we support through our community investment and Grammy winner Smokie Norful with high school during the year we developed a partnership with UNICEF, the international childrens music students.
Initially this was through Unity, the official album of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.
In association with our release of this CD, EMI Music donated 100,000 to support HIV AIDS work in sub-Saharan Africa.
In January, EMI staff and South African artist Mzwakhe Mbuli joined a UNICEF team on a field trip to Swaziland, to see at first hand how UNICEF uses music and performance arts as a crucial education tool in the fight against HIV AIDS.
We worked with UNICEF again after the devastating tsunami in Asia, setting up a scheme to match worldwide employee donations.
The combination of staff giving, EMIs matching and an initial corporate donation raised more than 230,000 to help with both immediate relief and longer-term development in the affected areas.
To mark the untimely death of South African icon and EMI artist Brenda Fassie, EMI released worldwide a greatest hits compilation spanning her 20-year career.
All profits were donated to 46664, the HIV AIDS education and research arm of the Nelson Mandela Foundation.
EMI Australia has embraced community involvement as a key part of its social Unity responsibility programme and this year launched department community days.
In association with the release By year end, 75% of the companys departments had completed a day working of the Unity album, EMI donated together in the community and the remaining departments had identified their charity 100,000 to UNICEF.
Beneficiaries ranged from a telephone online counselling service for young people and a childrens hospice to habitat preservation and restoration groups.
EMIs worldwide charitable cash donations for the year were 1.0m: this was complemented by additional community investment from participation in industry fundraising events around the world, arts sponsorship, staff time and gifts in kind.
Based on our UK operations, we continued to achieve the PerCent Standard, a benchmark designed to recognise companies that invest a minimum of 1% of their pre-tax profits in the community.
Environment We completed our exit from manufacturing in Europe and the US in June 2004.
This leaves us with just two plants, in Japan and Canada, and a significant reduction in the environmental impacts that we can manage directly.
As an example, our worldwide energy use dropped 44% compared to the previous year, almost entirely due to our exit from CD manufacturing.
