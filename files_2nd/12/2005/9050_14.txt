SIDNEY SHEARS, customer The timescale for turning off water to carry out planned maintenance work has been reduced from 36 to 12 hours, with further reductions targeted.
The pilot has now been rolled out regionally with a substantial increase in levels of customer trust and satisfaction.
In March 2005, Yorkshire Water organised a national conference to stimulate discussion about the future of customer service in the water industry.
Senior figures from other water companies, customer service organisations and industry regulators attended the event which was chaired by Pamela Taylor, Chief Executive of Water UK.
There is no doubt that Ofwats existing measures have been extremely successful at driving up levels of customer service in the industry.
We believe that now the regulators recent price review has reached its conclusion, it is the ideal time to look at the possible introduction of more qualitative measures to address not just what level of service companies provide, but how satisfied customers are with the service they receive.
DUE TO OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, only 76 properties in Yorkshire went without water for more than 12 hours 77 during 2004, compared to 683 in 2001.
