Insurance risk: the Group is exposed to insurance risk, either directly through its businesses or through using insurance as a tool to mitigate other risk exposures.
Enterprise risk: the Group separately defines operational and external risk.
Operational risk is defined as the risk arising from the Groups people, processes, systems and assets.
External risk comprises business, political and environmental risk.
Regulatory risk: is the risk arising from failing to meet the requirements and expectations of our many regulators, or from a failure to address or implement any change in these requirements or expectations.
Qualitative and quantitative elements of risk management Risk appetite Risk management across the Group is based on the risk appetite and philosophy set by the Board and the associated risk committees.
The Board establishes the parameters for risk appetite for the Group through: Setting strategic direction.
Contributing to, and ultimately approving annual plans for each division.
Regularly reviewing and monitoring the Groups performance in relation to risk through monthly Board Reports.
The Board delegates the articulation of risk appetite to GEMC and ensures that this is in line with the strategy and the desired risk reward trade off for the Group.
Risk appetite is an expression of the maximum level of residual risk that the Group is prepared to accept in order to deliver its business objectives and is assessed against regular often daily controls and stress testing to ensure that the limits are not compromised in abnormal circumstances.
section Risk appetite is usually defined in both quantitative and 01 qualitative terms.
Whilst different techniques are used to ensure that the Groups risk appetite is achieved, generically they can be classified as follows: Quantitative: encompassing stress testing, risk concentration, value at risk and credit related metrics, including the probability, loss and exposure at default.
Qualitative: focuses on ensuring that the Group applies the correct principles, policies and procedures.
The annual business planning and performance management process and associated activities ensure the expression of risk appetite remains appropriate.
GRC and GALCO support this work.

Operating and financial review Loan impairment The Group classifies impaired assets as either Risk Elements in Lending REIL or Potential Problem Loans PPL.
REIL represents non-accrual loans, loans that are accruing but are past due 90 days and restructured loans.
PPL represent impaired assets which are not included in REIL but where known information about possible credit problems causes management to have serious doubts about the future ability of the borrower to comply with loan repayment terms.
Both REIL and PPL are reported gross of the value of any security held, which could reduce the eventual loss should it occur, and gross of any provision marked.
Therefore impaired assets which are highly collateralised, such as mortgages, will have a low coverage ratio of provisions held against reported impaired balance.
93 The adoption of IAS 39 under IFRS at the start of 2005 resulted in changes to the methodology used to identify impaired assets and therefore the way that REIL is calculated.
Comparative financial information is given in the following tables for both 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2004.
Commentary is based on comparison with information at 1 January 2005, which reflects the impact of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4.

2 Loans where an impairment event has taken place but no impairment recognised.
This category is used for over-collateralised non-revolving credit facilities.
3 Troubled debt restructurings represent loans that have been restructured following the granting of a concession by the Group to the borrower.
4 Loans for which an impairment event has occurred but no impairment provision is necessary.
This category is used for over-collateralised advances and revolving credit facilities where identification as 90 days overdue is not feasible.

REIL as at 31 December 2005 was 5,937 million 1 January 2005 5,888 million, an increase of 49 million 1% during the year.

The lower coverage ratio reflects a change of mix in the portfolios to more secured assets e. g. residential mortgages which, due to the level of collateral held, require a much lower level of provision.

Diversification of funding sources The structure of the Groups balance sheet is managed to maintain substantial diversification, to minimise concentration across its various deposit sources, and to contain the level of reliance on total and net short-term wholesale sources of funds within prudent levels.
As part of the Groups planning process, the forecast structure of the balance sheet is regularly reviewed over the plan horizon and funding strategies and options are developed by Group Treasury and implemented after review and approval by GALCO.
The level of large deposits taken from banks, corporate customers, non-bank financial institutions and other customers, and significant cash outflows therefrom, are also reviewed regularly to monitor concentration and identify any adverse trends.

Political risks caused by political unrest or uncertainty, activity by public interest groups or extremists, and noncompliance with, or changes to, current legislation.
106 Environment risks arising due to demographic, macroeconomic, technical, cultural or environmental change.
Enterprise risk also includes the potential or actual impact on corporate reputation arising from any of the Groups activities.
Enterprise risk management is achieved through monitoring the Groups exposure to direct or indirect loss using a range of policies, procedures, data, analytical tools and reporting techniques.
In particular, Group-wide risk management processes ensure that enterprise risk issues are quickly escalated and resolved, that the risks inherent in new products are fully evaluated, and that emerging external risks are actively monitored.
Operational risk exposures and loss events for each division are captured through monthly Risk and Control returns, which provide details on the change of risk exposures for each risk category in the light of trends and the risk profile of each division.
Regulatory risk Regulatory risk is the risk arising from failing to meet the requirements of our regulators.
To mitigate this risk, the Group is active in various regulatory developments affecting risk, capital and liquidity management.
This includes working with domestic and international trade associations, being active with various regulators, especially the FSA and the main regulatory groups, including the Basel Committee see page 256, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, the EU Commission and US regulators.
