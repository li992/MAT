How we behave Environment and supply chain We have prioritised three environmental issues energy consumption, paper use and recycling and are working on these with 10 of our biggest ofces.
We recognise the potential impact of our purchasing decisions on the environment and also the need to consider the labour standards associated with manufacturing in certain product sectors.
We have introduced ethical and environmental criteria to WPPs Procurement Policy and initiated a corporate responsibility questionnaire through our UK procurement team.
Following the responses of UK suppliers, we have invited a small number to a workshop at which we will pilot the next stage of our engagement process.
Our strategy is to focus on companies where we believe our intervention will have the most impact.
We anticipate that usually this will be by engaging with smalland medium-sized supplier companies that may have had less exposure to corporate responsibility than multinationals and major national companies.
