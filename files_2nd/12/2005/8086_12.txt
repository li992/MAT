Corporate Responsibility At Informa we endeavour to practise our business with integrity, respecting the different cultures, dignity and rights of individuals everywhere we operate.
2005 was the year that Corporate Responsibility CR was formalised at Informa, with the appointment of Mr K Brownlie as CR Director, reporting to Mr P Rigby, Chief Executive.
During 2005 four active sub-committees were formed to address CR issues, covering workplace, marketplace, community and environment.
The head of each of these sub-committees is a member of the CR Committee, along with Messrs Rigby and Brownlie.
The sub-committees meet regularly and have targeted their short, medium and long-term actions, which have been agreed by the CR Committee.
Further details are included within the full 2005 CR Report available on the Groups website at www.
The Company is delighted to have also been awarded the FTSE4Good accolade during 2005.
While significant strides have been made in the area of Corporate Responsibility during 2005, there remains much internal research to complete, including a global staff satisfaction survey being conducted during 2006, many processes and procedures to create and a good deal to articulate both internally and externally over the coming months and years.
We have though completed the first year of formalised CR with a renewed sense of belief in the Groups ability to create positive change for all those involved with Informa.
