Shareholders Review and Outlook ATS Investment Plans Government initiatives to promote individual savings and a growing awareness of the urgent need for more pensions provision pointed to greater future opportunities for financial services companies such as ATS.
These opportunities, along with rapid changes in the way people prefer to buy and manage investments, prompted ATS to invest in technology in order to meet customers current and future needs, while ensuring the continuing excellence of its products and customer service.
This investment in technology and product development will in time allow customers to deal with ATS in the way they choose whether online, by telephone or by mail.
One clear opportunity ahead is the introduction of pensions simplification in April 2006 and the ongoing investment by ATS should prepare it to offer the far broader choice of investments that will be allowed in a pension, including property.

Contributions to investment plans with ATS rose noticeably.
The total value of investment assets held for ATS customers reached a record 1.6bn, up 31% in the year.
Gross cash inflows into ATS products over the last year reached their highest ever level of 224m.
