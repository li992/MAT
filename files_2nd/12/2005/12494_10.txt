The Directives require implementation into the national laws of the EU member states.
The RoHS Directive effectively prohibits the use of certain undesirable substances including lead, cadmium and mercury in electronic and electrical products beginning in July 2006.
The WEEE Directive imposes obligations relating to the collection, recycling and disposal of waste electronic and electrical equipment.
The primary purpose of both Directives is the protection of human health and the environment.
Similar legislation has been proposed in some US states, Canadian provinces, Japan and in China.
A large number of the items distributed by the Group will be affected, as will the products manufactured or assembled by many of the Groups customers.
The Group has dedicated areas of its web sites that provide more information regarding RoHS and WEEE requirements and these can be accessed via www.
