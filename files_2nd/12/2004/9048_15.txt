YORKSHIRE WATER'S DEVELOPMENT OF CENSAR MICROTECHNOLOGY, which can detect tiny fluctuations in quality as water flows through underground mains, has won a prestigious international award from the Pipeline Industries Guild.
The award, for significant contribution to utility pipeline technology is only the second time the Guild has presented the accolade.
The Censar devices were first used to monitor water quality in areas with a history of discolouration but the technology has since been put to even greater use in areas where the company has been carrying out mains rehabilitation work or responding to bursts.
This has benefited tens of thousands of customers.
