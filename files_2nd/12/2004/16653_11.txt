The allocations were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of Cookson shares on the day before the awards were made.
Allocations to Messrs Cozzani, Howard and Millard were made on 24 June 2004 and to Mr Salmon on 29 July 2004.
Cooksons mid-market closing price on these dates was 42.75p and 34.5p respectively.
The performance criteria which apply to the vesting of these share allocations are summarised on page 32.
It has been agreed that Mr Howard will retain the allocation of Performance Shares made to him in 2004 under the LTIP.
Should the award vest he will be eligible to receive a pro-rata award based upon the length of his participation in the plan, i. e. ten months to 4 November 2004.
As the LTIP was only introduced in 2004, no LTIP interests existed at 1 January 2004.
MTI Plan allocations Under the MTI Plan, executives were eligible to receive a bonus paid partly in cash and partly in deferred shares based upon the achievement of target financial performance, measured over a three-year period.
The executive Directors have not participated in any new cycles of the MTI Plan since 2003.
For existing cycles, performance targets based on either the Groups cumulative profit or cumulative profit and cash flow performance were set by the Committee for each three-year MTI Plan period.
The achievement of target financial performance under the MTI Plan is rewarded with a mix of cash and deferred shares.
The MTI Plan operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle will culminate at the end of 2005.
On 31 December 2003 awards vested under the 2001-2003 MTI Plan cycle.
Executive Directors received a bonus payable partly in cash and partly in deferred shares based upon achievement against Group profit and cash flow targets.
Details of these awards were included in the 2003 Annual Report.
These deferred shares are due to vest on 31 December 2005.
For the period 2002-2004, the MTI Plan performance measures for the executive Directors were based half on profit and half on cash flow targets.
Group results were below the target performance levels for profit and cash flow set by the Committee and therefore no payouts were made under this cycle of the MTI Plan.
Interests under this cycle of the MTI Plan have therefore lapsed.
