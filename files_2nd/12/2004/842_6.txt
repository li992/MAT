Sustainability Sustainability, or corporate responsibility, is a management approach that takes into account the broad and long-term interests of stakeholders, as well as shorter-term profitability.
AMEC started reporting on sustainability in 2000, when we drew up seven sustainability principles: environmental management, health and safety, ethical conduct, community involvement, human rights, employment rights and profitable growth.
These are now the heart of our companys Guiding Principles and we measure our performance annually in each area.
We have made progress since then, improving our own performance against the targets we set ourselves.
We also moved up the latest published Business in the Environment ranking, scoring 78 per cent in 2003 against 39 per cent in our first year.
In February 2005, AMEC appointed a dedicated manager, who now drives the sustainability programme across the group.
