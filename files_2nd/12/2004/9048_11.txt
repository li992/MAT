How we go about our business.
Keldas approach to corporate social responsibility CSR is founded on the principle that the interests of the environment, customers and society at large are best served through the efficient, effective and proper operation of our business.
This is achieved through a clear strategic focus on providing excellent customer service, strong financial and environmental performance and by effectively managing the relationships we have with our people, service providers and society.
Successful progress in each of these areas provides benefits for all.
Over the last year, we are pleased that Keldas contribution has been externally recognised through various benchmarking indexes, including Business in the Communitys BitC own Corporate Responsibility Index.
This external recognition, together with an expanded corporate responsibility section on our website, will create further opportunities for our customers, investors and stakeholders to learn more about what we do in this area and the targets we have set for the future.
