&DUERQ DYRLGDQFH Our key performance measures for environmental sustainability are our recycling and recovery rate and thecarbon avoidance our facilities provide through their activities.
We also measure our environmental sustainability performance across a much wider range of measures, fromfull carbon footprints by country of operation and significant emissions from our facilities.
Full details of these wider environmental measures andother measures referred to below, can be found inourannual Corporate Responsibility Report and wider environmental indicators document, both of which are available on our website.

$FFLGHQW UDWH Health and safety is our primary concern and we are actively managing and measuring our accident rate.
Waste management is a high-risk sector with accident rates equivalent to those found in the construction and agricultural industries so ongoing focus is required in this area.
Beyond these basic measures of health and safety performance, we have awider commitment to our people, to their development and their right towork in an environment which is free from discrimination and where theirtalents are used to the full.
All of our people need to be competent inthetasks they perform to ensure that we both achieve our sustainability targets and comply with the varied and strict regulation in the waste management industry.
&RPSODLQWV UHFHLYHG Sustainable waste management operations provide a benefit to society.
Weare more than aware that for those people living in the communities nearto our facilities these benets maybe obscured if we fail to control the potential nuisance from our sites.
Such communities are a key stakeholder group for us and it is for this reason that the number of complaints received isa key performance measure for Shanks.
We also have many more stakeholder groups including shareholders, customers and environmental groups.
We take communication with these groups seriously and have a structured approach to engaging with them.
