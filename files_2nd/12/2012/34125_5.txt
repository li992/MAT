With 66 easy to find, high profile locations around the UK, we have an unrivalled portfolio of stores across London, the South East and large metropolitan cities.
Our customers like our modern, highly visible, purpose built stores which are situated in safe and easily accessible locations.
Since last year end we have opened four new stores in Eltham, Stockport, New Cross and Chiswick, situated next to the M4 flyover leading into London.
These great locations also contribute to our growing awareness for our service and brand.
Very helpful staff who were happy to look at our requirements in terms of accessibility, price and offer advice on what we needed.
We would not hesitate to recommend to others.
Great locations, clean and well lit.
