We undertook a second compliance 7.4 7.2 audit in 2012, conrming that considerable progress had been made during 2011.
We will continue with annual audits with a focus on bringing all regions up to the same standard.

In addition many of the days lost during 2012 were due to an injury which happened How we did in 2012 in 2011.
Our rate of lost working day injuries LWDIs 246 fell signicantly in 2012.

By this measure our safety 134 performance only improved slightly though the numbers are distorted by the inclusion of 68 agency staff for the first time this year.
Thus 36 overall we saw a similar number of injuries but the consequences were less serious.

The effluent from both has to meet a range of limits: for South Carolina actual 2012 performance is shown as a percentage of the permitted value below.

These were all minor incidents which were quickly remedied.
In addition the pH of the discharge was within the permitted range of 6 to 9: there is also a minimum dissolved oxygen requirement which was comfortably exceeded.
For the Czech Republic we have limits for concentration and quantity.
Most values were slightly lower than in 2011.

In South Carolina these relate to the waste treatment operation for ammonia and a wood-fired boiler for opacity and particulates: Ammonia Particulates 0% 50% 100% The opacity limit was also met with an average half the permit value.
In the Czech Republic the performance of the boilers against consents was: Carbon monoxide Nitrogen oxides 0% 50% 100% The carbon monoxide figure increased compared to the previous year but nitrogen oxides were almost unchanged.
We plan to change our reporting format in 2013 to comply with the new Greenhouse Gas Regulations.
