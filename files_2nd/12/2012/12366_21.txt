Risk management activities continued A summary of option activity under the Plan for the year ended 31 December 2012 is presented below: The Group has certain share-based payment awards, issued in 2010, which currently vest in line with the Companys weighted Weighted average share price from December 2012 to June 2013 against a xed target for further details see Note 32.
Based on the Weighted average Weighted average fair value of average Companys share price in the equivalent six month period to 31 December 2012 then these awards are not dilutive for the exercise price awards per remaining purposes of calculating diluted EPS and accordingly, both basic and diluted EPS are identical for the year ended per share, share, US contractual 31 December 2012.

The dilutive effect of equity-settled share appreciation rights Forfeited 345,000 has been calculated using the treasury stock method.
Share-based payments None of the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2012 were exercisable as they are not fully vested.
For the year ended In 2010, the Group established an equity incentive plan the Plan for executive directors and senior employees of the Group 31 December 2012, share-based compensation in the amount of US$54 million, 2011: US$57 million was recognised in in which the grant of equity-settled share appreciation rights up to 30 million shares in JSC Polymetal the Bonus Fund was general, administrative and selling expenses in the consolidated income statement see Note 11. approved.
The number of awards to which a qualifying participant is entitled was determined by the board of JSC Polymetal on 8 November 2010.
Group management believes that such awards better align the interests of its employees with those As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group had US$24.7 million and US$75.7 million, respectively of of its shareholders.
unrecognised share-based compensation expense related to non-vested equity-settled stock appreciated rights with a weighted average expected amortisation period of 0.45 years and 1.45 years, respectively.
Under the terms of the plan these awards were eligible for immediate vesting on the Group restructuring and listing.
However, the executive directors and senior managers waived that right and the entitlement to JSC Polymetal shares was exchanged for 33.
Related Parties an entitlement to Polymetal International shares on a one to one basis with the same vesting conditions as existed previously.
Related parties are considered to include shareholders, afliates, associates, joint ventures and entities under common As the cancellation and reissuance of the awards was done solely to preserve the existing rights of the award holders, no ownership and control with the Group and members of key management personnel.
In the course of its business the Group accelerated share-based charge has been recognised.
entered into various transactions with Nomos-Bank an entity in which Alexander Nesis, a significant shareholder of the Company Note 1, also holds a substantial interest, equity method investments and its employees and ofcers as follows: The aggregate number of shares comprising the Bonus Fund will be determined on 11 June 2013 and will depend on the excess Year ended of the weighted average price of the Companys shares during the period between 11 December 2012 and 11 June 2013 over 31 December 31 December a target price of US$16.74.
If the average share price is below the target gure there will be nil vesting.
The weighted average 2012 2011 price of the Companys shares during the period between 1 July 2012 and 31 December 2012 was US$16.45.

The fair value determined is then recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Use of two-stage MonteExpenses from transactions with related parties Carlo option pricing requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
The following Interest expense on loans provided by Nomos-Bank 2,016 2,339 assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value: Purchases from equity method investments 3,035 Q Expected forfeitures.
This assumption is estimated using historical trends of executive Director and employee turnover.
Lease payments to Nomos Leasing 5,082 As the Group typically only grants awards to senior employees and the turnover rate for such employees is minimal, the Group has estimated expected forfeitures to be 5%.
Estimated forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent Outstanding balances owed to or from related parties at 31 December 2012 are presented below: actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates.
Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognised in the 31 December 31 December period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognised in future periods.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on an analysis of the historical stock price volatility of the US$000 US$000 JSC Polymetal GDRs from February 2007, when the JSC Polymetal GDRs became publicly traded.
Short-term loans provided to equity method investments 11,792 315 Q Expected life.
The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option of 3.6 years.

The risk-free rate is based on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the Total loans provided by related parties, unsecured 27,967 35,401 expected life assumed at the date of grant.
Accounts receivable from related parties 4,717 2,940 At the grant date, the Group had not historically declared dividends and management believed the Company would not declare Interest receivable from related parties 836 1,573 a dividend over the life of the option.
As such, the expected annual dividend per share was therefore nil.
Any subsequent change in dividend policy will be taken into account when valuing options granted in the future.
Carrying values of other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 approximate their fair values.
Details of the significant terms of the loans provided by related parties are disclosed in Note 25.
