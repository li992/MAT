Health and safety We recognise the importance of ensuring that our properties provide a safe and healthy environment for our tenants, staff and all other users.
A firm of specialist consultants is retained to undertake risk assessments on a 12 to 18 month cycle on all property for which we have responsibility.
Any issues which arise from such assessments are allocated to the responsible surveyor for action: a dedicated team ensures that all issues are dealt with on a timely basis and also monitors performance and compliance.
Health and safety policies are formulated by our consultants and monitored by senior staff.
Each and every staff member has a health and safety responsibility at some level.
A report is prepared and presented annually at Board and senior management level to ensure that those ultimately responsible for health and safety within the Group are fully briefed on issues arising and any actions required.
In addition, we employ a variety of specialist consultants to ensure that specific areas such as lifts, gas and electrical supply are correctly maintained in a safe condition.
