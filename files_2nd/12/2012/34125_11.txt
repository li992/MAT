23 Report on Corporate Governance Introduction The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code that was issued in 2010 by the Financial Reporting Council the Code for which the Board is accountable to shareholders.
The Board also takes account of the corporate governance guidelines of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Statement of compliance with the Code Throughout the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in section 1 of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code.
Statement about applying the principles of the Code The Company has applied the principles set out in the Code, including both the main principles and the supporting principles, by complying with the Code as reported above.
Further explanation of how the principles and supporting principles have been applied is set out below and in the Directors Remuneration Report and Audit Committee Report.
The Board of Directors The Directors believe it is essential for the Group to be led and controlled by an effective Board that provides entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of sound controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed.
The Board is responsible for setting the Groups strategic aims, its values and standards and ensuring the necessary financial and human resources are in place to achieve its goals.
The Board ensures that its obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are understood and met.
The Board also regularly reviews the performance of management.
The Board currently consists of nine Directors: four Executives and five Non-Executives.
The Board considers Tim Clark, Mark Richardson, Steve Johnson and Jonathan Short to be wholly independent and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement throughout the year.
Jonathan Short is considered an independent Non-Executive, even though he has served on the Board for twelve years, exceeding the Code recommended limit.
This was concluded after considering his integrity and the effectiveness with which he carries out his responsibilities to the Company.
Jonathan Short is retiring as a Director at the Companys AGM in July.
The Board does not consider that Philip Burks is an independent Non-Executive, given that he is a co-founder of the Group and was an Executive Director from September 1998 until March 2007.
Tim Clark is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
All of the Non-Executive Directors bring considerable knowledge, judgement and experience to Board deliberations.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Companys share option or bonus schemes and their service is non-pensionable.
Philip Burks has legacy LTIPs from his time as an Executive Director.
The Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to communicate directly with Executive Directors between formal Board meetings.
The Non-Executive Directors meet at least once a year without the Executive Directors being present.
Details of the Board and its principal committees are set out below.
All of the Committees are authorised to obtain legal or other professional advice as necessary, to secure where appropriate the attendance of external advisers at its meetings and to seek information required from any employee of the Company in order to perform its duties.
Attendance at meetings of the individual Directors at the Board and for the members of the Committees that they were eligible to attend is shown in the table below: Director Position Board Audit Remuneration Nominations Philip Burks Non-Executive Director 6 6 Tim Clark Non-Executive Director 6 6 3 3 4 4 1 1 James Gibson Chief Executive Officer 6 6 Steve Johnson Non-Executive Director 6 6 3 3 4 4 1 1 Adrian Lee Operations Director 6 6 Mark Richardson Non-Executive Director 6 6 3 3 4 4 1 1 Jonathan Short Non-Executive Director 6 6 3 3 4 4 1 1 John Trotman Chief Financial Officer 6 6 Nicholas Vetch Executive Chairman 6 6 The Board meets approximately once every two months to discuss a whole range of significant matters including strategic decisions, major asset acquisitions and performance.
A procedure to enable Directors to take independent professional advice if required has been agreed by the Board and formally confirmed by all Directors.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Boards attention including the approval of Group strategy and policies, major acquisitions and disposals, major capital projects and financing, Group budgets and material contracts entered into other than in the normal course of business.
The Board also considers matters of non-financial risk as part of its review of the Groups risk register.
At each Board meeting the latest available financial information is produced which consists of detailed management accounts with the relevant comparisons to budget.
A current trading appraisal is given by the Executive Directors.
24 Re-election of Directors In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors are submitting themselves for re-election at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, with the exception of Jonathan Short who is retiring at the Annual General Meeting.
The biographical details of the Directors of the Group are set out on page 57.
In the event of a proposal to appoint a new Director, this would be discussed at a full Board meeting, with each member being given the opportunity to meet the individual concerned prior to any formal decision being taken.
Chairman and Chief Executive The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and encompasses the following parameters: the Chairmans role is to provide continuity, experience, governance and strategic advice, while the Chief Executive provides leadership, drives the day-to-day operations of the business, and works with the Chairman on overall strategy: the Chairman, working with the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, is viewed by investors as the ultimate steward of the business and the guardian of the interests of all the shareholders: the Board believes that the Chairman and the Chief Executive work together to provide effective and complementary stewardship: the Chairman must: take overall responsibility for the composition and capability of the Board: and consult regularly with the Chief Executive and be available on a flexible basis for providing advice, counsel and support to the Chief Executive.
the Chief Executive must: manage the Executive Directors and the Groups day-to-day activities: prepare and present to the Board strategic options for growth in shareholder value: set the operating plans and budgets required to deliver agreed strategy: and ensure that the Group has in place appropriate risk management and control mechanisms.
Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.
They are required to satisfy themselves on the integrity of the financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible.
They are responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration for Executive Directors and have a prime role in appointing and, where necessary, removing Executive Directors, and in succession planning.
Performance evaluation Each year the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committee and its individual members.
During the year, the Chairman evaluated the performance of the Executive Directors, and the performance of the Chairman was evaluated by the Senior Independent NonExecutive Director.
It was considered that the individuals, the Committees and the Board as a whole were operating effectively, with appropriate procedures put in place for minor areas identified for improvement.
The Board has noted the recommendations of the new Code, and intends to appoint a facilitator during the year ending 31 March 2013 to perform an external evaluation of the Boards effectiveness and procedures, and those of its Committees.
Given Jonathan Short is retiring from the Board in July 2012, and will be replaced by Richard Cotton as an independent Non-Executive Director, the Board decided to delay the external evaluation until these changes had occurred.
With the exception of Jonathan Short, all of the Non-Executive Directors are being proposed for election at the Annual General Meeting.
Following the performance evaluation above, the Committee has determined that their performance is effective, and that they demonstrated commitment to the role.
Information and professional development All Directors are provided with detailed financial information throughout the year.
On a weekly basis they receive a detailed occupancy report showing the performance of each of the Groups open stores.
Management accounts are circulated to the Board monthly, and a detailed Board pack is distributed a week prior to each Board meeting.
All Directors are kept informed of changes in relevant legislation and changing commercial risks with the assistance of the Companys legal advisers and auditors where appropriate.
During the year under review, this has included consideration of Directors responsibilities and an update on developments in the Code.
The professional development requirements of Executive Directors are identified and progressed as part of each individuals annual appraisal.
All new Directors are provided with a full induction programme on joining the Board.
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to attend seminars and undertake external training at the Companys expense in areas they consider to be appropriate for their own professional development.
Each year, the programme of senior management meetings is tailored to enable meetings to be held at the Companys properties.
During the year, the senior management team made visits to all of the Groups open stores.
Standing committees of the Board The Board has Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each of which has written terms of reference.
They deal clearly with the authorities and duties of each Committee and are formally reviewed annually.
Copies of these terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
Each of these Committees is comprised of Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company who are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.
The Chairman of each Committee reports the outcome of the meetings to the Board.
The Company Secretary is secretary to each Committee.
