However, the environmental excellence is underlined by the intention to have all the sites environmental impact of the polymers studied had reduced signicantly at present in the Group, accredited to ISO 14001 by the end of 2014. since the first study: a 5% reduction in overall global warming potential since 1999: and even higher reductions in the total primary energy used, ranging Whilst the releases which are most likely to have an impact on the from a 15% reduction for SBR polymers to 20% for pure acrylic or vinyl environment are recorded in the graphs presented in this report, we monitor acetate polymers.
For Synthomer in particular, the LCI study showed that a number of other measures internally.
All of these other measures also our products gave results which are either better than or at the same level show very significant improvement over the last 10 years and most are as the industrial average.
This positive result for Synthomer is no reason continuing to improve year on year.
As examples: our releases of nitrogen for complacency and we continue to work on reducing our future oxides to air have fallen by more than 70% per production tonne since environmental impact both as an end in itself and to keep up with 2000: our releases of phosphorous to water have fallen by over 90% since improvements in our industry in general.
2000: and our releases of heavy metals are down from 4.5 gm tonne to 0.096 gm tonne, a better than 97% reduction.
These have been achieved by investment in better systems for environmental control: the development of better processes: better process control focusing on avoiding releases and other losses: and incremental improvement in the operational systems on our sites.
All of this is underpinned by the performance of our site staff, who have driven improvement and whose aims are to produce better quality product, using more carefully husbanded resources, whilst producing less waste.

To this end we have signed a long-term contract to buy electricity from Drax power station in the UK After examining different options, a scheme to recover a large proportion of which already uses over a million tonnes of biomass as fuel, reducing its net the VOCs released from the NBR plant at Kluang was developed in 2010 11 CO production by nearly 2 million tonnes in 2011.
Drax will fully convert one and the equipment was installed in 2012.
This equipment, costing some 2 of its six combustion units to biomass in 2013, reducing their net releases.
12 million, is now being commissioned and is designed to recover over We also recognise that the electricity supplies we use in different countries 65% of the VOCs being released by the Kluang NBR plant.
This will lead to have different thermal efficiencies and rates of CO production.
In line with very significant further reductions in VOC release during 2013, once the 2 the UK Governments requirement for full reporting of Greenhouse Gas recovery plant is running.
This scheme will be followed, hopefully also during GHG Emissions from next year, we are exploring more accurate ways of 2013, by a further scheme which will burn the residual VOCs with full energy calculating our GHG emissions, given the wide range of countries in which recovery, to give a plant with low overall VOC releases.

The key measures suggested were energy use, emissions to air, waste disposal and water consumption, on an absolute and a per tonne basis.
Synthomer has reported on these indicators for a number of years, and to aid transparency in environmental reporting we adopted DEFRAs preferred format in 2008 for the report on our 2007 performance.
This format is used in the table below which gives the data for the period 2010-2012.
Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport.
Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel.
They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc.
Re-examination of the Companys VOC emissions has shown that the gure was signicantly overstated in 2011.
The 2011 gure has been re-calculated and all gures are now on a consistent basis.
