Energy and greenhouse gas emissions A major factor behind these unplanned increases has been Our policies grid power supply problems at the Tongon mine, following We have published a five-year strategy to reduce our use of fossil-fuel based power sources and enabling us to reduce its connection to the Ivorian national grid in December costs, improve our security of supply and reduce CO emissions 2 2011.
Tongon suffered from a series of grid power outages per production unit.
Our target is to reduce all greenhouse gas in 2012, meaning that diesel-powered back-up generators emissions by 47% in efficiency terms by 2015. were frequently in use.
We took steps to stabilise the power supply including the installation of a new capacitor bank and We are using a wide range of methods to achieve this target, five additional generator sets, as well as a reconguration of many of which are site specic.
The main methods in our the powerhouse feeder arrangement.
We are working with approach are the increased use of hydropower, including Compagnie Ivoirienne d'Electricit CIE, the Ivorian electricity the construction of new hydroelectric power plants for Kibali: supplier, to stabilise the grid as well as effecting improvements efficiency measures such as the introduction of lower revving to warning systems and offering management training.
This generators and solarpowered pumps at Loulo and the transfer process has been helped by a government budget passed in from diesel-based power generation to the hydroelectric and the autumn of 2012, which includes provisions to rebuild the natural gas powered national grid at Tongon.
We also work countrys energy infrastructure.
with employees to encourage more energy efficient behaviour through initiatives such as our switching off the switches campaign.
Despite the setbacks at Tongon, we are encouraged by energy efficiency progress at other sites.
During 2012, we identied Our performance several power saving opportunities at Loulo that have been Despite a number of positive developments at individual sites, formed into a wide-ranging energy efficiency programme currently we did not meet our corporate targets for overall energy use or being implemented.
It is estimated that these measures can efficiency in 2012 see graphs below, due largely to the supply result in a reduction of diesel usage per kilowatt generated from problems at Tongon explained below.
0.25l kW to 0.23l kW, representing an 8% improvement, and cost savings of up to US$800 000 per month.
The design and The groups overall energy consumption increased from construction of the 20MW Nzoro hydropower station adjacent 386 917MWh in 2011 to 448 632MWh in 2012, and energy to the Kibali River, continued at pace in 2012 and will be a major efficiency decreased slightly last year from 34.76kWh contribution towards achieving our 2015 emissions targets.

This increase led to a rise in greenhouse gas We are committed to transparency in our environmental emissions for the year to 535 598 tonnes of carbon dioxide management and our reporting on emissions and energy use or equivalent.
