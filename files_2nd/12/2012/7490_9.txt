REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS Responsible retailing We call our approach to corporate responsibility the basis of good business, because we believe it makes good business sense.
By contributing to the communities that we operate in, reducing waste and by being more efficient in our use of energy, we deliver benefits to our stakeholders.
To us, corporate responsibility is not an abstract idea, but about how we work every day.
Colleagues across the Group are passionate in their support for both our charity partner Teenage Cancer Trust and for their local communities.
Our colleagues and customers raised a record 2.5m for charitable causes during the year, more than PL ATINUM AWARD 2012 for any year previously, and our new volunteering policy encourages colleagues to give their time more freely to help in their local community.
PA YR OLL GIVING Were proud of our achievements so far.
