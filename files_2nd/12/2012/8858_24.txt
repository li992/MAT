Delivering Value Investing in New Capacity With ever increasing concerns over the availability of natural resources, countries around the world remain focused on ensuring their energy security and continue to seek to reduce their dependence on the use of imported oil.
In China, which has low natural gas reserves and lots of coal, there is particular interest in converting coal into substitute natural gas SNG and Johnson Matthey has leading technology and catalysts for this process.
Investments at our Process Technologies business Panki site in India are increasing capacity for manufacturing SNG catalysts to meet demand from customers in China.
Projects to construct new facilities are well underway and several upgrades to our existing assets have been completed.
As well as boosting capacity, these upgrades have included a number of health and safety improvements to provide an enhanced working environment for our employees at Panki... Employees at Panki outside one of the new catalyst Inside the control room of a recently completed facility at Panki.
