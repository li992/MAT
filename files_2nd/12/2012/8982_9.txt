Summary Corporate Responsibility Investing for responsible growth Corporate Responsibility CR is a key pillar of our business strategy.
Running our business responsibly enables us to access capital, lower operational costs, build good relationships with regulators and local communities, and attract and retain the best employees.
That is why our mining, smelting and power generation operations must manage their risks carefully to prevent harm to people and the environment.
CR Key Performance Indicators In addition to the business KPIs on page 14 we report performance on six CR KPIs for the most significant social and environmental issues for our business.

Long term, however, we are aiming for an annual reduction of 10%.
