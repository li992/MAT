Recognising the nature of G4Ss business, our large workforce and our geographic diversity, it is understandable that the materiality exercise highlighted business ethics including anti-corruption, human rights, employee engagement and health and safety as priorities for the group, as these are the areas which would have the most material effect on business performance or reputation if they were not managed carefully.
Our CSR strategy includes a much broader range of topics, but these are the areas where management and theCSR Committee focus the majority of their efforts.
TheCSR Committee will regularly review these issues in light of changing circumstances and stakeholder priorities.
