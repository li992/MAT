About our gold mines: Cradle to grave sustainability Details of the four countries in which our mines and projects are based, including sustainable development indicators, are listed alongside details of the sites themselves.
Each site is at a different stage of its life and therefore faces varying, though connected, sustainability challenges.
Here we describe how we manage those challenges in an integrated way that takes each mines site-specic political, social and environmental conditions into account.
Sustainability priorities at each phase of the life cycle There are five distinct phases in the life of our mines.
Below is a summary of our sustainability priorities at each of these stages.
Exploration Q Aim for the smallest possible social and environmental impact.
Q Set up grievance mechanism and emergency response plan for all community concerns.
Q Employ local people in the exploration teams to ensure sufficient local knowledge to assess potential social and environmental issues.
Feasibility Q Conduct social, public health and Environmental Baseline Studies and Impact Assessments ESIAs.
Q Launch public communication programmes to ensure the local communities are aware of the mines likely positive and negative impacts.
Q Hold discussions with host governments on issues such as infrastructure and security.
Q Produce a site-specic environmental management plan that complies with the International Finance Corporations IFC Performance Standards.
Q Draw up resettlement action plans as required.
Construction Q Launch recruitment process prioritising directly affected communities.
Q Conduct aptitude tests to identify potential candidates for skilled jobs during the mines operation.
Q Initiate training of host country nationals in preparation for operational employment.
Q Increase communications with local communities.
Q Implement environmental management system EMS and programmes to mitigate impacts, with regular monitoring and quarterly updates to board.
Q Implement safety management systems with emphasis on safety awareness, training and risk assesment.
Operational Q Prioritise workplace safety, health and employee development.
Q Allocate budgets to local committees for community development projects.
Q Ensure employment is offered first to people from the most affected local communities, then host country nationals.
Q Optimise use of energy, water and other natural resources, with monitoring to check compliance and track improvements.
Q Boost waste management resources to cope with increased consumption levels.
Q Continuous rehabilitation of land wherever possible using satellite imagery to plan and monitor progress.
Q Clearly promote and manage grievance mechanisms.
Q Ensure sufficient financial resources are set aside to meet closure obligations and put legacy planning in place.
Closure Q Ensure economic and social infrastructure in place to maintain the long term viability of communities.
Q Develop and implement viable economic strategies, such as our agribusiness strategy for Morila.
Q Provide training for people previously employed at the mine to enable alternative employment.
Q Offer financial support to mine employees to help start alternative livelihoods.
Q Remediate and restore land using indigenous plant species as detailed in original baseline studies.
