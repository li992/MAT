Strategic Report Executing our long-term strategy Reducing our carbon emissions Managing our environmental impacts Managing the issues of climate change, resource use and waste is gaining significant interest from stakeholders interested in the impacts of these issues on business performance and long term viability.
SSE has an important role to play in driving a low carbon transition as well as improving its environmental performance and disclosure.
