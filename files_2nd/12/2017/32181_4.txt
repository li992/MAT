As a global leader in sustainable technologies, we work with customers and partners across markets from pharmaceutical and medical to automotive, industrial and chemical production Recycling Rare Elements Theyre not called precious metals for nothing.
Platinum group metals, or pgms, are a valuable natural resource and their applications are numerous.
Youll find them in autocatalysts, jewellery and electronics.
The more pgms we can reuse, the less we need to take from the earth.
So weve developed highly advanced processes for extracting and separating pgms from products so advanced that we can recycle platinum, for example, to a purity of 99.999%.
In fact, we recycle enough platinum and palladium in a year to make millions of autocatalysts.
Optimising processes, improving efficiency and maximising the use of the planets natural resources.
Enhancing business performance, day to day while sharpening the competitive edge, long term.
Making More from Less Populations are growing all over the world, placing ever greater demands on food production and the manufacture of agricultural products such as fertilisers.
With pgm and base metal catalysts developed by Johnson Matthey, chemical companies are able to produce more fertiliser using fewer materials and less energy.
We design our catalysts to cleverly maximise their atomic level surface area, greatly accelerating the reactions that produce ammonia and nitric acid while only using a minimum of metal.
With Johnson Matthey technology, our customers produce fertilisers that help cultivate millions of tonnes of produce every year.
