5.8 Equity and dividends Accounting policy Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Where any group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Company.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 137 Section 6: Acquisitions and disposals 6.1 Acquisitions Growth through acquisitions is one of the Groups priorities in order to deliver its Events First strategy.
Further details of the Groups strategy are provided in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 12.
The Group completed five acquisitions during 2017 of which Arabian Exhibition Management WLL AEM was significant 2016: five acquisitions of which Allworld Exhibitions Allworld and Business Journals Inc. BJI were significant.
Accounting policy The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred is measured at the amount of cash and cash equivalents transferred, the fair value of any equity instruments transferred and the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope of IAS 39 are recognised in profit or loss.
The Group recognises the fair values of the assets acquired, the liabilities including contingent liabilities assumed, and the equity interests issued by the Group.
For significant acquisitions, management is assisted by external advisors in identifying and measuring the fair values of any intangible assets acquired.
On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value under the full goodwill method or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
When the full goodwill method is used, the fair value of the non-controlling interest is measured using a multiples approach adjusted for the discount that market participants would expect for the lack of control.
Acquisition costs incurred are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period incurred and classified as exceptional items.
If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying amount of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
All 2017 and 2016 acquisitions where less than 100% of the voting rights of a company were purchased have been accounted for using the full goodwill method.
2017 acquisitions The Group has acquired 100% of the voting rights in all cases where acquisitions involved the purchase of companies unless otherwise stated below.
