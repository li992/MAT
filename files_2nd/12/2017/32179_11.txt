CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ENVIRONMENT We are conscious of the role we have to play in minimising the environmental impact of our activities.
We operate an energy efficiency helpline to provide advice to Members on how they can reduce their energy usage: we enable qualifying Members to access free home insulation: we actively promote Feed-In Tariffs: and we encourage Members to monitor their energy usage by providing regular meter readings.
Since moving to an online Member application process, we have increasingly reduced the amount of printed marketing materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new Members choosing not to receive a paper bill each month.
We participate in a waste paper recycling programme, with a certificated saving of 235 trees and 43,710kg of CO2 during the year 2016: 337 trees and 45,720kg of CO2 : we also recycle all of our cardboard, and use only fsc-certified paper.
We recycle both mobile phones and toner cartridges.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STATEMENT The greenhouse gas GHG emissions statement below provides a summary of the Groups greenhouse gas carbon emissions from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017.
It gives a summary of emissions from fuel combustion and the operation of our facilities which include our offices and company cars, scope 1, and from our purchased electricity use during the year scope 2.
We have adopted the operational control approach, as defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised Edition 2004, therefore emissions associated with our Members energy usage, the activities of our independent distributors and the supply of energy from Npower are not included in this statement as they are outside the Groups operational control.
