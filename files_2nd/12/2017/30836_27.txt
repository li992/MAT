6.1 EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS This note provides a more detailed breakdown of the cost of our employees, including executive directors.
The average number of employees in Operations staff based at production sites, B2B Energy Supply services employees in our B2B Energy Supply segment and Central and administrative functions are also provided.
Further information in relation to pay and remuneration of the executive directors can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee, starting on page 81.
The number of staff employed by the Group, and the associated costs, increased from the previous year following the purchase of Opus Energy and the expansion of our US-based Pellet Production business.

We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy All of the Groups share-based payments are equity settled.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m PSP granted from 2017 0.5 DSP granted from 2017 0.1 BMP granted in periods prior to 2017 1.5 2.6 SAYE 4.0 2.6 6.1 5.2 154 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE 6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Share Incentive Plan SIP Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to 1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year.
Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group.
There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.
Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Companys control as a result of the SIP were as follows: Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at Cost at value at value at 1 January acquired transferred 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2017 during year during year 2017 2017 2017 2017 number number number number 000 000 000 SIP 153,034 95,435 57,599 7 156 2017 Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Share Plan DSP In 2017, a new share plan was introduced for directors and senior executives, replacing the Bonus Matching Plan.
Under the PSP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 175% of their annual bonus.
Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The fair value of the 2017 PSP awards of 2.8million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.
The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting.
The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2017 awards are the share price at the grant date 325 pence, expected volatility 44%, and risk-free interest rate 0.13%.
In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced in 2017 as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive directors, which are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or good leaver termination provisions.
The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2017 was 325 pence and the fair value of these awards of 0.6 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the PSP and DSP awards are as follows: 2017 2017 PSP DSP number number At 1 January Granted 1,582,309 170,227 Forfeited 292,547 59,418 Exercised Expired At 31 December 1,289,762 110,809 50% of the PSP options granted in 2017 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with theremaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The share price on the grant date for PSP options awarded in the year was 325 pence and the weighted average fair value of the PSP options granted during the year was 177 pence.
All of the PSP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of nil.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 28 months.
The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 155 6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Bonus Matching Plan BMP Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016.
The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP.
For awards prior to2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The fair value of the 2017, 2016 and 2015 BMP awards of0.6 million, 2.6 million and 3.3 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three-year vesting periods.
The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting.
No BMP awards were made in 2017.

The weighted average remaining contractual life was nine months 2016: 17 months.
The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil 2016: nil.
Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE In April 2017, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all qualifying employees.
Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 280 pence 2016: 203 pence, representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules.
The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts.
The fair value of the options granted inconnection with the SAYE plan of 0.9 million 2016: 3.9 million is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts.

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS We operate one dened benefit and four dened contribution pension schemes.
The Drax Power Group DPG section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS is a dened benefit scheme: a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules.
Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401 K Plan are dened contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.
Accounting policy Payments to dened contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the contributions.
The income statement charge for the dened contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
For the dened benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benets is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable and the return on scheme assets excluding interest, is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Dened benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur.
The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.
significant estimation uncertainty Measurement of the dened benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modied as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2017 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent actuarial advice received.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 157 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Dened contribution schemes The Group operates four dened contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401 K Plan, for all qualifying employees.
Pension costs for the dened contribution schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Total included in staff costs note 6.1 8.1 5.6 As at 31 December 2017, contributions of nil 2016: 0.5 million due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Dened benefit scheme The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS.
Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benets as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets equities, property and direct lending which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benets for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes obligations to pay benets are linked to inflation, and, as such, higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Other risks include operational risks such as paying out the wrong benets, legislative risks such as the Government increasing the burden on pension schemes through new legislation and other demographic risks such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group.
The Trustees insure certain benets payable on death before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualied independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016.
Theactuarial review at 31 December 2017 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation.
The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose ofassessing the scheme cost.
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation, and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows: As at 31 December 2017 2016 % p. a.
Discount rate 2.6 2.8 Inflation RPI 3.2 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 3.1 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.8 Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements inmortality rates.
The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2017 will live, on average, for a further 26 years iftheyaremale 2016:27years and for a further 29 years if they are female 2016: 29 years.
Life expectancy at age 60 for male  currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively 2016: 28 and 31 years respectively.
158 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the dened benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets, determined as follows: As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Dened benefit obligation 306.5 311.4 Fair value of plan assets 305.3 281.3 Net liability recognised in the balance sheet 1.2 30.1 The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Included in staff costs note 6.1 : Current service cost 7.3 6.0 Included in finance costs note 2.5 : Interest on net dened benefit liability 0.5 0.9 Total amounts recognised in the income statement 7.8 6.9 Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Cumulative actuarial losses on dened benefit pension scheme at 1 January 79.2 70.8 Actuarial gains losses on dened benefit pension scheme recognised in the year 21.4 8.4 Cumulative losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 57.8 79.2 Changes in the present value of the dened benefit obligation are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Dened benefit obligation at 1 January 311.4 244.6 Current service cost 7.3 6.0 Employee contributions 0.1 0.2 Interest cost 8.5 9.4 Actuarial gains losses 4.8 58.8 Benets paid 16.0 7.6 Dened benefit obligation at 31 December 306.5 311.4 The actuarial gains of 4.8 million 2016: 58.8 million losses reflect losses of 4.5 million arising from changes in financial assumptions 2016: losses of 71.4 million, offset by 5.5 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and gains arising from scheme experience of 3.8 million 2016: gains of 1.9 million and 10.7 million respectively.
The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.60% 2016: 2.75% following reductions in corporate bond yields.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 159 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 281.3 215.1 Interest income on plan assets 8.0 8.5 Remeasurement gains 16.6 50.4 Employer contributions 15.3 14.7 Employee contributions 0.1 0.2 Benets paid 16.0 7.6 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 305.3 281.3 Employer contributions included payments totalling 7.5 million 2016: 8.3 million to reduce the actuarial deficit.
The actual return on plan assets in the period was 24.5 million 2016: 58.9 million.
The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Gilts 104.1 105.9 1 Equities 76.6 65.2 2 Fixed interest bonds 71.6 61.3 Property 32.2 29.5 3 Cash and other assets 20.8 19.4 Fair value of total plan assets 305.3 281.3 Notes: 1 At 31 December 2017 the schemes long-term asset strategy was: global equity 20%, direct lending 10%, emerging market equity 5%, fixed interest bonds 15%, corporate bonds 6%, liability driven investing 29% and long lease property 15% 2 Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds.
Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating i. e. BB or lower 3 Other assets include 19.0 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market 2016: 17.9 million The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual asset allocation for the scheme.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension deficit at 31 December 2017 to changes in these assumptions: Decrease increase in net liability % m Discount rate Increase 0.25 15.6 Decrease 0.25 16.3 1 Inflation rate Increase 0.25 13.7 Decrease 0.25 13.2 Life expectancy Increase 1 year 10.9 Decrease 1 year 10.9 Note: 1 The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benets will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
160 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED As at 31 December 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 m m m m m Dened benefit obligation 306.5 311.4 244.6 242.1 220.9 Fair value of plan assets 305.3 281.3 215.1 207.8 179.2 deficit 1.2 30.1 29.5 34.3 41.7 Experience adjustments on plan liabilities 3.8 10.7 1.7 1.6 8.7 Experience adjustments on plan assets 16.6 50.4 4.6 13.6 9.4 The dened benefit obligation includes benets for current employees of the Group 60%, former employees of the Group who are yet to retire 5% and retired pensioners 35%.
The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.
Future contributions The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of 10.8 million to the dened benefit pension plan during the 12 months ended 31 December 2018.
In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as at the 31 March 2016 valuation.
The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of 64 million including an estimate of the impact of future service costs, which do not meet the denition of a liability at 31 December 2017 for inclusion in the financial statements.
This valuation has not changed materially between the 31 March 2016 valuation date and 31 December 2017.
The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit.
At this point the scheme is expected to be self-sufficient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the valuation.
The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group's business plan.
The terms of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled, accordingly the deficit contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.
