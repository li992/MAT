Employees targeted for training are those in client-facing roles and relevant support teams.
A new policy framework, launched in 2014, required a signi cant level of training to be delivered in 2015 and thus a one-off increase in training attendance Equator Principles Project advisory Project finance mandates Project-related corporate loans mandates 1 2 3 Cat A Cat B Cat C Cat A Cat B Cat C Total 2015 4 9 1 Total 2016 7 6 2 Total 2017 1 111 12 1 2017 Sector Mining 1 Infrastructure 131 1 Oil & Gas 3 1 1 Renewables Telecoms Power 2 1 Other 2 Region Greater China 1 1 North East Asia South Asia 2 ASEAN MENAP 7 1 1 Africa 1 2 Americas 1 Europe 4 Designation Designated 1 Non-Designated 1 11 1 1 1 Independent Review Yes 1 11 1 1 2 No 1.
Cat A or Category A are projects with potential signi cant adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented 2.
Cat B or Category B are projects with potential limited adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts that are few in number, generally site-speci c, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures 3.
Cat C or Category C are projects with minimal or no adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts 4.
Designation is split into designated and non-designated countries.
Designated countries are deemed by the Equator Principles to have robust environmental and social governance, legislation systems and institutional capacity designed to protect their people and the natural environment.
Non-designated countries are countries that are not found on the list of designated countries.

Scope 3 emissions calculated from total energy consumption from our outsourced global data centres 3.
Indirect non-renewable energy refers to purchased electricity from non-renewable sources 4.
Indirect renewable energy refers to purchased electricity from off-site renewable sources 5.
Direct non-renewable energy refers to the gross calori c values of fuels consumed on-site 6.
Direct renewable energy refers to the gross calori c values of renewable fuels consumed on-site 7.
On-site renewable energy refers to renewable energy generated and consumed on-site 8.
During 2017, we introduced new methodology to measure paper consumption.
This resulted in both an increase in reporting and overall paper consumption.
Data from 2015 and 2016 is no longer considered representative and is, therefore, not shown 9.
During 2017, more branches measured their waste generation and those reporting were found to have generated more waste per branch than our previous sample population.
As a result, total waste generated across the portfolio increased.
We are reviewing our scaling-up approach: scaled-up data from 2015 and 2016 is no longer representative, and is, therefore, not shown 329 SUPPLEMENTARY Supplementary INFORMATION sustainability information Additional notes on environment data The emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017.
This is to allow suf cient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results.
Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting.
This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice.
We use measured data to calculate our energy and water use across our properties, which we then scale up to re ect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from.
Measured data is collected from Global Environment Management System GEMS properties, fide ned as all properties that are over 10,000 square feet for energy and water.
Scaled-up data represents measured data taken from a sample of branches, which is then extrapolated to re ect the Groups total property footprint for energy and water.
For paper and business travel, it is fide ned per full-time employee as at the end of the reporting period.
Carbon abatement bene t from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account.
Total energy use is normalised to re ect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.
Net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas.
Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation.
Scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 20 countries, based on seating class and distance own.
As we operate largely outside of the UK, all ights domestic or international with ight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy DBEIS as domestic ights, have been classi ed as short haul.
All ights with distance own ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DBEIS as short haul have been classi ed as medium haul.
The Carbon Trust is our independent third-party assurance provider for Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions.
In 2017, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were assured by The Carbon Trust, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting.

In 2017, we introduced a Mandatory Learning reporting standard that records employees who have completed training as well as those who are yet to complete, but remain within the allotted time for completion.
Previously, we only recorded completion as at the report date.
As a result, 2017 completion rate percentage values have slightly increased and are not directly comparable to prior periods Investing in communities Community expenditure 3 2017 2016 2015 $million $million $million Cash contributions 22.1 21.3 24.5 Employee time non-cash item 18.1 17.3 20.0 1 Gifts In Kind non-cash item 0.1 0.1 Management costs 4.5 4.7 5.5 Total direct investment by the Group 44.8 43.3 50.1 2 Leverage 5.0 9.6 10.2 Total incl.
