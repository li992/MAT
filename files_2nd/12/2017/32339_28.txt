Deemed Consent Our 2020 ambition On 26 March 2017 Ofcom published the findings of its investigation into the historical use of Deemed Consent by Openreach.

Weve achieved our UK target, to send zero 25m on our overall energy bill this year, contributing a total of qualifying waste directly to landfill by year-end.
We use specialist 221m savings since 2009 10.
This has helped us cut consumption contractors to manage hazardous waste responsibly, complying with by 2.7% this year, but is offset by the addition of EEs energy use: relevant regulations.
overall, our consumption has risen by 12.5%.
In Great Britain, we spent around 341m on energy and fuel 2015 16: 307m.
We maintain our commitment to buy our electricity from 100% renewable sources, in the UK and globally, where markets allow.
This year, our acquisition of EE has reduced the UK figure from 100% to 84% and our worldwide figure from 95% to 82%.
Weve plans in place to move over 98% of EEs directly-billed electricity supply onto renewables during 2017 and have increased our renewable contracts outside of the UK.
