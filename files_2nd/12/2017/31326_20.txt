Corporate and social responsibility Greenhouse gas emissions It is Hansteens policy to comply with environmental legislation and relevant codes of practice.
In line with recent guidance issued by DEFRA the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, we set out below the required information for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Quantification and reporting methodology We have followed the 2013 UK Government environmental reporting guidance.
DEFRA greenhouse gas conversion factors have been used for the purposes of this report.
We have used the operational control approach, which therefore only includes information regarding those emissions for which we have direct control and influence on.
We have therefore included carbon emissions derived from gas, electricity, heating oil and district heating consumptions attributable to Hansteen.
Energy consumption is assessed as attributable to Hansteen if it is used for the benefit of vacant property space or for common parts or communal facilities at properties which are held directly or managed by Hansteen.
Operational scopes We have measured our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as detailed below.
Base year We have used 2013 as our base year as it is the first year for which we have reliable data and it was typical in respect of our operations.
