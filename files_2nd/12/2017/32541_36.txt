Greenhouse gas reporting The table below outlines the location-based emission factors used for the 2016 17 year and how they compare to the previous year.
We report our full greenhouse gas GHG emissions annually in accordance to the World Resources Institutes Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
Landsec is also committed to EPRA Best Practice Recommendations for Landsec Scope 1 and 2 emissions 2015-17 Table 110 Sustainability reporting, for which we have won a Gold award for three 90,000 years running.
We believe that such reporting improves transparency and performance.
We report our data using an operational control approach 80,000 64,114 to define our organisational boundary.
A detailed description of our 55,688 70,000 reporting methodology and data, including our EPRA figures, can be 47,006 found at www.
com sustainability 60,000 GHG emissions are broken down into three scopes, Scope 1,2 and 3.
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from activities controlled by 50,000 34,259 usthat release emissions into the atmosphere, whereas Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with our consumption of purchased 40,000 energy.
Scope 2 emissions are reported using both the location-based 30,000 and market-based accounting methods.
Location-based emissions are reported using UK Government Greenhouse gas reporting Conversion 3,862 20,000 factors 2016.
Market-based emissions are reported using the conversion 16,447 16,477 factor associated with each individual electricity supply as per the 13,648 10,000 13,711 13,648 suppliers guidance.
Scope 1 emissions are currently reported using only the location-based method.
2015 2016 2017 2016 2017 Scope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our actions, Location-based emission factors Market-based emission factors but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not classed as Scope 2 emissions.
The GHG Protocol identifies 15 categories Scope 1 tCO e Scope 2 tCO e 2 2 of which eight are directly relevant for Landsec.
Total GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have dropped by 8% since the previous year.
This has been driven by a reduction in electricity consumption and the drop in national emission factors due to acleaner energy mix.
In terms of market-based emissions we have seen a significant reduction of 58%.
This has been due to our move to 100% renewable electricity via our contract with SmartestEnergy.
This is the first year where we have fully reported our Scope 3 emissions having worked with the Carbon Trust to establish an accurate and repeatable methodology.
We believe it was important to do so to fully understand and disclose the total emissions associated with our business.
The table below provides a breakdown of our entire emission inventory including Scope 3.

We assessed each one individually and decided which ones were applicable to our business.
For the categories that are applicable we have obvious hot spots which are highlighted below: Landsec Scope 3 GHG emissions 2016 17 % Table 112 Capital goods 45.82% Downstream leased assets 41.76% Purchased goods and services PG&S 9.96% Fueland energy-related activities 2.26% Others 0.20% The two largest contributing categories are Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, making up 80% of our entire emissions.
Capitalgoods include the emissions associated with the manufacture andtransport of materials used within our construction activity and Downstream leased assets are those associated with our customers withinour assets.
We are working to reduce our impacts in these categories by working closer with our supply chain partners and customerson reduction strategies.
