36 Taking paper out of the mortgage process Our new paperless mortgage process is saving our customers time and money.
Documents which were previously received by post can now be uploaded in seconds via a safe, temporary portal.
Signatures can also be provided digitally, so customers no longer have to sign paper documents and post them back to us.
As well as being much more convenient for customers, the new process is also more environmentally friendly saving around 4.3 million sheets of paper a year and much more efficient.
By removing the need for paper documents, which need to be sent through the postal system, we are now able to complete the appointment to offer in less than half the time than before, from 23 working days to 11 on average.
