Looking after our environment Spire Healthcare realises that we have a duty of care to the environment as well as our patients and we continue to promote a low carbon culture across our hospitals.
We continually review how we operate our buildings and infrastructure to improve the carbon efficiencies.
A key focus is to reduce carbon emissions Our mandatory Energy Savings High Efficiency Lighting after the associated with our usage of electricity Opportunity Scheme ESOS audits success of our lighting replacement and natural gas.
