Strategic Report Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 44 Sustainability Environment Environment As a leading industrial technology company, our activities have a profound effect on society and the environment.
We have an irrefutable role in addressing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change.
Our approach We have a long-standing commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our products, services and manufacturing activities.
This commitment is embedded within our governance framework, including our operating system and production system, and therefore is not a standalone environmental policy.
During the year we strengthened our approach to governance and risk management in this area by introducing an executive-level environment & sustainability committee.
Our environmental strategy focuses on three core areas: 1 2 3 Further reducing the Developing new technologies Continually reducing the environmental impact of our and capabilities for low emission impact of our business products and services products and services operations and facilities 1.
Products and services In 2017, over two-thirds of R&D investment at Rolls-Royce went into improving the environmental performance of our products.
Together with our supply chain and research partnerships, we have delivered products that are industry-leading in terms of fuel efficiency, emissions and noise.
Our service capabilities contribute to reducing environmental impact by maintaining our products to the highest standards.
Increasingly we are able to repair individual engine components, reducing the manufacture of new parts and minimising customer disruption.
We are also frequently retro-fitting improvements throughout the life of our engines.
Our global network of service provider partners is crucial to this.
TRENT XWB Our Trent XWB engine is the sixth generation of the Trent engine family and is now the most efficient large aero-engine flying today.
It delivers 15% better fuel efficiency than the original Trent engine.

New technologies and capabilities The transition to a low carbon global economy is dependent on the development of new technologies and capabilities.
We are building on our strong engineering heritage to produce state-of-the-art electro-mechanical and hybrid power systems, combined with digital solutions.
This means building on our existing thermo-mechanical products to deliver step changes in emissions performance.
In partnership with our global network of University Technology Centres and Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres, Rolls-Royce is able to apply innovations across the product portfolio.

This became fully operational in June We continue to invest in new facilities 2017, and currently provides 7% of the sites electricity needs, helping save and manufacturing technologies which over 31,000 tonnes of CO across its lifetime.
This is one of a series of low will reduce the environmental impacts 2 carbon energy projects completed during 2017 including: a ground-source of our operations even as we increase heating installation at our Bristol, UK site: a further solar installation at our engine production.
We continually monitor Aiken, US facilities: and a combined heat and power CHP facility at our performance across our global footprint Friedrichshafen campus, Germany.

There remains a degree of uncertainty in the accuracy and completeness of waste-related data.
We will continue to review historical and source data and if a material impact is identified will seek to restate these reported figures in 2018.
As a result of these continued issues with data completeness we have extended our total solid and liquid waste reduction target from 2020 to 2025.
The baseline year of 2014 remains unchanged.
