Responsible Business SUSTAINABILITY AT OUR CORE CASE STUDY WE SUPPORT THE MEAT AND DAIRY INDUSTRIES Importing live bulls to India In 2016, we became the first company THROUGH ETHICAL ANIMAL ever to import live bulls to India, following a landmark agreement with the Indian GENETIC IMPROVEMENT, government.
These 13 animals are now the countrys leading sires, enhancing the INCREASING THE availability of high-quality genetics in the worlds largest dairy market.
They reside SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY at our Brahma joint venture bull stud, a state-of-the art facility built using best practice for animal well-being and H&S.

This both enhances the stressed.
We work with the core productivity of customer operations and building block animal genetics to reduces environmental impact: efficient improve the quality and output of growth means animals produce less responsibly produced meat and milk.

We train every employee on our animal well-being principles including our zero tolerance policy on animal cruelty.
Our training is tailored to the different species and is of a world class standard.
