160 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit obligations Accounting policies In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.
Plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the statement of other comprehensive income as incurred, and comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
The income statement charge consists of a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and interest income on plan assets and defined benefit pension scheme expenses.
The financing charge is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the pension scheme liabilities and plan assets at the beginning of the financial year.
The Group contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual as at that date.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Background At 11 March 2017, retirement benefit obligations relate to two defined benefit schemes, the Sainsburys Pension Scheme and from 2 September 2016, the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme the Schemes as well as two unfunded pension liabilities relating to senior former employees of Sainsburys and Home Retail Group.
The retirement benefit obligations at the year-end have been calculated by KPMG, as actuarial advisers to the Group, using the projected unit credit method and based on adjusting the position at the date of the previous triennial valuations see below for known events and changes in market conditions as allowed under IAS 19, Employee benefits.
Sainsburys Pension Scheme The Scheme is governed by a Trustee board, and the assets of the Scheme are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Scheme is an HMRC Registered pension scheme, subject to UK legislation with oversight from the Pensions Regulator.
The governance of the Scheme is the responsibility of the Trustee: the Trustee comprises 11 directors five selected from members, five appointed by the Company and one Independent Chairman who is selected by the Company in consultation with the Trustee.
In accordance with legislation, the Trustee consults with the Company regarding the Schemes investment strategy and agrees an appropriate funding plan with the Company.
The Scheme has three different benefit categories: Final Salary, Career Average and Cash Balance.
For Final Salary and Career Average members, benefits at retirement are determined by length of service and salary.
For Cash Balance members, benefits are determined by the accrued retirement account credits.
The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002 and closed to future benefit accrual on 28 September 2013.
The Scheme is also used to pay life assurance benefits to current including new colleagues.
The assets of the Scheme are valued at bid price and are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation, carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee, as at 14 March 2015 on the projected unit basis.
On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit at 14 March 2015 was 740 million, an increase of 148 million from the March 2012 deficit of 592 million.
A Recovery Plan was agreed in September 2016 which included: Two special contributions of 125 million paid in August 2015 and August 2016 Deficit contributions increasing to 65 million a year until March 2021 The interest in the property partnership to continue, of up to 600 million payable in 2030 if there is a deficit at that time.
The Scheme continues to receive annual coupons from the property partnership which are based on the average weighted discount rate used in the triennial valuation and so are effectively reset every three years.
These coupons will reduce from 2017 18 to 19 million a year.
Financial Statements 161 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued Home Retail Group Pension Scheme The Scheme is governed by a Trustee board, and the assets of the Scheme are held separately from the Groups assets.
The governance of the Scheme is the responsibility of the Trustee: the Trustee comprises six directors two selected from members, four appointed by the Company including an Independent Chairman.
The Scheme was closed to new employees in 2009 and closed to future benefit accrual in January 2013.
The Scheme is used to pay life assurance benefits only to current including new colleagues.
Pension benefits were based on service and final salary.
The Home Retail Group defined benefit pension scheme was subject to a Trustees triennial valuation as at 31 March 2015.
This was carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee.
On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit as at 31 March 2015 was 315 million, an increase of 157 million from the March 2012 deficit of 158 million.
A Recovery Plan was agreed and implemented on acquisition which included: An immediate payment on acquisition by Sainsburys of 50 million Deficit contributions of 40 million a year, 10 million payable each quarter, until October 2021 Security over 80 million of freehold property to be completed in the year ending 10 March 2018 A parent guarantee of 470 million which reduces over time in line with deficit contributions paid and will be reset at following triennial valuations As part of the sale of Homebase by Home Retail Group, it was agreed with the Trustee that a cash contribution of 50 million would be made to the Scheme.
Of this total, 26 million was paid during Home Retail Groups year ending 28 February 2016.
Following the capital return to shareholders associated with the Homebase sale, the final cash contribution of 24 million was made to the Scheme in September following the acquisition of Home Retail Group by Sainsburys.
Unfunded pension liabilities The unfunded pension liabilities are unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
IFRIC 14 IFRIC 14 is the interpretation that details when a company can recognise any pension surplus that exists.
Furthermore, if the company has a funding commitment in excess of the IAS 19 deficit, then IFRIC 14 requires recognition of this excess in those circumstances when the surplus that would result on fulfilling that commitment cannot be recognised.
A surplus may be recognised either because of an unconditional right to a refund to the company, or on grounds of a future contribution reduction where schemes are still open to future accrual.
For the Sainsburys pension scheme, management is of the view that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14.
As such no adjustment has been made for potential additional liabilities.
Based on the net deficit of the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme as at 11 March 2017 and the committed payments under the Schedule of Contributions signed on 2 September 2016, there is no notional surplus and therefore no additional balance sheet liability in respect of a minimum funding requirement to be recognised at 11 March 2017. a Income statement The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Excluded from underlying profit before tax: 1 Interest cost on pension liabilities 292 266 Interest income on plan assets 276 244 Total included in finance costs note 6 16 22 Defined benefit pension scheme expenses 8 6 Total excluded from underlying profit before tax note 3 24 28 Total income statement expense 24 28 1 Includes interest of 1 million for the unfunded pension scheme 2016: 1 million.

A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 1,270 million.
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 850 million.
A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by 796 million.
This sensitivity includes the effect of inflation on the Schemes pension increases.
An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 381 million.
The sensitivities are based on managements best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change.
The sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the retirement benefit obligation, by considering the change in the retirement benefit obligation for a given change in assumption.
The net retirement benefit obligation is the difference between the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the fair value of plan assets.
There has been no change in the calculation methodology since the prior period.
30 Share-based payments Accounting policies The Group provides benefits to employees including Directors of the Group in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares, rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.
For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
All share options are valued using an option-pricing model Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo.
This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised through the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in accruals.
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group recognised 32 million 2016: 23 million of employee costs note 28 related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year.
Of these, nil 2016: nil were cash-settled.
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below: a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months continuous service.
This is an approved HMRC scheme and was established in 1980.
Under Sharesave, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or fiveyear savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.

b Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, shares are conditionally awarded to the senior managers in the Company.
The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grades.
Performance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period.
If the required performance conditions have been met, the awards vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released.
Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released one year after the vesting date.
Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date.
Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.
The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.
Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.
Awards are structured as nil cost options.

c Deferred Share Award The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of financial and strategic scorecard measures.
These are intended to reward the top managers in the Company, including Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company.
Share-based awards are made to participants subject to performance against a basket of measures.
At least 50 per cent of the awards are based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders.
The balance is based on measures which will assess the Companys performance relative to its competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year.
Any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that managements interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders.
The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed.
Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.
