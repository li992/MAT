5.4 Policy on appointments to the Board Our policy is outlined in section 1.3 above, but in brief all Board appointments are made on merit, against objective criteria.
The issue of diversity was debated by the Board in March 2012, and a formal policy adopted.
This is predicated on appointing the best possible candidates and, to avoid precluding any deserving candidate from consideration, requires that short-lists contain candidates from a diverse range of backgrounds, and that these lists are gender-neutral.
The Board will maintain its practice of embracing diversity in all its forms, but has chosen not to set any measurable objectives.
The process of identifying candidates for Board appointment commences with drawing up a job specification which includes, in the case of non-executive appointments, an estimate of the time commitment required.
Generally, the Committee will engage executive search consultants, or consider open advertising, to assist in ensuring a comprehensive listing of potential candidates from a range of backgrounds for the Committees consideration.
Phuti Mahanyele, Gary Nagle and Paul Smith were appointed to the Board following nominations from their respective employers as explained earlier in this report, and neither an external search consultancy nor open advertising was used.
Ben Magara was appointed following an external search managed by Meyer Hosking & Associates, and Brian Beamish following an external search managed by Spencer Stuart.
Neither firm has any other connection to the Company.
The Safety & Sustainability Committee This Committee was created voluntarily by the Board to help it oversee the significant risks that the Company faces in the twin areas of safety and sustainability.
The matters it considers are a mixture of legal obligations most often arising from South African legislation or regulation and other actions we believe are necessary to be a good corporate citizen and retain our social licence to operate.
6.1 Role of the Safety & Sustainability Committee The Safety & Sustainability Committee has delegated authority from the Board set out in its written terms of reference, available on the Companys website, which were last reviewed by the Board in March 2012.
The primary purposes of the Committee are: to assist the Board in meeting its commitments under the Groups Safety and Sustainable Development Policy: to have oversight of and provide advice to the Board in the areas of safety, health, environment, community to the extent not covered by the Transformation Committee, external affairs and human rights, including the risks in each of these areas: to have oversight of and provide advice to the Board on the Groups compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements associated with safety and sustainability: to report to the Board developments, trends and or forthcoming significant legislation in relation to safety and sustainability which may be relevant to the Groups operations, its assets or employees: and to review the Groups external reporting and regulatory disclosures in relation to safety and sustainability.
More detailed information concerning the Groups sustainability related activities is set out in the Strategic Report, page 6 onwards and in A Deeper Look page 158 onwards, as well as in the Sustainable Development Report, available on the Companys website.
