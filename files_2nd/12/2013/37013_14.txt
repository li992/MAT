We continue to partner use intensity by 3 per cent compared in six of the Governments Plugged with 2011. in Places programmes designed to Underpinning our commitment to increase electric vehicle use and required environmental efficiency is a robust infrastructure.
In 2013 we installed the monitoring system which tracks our first rapid charging point for electric energy, carbon, waste and water cars in a Scottish shopping centre at performance across each centre.
To improve this even further, we have been rolling out portfolio-wide automatic metering to improve our understanding and control of energy use.
This year we have reduced our carbon emissions by sevenper cent and increased the proportion of waste recycled to 71per cent.
