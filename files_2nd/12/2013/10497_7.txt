Understanding our material sustainable development issues We are operating in a world of constrained resources, facing environmental and social challenges which are global in scale and local in nature.
These challenges affect our business, our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate, and our response to them contributes to our future sustainability.
It is therefore crucial for us to identify and understand our material sustainability issues within this global context.
Stakeholder engagement and risk management processes also inform our material issues and the commitments we have set to monitor and improve our performance.
The table below provides an overview of some of our key commitments in relation to our six material issues, and our progress against these in 2013.
With the exception of our commitments on carbon and energy, which cover the period 2004 to 2014, all other commitments are set against a base year of 2010, to be met by 2015.
For a more detailed overview of our full set of IR SSF SD 37 commitments please refer to our sustainable development report 2013 at www.
