Following damage to the gas export pipeline by a third party in late August, oil production was cut to reduce gas being flared.
The pipeline was reinstated for gas export in November and production has since returned to above 30 kboepd gross.
The costs of repair are the subject of an insurance claim.
Significant upgrades are being made to the Chim So FPSO to improve the reliability of power generation and to increase the number of the offshore workforce, both critical to improving operational efficiency.
The Dua development project, which is a subsea tie-back to Chim So, continued with subsea Phil MacLaurin equipment now installed at Dua and tied back to the FPSO via flowlines and umbilicals.
