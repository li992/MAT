INTRODUCTION Our Corporate Social Responsibility CSR Policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the environment, to control our risks and manage our opportunities in a sustainable way.
Big Yellow has been classified as having a low environmental impact by the Ethical Investment Research Index Series EIRIS because it is involved in Support Services.
Notwithstanding this, in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for its Stakeholders, the Board has continued to commit significant resources to the environmental and social aspects of its storage operations, real estate portfolio and new store developments.
This year we report in compliance with, and prior to, the adoption of the Companies Act Climate Change Regulation October 2013 on reporting Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions for listed companies.
We therefore provide a summary in the Directors Report of Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent CO e emissions using the DEFRA DECCs Green House Gas GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, as defined on 28 May 2012.
2 A limited level of assurance focuses on our carbon, waste, and health and safety performance data and was undertaken by Deloitte LLP in accordance with the International Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000 ISAE 3000.
The ISAE 3000 standard provides an evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of our CSR management and reporting.
Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 1 Carbon Emissions: Direct on-site GHG carbon equivalent emissions from stores from coolant replacement: flexi-office gas heating: construction fit-out generator gas oil: and company vehicle use.
These fuels and coolants only make up about 4.6% of our GHG emissions.
Coolant top-up or replacement in reception area air conditioners only occurs when required, through bi-annual servicing checks.
Natural gas use for heating flexi-offices within 8 of our 66 stores, are a relatively low environmental impact compared to our Scope 2 emissions.
Gas oil use in generators and associated emissions from new store construction fit-out has fallen with the reduction in our new store development programme.
Big Yellow has one company owned diesel fuelled vehicle, which is fide minimis in terms of carbon emissions, but it is still monitored for CSR purposes.
Scope 2 Carbon Emissions: Indirect off-site GHG carbon equivalent emissions from electricity supplied for store lighting use in all areas of the building: and air conditioning for store reception areas only.
Our main business activities consist of self storage operations and the facilities management of a 66 store portfolio.
National grid electricity use constitutes 93.8% of our annual energy consumption, mainly for store lighting both internal and external.
It is a major operational cost and our most significant environmental impact, so we have continued with our investment in energy efficient lighting programmes to assist in reducing our Scope 2 emissions in the last year.
Scope 3 Voluntary Carbon Emissions: GHG emission indicators within our waste, water supply and landfill chains.
Waste recycling and landfill GHG emissions Waste generation in self storage is assessed as a low environmental impact as customers store high value goods and generate very little waste.
Customer waste is the responsibility of our customers, unless recycling services are requested at an individual store.
The majority of Big Yellows non-hazardous bulk office waste is segregated by staff and recycled by our waste contractor.
Waste tonnage is measured by our contractor from bulk container volumes.
Percentages of waste recycled or sent to land fill is determined from studies and estimates.
Water supply and waste water treatment GHG emissions Water use measurement has been monitored over the last three years with some estimation to confirm the significance of this potential environmental impact.
It has been assessed as a low environmental impact for self storage operations, but Big Yellow will continue to monitor and report this data to assess tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tCO e for water supply chain sewage treatment emissions.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Reduction in Scope 2 Same Store Electricity Use and Carbon Emissions Scope 2 emissions are from National Grid electricity use and constitute some 94% of our annual energy consumption.
Over the last 5 years: our Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas carbon equivalent emissions have been reduced by 10.3%: and our carbon intensity emissions carbon emissions compared to revenue growth have been reduced by 25.0%.
These reductions have been achieved by further investment in our energy efficiency programmes such as motion sensor lighting, energy efficient lamps, power-saver adaptors and zoned motion sensor lighting in both new and existing stores.
Our programme of re-lamping stores with energy efficiency LED lighting is to be continued in the year ending 31 March 2014.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY continued Increases in Solar Electricity Generation Our solar electricity generation achievements are as follows: the income generated from our installations has increased by 126% in 2013 compared to the average achieved in 2011 and 2012: three large capacity 50 kWp solar installations at New Cross, Chiswick and Barking stores began contributing carbon free electricity in 2013: these installations contributed about 20% of each stores electricity use: solar electricity generation displaced 23,277 of National Grid electricity costs in 2013: and solar electricity use in 2013 has saved 108 tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions.
Scope 1 and Scope 3 Low Emission Measurements Scope 1 emissions are Direct or On Site emissions and make up just 4.6% of our total carbon footprint.
They are mainly from the natural gas heating in eight of our twelve flexi-office stores and also from coolant replacement in air conditioned areas.
Scope 3 emissions are from our waste and water supply chains.
Average residual waste to landfill represents only 0.13% of our combined Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
For the first time, in this financial year we measured our water use and waste water treatment by metered data from water supplier invoices, to assess the significance of these Scope 3 emissions on our business: they represent only 0.14% of our combined Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
The Queens Award for Innovation and Sustainable development This award was presented to Big Yellow for recognising our outstanding achievement in Innovation and Sustainable Development.
The Award is only presented to a limited number of companies each year, and in April 2012 we were very proud to have been one of them.
Green Star Rating by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB We were recognised as a pan European sector leader in sustainable development by the GRESB report.
GRESB awarded us with a Green Star Award for the third consecutive year, with a global ranking of 9 out of 455 participating companies.
ENERGY USE, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATION Key performance indicators for annual energy use and GHG emissions In reporting our total carbon footprint from emissions we express our total energy use, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from National Grid supplied electricity, natural gas, gas oil, diesel and self generated solar electricity as kWh and compare their significance as percentages of our total use.
Total energy use All annual energy uses kWh 2011 2012 2013 Absolute Energy Use KWh 14,904,835 14,554,103 14,769,872 2011 is our baseline year for performance measurement against peak energy use and growth.
Electricity supplied from the National Grid currently accounts for 93.8% of our energy use for store lighting c. 60% of store energy use and reception area air conditioning c. 30% of store energy use.
Only 4.6% of energy use is from natural gas heating for our flexi-offices.
Absolute energy use increased in 2013 due to increased customer occupancy, one new store opening Chiswick, the expansion of storage space at 7 stores phase 2 fit out works, and an increased demand for flexi-office winter heating.
However, a reduction in energy use of 0.9% was still achieved in 2013, compared to the average energy use over the last two years 14,661,987 kWh, a method used by carbon reduction certification bodies.
This reduction was due to our continued energy efficiency programmes and the slowdown in new store development growth.

See page 54 for the independent assurance report.
A five year summary of our main energy use shows a peak in the year ended 31 March 2011.
This peak electricity use follows a period of six new store openings per year in 2009 and 2010, followed by increases in operational electricity use due to our growing store occupancy and customer numbers.
The annual electricity use in the year ended 31 March 2013 was 0.6% less than our peak year of 2011.
We have chosen 2011 as our performance baseline year for comparing shorter term energy and carbon emission.
To assess the performance of our energy efficiency programmes in the longer term, we have also compared like for like stores in the table above.
These stores electricity use indicates a reduction of 7.6% from the longer term baseline year of 2009.

When considering carbon emissions compared to revenue growth over this period, our carbon intensity emissions have reduced by 25%.
This reduction has been achieved by the investment in our energy efficiency programmes such as motion sensor lighting, energy efficient lamps, power-saver adaptors and zoned motion sensor lighting in both new and existing stores.
In the year ended 31 March 2013, a new programme began of re-lamping stores with energy efficiency LED lighting and this is to be continued in the year ending 31 March 2014.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for store electricity and gas use, which are the main energy supplies used by the Group, show reductions in the years ended 31 March 2012 and 2013 compared to the base year of 2011.
Emissions per gross internal floor area have also reduced since the 2011 base year.
Store emission reductions per occupied space showed a reduction of 12.0% when compared to the baseline year 2011, reflecting the higher growth in occupancy at our stores compared to the absolute changes in the Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The total carbon footprint for all activities in 2013 increased from the 2011 baseline year due to increased occupancy, new store openings and extensions to existing storage areas.
The same store emissions showed reductions in 2012 and 2013 when compared to the 2011 baseline year.
The wider scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity performance per revenue, shows a more consistent reduction over the last three years.
ENERGY USE, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATION continued Summary of solar electricity programme Since 2008, we have invested in solar panel installations at 15 stores 23% of our portfolio, utilising the large roof spaces on each of our developments.
To date these installations have generated 588 MWh of electricity for store use.

We have averaged these across the 2 years as we are unable to indicate the exact yearly amounts.
Indicates data reviewed by Deloitte as part of their assurance work.
Average annual solar electricity generation for the years ended 31 March 2011 and 2012 was 118,727 kWh, indicating an increase in solar electricity of 74.4% in 2013.
Solar electricity now contributes 7.4% of our total electricity use in the 15 stores with solar installations and benefits Big Yellow as it displaces 5-20% of our grid electricity supply at those stores.
Solar generation reduces our grid electricity dependency and our carbon tax.
It also increases cost savings and generates revenue.
The solar electricity generation achievements have been as follows: 1.
Income for the years ended 31 March 2011 and 2012 averaged 25,848 per year and increased by 125.6% to 58,314 in 2013, due to the contribution from our newest and larger capacity installations: 2.
Three large capacity 50 kWp solar installations at New Cross, Chiswick and Barking stores have contributed significant increases in generating carbon free electricity, amounting to approximately 20% of each stores electricity use: 3.
Solar electricity generation has displaced Grid electricity costs of 23,277: and 4.
Solar electricity use has saved 108 tCO e, from carbon taxation amounting to a saving of 1,296.
2 Summary of energy efficiency investment programme and medium to long term objectives In the year ended 31 March 2013, Big Yellow continued with its energy efficiency and carbon reduction programmes.
We committed to reduced absolute energy use, and in particular electricity carbon equivalent emissions and carbon intensity emissions, and achieved the following strategies and objectives: 1.
All new stores will now have energy saving motion sensor lighting and high efficiency internal and external LED lighting as standard: 2.
All stores with T8 lights will be included in the LED investment programme for 2014 to gain an estimated 60% reduction in lighting electricity use at those stores: 3.
To improve upon our same store kWh absolute reductions of 7.6% and 10.3% of Scope 2 emissions, year-on-year, over the next three years: 4.
To improve upon our Scope 2 carbon intensity emissions per revenue which achieved a 25% reduction over the past five years: 5.
To improve upon our Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity emission reductions by gross internal floor area of 6.7% and by customer occupied space of 12.4% over the past three years: 6.
To reduce total same store GHG carbon equivalent emissions of 4.1% as a consequence of the LED lighting and improved capacity and maintenance of the solar installation portfolio: and 7.
We have completed the installation of eight smart meters on gas supplies to our flexi-offices, in addition to 22 smart meters on electricity supplies to stores, in order to improve the accuracy of our energy consumption data and avoid estimations.
Future Store Lighting Energy Efficiency Programme Following the conversion of 15 of our stores to LED lighting from T8 lighting, we aim to convert a further 35 stores to this system and re-lamp some of our external signage with LED in the financial year ending 31 March 2014.
In 2015, we will review the remaining stores, signage and external lighting, as longer term investment programmes and these will be determined by changes in lighting technology, returns on investments and the price of our supplied electricity at that time.

ENERGY USE, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATION continued Scope 3 Carbon Emissions continued In May 2011 we changed our waste contractor to a new supplier that recycles and manufactures cardboard, in addition to providing standard waste collection services.
Our average store waste for 2012 and 2013 261t reduced by 1.8% against the 2011 baseline tonnage.
Average sorted waste for 2012 and 2013 was 189.4t and reduced slightly by 1.1% compared to the baseline year 2011.
Average residual waste sent to landfill for 2012 and 2013 was 35.7t after further sorting and recycling.
This provided a reduction of waste to landfill of 4.3%.
This waste is estimated to be responsible for 10 tCO e GHG carbon equivalent emissions within our waste supply chain.
Compared to our carbon footprint of 7,542 tCO e, this represents only 0.13% of 2 2 our combined Scope 1 and 2 total emissions.
Construction Waste Management This financial year Big Yellow Construction completed the fit-out of our Chiswick store which opened on 30 April 2012, and this generated some residual construction waste.
One new store development is planned in 2014 at Gypsy Corner.
