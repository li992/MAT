Corporate social responsibility report Community values have always been at the heart of Dominos, but, we realise there is more to being a responsible business than our charitable funding, namely the quality of our food, the impact we have on the environment and how we treat our employees.
In 2013, we began to develop a CSR strategy by analysing our current business practices and devising a plan for the years to come.
Dominos Pizza is a successful business, built on a simple business model deliver hot, freshly made pizza to our customers in as quick a time as safely possible.
We have a responsibility to uphold the solid reputation our business has formed since we arrived in the UK in 1985.
So, to ensure we build a sustainable business for the future, we have developed Dominos Responsible Delivery Plan, our CSR strategy.
CSR is becoming an integral part of decision making at Dominos.
Our CSR Strategy Food Environment Employees Delivering to the Community We operate our business in line with these values and the following Dominos Responsible Delivery Plan is broken down into guiding principles: four areas, with underpinning values: to deliver freshly made, quality pizza Food premium quality, great tasting, innovative to drive reduction to our carbon footprint by monitoring energy, waste Environment reduce energy consumption, reduce, recycle and reuse and emissions within the business and setting targets accordingly waste and reduce emissions to encourage career development and cater for the wellbeing of our Employees happy staff, healthy staff, engaged staff employees Delivering to the Community to care, to share and to be at the heart of to invest and give back to the communities in which the business our local communities operates to demonstrate clear leadership, governance and values by integrating our CSR plan into the strategic Company mission We will fully integrate our Responsible Delivery Plan over the next five years, measuring and monitoring what we are doing along the way, as we strive to make changes for the better.
