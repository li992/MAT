Minimising the impact of our activities, and being accountable and transparent regarding our environmental footprint are crucial to gaining and maintaining our social license to operate.
What we said we would do in 2013 What we did in 2013 What we plan to do in 2014 Maintain zero environmental incidents We met the zero environmental incidents target Obtain Clean Industry certication at Saucito and Cyanide Code at Cinega Continue promoting environmental practices Some of key contractors obtained the Environmental within our value chain Quality certication and implemented ISO14001 Review and upgrade our energy and climate as part of our efforts to promote environmental change, water, land and biodiversity strategies Obtain Clean Industry certication at Saucito practices in our value chain and Cyanide Code at Cinega Support our business processes, documents Saucito made considerable progress in its application and indicators with information systems for the Clean Industry certication.
Cinega also advanced in their application process for the International Cyanide Management Code Environment Strategy Management Our Environmental Management System ensures effective systems and compliance with regulations and supports initiatives that certication reduce our environmental footprint.
Operational excellence, Climate change Communities innovation and continuous improvement are recognised and energy by our Value Creation programme.
This programme rewards teams for improving processes, manyof which actually Environmental achieved valuable environmental footprint reductions.

Groundwater gures include wells and the portion of the mine water from fide-watering used in our operations.
Some of our mines do not discharge water and use all the water collected on-site in operations.
Other mines require fide-watering draining groundwater by pumping to allow access to the ore.
The mine water that is not used in our operations is treated before being discharged in order to comply with Mexican water quality standards.
We have not detected negative downstream impacts of our water intake or discharge.
Some of our neighbouring communities benefit from the mine water we discharge, using it for irrigation purposes.

Operational efficiency is crucial to maximise the recovery of metals, reducing production costs and mineral waste.
To ensure effective handling and storage, our facilities are regularly Communities monitored and audited.
