STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Our Board Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Other Disclosures In addition to BCIP awards, Directors were also eligible to receive LTIP awards up to a value of 200% of salary at grant.
In practice, LTIP awards were restricted to 100% of salary or less.
The LTIP awards granted on 26 February 2013 were as follows: Executive Number of LTIP shares Basis of award granted Face maximum value of % of award vesting at Director awarded % of salary awards at grant date threshold maximum Performance period Steve Foots 23,102 100% 549,996 30% 100% 01.01.13 31.12.2015 Sean Christie 15,151 100% 360,704 30% 100% 01.01.13 31.12.2015 Keith Layden 8,479 70% 201,862 30% 100% 01.01.13 31.12.2015 Face value maximum value of award calculated based on the first 30 dealing days of 2013 The 2013 LTIP awards, as in prior years, were subject to a performance condition which is split into two equal separate parts.
Half of the award was subject to a relative TSR performance condition, comparing Crodas TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period.
The remaining half of the award is subject to an EPS growth condition.
Vesting under the two parts of the performance condition will take place on the following sliding scale: Rank of the Companys TSR against the Vesting % Adjusted EPS growth over the Vesting % FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts TSR part three year period EPS part Below median 0% Less than RPI 12% No vesting Median 30% RPI 12% 30% Upper quartile 100% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points Between median and upper quartile 30% - 100% pro rata Both the LTIP and BCIP, as detailed earlier, will be replaced, subject to shareholder approval, by the PSP being proposed at the 2014 AGM.
As a result, no further awards will be granted under these plans.
