9 During 2010 11, core IT facilities in our London office were outsourced to a data centre.
As per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, emissions from the data centre have been moved to Scope 3.
However, where we have stated a figure for overall electricity use we have included the data centre, as we felt that to exclude it would be misleading 10 Electricity transmission and distribution refers to the energy loss that occurs between the power station and the point of use.
Changes to legislation mean that this year these emissions must be reported separately as a Scope 3 emission.
