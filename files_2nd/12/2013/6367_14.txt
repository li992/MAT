Our business can contribute positively to the realisation of human rights through the range of services we offer to protect people.
We also recognise that we have a duty to ensure that we are not at risk of violating human rights through the services we provide, the customers we work with and the suppliers we use and through the fair and appropriate treatment of our own employees and others who are in our care.
Increasingly, customers and other key stakeholders are looking to companies such as G4S to demonstrate specifi c actions and practices which are aligned to internationally recognised human rights standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 2011, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights 2000, and the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers 2010.
Our human rights framework aims to bring our existing practices into line with these standards and introduce new guidelines in areas which are not covered by existing policies and practices.

The businesses that reported data in our 2013 GHG measurement represent 94.5% of the groups operations, across an 11-month period.
This level of measurement, including each of our main service types, allows us to calculate reliably the total GHG emissions for 100% of the group over a period of 12 months.
How were performing The G4S total carbon footprint, extrapolated to 100% of the business equates to some 559,000 t CO e. Since we launched our climate action 2 strategy in 2009, our carbon intensity has decreased by 23.5% per m of revenue exceeding our stated target of 20%.
This reduction translates to a real reduction of 4.9% in carbon emissions against a 24.4% growth in the business during the same period, much of which includes carbon emissions from services which our customers have outsourced to G4S.
This is a positive achievement which recognises the efforts made to increase the energy and fuel effi ciency of our business.
