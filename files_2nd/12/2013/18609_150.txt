We have used the Operational Control boundary approach for all Sustainability Performance Measures.
Data is reported for our property investment portfolio and own occupied offices.
Our property investment portfolio includes our UK Residential portfolio and the GRIP fund.
We have not reported energy consumption and GHG emissions from the properties in our GInvest portfolio and in our WIP portfolio as we do not have energy consumption data for the reporting year we are working to improve data collection for future reporting.
We have not reported energy consumption and GHG emissions from the properties in our German residential portfolio as we do not have energy consumption data for the reporting year we are working to improve data collection for future reporting and will report on our German properties next year.
Grainger only reports on landlord-obtained energy, water and waste consumption.
Data on tenant consumption is not available, however we report estimated tenant carbon dioxide emissions in our mandatory greenhouse gas statement.
