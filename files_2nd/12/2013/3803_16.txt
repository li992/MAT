Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2013 Strategic report 29 Organic revenue growth Operating efficiencies Competitive advantage Our people Our people At the heart of our business are our people: they are our most valuable asset.
Having well trained, motivated and productive employees is an essential component of our success, both in terms of service delivery and cost management.
We are committed to investing in our people, making sure we attract, retain, develop and engage them in a consistent way around the world.
We value the diversity of our employees and strongly believe that the more they reflect the diversity of our clients and consumers, the better equipped we are to deliver great service.
Training and development programmes are important both for our employees to fulfil their potential and to help our business achieve its goals.
We believe in nurturing talent, providing experience and formal qualifications to create managers and leaders of the future.
In addition to the development programmes we run at a global and local level within Compass, we also work with local communities to share our knowledge and provide training.
For example, our chefs in Kazakhstan have been working closely with local colleges since 2009 to organise training sessions on food safety and culinary skills.
In recognition of this work to support students, Compass was nominated for the Best Partner Award at the IV International Forum Vocational Training and Business: Dialogue of Partners.
In South Africa, we have partnered with the Department of Education in Mpumalanga to support school performance and enhance local students future employment opportunities.
