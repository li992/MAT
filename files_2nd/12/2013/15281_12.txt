Unfortunately, commissioning problems with the BD recovery system at Kluang mean that the hoped reductions there were not realised in 2013.
Work continued throughout the year to bring the plant on-line and the unit was operating at the year end.
A new boiler which will burn residual VOC from the Kluang NBR plant with full heat recovery was installed late in 2013 and is currently commissioning.
Better measurement of releases from the Kluang NBR plant showed a reduction of some 350 tonnes compared to the estimates for previous years.

2 Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel.
They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc.
with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity These losses are in Scope 3, this report is for Scope 1 & 2.
3 CO equivalent emissions include contributions from CH and N O associated with combustion.
2 4 2 4 NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes.
The CO equivalent Global Warming Potential contribution from these releases 2 is already included in the CO from energy gure above.
2 5 Data on refrigerant gas losses has been collected for 2013 and has been collected for 2011 and 2012 wherever possible.
Where site data is not available for 2011 & 2012, losses have been assumed to be the same as in 2013.
Annual losses of refrigerant have been converted to the CO equivalent gures 2 using the substance by substance gures published by DEFRA, based on the materials consumed within the Group.

7 Percentage changes are calculated from the base data and may differ slightly from changes calculated from the data in the tables because of rounding.
