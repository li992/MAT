At the time of announcing its annual results for the financial year 2012, the Company confirmed its intention to undertake an additional buyback of its ordinary shares of up to $50 million.
The Board is committed to maxmising shareholder value and believed that the proposed share buyback would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.

The Companys previous buyback authorities, obtained at the Annual General Meeting in 2012 and at a general meeting held on 17 August 2012, had been fully utilised by November 2012 following the tender offer made after completion of the transaction with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.
The authority obtained from shareholders on 14 March 2013 was renewed at the Annual General Meeting held on 22 May 2013.
Pursuant to the authorities obtained from shareholders during the course of 2013, in the period from 20 March 2013 to 20 June 2013 the Company completed the purchase of 6,302,089 ordinary shares in the open market.
These were transferred to treasury.
As at the close of the share buyback on 20 June 2013, 21,409,384 ordinary shares were held in treasury and the full $50 million had been expended.
For the buyback that commenced in March 2013, the Company entered into arrangements with J. P. Morgan Securities plc such that the Company purchased shares from J. P. Morgan Securities plc who had itself, acting as principal, first made market purchases of such shares.
J. P. Morgan Securities plc acted as an independent third party, which allowed the buyback to continue to be implemented following the end of the first financial quarter for the 2013 financial year, during what would otherwise have been a prohibited period of the Company.
On 25 July 2013 the Company announced its intention to make purchases of its ordinary shares of up to $25 million, due to the Boards continued focus on shareholder returns.
