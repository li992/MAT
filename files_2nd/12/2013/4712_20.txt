In 2013, we emitted 1.252kt of nitrous oxides NOx and 1.405kt of sulphur dioxides SOx.
NOx and SOx are calculated based on fuel usage and standard emission factors.
A small number of sites have NOx and SOx air emissions associated with the roasting and kilning of cereals, used to flavour some of our brands.
These emissions are measured but are minimal to our overall total NOx SOx levels, which remain low compared with background NOx and SOx data.
