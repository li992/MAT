We have continued the development of brownfield sites, with 53% of new homes built on such land this year 2017 59%.

We have continued our programme of installing energy saving technology in our compounds and by the year end 100% were fitted 2017 94%, achieving our target two years early.
Our focus on the energy efficiency of our telehandler fleet also continues, with 88.6% now fitted with more fuel efficient engines 2017 83.5%, and we expect to complete the programme this year depending on the availability of engine technology for our larger machines.
We continue to focus on the design of our new homes, ensuring they are energy efficient so our customers can benefit from reduced running costs.

It should be noted that the 2017 GHG Conversion Factors have seen a 15% decrease in the UK electricity CO2e factor compared to the previous year.
This is due to a significant decrease in coal generation and an increase in gas and renewables generation for UK electricity in 2015 the inventory year on which the 2017 GHG Conversion Factor is based.
This has led to our Scope 2 emissions from electricity consumption falling by 3.4% even though usage has risen by 13.2%.
