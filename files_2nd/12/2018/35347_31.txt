We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy The PSP, BMP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group.
There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.
Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Companys control as a result of the SIP were as follows: Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at Cost at value at value at 1 January acquired transferred 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2018 during year during year 2018 2018 2018 2018 number number number number 000 000 000 SIP 123,282 34,999 88,283 10 317 Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was introduced for directors and senior executives to replace the Bonus Matching Plan.
Under the PSP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 175% of their annual bonus.
Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
50% of the PSP options granted in 2018 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The fair value of the 2018 PSP awards of 2.5 million 2017: 2.8 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.
The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting.
The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the share price at the grant date of 272 pence 2017: 325 pence, expected volatility of 41% 2017: 44%, and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% 2017: 0.13%.

DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or good leaver termination provisions.
The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2018 was 272 pence 2017: 325 pence and the fair value of these awards of 0.4 million 2017: 0.6 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.
The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting.
The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the share price at date of grant, expected volatility of 41% 2017: 44%, and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% 2017: 0.13%.

Bonus Matching Plan BMP Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016.
The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP.
For awards prior to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The fair value of the 2017 and 2016 BMP awards, 0.6 million and 2.6 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three-year vesting periods.
The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting.
No BMP awards were made in 2018.

Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 211 pence 2017: 280 pence, representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules.
The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts.
The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of 1.2 million 2017: 0.9 million is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts.

The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out in the table below: Grant date 28 March 2018 28 March 2018 27 March 2017 27 March 2017 Share price at grant date pence 275 275 328 328 Vesting period 3 years 5 years 3 years 5 years Exercise price pence 211 211 280 280 Dividend yield 5.1% 3.0% 1.8% 2.5% Annual risk-free interest rate 1.22% 1.35% 0.73% 0.90% Expected volatility 40.9% 38.1% 41.2% 37.3% Fair value of options granted pence 80 94 106 103 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three and five years respectively.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 365 pence 2017: 305 pence.
The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 212 pence 2017: 224 pence.

156 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates one defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes.
The Drax Power Group DPG section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS is a defined benefit scheme: a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules.
Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401 K Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.
As part of the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited see note 5.1, employees with defined benefit pension rights were transferred to the Group.
These employees continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the process of setting up a new scheme the Drax 2019 Scheme for the members to transfer into.
Accounting policy Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the contributions.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable and the return on scheme assets excluding interest, is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur.
The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.
Significant estimation uncertainty Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2018 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates four defined contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401 K Plan, for all qualifying employees.
Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Total included in staff costs 8.1 8.1 As at 31 December 2018, contributions of 1.1 million 2017: nil due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 157 SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Defined benefit schemes The breakdown of the defined benefit pension surplus is as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Drax Power Group section of ESPS net surplus liability 18.9 1.2 Drax 2019 Scheme net surplus 3.8 Total net surplus liability recognised in the balance sheet 22.7 1.2 During 2018, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Drax Power Group of the ESPS, which are described in further detail below, resulted in the scheme moving into a position of surplus assets over liabilities.
The scheme rules allow the Group to benefit from any residual surplus upon winding up of the scheme.
As a result, the surplus has been recognised in the balance sheet in full.
Drax Power Group DPG section of ESPS The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS.
Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The scheme has a significant holding in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk is hedged.
Other risks include operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks such as the Government increasing the burden on pension schemes through new legislation and other demographic risks such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group.
The Trustees ensure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016.
The actuarial review at 31 December 2018 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation.
The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost.
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 % p. a.
Discount rate 3.0 2.6 Inflation RPI 3.2 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.8 158 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2018 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they are male 2017: 26 years and for a further 29 years if they are female 2017: 29 years.
Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively 2017: 27 and 30 years respectively.
The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the DPG section of the ESPS is the excess of the fair value of the plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation, determined as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Defined benefit obligation 275.6 306.5 Fair value of plan assets 294.5 305.3 Net surplus liability recognised in the balance sheet 18.9 1.2 The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Included in staff costs note 6.1 : Current service cost 6.8 7.3 Past service cost 0.6 Included in finance costs note 2.5 : Interest on net defined benefit surplus liability 0.1 0.5 Total amounts recognised in the income statement 7.3 7.8 On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that defined benefit schemes should be amended to equalise benefits in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions GMP for men and women.
It is not yet agreed how benefits will be equalised in practice: however, on the grounds that implementation will not lead to any further obligations, the Groups actuarial advisers have initially estimated that the liabilities of the scheme will increase by 0.6m as at the date of the court ruling.
This has been reflected as a past service cost in 2018.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Cumulative actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme at 1 January 57.8 79.2 Actuarial gains on defined benefit pension scheme recognised in the year 15.9 21.4 Cumulative actuarial losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 41.9 57.8 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 306.5 311.4 Current service cost 6.8 7.3 Past service cost 0.6 Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 Interest cost 7.8 8.5 Actuarial gains 23.0 4.8 Benefits paid 23.2 16.0 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 275.6 306.5 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 159 SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The actuarial gains of 23.0 million 2017: 4.8 million reflect gains of 21.8 million arising from changes in financial assumptions 2017: gains of 5.5 million and 1.8 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions 2017: losses of 4.5 million offset by losses arising from scheme experience of 0.6 million 2017: gains of 3.8 million.
The gains due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 3.0% 2017: 2.6% following increases in corporate bond yields.
Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 305.3 281.3 Interest on plan assets 8.0 8.0 Remeasurement losses gains 7.2 16.6 Employer contributions 11.5 15.3 Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 Benefits paid 23.2 16.0 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 294.5 305.3 Employer contributions included payments totalling 5.0 million 2017: 7.5 million to reduce the actuarial deficit.
There were no contributions outstanding at the end of the year 2017: 0.8 million.
The actual return on plan assets in the period was 0.8 million 2017: 24.5 million.
The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Gilts 83.6 104.1 1 Equities 9.8 76.6 2 Fixed interest bonds 50.2 71.6 Property 34.8 32.2 Investment funds 40.4 3 Cash and other assets 75.7 20.8 Fair value of total plan assets 294.5 305.3 Notes: 1 A t 31 December 2018 the schemes long-term asset strategy was: diversified growth funds 35%, direct lending 5%, absolute return bonds 7%, corporate bonds 8%, liability driven investing 29%, long lease property 12%, and cash 5% 2 F ixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds.
Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating i. e. BB or lower 3 O ther assets include 15.5 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market 2017: 17.9 million The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual asset allocation for the scheme.
160 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension surplus at 31 December 2018 to changes in these assumptions: Increase decrease in net surplus % m Discount rate Increase 0.25 13.6 Decrease 0.25 15.2 1 Inflation rate Increase 0.25 13.1 Decrease 0.25 12.3 Life expectancy Increase 1 year 9.2 Decrease 1 year 9.3 Note: 1 The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group 60%, former employees of the Group who are yet to retire 5% and retired pensioners 35%.
The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.
Future contributions The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of 10.1 million to the defined benefit pension plan during the 12 months ended 31 December 2019.
In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as at the 31 March 2016 valuation.
The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of 45 million including an estimate of the impact of future service costs, which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2018 for inclusion in the financial statements.
This valuation has improved since 31 March 2016, in line with the accounting surplus, although this remains subject to a recovery plan.
The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit.
At this point the scheme is expected to be self-sufficient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the valuation.
The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Groups business plan.
The terms of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled.
Accordingly the deficit contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.
Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme On 31 December 2018, the Group purchased a generation business from ScottishPower see note 5.1.
Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement SPA, a number of employees with defined benefit rights transferred to the Group.
The employees in question continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the process of setting up a new scheme for the members to transfer into the Drax 2019 Scheme.
The calculations set out below have been performed on the assumption that the transfer of members and assets into the Drax 2019 Scheme occurs during 2019, and will be in accordance with the terms set out in the SPA and the draft Trust Deed regarding the future operation of the new scheme.
The liabilities and asset values at 31 December 2018 have been calculated based on advice from PwC, an independent qualified actuary.
The liabilities have been calculated using full member by member data as at 16 October 2018, the date of the SPA.
The valuation has been prepared at 31 December 2018 allowing for the accrual of benefits up to the year end date and based on the assumptions set out below.
The valuation includes an allowance for the equalisation of GMP, calculated using an actuarial GMP benefit modelling tool.
The total asset value at 31 December 2018 has been estimated based on a share of funds mechanism agreed with ScottishPower in the SPA.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 161 SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Assumptions have been set using the best information currently available to the Group and based on the Groups expectations of events during 2019 in order to set up the new pension scheme.
In the event that experience in 2019 differs from these estimates, retrospective adjustments may be required to the extent material.
The principal assumptions have been set with reference to the nature and term of the liabilities acquired and are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 % p. a.
Discount rate 3.1 Inflation RPI 3.1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.7 The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Drax 2019 Scheme is the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets to be transferred over the present value of the defined benefit obligation acquired: As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Defined benefit obligation 50.7 Fair value of plan assets 54.5 Net surplus recognised in the balance sheet 3.8 The draft Trust Deed provides for any residual surplus on winding up of the scheme to be returned to the Group.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus.
