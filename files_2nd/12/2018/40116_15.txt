Strategic Report Our role in society ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE SUPPORTING A Low-carbon TRANSITION 72 SSE plc Annual Report 2018 SSEs vision is to be a leading energy provider in a low-carbon world, and it has a significant role to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy.
In light of this, and with increasing scrutiny concerning the management of climate-related impacts, SSE seeks to provide open and transparent disclosures around these issues.
1 The figure for generation emissions adjusts the figure from SSE-owned generation in GB and Ireland to include energy bought in under power purchase agreements.
2 Scope 1 comprises electricity generation, operational vehicles and fixed generation, sulphur hexafluoride emissions and gas consumption in buildings.
3 Scope 2 comprises electricity distribution losses, operational vehicles and fixed generation, sulphur hexafluoride emissions and gas consumption in buildings.
In 2017 18 there was a change in the approach used for Scope 2 data collection.
This change was immaterial to the overall total Scope 2 balance and therefore no restatement was required.
4 Scope 3 comprises emissions that occur outside of the organisation in support of its activities.
Scope 3 emissions include upstream emissions associated with the extraction, refining and transport of raw fuels purchased, SHE Transmission losses, gas sold and business travel.
5 GHG emissions from SGNs activities are excluded SGN reports these separately.
GHG emissions from other Joint Ventures are also excluded.
6 Emissions intensity relative to kWh is calculated against scope 1 emissions only, rather than total emissions.

In 2017, Sustainability Report SSE was awarded a B for its response to the CDP Climate Change Programme.
Half-year Sustainability Statement Governance Post-Paris Climate Change Governance of climate-related issues Scenario Report SSEs Chief Executive has lead responsibility for climate-related issues, including at Board-level.
The Board is responsible for setting the Group strategy direction and, when setting strategic CDP submissions carbon, water, objectives, it considers all material influencing factors including those relating to climatechange.
supply chain and forests Biodiversity Report The Executive Committee is responsible for implementing the Group strategy set by the Board.
It drives climate-related performance programmes across the organisation through its Group GHG and water assurance Safety, Health and Environment Committee, as well as through support from SSEs Sustainability statement team.
In addition to this, climate-related issues are managed within each business unit.
Environment and Climate Change Policy Risk management Managing climate-related risks and low-carbon opportunities Climate change, and the imperative to decarbonise energy systems, creates both risks and opportunities for SSE.
SSE identifies and evaluates risk at both Group and divisional including assets level.
The Group Risk Management Framework has been designed to ensure, amongst other things, that SSE is in a position to address the issue of climate change, whether as a risk or as an opportunity.
This framework is outlined on pages 28 to 33.
Addressing climate change involves mitigation as well as adaptation and this is reflected in SSEs approach to risk management.
Climate change and its impacts are considered throughout SSEs Group Principal Risks.
More detailed analysis of climate-related risks and low-carbon opportunities can be found in SSEs Sustainability Report 2018.
Using resources responsibly Managing water use 3 In 2017 18, SSEs operations abstracted a total of 24 billion m of water compared to 22.7 billion 3 m in 2016 17.
The vast majority was abstracted by SSEs hydro generation operations and 3 is therefore returned almost immediately to the environment only 0.008 billion m, of this 3 water was consumed in 2017 18 compared to 0.005 billion m in 2016 17.
None of SSEs core operations have an impact on water-stressed areas.
Enhanced disclosure around SSEs water use is detailed in its Sustainability Report 2018.

In 2017 18, SSEs thermal generation sites in GB emitted 1,791 tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 5,612 tonnes of oxides of nitrogen.
This compares to 1,546 and 5,555 tonnes respectively in 2016 17.
The rise in air emissions was due to increased running of thermal generation plant in 2017 18.
