SUPPLEMENTARY Supplementary INFORMATION sustainability information Supplementary sustainability information Contributing to sustainable economic growth Environmental and social risk management Employees trained in environmental and social risk management 2018 2017 2016 1 Employees trained 1,308 568 118 1 Employees targeted for training are those in client-facing roles and relevant support teams.
Higher training numbers in 2018 are due to the roll-out of the revised environmental and social risk framework in Commercial Banking and targeted training on topics such as modern slavery Equator Principles Project advisory Project finance mandates Project-related corporate loans mandates 1 2 3 Cat A Cat B Cat C Cat A Cat B Cat C Total 2016 7 6 2 Total 2017 1 9 1 1 2 1 Total 2018 4 7 3 2018 Sector Mining Infrastructure 1 3 1 Oil & gas 1 2 2 Renewables 1 Telecoms Power 1 2 Other Region Greater China North East Asia South Asia 2 ASEAN 1 1 MENAP 2 2 1 Africa 1 1 1 Americas 1 Europe 1 4 Designation Designated 1 2 Non-designated 3 5 Independent review Yes 4 6 No 1 1 Cat A or Category A are projects with potential significant adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented 2 Cat B or Category B are projects with potential limited adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts that are few in number, generally site-specic, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures 3 Cat C or Category C are projects with minimal or no adverse environmental and social risks and or impacts 4 Designation is split into designated and non-designated countries.
Designated countries are deemed by the Equator Principles to have robust environmental and social governance, legislation systems and institutional capacity designed to protect their people and the natural environment.
Non-designated countries are countries that are not found on the list of designated countries.

Refer to the eco-efficiency criteria for more information 2 For environmental reporting purposes, full time employees FTE refers to the Groups headcount at 31 December 2018 3 Scope 3 emissions calculated from total energy consumption from our outsourced global data centres 4 Indirect non-renewable energy refers to purchased electricity from non-renewable sources 5 Indirect renewable energy refers to purchased electricity from off-site renewable sources 6 Direct non-renewable energy refers to the gross caloric values of fuels consumed on-site 7 Direct renewable energy refers to the gross caloric values of renewable fuels consumed on-site 8 On-site renewable energy refers to renewable energy generated and consumed on-site 9 New methodology to measure paper consumption, introduced in 2017, resulted in 2016 data no longer being representative.
It is, therefore, not shown 10 We are reviewing our methodology for measured and scaled-up waste.
Scaled-up waste data is not representative and is therefore not shown 381 SUPPLEMENTARY Supplementary INFORMATION sustainability information Additional notes on environment data The emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018.
This is to allow sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results.
Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting.
This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice.
We use measured data to calculate our energy and water use across our properties, which we then scale up to reect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from.
Measured data is collected from Global Environment Management System GEMS properties, dened as all properties that are over 10,000 square feet for energy and water.
For paper and business travel, it is dened per full-time employee.
Scaled-up data represents measured data taken from a sample of branches, which is then extrapolated to reect the Groups total property footprint in energy and water.
For paper and business travel, it is dened per full-time employee as at the end of the reporting period.
Carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account.
Total energy use is normalised to reect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.
Net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas.
Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation.
Scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 30 countries, based on seating class and distance own.
As we operate largely outside of the UK, all ights domestic or international with ight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy DBEIS as domestic ights have been classied as short haul.
All ights with distance own ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DBEIS as short haul have been classied as medium haul.
The Carbon Trust is our independent third-party assurance provider for greenhouse gas GHG emissions.
In 2018, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were assured by the Carbon Trust, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting.
