OUR GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT: STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Responsibility for shareholder relations rests with the Chief Financial Officer.
The Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction with the corporate broker, ensures that there is effective communication with shareholders on matters such as governance and strategy and that an active dialogue is maintained with investors through a planned programme of investor relations activities.
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the other Directors are available to engage in dialogue with major shareholders as appropriate.
Board members develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders through analysts and brokers briefings and any direct contact initiated by shareholders.
The Board believes that there were appropriate mechanisms in place during the year for the Board to understand the views of shareholders and to communicate with them on matters including governance, remuneration, strategy and performance.
