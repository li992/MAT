The STraTegic reporT governance Financial STaTemenTS addiTional inFormaTion Why is the treatment of our subscriber acquisition and retention costs a critical judgement?
Subscriber acquisition and retention costs are recognised as an expense within other operating costs for the period in which they are incurred.
If subscriber acquisition and retention costs are paid in advance they are recognised as prepayments provided the amounts are able to be measured reliably and are expected to be recoverable.
In some cases, contractual clauses with retailers provide for profitsharing based on the recognised and paid revenue.
In these cases we recognise an expense when the revenue is earned from the customer and a corresponding liability to pay that retailer.
In some cases we need to exercise judgement in assessing whether we have an upfront obligation based on the contractual terms.
