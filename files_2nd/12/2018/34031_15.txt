We aim to protect and enhance the net gain can be achieved.
Using the local environment wherever we build.
56% of our council biodiversity impact guidelines it new developments now have a biodiversity was demonstrated that despite measures action plan.
to counteract the impact, there would still be an overall loss of biodiversity of about five hectares of amenity grassland.
However, the site is in close proximity to anancient woodland, Park Wood a unique habitat for a variety of species, including woodpecker, nuthatch and a range of butterflies, reptiles and amphibians.
With the woodland experiencing some decline, the local council put together a costed 30-year management plan for improving the condition of the woodland, creating biodiversity gains.
Through the Group contributing financially to this plan, the loss of amenity grassland habitat will be offset by the improvement of the condition of a 2.2 hectare compartment of the ancient woodland, creating an overall net gain for biodiversity.
This arrangement will also act to provide improved access for residents to an important wild space, with potential for education and learning about nature, as well as the enjoyment and health benefits that access to these environments can bring.
