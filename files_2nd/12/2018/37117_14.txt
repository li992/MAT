In 2017, Mollie fulfilled a dream with her climbing partner and guide, Jon Gupta of Mountain Expeditions and her trusted Sherpa team of Lhakpa Wongchu Sherpa and Lila Bahadur Tamang, and stood on the summit of Mount Everest 8,848m for the second time.
On this occasion, Mollie had reached the roof of the world by ascending the notoriously windy and cold north side of the mountain from Tibet.
In 2012, at the age of 21, Mollie ascended the mountain from the south side.
Now, aged 26 she holds the record of being the youngest woman in the world to have successfully ascended the worlds highest peak from both north and south.
The JD Foundation applaud Mollies expedition as an outstanding achievement.
The trustees were delighted to donate 8,848, being 1 for every metre that she climbed, to her chosen charity in recognition of her exceptional achievement.
