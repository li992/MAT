Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to employees long-term incentives, executive share options and SaveAs You Earn.
These payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value of options The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2018 2017 Executive SAYE Nil price Executive SAYE Nil price options options options options Share price at grant date pence 1,272.0 1,089.0 1,295.0 1,487 1,434 1,487 Option exercise price pence - 909.0 1,300.0 1,488 1,185 - Volatility % 29.2% 30.2% 29.3% 29.2% 28.4% 31.0% Option life years 2.2 3.3 2.2 3.0 3.3 2.9 Risk-free interest rate % 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % 3.3% 3.8% 3.2% 2.9% 3.1% 2.9% 165 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Financial statements Financial statements 35.
