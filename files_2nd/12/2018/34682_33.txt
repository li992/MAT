Other Information Responsible Business Performance Measures Non-financial key performance indicators KPIs We engaged  LLP PwC to undertake a limited assurance engagement using the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 Revised : Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410: Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements.
PwC have provided an unqualified opinion in relation to 19 KPIs that are identified with the symbol and feature on pages 8, 19, 59, 61, 63, 85, 97, 103 and below.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in terms of the risk assessment procedures which include an understanding of internal control, as well the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.
Non-financial performance and in particular, greenhouse gas quantification, is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information.
It is important to read the responsible business information in the Annual Report and Accounts 2018 in the context of PwCs full limited assurance opinion and Centricas Basis of Reporting, which are available at centrica.
