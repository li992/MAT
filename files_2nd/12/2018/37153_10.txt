Johnson Matthey Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report A new sustainable business framework to support value creation With our science, understanding and vision, we believe we have much to contribute to a more sustainable future.
In March 2017 we came to the end of our Sustainability 2017 programme.
In realising our Sustainability 2017 Vision, we engaged our people, made Johnson Matthey a safer place to work and built our reputation as a world leading manufacturer of sustainable technologies.
Over ten years we transformed our business and our sustainability performance, halving our operational carbon footprint and our use of energy and water per unit of sales.
Sustainability 2017 laid the foundations for our new brand: inspiring science, enhancing life: and our vision for a cleaner, healthier world.
Our refreshed business strategy has stemmed from these.
All of this provided a powerful impetus for rethinking our business and how we wanted to further embed and integrate sustainability.
It was time to move forward and increase our ambition for building a sustainable business.
