Additional information 200 Managing our environmental impacts performance data We remain committed to working in partnership with our stakeholders and partners to mitigate the impact of climate change and the Group continues to maintain full environmental legislative compliance.
Our environmental performance has remained strong in 2018 retaining a CDP B rating and a water disclosure C rating for 2018.
Divisional tCO2e for KPI period Total Group emissions decreased again year-on-year, to 865,311 tCO e. Although this is a marginal decrease it needs to be considered 2 in relation to the overall increase in passenger km.
North America and ALSA reported an increase of 3% and 1.5% respectively but this increase was mitigated by the strong UK performance.
We saw total UK emissions drop year-on-year from 237,919 to 230,222 tonnes, a reduction of 3%, with only a small 4,038 tCO e attributable to the reduction from the Midland Metro exit.
The Scope 1 combustion of fuel and operation of facilities increase of less than 1% year-on-year and 7% for the KPI period is to be expected with the Group growth over that period but the increase is less than passenger km growth and demonstrates the improving efficiency of our fleet.
This decrease is significant considering the Group increase of nearly 20% in passenger km.

Water consumption reduction has also exceed the KPI period target by over 50% and reduced year-on-year by 4%.
However, some challenges still remain with a year-on-year increase in site energy use and waste to landfill.
As with last year, some of these changes are the result of improved reporting and accuracy of data but we will review this data at a site level and set improvement targets for the next period.
