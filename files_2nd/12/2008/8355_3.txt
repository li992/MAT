Interserve text 2009 24 3 09 09:58 Page 4 Sustainability We are committed to helping our clients meet their sustainability challenges and to providing a sustainable business for our employees, our communities and our shareholders.
We have developed a Sustainable Development Guide using RENEWABLES as a framework for managing our 10 sustainability priorities.
Each of these is represented by one letter within the word, and together they are aligned to the governments guiding principles and shared UK priorities.
Our RENEWABLES programme is helping us to manage our environmental, social and economic responsibilities while bringing added value to our clients.
The case studies identified here and described throughout the Operational review demonstrate how we have put the framework into practice and the benefits it brings.
