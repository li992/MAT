All companies need different streams of revenue and growth to spread risk and Alliance Trust PLC is no different.
Recent stock market activity gives an ideal illustration of why this is necessary.
Over time, we expect this subsidiary to produce a substantial return on the capital invested and also an increasing revenue stream, both of which will benefit the Company and our shareholders.
