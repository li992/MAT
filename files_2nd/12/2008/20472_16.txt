This has been in place since July 2008 and the average red grades amounted to 0.51%.
91% of the measures throughout the period achieved a green grade.
Each quarter the Central Complaints Department produce a report analysing the complaints received and causes.
The report provides a summary of the root causes of the complaints and actions taken to reduce the risk of complaints due to specific procedures or staff behaviour.
Community Admiral has adopted a charitable giving policy, which supports the local communities in which its employees live and work.
During 2008, 211 local organisations were helped with a total donation of 42,791.
Financial support is an important part of our commitment to our local communities and our customers.
We contribute both as a Company and as individuals through a variety of schemes including a matching scheme whereby the Company matches funds raised for charity in the workplace.
Environment The Groups impact on the environment stems from its use of resources to run its offices in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and its overseas branches in Spain, Germany, Italy and Canada.
The Group does not own the properties that it occupies and is, therefore, reliant upon the cooperation of the managing agents of the properties to make changes that could reduce the consumption of energy and water.
The figures quoted include all of the Groups offices.
The Group Company Secretary is responsible for the Groups approach to its impact upon the environment.
The Group is committed to: Raising and maintaining staff awareness of, and ensuring that employees are actively engaged in, activities to reduce the impact of the Groups operations on the environment.
Measuring, monitoring and reporting on the key aspects of the Groups environmental performance and regularly reviewing progress to reduce the amount of resources consumed per employee.
Reporting key environmental performance indicators, taking into account the ABIs Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure and guidance provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Defra.

The Carbon emissions have been calculated using the Carbon Trust Calculator which uses the emissions factors published by Defra in April 2008.
Energy The main source of the Groups carbon emissions is the consumption of electricity and gas for its two main UK offices.
The Cardiff head office is the older and least efficient, built in the 1960s and housing just over 1,200 people.
The Swansea office, housing 1,100 staff was built in 2006 and is therefore a much more efficient building.
The other UK offices are located in Cardiff and Newport.
During the last quarter of 2007 electricity supply to the Cardiff office was switched to Green electricity which has been excluded from the carbon emission calculation in the table above and has lead to a significant reduction in the Groups absolute CO emissions.
2 Environmental Risks The Group has reviewed the risks facing its business operations as a result of climate change.
The volume of motor insurance claims for any given portfolio of business is to a large degree dependent upon weather conditions.
The risk associated with climate change is the potential change to claims frequency through the impact of more extreme weather patterns.
It is virtually impossible to model the potential impact of climate change on claims frequency as the actual climate change induced outcome for the UK is unknown.
However, the Group does assess the potential costs associated with a number of disaster scenarios such as a major storm in the South East, major flood on the East Coast, and a complete flooding of the Thames in the London area.
The Group purchases reinsurance cover to provide significant protection in the event of catastrophes of this nature.
