30 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Our impact on society Introduction The terms corporate social responsibility and sustainability have come to mean different things to different companies, but at Pearson, our goal remains simple: to be a socially responsible company that has a positive impact on society.
We try to fulfil that aspiration by following a four part strategy based on: 1. sustainable business practice: 2. valuing our people: 3. commitment to fairness and quality: 4. supporting active citizenship.
Each year, we set our targets to help us focus on the way we impact on society across the company and across the world.
Youll find the review of last years targets and the new ones for 2009 at the end of this section and an overview of our work over last year in our Impact on society report for 2008: Learn more at www.
