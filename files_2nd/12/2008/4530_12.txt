Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 33 CARBON FOOTPRINT AND ENERGY USAGE ENERGY USAGE The sizeable contribution of electricity to our carbon footprint places reduction on the forefront of our energy strategy.
Key elements of this include: Improving the energy usage of new stores: by using construction materials wherever possible which aid energy eciency: installing energy ecient heating and air conditioning systems: and using low energy LED lighting where appropriate.
Our target is to reduce the carbon footprint of new stores by 30 per cent.
In 2008 to date, we did not meet this target, achieving a reduction of 17 per cent.
However, much of this was due to longer operating hours and overnight re-stocking of stores, which pushed up energy use.
Increasing the proportion of green energy: in 2008 we tripled our use of green electricity and are using green power predominantly from wind sources to meet at least 50 per cent of a new stores electricity usage.
Looking forward, Debenhams has recently signed a landmark deal with Do The Right Thing is the banner for the Company-wide energy efficiency Scottish Power to supply all its UK stores and properties with electricity and waste reduction programme.
35 MW of green energy a month, enough to light and heat 50,000 homes will be supplied from the Black Laws wind farm near Shotts, o the M8 Glasgow to Edinburgh motorway.
Raising awareness of energy eciency throughout the Company: new initiatives include a major head oce programme to encourage employees to take responsibility for their own energy usage under the banner Do The Right Thing.
The storewide energy eciency programme which uses the magazine style E!
publication as its principal communication tool has continued to good eect.
Incentives are awarded to both individual employees and to a stores prize fund for success in energy eciency initiatives.
Reducing distribution centre DC energy usage: following the success of last years re-lamping project at the Brackmills DC, lighting eciencies have been further enhanced in the Peterborough DC with the introduction of light sensing on the mezzanine oor.
Based upon our planned projects, the findings and recommendations from AEA, our focus for 2008 09 will be: Review best practice in stores, particularly in those whose energy consumption was highlighted to be above the Good Practice benchmark.
Replacement of tungsten halogen store lights with those with a greater eciency.
Re-lighting jewellery cabinets with LED bulbs, thereby substantially reducing the energy consumed and heat generated by these displays.
Swapping electrical circuits to ensure lights do not need to remain on overnight.
