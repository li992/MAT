In 2008 FPM personnel monitored and tested the effects of moistening exposed and potentially dusty surfaces in reducing dust pollution.
They concluded that this moistening cut air pollution but had no negative effect on subsoil or surface water pollution.
As a result of these experiments FPM now carries out extensive watering of work faces after blasting and in the dry season.
This also enabled the company to decrease expenditure on disposal costs of stripping material.
