IG Group Holdings plc Group Operating and Financial Review Report and Financial Statements 2008 23 Key performance indicators continued Earnings per share The Group seeks to maximise the growth in earnings per share over time in order to maximise shareholder value.
The Groups Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs and directors bonuses are linked to growth in earnings per share and growth in the Companys share price.
Further details of LTIPs and directors bonuses are set out in the directors remuneration report and note 25 to the financial statements.
Diluted earnings per share were 20.28p compared with 14.52p in the previous year, an increase of 39.7%.
The directors consider that the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended 31 May 2005 and prior do not fully reflect changes in the Groups capital structure referred to above.
In order to facilitate comparison of performance over the periods to 31 May 2005, normalised earnings per share was established.
Normalised earnings per share were not calculated for the year ended 31 May 2006 or subsequently.
Normalised earnings per share represents earnings adjusted for normalising items, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue and to be issued, adjusted for normalising items.
Normalising adjustments to earnings comprise the impact, net of tax, of exceptional administrative costs, interest and charges on debt finance, redeemable preference share interest payable and tax items relating to the financing structure.
Normalising adjustments to the number of shares comprise the impact of restating the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue prior to a subdivision and re-designation on 31 May 2005 to the equivalent weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the period and treating the issue of new ordinary shares at the time of the Companys flotation as if it had taken place prior to 1 June 2002.
Employees The Groups continued growth is highly dependent upon attracting and retaining high calibre employees.
The Group pays performance related bonuses to all staff and has made awards under LTIPs to key personnel.
In addition, the opportunity to acquire shares under a Share Incentive Plan SIP has been made available to all UK staff.
