Go the extra mile awards One of the key differentiators between easyJet and other low-cost carriers is its people.
Regardless of where in the business people are working, they work hard and give their all.
For this reason, easyJet runs an employee incentive scheme called the GEM Going the Extra Mile awards.
The awards are designed to recognise employees who go beyond what can rightly be expected of them in the role they are in.
There are two different types of GEMs which recognise different areas of an employees contribution and these are matched by an exciting range of rewards.
This year, 152 people have been recognised with a GEM award.
E. Charitable donations easyJets charity policy is to recognise and devote efforts to a single charity each year.
This year the charity, chosen for the third time, was The Anthony Nolan Trust.
easyJet has worked with The Anthony Nolan Trust to help promote the Trust, with activities including onboard collections, a click and give campaign from the website, staff fundraising, being featured in the in-flight magazine and other public relations activities.
528,266 was raised to 30 September 2008 and the Anthony Nolan Trust received coverage in European press, UK regional press and National television.
F. Ethical easyJet is committed to the highest standards of corporate behaviour from its Directors and employees.
easyJet requires all of its people to perform their duties with efficiency and diligence and to always behave to customers and other people alike with courtesy and decorum.
easyJets procurement process has strong controls to ensure that any dealings are open and transparent, and avoids any suspicion of conflicts of interest.
In particular, easyJet has specific clauses in each employees contract of employment, which set tight rules in respect of accepting gifts or gratuities.
This year easyJet took the opportunity to reinforce the ruling by refreshing and communicating the policy.
Gifts and gratuities Some easyJet employees are sent gifts from various companies throughout the year.
The airline has a strict policy that prevents any employee accepting gifts over a nominal value.
Every Christmas and less frequently, at various times through the year easyJet holds a staff raffle of all the gifts that are received.
Every employee across Europe is entered into the draw and allocated a unique reference number.
Numbers are then drawn at random and winners have the gifts sent directly to their home in time for Christmas.
