Summary Corporate Responsibility Statement 15 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Increasingly we are focusing upon the sustainability of the homes that we build.
We aim to minimise the effects of the building process and create vibrant sustainable communities where people wish to live.
To achieve this objective we have established five strategic principles that steward our day-to-day activities.
Protection of the environment in which we are working.
Prudent use of natural resources.
Creating environments that have the potential to add to economic growth and employment opportunities.
Social considerations that recognise the needs for a changing and advancing population.
The development of communities that will endure and where people will aspire to live.
Protection of the environment The construction process affects the environment in many different ways.
It is our aim to minimise the effect of our development operations and reclaim former brownfield sites, returning them to community use.
This year 79% of our developments have been built on brownfield sites well above the Government target of 60%.
The majority of these sites are located in urban areas, where there is greater potential to affect neighbouring communities.
Prior to construction, we test all sites with impact assessment and sustainability studies.
The preparation of these documents, in conjunction with public consultation exercises, allows us to understand the unique characteristics of the sites we develop and to identify the appropriate methods of remediation and development.
We have deliberately chosen timber frame as a principal building material.
This year 30% of our homes have been constructed using timber frame.
Timber is a natural and renewable resource that offers significant environmental benefits saving around 4 tonnes of CO for every home built.
All our timber suppliers are either accredited to Forest Stewardship Synergy at Park 25, Redhill, Surrey Council FSC or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification PEFC standards.
Wherever possible we aim to reuse materials and this year 106,000 tonnes of demolition material has been recycled.
2008 marks the sixth successive year for reporting the progress we are During the year Site Waste Management Plans have been introduced.

They will advance the management of waste materials and increase the Since the publication of our first report in 2003 we have made volume of material that is able to be re-used.
The objective is, ultimately, considerable progress in managing our environmental footprint and what to achieve 100% recycling on-site.
this means to the many communities around the country where Bellway is working.
Prudent use of natural resources Our sustainability strategy helps us to respond to the numerous social, Earlier this year we undertook a detailed review of our supply chain economic and environmental challenges that we face.

of building materials is a key component in limiting the effects of climate change.
Many of the products we use display high environmental credentials.
For example, Thermalite is a brand of aerated concrete block containing up to 80% recycled material pulverised fuel ash which achieves an A rating in the Green Guide and offers high standards of insulation.

Recognising the unique characteristics that combine to create sustainable communities lies at the heart of our business.

After 10 years of development, this 1,200 home community provides a high quality, attractive and derelict land back to stimulating environment for residents.
The scheme provides a wide range of accommodation and tenure, meeting both the local and wider economic use, the needs of the Ipswich and Suffolk area.
In North Solihull, we are engaged in a major regeneration scheme that regeneration is creating will result in new homes, new schools, more open space and new village centres.
The overall aim of the scheme is to bring about physical valuable training change to a deprived area and to bridge the economic divide between north and south Solihull.
Key to the success of this scheme is the and employment.
partnership we have with the community and key stakeholders: a fact that was recognised this year when the scheme won the Regeneration and Renewal Partnership of the Year Award, with the judges citing that community involvement was at the forefront of the scheme.
Similarly, in the Meden Valley, on the borders of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, we are working with the development agency, Meden Valley Making Places, to regenerate the neglected former coal mining areas.
As well as returning derelict land back to economic use, the scheme is creating valuable training and employment opportunities for the local community.
To date, more than 100 local people have been employed across a range of building trades.
Apprenticeship schemes have also been established which work in conjunction with local colleges so that apprentices develop building skills and attain recognised qualifications.
