Waste management and recycling During 2009, individual press sites have targeted waste reduction from press operations through their ISO 14001 environmental management system programmes.
We have also worked with our group-wide contractor to optimise treatment of press wastes, so that they are either recycled or re-used wherever possible.
In 2009, we achieved an overall reduction in the quantity of press wastes generated, compared with the previous year.
For example, for the highest volume liquid waste streams blanket wash and CTP developer we achieved reductions of 15% and 42% respectively.
