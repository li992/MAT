12 Directors Report | Business Environment The challenges Pricing pressure Business Environment The growing demand for healthcare continues to increase pressure on payer budgets.
Whilst payers may recognise the need to reward innovation, they have a duty to spend their limited financial resources wisely.

Generic versions of drugs that are no longer Expanding patient populations patent protected also compete in the market.
Manufacturers of generic drugs price them at a significantly lower level than the innovator equivalents.
This is partly because generic manufacturers do not invest the same amounts in R&D or market development as research-based pharmaceutical companies, and therefore do not need to recoup that investment.
Such competition generally occurs when patents expire but can also occur where the validity of patents is being disputed or has been successfully challenged before expiry.
In addition, competition can occur when a generic medicine in the same product class as an innovator product a product which does not yet have a generic equivalent enters the market and competes to meet the same medical need.
