At Thomas Cook Group, our response to challenging market conditions is to work harder and go further to make dreams come true for our customers.
We recognise the many virtues of travel, the positive cultural exchange and the boost to local economies, but we are also aware of the potential impact on the environment, societies and local cultures.
The travel and tourism industry has a responsibility to operate in a sustainable way and Thomas Cook, which founded its business with clear social and educational intentions, is proactive in this area.
We aim to have sustainability at the core of our business and feature it as an integral part of our strategy, particularly when it comes to the environment.
These responsibilities no longer sit on the periphery: their importance represents a genuine business risk.
Society, customers, investors, governments and communities no longer look for, but demand that both time and money be invested in the preservation and protection of the incredible people and places we come into contact with.
