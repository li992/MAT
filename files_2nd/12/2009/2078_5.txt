Depletion of reserves due to production was offset by the addition of reserves in the revised mine plan as a result of changes in economic assumptions.
ROM run of mine leach stockpiles for low-grade oxide, supergene sulphide mineralisation and transitional sulphides.
6 Pinto Valley The Pinto Valley mine and mill operations were placed on care and maintenance status as of 20 January 2009 due to depressed copper prices.
Changes to the intact reserves are due to depletion by production only.
The sulphide stockpiles were removed from reserve status due to the tenuous long-term viability of remnant mineralisation in the stockpile.
7 Olympic Dam The increase in overall Ore Reserve is due to additional mineralisation being available for conversion to Probable Reserves.
8 Antamina The increase in reserves is the result of a drilling program completed in April 2008 that identified additional mineralisation which has been incorporated into the November 2008 mine plan.

7 Our WAIO reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine, except the Cattle Gorge mine part of Mt Goldsworthy JV Northern, which is an operating mine on a standard Western Australian mining lease.
We are required to obtain certain State Government approvals including environmental and heritage clearances before we commence mining operations on a particular area.
We have included in our reserves areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding but where, based on the technical investigations we carry out as part of our mine planning process and our knowledge and experience of the approvals process, we expect that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current life of mine schedule.
8 Jimblebar Increase in MM ore reserve due to addition of new deposit South Jimblebar.
9 Samarco reserves have substantially increased as a result of a the inclusion of additional mineralisation in the mine plan as a result of extensive drilling programs, and b completing studies of product specifications that have enabled the extension of the expected economic life of the mine.

The EPC is due for renewal on 17 October 2009 and an application to convert to a mining lease has been lodged with the Queensland State Government Mines Department.
New Hope Collieries previously quoted underground resources only.
11 Appin The total resource has increased as a result of the inclusion of coal in the adjacent exploration licence A248 due to active exploration in the area during FY2009.
Additional resources have also been declared in a new mining lease, ML1574, which was acquired as a result of a lease exchange agreement with Gujarat NRE Minerals Limited.
Active exploration has resulted in an upgrade of resources from inferred and indicated to indicated and measured.

4 Total Coal Reserve tonnes is the sum of Proved and Probable Coal Reserve estimates, which includes allowances for diluting materials, and for losses that occur when the coal is mined, and are at the moisture content when mined.
Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes is the tonnage of coal available, at specified moisture and air-dried quality, for sale after the beneficiation of the Total Coal Reserve.
Note that where the coal is not beneficiated, the Total Coal Reserve tonnes are the Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes, with moisture adjustment where applicable.
5 Saraji Changes to the reserve are attributed to an updated geological model, revised exclusion zones associated with the Phillips and Spring Creek diversions, and revised economic assumptions.
6 Norwich Park The increase in reserves is mainly attributable to an updated geological model.
7 Blackwater The Blackwater deposit is sensitive to movements in pricing and cost assumptions.
The increase in reserves is mainly attributable to revised economic assumptions.
The marketable thermal coal component of the overall Marketable Coal Reserve is estimated to be 90mt at 6,900 kilo-calories per kilogram Kcal kg calorific value.
8 Gregory Crinum The 2008 reserve estimation was based on the previous product specifications where both 6.5% ash coking and 13% ash thermal products were produced.
Changes to the Gregory Low Ash GGLA product specification has resulted in the adoption of a single 7.5% ash coking product.
It is anticipated that Gregory Crinum will continue to produce a single 7.5% ash coking product.
9 South Walker Ck The reserve changes are due to revised economic assumptions and tenement increases.
The marketable reserve includes an estimated 90mt of Pulverised Coal Injection PCI product and 11mt thermal coal product with an average calorific value of 7,500Kcal kg.
10 Poitrel-Winchester The marketable PCI coal component of the overall Marketable Coal Reserve is estimated to be 12mt at 7,560Kcal kg calorific value.
11 Appin The increase in reserves is a result of the exploration program carried out throughout the year.

5 Douglas-Middelburg Douglas is now reported with Middelburg.
6 Optimum Optimum mine was sold effective 1 July 2008 and is no longer reported.
7 Davel is an underground only resource with no open-cut potential and as a result the seam thickness cut-off was increased to 1.20m.
The low quality B-Seam was also excluded from the resources due to its erratic occurrence within the deposit.
8 Mt Arthur Coal The open-cut coal limits were extended as a result of a feasibility study.
Reclassification of the resources to open-cut allowed the minimum seam thickness cut-off to be revised, which also allowed the inclusion of seams not previously available to underground mining.
This resulted in a resource increase.

Our reserve is within existing mining leases.
We have included reserves beyond the current mine lease term and approval where, based on our knowledge and experience of the approvals process and our technical investigations as part of the planning process, we expect that extension to the lease period and approvals will be obtained in the normal course of business and in a time frame that is commensurate with the current life of mine schedule.
10 Cerrejn Coal Company The reduction in the Marketable Reserve is due to production depletion, redesign of the pit and introduction of a beneficiation factor which is now applicable to the total reserve.

The two key measures are profit attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group and Underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT is the internally defined key financial measure used by management for monitoring the performance of our operations.
We explain the calculations and why we use this measure in section 3.6.
Our financial results demonstrate the success of our strategy in delivering a consistently strong performance throughout the cycle.
Our portfolio of long-life, low-cost and diversified assets continued to yield strong margins and cash flows, despite the pressures of the current economic environment.
Our low financial and operational leverage and a strong balance sheet enabled us to continue to invest in future growth.

Third party sales We differentiate sales of our production from sales of third party products due to the significant difference in profit margin earned on these sales.
The table below shows the breakdown between our production which includes marketing of equity production and third party products.
2 Operating profit divided by revenue.
We engage in third party trading for three reasons: In providing solutions for our customers, sometimes we provide products that we do not produce, such as a particular grade of coal.
To meet customer needs and contractual commitments, we may buy physical product from third parties and manage risk through both the physical and financial markets.
Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our own assets means that we sometimes source third party materials to ensure a steady supply of product to our customers.
The active presence in the commodity markets provides us with physical market insight and commercial knowledge.
From time to time, we actively engage in these markets in order to take commercial advantage of business opportunities.
These trading activities provide not only a source of revenue, but also a further insight into planning, and can, in some cases, give rise to business development opportunities.
116 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2009 3.7 Liquidity and capital resources As a result of our record production volumes and record prices in many of our key commodities over the past several years, we have generated very strong cash flows throughout our operations.
Despite the economic downturn and changing market conditions, we generated record net operating cash flows in FY2009.
These cash flows have been fundamental to our ability to internally fund our existing operations, maintain a pipeline of growth projects and return capital to shareholders through dividends.
Our priority for cash is to reinvest in the business.
In line with our strategy, we have grown our business rapidly and consistently through project developments and acquisitions.
Through a combination of borrowings and payments to shareholders, we manage our balance sheet with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing that we believe optimise our costs of capital and return on capital employed.
Net operating cash flows are our principal source of cash.
We also raise cash from debt financing to manage temporary fluctuations in liquidity arrangements and to refinance existing debt.
Our liquidity position is supported by our strong and stable credit rating and committed debt facilities.

In pursuing the Corporate Objective, we have committed to the highest level of governance and strive to foster a culture that values and rewards exemplary ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.
Our approach to governance is predicated on the belief that there is a link between high-quality governance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Our expectations of our employees and those to whom we contract business are set out in our Code of Business Conduct.
This statement outlines our system of governance.
Shareholders are reminded that we operate as a single economic entity under a Dual Listed Company DLC structure with a unified Board and management.
We have primary listings in Australia and the UK and are registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE.
In formulating our governance framework, the regulatory requirements in Australia, the UK and the US have been taken into account, together with prevailing standards of best practice.
Where governance principles vary across these jurisdictions the Board has resolved to adopt what we consider to be the better of the prevailing standards.
It is our view that governance is not just a matter for the Board: a good governance culture must be fostered throughout the organisation.
The current economic and business environment underscores the need for continued high standards of corporate governance.
There is a heightened level of interest in companies approaches to risk management and assurance.
While the Board and the Risk and Audit Committee RAC are at the apex of the Groups risk management and assurance framework, the diagram in section 5.5.
1 highlights one additional aspect of BHP Billitons approach the use of Customer Sector Group Risk and Audit Committees CSG RACs, chaired by a Board RAC member.
While CSG RACs are management committees, and therefore do not entail any delegation of responsibility from the Boards RAC, the Board believes that the link back to the RAC facilitates a deeper understanding of risk management and assurance issues throughout the Group.
This is also clearly a time where engagement with shareholders is more important than ever.
As representatives of shareholders accountable to them for the Groups performance, it is a key part of the Boards approach to governance to ensure shareholders views are heard and understood.
The Board governs the Group consistent with our long-stated business strategy and commitment to a transparent and high-quality governance system.

Performance evaluation for executives The performance of executives and other senior employees is reviewed on an annual basis.
For the most senior executives members of the GMC, this review includes their contribution, engagement and interaction at Board level.
The annual performance review process that we employ considers the performance of executives against criteria designed to capture both what is achieved and how it is achieved.
All performance assessments of executives consider how effective they have been in undertaking their role: what they have achieved against their specified key performance indicators: how they match up to the behaviours prescribed in our leadership model and how those behaviours align with the BHP Billiton Charter values.
The assessment is therefore holistic and balances absolute achievement with the way performance has been delivered.
Progression within the Company is driven equally by personal leadership behaviours and capability to produce excellent results.
A performance evaluation as outlined above was conducted for all members of the GMC in FY2009.
For the Chief Executive Officer, the performance evaluation was led by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of all the non-executive Directors, drawing on guidance from the Remuneration Committee.

are classified as foreign private issuers and both have American Depositary Receipts listed on the NYSE.
This Corporate Governance Statement was approved by the Board on 8 September 2009 and signed on its behalf by: We have reviewed the governance requirements currently applicable to foreign private issuers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act US including the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules of the NYSE and are satisfied that we comply with those requirements.
Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual has instituted Don Argus a broad regime of corporate governance requirements for Chairman NYSE-listed companies.
Under the NYSE rules, foreign private 8 September 2009 issuers, such as ourselves, are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the requirements of Section 303A, except for the rule relating to compliance with Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain notification provisions contained in Section 303A of the Listed Company Manual.
11 of the Listed Company Manual, however, requires us to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US listed companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards.
Following a comparison of our corporate governance practices with the requirements of Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that would otherwise currently apply to foreign private issuers, the following significant differences were identified: The NYSE rules require listed companies to have a Compensation Remuneration Committee composed entirely of independent directors.
The Board considers that all members of the Remuneration Committee are independent, however notes that the test of independence set out in the Boards Policy on Independence differs in some respects from that prescribed by the NYSE.
The NYSE rules permit the Group as a foreign private issuer to follow home practice rules, both in considering the independence of Directors and in the composition of its Remuneration Committee.
Our Nomination Committee Terms of Reference charter do not include the purpose of developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the corporation.
We believe that this task is integral to the governance of the Group and is therefore best dealt with by the Board as a whole.
Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure that their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the external auditor unless the companys governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters.
While the RAC is directly responsible for remuneration and oversight of the External Auditor, the ultimate responsibility for appointment and retention of the External Auditor rests with our shareholders, in accordance with UK law and our constitutional documents.
The RAC does, however, make recommendations to the Board on these matters, which are in turn reported to shareholders.
While the Board is satisfied with its level of compliance with the governance requirements in Australia, the UK and the US, it recognises that practices and procedures can always be improved, and there is merit in continuously reviewing its own standards against those in a variety of jurisdictions.
The Boards program of review will continue throughout the year ahead.
