policies rests with the Board and implementation thereof lies with the We continue to incorporate best practice into our designs for future CR group, which is also tasked with periodically reviewing the policies developments through the creation, review and updating of Sustainability to ensure they remain relevant and adhere to best practice.
Notable successes in 2009 include the award of a High Quality Environment HQE rating for our proposed extension to Italie 2 shopping centre in Paris and the creation of a Sustainable Implementation Plan SIP for our submission for an urban regeneration programme near Lyon.
This will be used as a blueprint for future SIPs, including Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille, a development we acquired in December 2009 and where we expect to start on site in late 2010.
As we did not start any new developments, a number of targets we set for the year were no longer relevant.
Instead we focused our efforts on environmental initiatives in the managed portfolio which offered immediate impacts on both carbon emissions and costs.
The success of this strategy is evident in the Connected Reporting Framework section, but less so in our targets, which until now have tended to be based on discrete projects.
Following feedback from Bureau Veritas, who we contracted to carry out a review of our data collection in 2008, we have changed our approach to targets for 2010, setting a smaller number of clearly auditable targets alongside a series of commitments for both assets and developments.
taking into consideration a 19% increase in opening hours solution at the shopping centre, the like-for-like year-on-year reduction in energy consumption achieved by the projects in 2009, two projects were introduced at westQuay was between 31% and 35%, exceeding the original shopping centre which are designed to reduce projection.
the forecast payback period for the projects energy consumption by around 30%: is less than three years, based on a cost of 510,000 and installation of voltage optimisation vO equipment estimated annual energy savings of 184,000. on incoming electricity supplies.
Prior to installation, westQuay would have qualified in replacement of existing t8 fluorescent tubes with its own right under the CrC tax scheme, as its annual more efficient t5 alternatives, together with the consumption exceeds 6,000 mwh.
However, the savings introduction of a system which allows lights to achieved by the projects means the centre no longer operate at 10% of their capacity in low-use areas falls under CrC, saving a projected 40,000 p. a. in CrC when nobody is present.
if this tax reduction is factored in, the projects payback period is less than two years.
