Signature Flight Support investing in a sustainable future Utilising more energy and environmentally effi cient technologies combined with green design and building practices, lowers BBA Aviations building and operating costs and reduces our impact on the environment in the long-term.
It is also valued by our customers and employees, all of whom benefi t from improved facilities and a more comfortable environment.
In April 2009, Signature completed a full renovation of the executive terminal and two existing hangars at San Francisco International Airport, extending the footprint of the terminal by 30% and incorporating new, sustainable, architectural features, and using environmentally friendly materials and technologies.
Through the use of light harvesting, a more effi cient heating and air conditioning system and the installation of energy-saving lighting and occupancy sensors in the hangars, electricity usage at the facility has fallen signifi cantly and other protocols have successfully reduced waste.
The project has been submitted to the US Green Building Council for certifi cation in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Commercial Interiors LEED-CI programme and key elements of the renovation are now standard in other renovation projects across the global Signature network.

Following a number of years in which Signature had been very successful in securing large crossnetwork customers, in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009, management focused more attention on other users of the network and as a result increased market share of these customers.

In response to the decline in market activity, Signature reduced headcount by 142 full-time equivalents FTEs early in 2009, and in the second half of the year introduced demand based staffi ng which reduced headcount by a further 203 FTEs, placing greater emphasis on part-time staff at peak times to better match staff availability, and therefore service, to customer demand.
