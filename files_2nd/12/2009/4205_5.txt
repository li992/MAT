manufacturing operations at the end of In 2007, a new Group SHE Manual was 2009.
For example, in 2009 the site at produced to combine the best practices Bromborough, UK was closed and all data available from Croda and Uniqema relating to the site has been removed following the acquisition of Uniqema in from the statistics.
This document provides the framework upon which the individual site SHE management systems are based.
Sites are regularly audited for compliance with this manual and all Croda manufacturing sites have the objective of certification to BS EN ISO 14001 and BS OHSAS 18001 by the end of 2010.
The results of SHE audits and other relevant performance indicators are used to focus the Group SHE initiatives and the annual Group SHE objectives.
The audit process, used by the Group SHE department to audit the manufacturing sites, has been externally validated by BSI in 2004 as being in accordance with BS EN ISO 19011 auditing guidelines for quality environmental management systems.
17 17 Safety, health and the environment Indicators of SHE performance SHE management Objective: To continually improve the effectiveness of our SHE management systems.
Target: All former Uniqema manufacturing sites to be certified to BS EN ISO 14001 and BS OHSAS 18001 by the end of 2010.
Six of the former Uniqema sites are already certified to both BS EN ISO 14001 and BS OHSAS 18001 and the remaining four sites are expected to achieve certification by the target date.
Energy consumption Objective: To continually improve the energy efficiency of our manufacturing processes.
Target: Based on 2006, to improve energy efficiency GJ tonne manufactured at all manufacturing sites by 2% each year 8% overall until the end of 2010.
In 2009, the Group energy efficiency per tonne was worse by 3.7% compared to 2008 and worse by 13.5% since 2006.
This is due to much reduced manufacturing volumes.
In absolute figures the energy used in 2009 was lower by 6.2% compared to 2008 and lower by 15.3% compared to 2006.
Progress with energy reduction projects is demonstrated by our continued compliance with the energy reduction targets of the UK Climate Change Agreement and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
In 2009, we saw the full energy savings effect of the wind turbine at the Hull, UK site and significant improvements in the energy efficiency of the boiler house at the Atlas Point, USA plant after bringing management of the unit in-house at the end of 2007.
Air emissions of volatile organic compounds VOCs Objective: To minimise the mass of volatile organic compounds VOCs released to air from our processes.
Target: Based on 2006, all manufacturing sites to reduce VOC emissions kg tonne manufactured by 5% per year 20% overall until the end of 2010.
In 2009, there was a 3.9% reduction in the amount of VOCs per tonne released to air compared to 2008 and an overall reduction of 21.2% since 2006.
In absolute figures the amount of VOCs emitted during 2009 was reduced by 13.0% compared to 2008 and reduced by 41.2% since 2006.
This improvement was due to major investment during the period to control the releases of VOCs.
18 18 Waste disposal Objective: To minimise the quantities of waste disposed to landfill.
Target: Based on 2006, to reduce waste to landfill kg tonne manufactured by 5% each year 20% overall until the end of 2010.
The waste data relates to waste generated by the manufacturing operations.
One off disposals of waste not directly associated with the manufacturing process, for example, construction excavations or contaminated land remediation, are excluded.
In 2009, waste disposed to landfill per manufactured tonne increased by 4.0% compared to 2008 and has decreased by 36.2% since 2006.
In absolute figures the waste disposed to landfill during 2009 was reduced by 5.8% compared to 2008 and has reduced by 52.4% since 2006.
Waste water discharges Objective: To reduce the environmental impact the Group has on controlled waters.
Target: All manufacturing sites to achieve greater than 97.5% compliance with their effluent discharge consents in every year and for year on year continuous improvement towards 100% compliance.
In 2009, the compliance with our effluent discharge consents was 96.8% compared to 97.0% in 2008 and the baseline compliance of 91.6% in 2006.
Consumption of mains water Objective: To reduce the Group requirements for mains water.
Target: 3 All manufacturing sites to reduce the use of mains water m per tonne manufactured by 2.5% each year 10% in all until the end of 2010.
In 2009, the mains water used per manufactured tonne reduced by 9.6% compared to 2008 and increased by 18.5% since 2006.
In absolute figures the mains water used by the Group reduced by 18.2% compared to 2008 and reduced by 11.6% since 2006.
19 19 Safety, health and the environment SHE initiatives 2009 Personal accidents In 2009 there was a decrease in the reportable accident rate from 0.33 to 0.25 per 100,000 man hour s. Process safety performance Croda recognises that whilst the personal injury accident rate is an important indicator of SHE performance, it is also critical to monitor those events which might lead to process incidents.
Very infrequently, such an event can result in a catastrophic accident.
It is important that these events are recognised so that remedial action can be taken and the risk of a catastrophic accident reduced.
As reported last year, the Group has developed and implemented a system for monitoring the performance of those engineering control measures which are critical to the safe operation of its processes.
This initiative has now taken the form of a set of Group process safety objectives.
Assessment of process risks Objective for 2009: To assess the individual risk of fatality from the site activities and to identify whether this risk meets a recognised criterion.
Target for 2009: To use improved risk assessment techniques to confirm that the individual risk of fatality from site activities meets the Group criterion by the end of 2009.
In 2009, 18 out of 20 manufacturing sites were able to demonstrate that their activities met the Group criterion for process risks.
Two sites have yet to complete the assessment work.
Objective for 2010: To ensure that no change is introduced that increases the individual risk of fatality IRF from all site processes to an intolerable level.
Target for 2010: All manufacturing sites to demonstrate annual improvements in evaluating process risks for new processes and the management of change for existing processes.
Control of process risks Objective: To demonstrate and monitor the effectiveness of control for each manufacturing process.
Targets for 2009: To clearly and concisely record the critical parameters and controls that are in place for the safe operation of all processes by the end of 2009.
To develop a system to monitor, investigate and report all significant deviations from the safe process conditions by the end of 2009.
In 2009, all manufacturing sites had clearly and concisely recorded the critical parameters and controls that are in place for the safe operation of all processes by means of a basis of safety document complying with the Group format.
The basis of safety document identifies all credible significant manufacturing process deviations.
In 2009, there were 14 calls on the last layer of protection and 38 calls on the last layer of prevention.
All these incidents were investigated thoroughly with a view to preventing a further occurrence.
Target for 2010: All manufacturing sites to demonstrate annual improvements in the reporting and investigation of significant deviations from safe operating conditions.
20 20 Review of process risks Objective: To regularly review the process risk assessments.
Target: To develop a programme to ensure that all process risk assessments are reviewed at least once every five years.
To monitor the timely completion of the review programme.
In 2009, each manufacturing site developed a programme for the review of process risk assessments at least once every five years.
At present, 87% of manufacturing processes have been reviewed in the last five years.
The programme will deliver 100% of processes reviewed in the last five years by the end of 2012.
In 2009, 19 out of 20 sites met the scheduled review programme for 2009.
Reduction of process risk Objective: To reduce process risks to as low as reasonably practicable.
Target: To ensure that actions arising from process risk assessments are prioritised and appropriately managed.
To monitor planned completion rates of all actions.
In 2009, all actions arising from process risk assessments were prioritised.
At the end of the year there were no overdue high priority actions.
At the end of the year 19 out of 20 sites had an overall planned action completion rate better than the Group internal target.
During the final quarter of 2008 the Group commenced a series of lengthy detailed audits of the process safety management system at each of our manufacturing sites against the standards identified in the Group SHE Manual.
In 2009, all of the major accident hazard sites have been audited and the remaining lower risk sites will be audited in 2010.
Enforcement action In 2009, there were no prosecutions against the Group.
