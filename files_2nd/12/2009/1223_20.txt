Creating a community of design and manufacturing innovation To meet todays challenges and opportunities ARMs role is to encourage and support this we need the expertise of the worlds smartest community.
When a new market becomes and most innovative people.
No one suitable for ARM technology for the first company can hope to have all of these time, we work closely with the pioneers people in their team, so ARM has developed to support their initial developments.
As an innovative business model.
Rather than those first companies find success, ARM trying to do everything ourselves, we partner encourages others to join them, and their with the leading design and manufacturing success encourages increased use of ARM companies in the world to create a huge technology.
Eventually ARM technology has connected community of innovation.
become a common platform, reducing the cost for all, as software and development There are thousands of companies in this tools can be reused by engineers across connected community all developing the platform.
Some are designing or manufacturing ARM-based chips: others are writing operating systems or application software to run on those chips: whilst some are creating development tools to assist both the hardware and software engineers.
Thousands of businesses employing hundreds of thousands of people, all over the world, are working together to create innovative and differentiated products based on ARM technology.
