44 Business Review eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Corporate Social Responsibility Social Responsibility an eaga Priority eagas commitment to social responsibility continues to be at the heart of our business and is driven by our core value: to care for our Partners, customers and communities with integrity, respect and enthusiasm.
As a co-owned business, it is extremely important to our Partners that our core business success can fit alongside a clear commitment to social and environmental responsibility.
eaga has an integrated and holistic approach to social responsibility: one which aims to incorporate social responsibility in our overall strategy as well as culture and operations.
Our approach to social responsibility is in the following key areas: Partners engaging our Partners in our social responsibility work through a range of social and environmental initiatives that educate and inform, encouraging participation, decision making and ownership throughout the business: Customers our diverse and often underrepresented customer base drives us to work with many stakeholders to identify opportunities to deliver all the extra assistance we can to those most in need: Communities supporting the communities in which we live and work with a structured approach to grant-giving through our Community Fund, giving time and expertise to those that need it, innovative event managing and fund raising: and Environment further reducing our impact on the environment by achieving carbon neutral status through our business operations during the year 31 May 2009 and delivering an ambitious programme of continuous development to improve upon this year on year.
Our Social Responsibility Future As social responsibility is intrinsically part of our culture, it is natural that we should embrace opportunities at both a grass roots level and by contributing to developing policy.
Achieving status as thought leaders in this area of community, social and environmental responsibility and further embedding a sustainable approach to business across the Group continues to be our overriding priority.
There are many opportunities to develop and support both organically, through existing links to our core business and beliefs, and through new developing initiatives.
As such, as eaga continues to grow and diversify, we must establish new networks to manage an increasingly diverse and innovative portfolio of social responsibility activity.
Further details regarding social responsibility activity can be found in the Social Responsibility Report 2009.
