The calculation of value in use for the Offshore Engineering & Operations, Production Solutions and Training Services units is most sensitive to the following assumptions: The deferred consideration was re-assessed at year end in the light of latest financial projections for the business and the current carried amount was reduced by Sterling 1,754,000 equivalent US$2,929,000 with a corresponding decrease in the carried goodwill.
Market share: the assumption relating to market share for the Offshore Engineering & Operations unit is based on the unit re-securing those existing customer contracts in the UK which are due to expire during the projection period: for the Training Services unit, the key The residual goodwill of Sterling 20,072,000 equivalent US$32,563,000 2008: Sterling 21,826,000, equivalent US$31,881,000 comprises assumptions relate to managements assessment of maintaining the units market share in the UK and developing further the business the fair value of expected future synergies and business opportunities arising from the integration of the business in to the group.
Growth rate: estimates are based on managements assessment of market share having regard to macro-economic factors and the growth rates experienced in the recent past by each unit.
A growth rate of 5% per annum has been applied for Offshore Engineering & Operations and Training cash-generating units for the remaining five years of the ten-year projection period and 2.5% per annum for Production Solutions cash-generating unit since it includes newly acquired businesses note 10 where there is less historic track record of achieving financial projections.
Net profit margins: estimates are based on managements assumption of achieving a level of performance at least in line with the recent past performance of each of the units.

Risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables and deferred consideration.
The groups activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and borrowings and foreign currency risk on both conducting business in currencies other than reporting currency as well as translation of the assets and liabilities of foreign operations to the reporting currency.
These risks are managed from time to time by using a combination of various derivative instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps and forward currency contracts in line with the groups hedging policy.
The group has a policy not to enter into speculative trading of financial derivatives.
The Board of Directors of the Company has established an Audit Committee and Risk Committee to help identify, evaluate and manage the significant financial risks faced by the group and their activities are discussed in detail on pages 74 and 75.
The other main risks besides interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from the groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk and the policies relating to these risks are discussed in detail below:
