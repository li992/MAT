Of this amount, approximately 165 million is attributable to Group Home Improvement and 23 million to Electricals.
 LLP Had the Group charged pension costs to the profit and loss account under the FRS 17 basis for the year, the net charge excluding Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors the credit for settlements would have been 31 million around 13.5% of pensionable salary.
London 16 April 2003 As reported last year, the FRS 17 net pension liability has no impact on pension funding and, as a consequence, continues to have no impact on the Groups current or future cash flow or reported earnings.
