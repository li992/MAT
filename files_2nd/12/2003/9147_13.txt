This has been used to reduce Group borrowings.
In the year to 1 February 2003 the Group committed to the separation of its electricals business.
The Group entered into currency hedging to protect the sterling value of its euro receipts from the sale or IPO into France of the business.
On 19 March 2003 the Company announced the proposed demerger of the electricals business in the form of a UK listed company.
The hedge of expected euro receipts has now been reduced accordingly.
The reduction in sterling value of euro receipts on those elements of the hedge contracts that have now been closed out amounts to a pre-tax cost of 78.8m.
This cost will be recorded in the accounts for the financial year to 31 January 2004.
As this non-adjusting post balance sheet event has taken place since the accounts were initially approved by the directors on 18 March 2003, the directors have re-approved the accounts and therefore the directors report, the accounts and the auditors report are all dated 16 April 2003.
