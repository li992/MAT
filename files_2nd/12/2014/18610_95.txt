170 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures Methodology We have reported on all EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures, using the EPRA Best Practices Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting 2nd Version, the main requirements of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard revised edition and emissions factors from the UK Governments Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014 and 2013.
Organisational boundary We have used the Operational Control boundary approach for all Sustainability Performance Measures.
Data is reported for our property investment portfolio and own occupied offices.
Our property investment portfolio includes our UK Residential portfolio, our Germany residential portfolio and the GRIP Fund.
Reporting on landlord and tenant consumption Grainger only reports on landlord-obtained energy, water and waste consumption.
Data on tenant consumption is not available, however we report estimated tenant carbon dioxide emissions in our Mandatory Greenhouse Gas statement on page 46.
Coverage Where we are not able to include 100% of all assets within our operational control in our reporting for a Sustainability Performance Measure, we have specified the level of data coverage.
Energy and Greenhouse gas notes Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the UK Governments Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014 and 2013.
Transmission and distribution losses are reported as Scope 3 emissions.
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as metric tonnes CO 2 equivalent t CO e and greenhouse gas intensity is reported as kilogrammes of CO equivalent kg CO e. Greenhouse gas emissions for 2 2 2 German electricity consumption and transmission and distribution are reported in carbon dioxide CO only as per the UK Governments 2 Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014 and 2013.
Where the unit of measurement for natural gas consumption is not known, consumption has been calculated using 100s of cubic feet as the default unit of measurement to avoid understating consumption.
Estimation of landlord-obtained utility consumption Where data for Grainger-obtained utility consumption is missing or unreliable, we have used the following estimation methodology: Where data is available for the same period quarter for the previous reporting year, we have estimated missing utility consumption using the daily consumption rate from the previous year.
Where data is not available for the same period quarter for the previous reporting year, we have estimated missing utility consumption using the daily consumption rate from all previous quarters in the current reporting year.
Where insufficient previous data was available, we have excluded the property from reporting.
We have only estimated data to fill gaps using known consumption from other periods for the metered supply in question.
We have disclosed the proportion of total disclosed data that is estimated in the data notes that accompany each Performance Measure.

Our London offices in Knightsbridge and Putney were closed in April and May of the reporting year and a new consolidated London Bridge office was opened in April.
Consumption has been reported for the period of the reporting year that each office was occupied by Grainger.
Like-for-like Energy and GHG emissions: No data is estimated.
Due to office consolidation in 2013 and 2014, there are only two UK offices that have been occupied for two full reporting years: Newcastle and Altrincham.
Our Frankfurt office in Germany has also been occupied for two full reporting years.
Martlesham, Putney and Knightsbridge are no longer occupied by Grainger and the Birmingham office moved in 2013, therefore these four properties have been excluded from like-for-like reporting.

Grainger does not report on energy or water consumed by tenants.
All annual consumption is reported as the portfolio stood at year end for the period from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014.
Consumption from assets subsequently transferred to the GRIP Fund was included in UK Residential Grainger obtained electricity, fuel and water for the period from October to December 2012.
We have used the market value of assets under management as our main intensity Performance Measure as this is also what we use to measure our business efficiency KPI as reported in our Strategic report.
Absolute energy and GHG emissions: 4% of electricity consumption data has been estimated.
32% of fuels consumption data has been estimated.
UK Residential portfolio: Seven properties have been excluded from electricity consumption because insufficient data is available to calculate consumption.
GRIP Fund: One property has been excluded from electricity consumption because there was no confirmed electricity supplier and so consumption could not be calculated.
German Residential portfolio: There are no properties excluded from reporting.
Absolute water: 83% of water consumption data has been estimated.
UK Residential portfolio: One property with Grainger-obtained water consumption was sold and is excluded from reporting.
GRIP Fund: There are no properties excluded from reporting.
German Residential portfolio: Water consumption data is not available for our German residential portfolio for the reporting year.

UK Residential portfolio: The GInvest and WIP portfolios are excluded from like-for-like reporting because this is the first year for which data is available to report.
Where data is not available for two full reporting years properties are excluded from like-for-like reporting.
However, minimal estimation has been applied to missing days in a quarter as per the estimation methodology used for all Performance Measures.
GRIP Fund: The GRIP Fund is excluded from like-for-like reporting as the Fund was created in January 2013 and data is not available for two full reporting years.
German Residential portfolio: The German Residential portfolio is excluded from like-for-like reporting because this is the first year for which data is available to report.

GRIP Fund: Waste data is gathered for all properties in the GRIP Fund portfolio where Grainger has waste management contracts in place, excluding Bethnal Green and West Tenter Street where it was not possible to convert the available waste data into weight.
100% of data is estimated because data is not gathered by waste management contractors for actual weight of waste generated by Grainger owned properties.
Waste weight in metric tonnes is calculated from bin volume in litres using the WRAP waste conversion factor 20 03 01 for mixed municipal waste, rather than actual weight measurements at each property.
Proportion of waste by disposal route is based on statistics for each applicable waste management contractor as a whole and is not specific to Grainger properties.
Food waste for three properties has been excluded because it was not possible to calculate weight from the data provided.
Like-for-like waste GRIP Fund: The GRIP Fund is excluded from like-for-like reporting as the Fund was created in January 2013 and data is not available for two full reporting years.
Data coverage notes for occupied offices Absolute waste Annual figures are estimated from an audit of actual waste weight produced by each office on a minimum of two separate days during the reporting year.
Total weight was calculated for the 255 working days per year, excluding bank holidays and weekends.
Waste data was not measured at our German occupied office.
Like-for-like waste Due to office consolidation in 2013 and 2014, there are only two UK offices that have been occupied for two full reporting years: Newcastle and Altrincham.
Both are reported in like-for-like reporting.
In 2013, shredded paper waste data was not available for the Newcastle office, but this is included in 2014 reporting.
