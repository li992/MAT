To ensure effective and concentration of sodium cyanide 0.05% is dripped onto the heap by a safe storage of tailings, our facilities are regularly monitored and audited.
The solution percolates through the heap, leaching the gold from the ore.
The leach pad is made of an impermeable liner We perform metallurgical extraction of gold with both heap leaching and cover made of high-density polyethylene HDPE to recover the pregnant dynamic leaching processes.
The heap leaching process leaves piles solution and protect groundwater from seepage.

In both cases, cyanide-bearing mineral waste is safely that when the cyanide solution is added, hydrogen cyanide HCN gas disposed.
The use of an impermeable membrane in heaps and tailings is not generated and cyanide remains in solution, ready to dissolve the ponds prevent seepage to groundwater.
The resultant gold-bearing solution is collected on the leach pad andchannelled to the Merrill Crowe plant for further processing.
In the dynamic leaching process, the mineral ore is crushed and ground sufficiently to form a slurry that is leached in large tanks.
The pregnant solution is separated from the slurry and the solution passes to MerrillCrowe plant for further processing.
