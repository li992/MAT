71 CASE STUDY Environmental Performance Johnson Matthey undertakes a Benefits of Combined Heat and Power comprehensive annual review of group environmental performance which at Redwitz, Germany covers all manufacturing and research When Johnson Mattheys heating system at its Redwitz site needed and development facilities.
Data is replacing, thoughts turned to more efficient and sustainable combined heat presented for a five year period for ten and power CHP systems.

Year on year performance system is captured and channelled into a heating system.

To be classed as a byproduct, waste must be capable of being used without further treatment.
In 2013 14, 3,233 tonnes of one byproduct, weak ammonium nitrate solution, was used as a raw material by a fertiliser manufacturer.
We also worked with Davyhulme Wastewater Treatment Works to reclassify a further effluent concentrated sodium nitrate.
The sodium nitrate is used to reduce the amount of mechanical agitation needed to provide oxygen to sewage waste water, reducing electricity consumption for the waste water treatment works.
Now that the solution has been reclassified, the volume of liquid waste produced at Clitheroe will drop significantly.
Clitheroe is also making a significant contribution to Johnson Mattheys target of sending zero waste to landfill by 2017.
In 2012 13 the Clitheroe sites figure stood at 45 tonnes: in 2013 14 it fell by 78% to 10 tonnes.
