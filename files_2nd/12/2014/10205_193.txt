Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which point 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a combination of both.
Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum 25% of awards will vest, with full vesting is achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
Where the award is subject to ASR the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report on pages 38 to 57.
