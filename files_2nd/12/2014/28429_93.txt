All-employee share plans It is important that all employees are offered the opportunity to own shares in Prudential, connecting them both to the success of the Company and to the interests of other shareholders.
Executive directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes UK based executive directors are eligible to participate in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and Barry Stowe is invited to participate in the similar International Share Ownership Scheme.
These schemes allow all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.
In 2014 participants could elect to enter into savings contracts of up to 500 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares.
If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules.
Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised.
No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
Details of executive directors rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the Statement of directors shareholdings.
