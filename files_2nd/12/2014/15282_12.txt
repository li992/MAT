Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport of goods to and from site and the movement of these vehicles on site.
Internal transport on site is included.
Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel.
They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc.
with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity.
These losses are in scope 3, this report is for scope 1 and 2.
CO e emissions include contributions from CH and N O associated with combustion.
NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes.
The CO e global warming potential contribution from these releases is already 2 included in the CO from energy figure above.
Data on refrigerant gas losses has been collected for 2014 and 2013 and was collected for 2012 wherever possible.
Where site data was not available for 2012, losses have been assumed to be the same as in 2013.
Annual losses of refrigerant have been converted to the CO e figures using the substance by 2 substance figures published by Defra, based on the materials consumed within the Group.
The total CO e figure is the total of the CO e from energy and the VOC contribution assuming an average factor of 11kg CO e per kg VOC and the 2 2 2 refrigerant contribution.
Percentage changes are calculated from the base data and may differ slightly from changes calculated from the data in the tables because of rounding.
The energy consumption data for 2012 and 2013 has been restated following a review of the data assumptions at two of our Malaysian sites.
This has also impacted the greenhouse emissions reporting for 2012 and 2013.
The water consumption numbers for 2013 have been revised following the acquisition of Synthomer Finland Oy and the alignment of water consumption on that site.
