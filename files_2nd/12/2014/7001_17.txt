GettinG into Gear inteGrated annual report for the Year ended 28 March 2014 strateGiC report strateGy sustainaBility halfords has a clear Group strategy for how we operate our business to benefit our customers and colleagues, and of course, to generate value for our shareholders.
we recognise that to be successful in achieving our Group strategy halfords must contribute positively to the world in which we operate.
acting responsibly in all our operations, and towards our colleagues, customers and other stakeholders, supports the delivery of our Group strategy and thereby benefits our business and our brand.
As part of this, in January 2013 we recognised that the development of a Community Strategy was a fundamental part of our Group strategy.
Hence, a dedicated Community & CSR Manager was appointed to explore opportunities for developing and implementing community programmes.
Since then, with the support of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, she has focused on building the foundations for a long-term Community Strategy.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the alignment of our wider sustainability initiatives with our Group strategy.
Executive Management monitor the achievement of related KPIs.
We endeavour to monitor our exposure and response to sustainability issues, to preserve not only our business, but also the environment and the local communities in which we operate.
CoMMunities Our extensive store and autocentre network puts us in an ideal position to become the hub of our local communities.
We have made significant progress, developing links with local communities by launching various initiatives to inspire cyclists of every age with a particular focus on primary school-age children.
re CyCle In 2013, we agreed a long-term charity partnership with Re Cycle, a UK charity that sends unwanted bikes, going to waste in sheds and garages across the country, to Africa.
We are proud to support this initiative because in some areas of Africa, a bike can be the only means of transport.
Owning a bike enables people to travel to work or school, and carry goods or passengers, whilst small scale farmers and traders can reach customers further afield.
The bikes can similarly be an invaluable resource for travelling health workers and provide access to training and employment, helping to improve lives in a sustainable way.
However, bikes can be too expensive for the majority in Africa.
Additionally, the skills to maintain the bikes might not exist.
As part of our partnership, we have opened our stores to donations from the public through National Bike Trade-In Events, thereby diverting unwanted bikes from landfill disuse to more constructive and sustainable use.
To date over 10,000 bikes have been donated by the public, diverting 150 tonnes from landfill waste.
We are also pleased to be able to share our skills and knowledge to support the charitys growth.
com halfords Group plc stock code: hfd annual report and accounts 2014 Since 1997, Re Cycle has sent around 53,000 bikes to Africa, as well as parts and tools.
We hope that through our partnership, Re Cycle will be able to build on the fantastic work it has already achieved and inspire more and more cyclists of every age across Africa.
You can read more about Re Cycle on their website - http: www.
org raisinG oVer 90,000 so far An additional facet of our Re Cycle partnership is that all our colleagues connect with their local communities, whilst having fun raising money to cover the cost of sending bikes to Africa.
This also provides incidental team building opportunities for our colleagues.
Highlights in the last year in our stores and Support Centre include cycle rides, fun days, Snowdon and Ben Nevis challenges, cake sales, raffles, continuous turbo trainer contests and car washes amongst other fun activities, some even in fancy dress!
Ben Our Autocentres have a long-term partnership with BEN, the dedicated charity for those who work, or have worked, in the automotive and related industries, as well as their dependants.
BEN provides practical, emotional or financial support, as well as day, nursing and residential care across the country for older people in the automotive community.
sCouts assoCiation Building on the success of our Kids Holiday Bike Clubs see page 35, it was a natural progression for us to team up with the Scouts Association to help 2,200 Cubs achieve their Cyclist Activity badge by attending an in-depth workshop at our stores.
These give our store colleagues additional opportunities to inspire our future customers and foster closer links with our local communities.

partnersHip WitH onley prison Through the Ministry of Justice, we are starting a partnership with Onley Prison to provide skills training and employment opportunities for ex-offenders.
ColleaGues As we recognise that our Retail colleagues are central to our progress on the Retail Getting into Gear journey as described on pages 26 to 39, we support them on our 3-Gears training and colleague qualification programme.
Similarly, we invest in our Autocentres colleagues via our training academy apprenticeship programme.
This comprises a three-year fully funded technician programme leading to the Institute of Motor Industry NVQ 3 and Diploma.
In twenty years of operation, we offered employment to the majority of apprentices who completed the three-year scheme.
In addition, we offer a range of technical and management qualification opportunities to our Autocentres colleagues via our IMI accredited Academy of Learning.
We are proud this year to be on The Sunday Times 25 Best Big Companies to Work For list.
We continue to aim to be an employer of choice, where our colleagues enjoy equal opportunities to help our customers and prosper within a rewarding and inspiring team.
We recognise that it is the continued trust of our colleagues, customers, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders that is central to the ongoing delivery of our strategy.
Whether it be their trust in our commitment to our diverse workforce or in the way we do business: maintaining their trust is of paramount importance to us.

As a result whilst the number of audits conducted has reduced we have maintained our audited coverage in line with our internal targets.
In addition, we have a company-wide Anti-Bribery & Corruption policy which prohibits payments to public officials.
Support Centre colleagues have this year participated in a training programme which seeks to refresh the principles of the policy, and undertaken a compulsory test thereafter.
It is planned to undertake this training testing programme on a yearly basis.
com investors governance policies  A Whistleblowing policy also exists as described at page 89. tHe enVironMent We recognise that in todays marketplace consumers have an increasingly wide choice of retailers from which to make their purchase.
This means that as well as reasonable price and the quality of the services they receive, the quality and provenance of the products become ever more relevant to our customers decisionmaking process.
Similarly, we seek to better understand the direct and indirect effects of our business activities.
In so doing, we are better able to manage not only our impact on the environment but also our operations.
standards Our product specifications demand that they are consistent with or are stronger than relevant legislation, international conventions and codes of practice.
The upholding of these high standards is scrutinised by our quality control procedures, as well as via our mystery shopper programme.
This enables us to respond to any inadequacies identified.
We are also monitored by external organisations such as VOSA and Trading Standards.
Additionally, we are pleased to often work alongside trade associations, research institutes, standards authorities, universities and government organisations to improve standards and safety, and develop and influence best practice.

This success is reflected in the latest Cycle to Work Alliance data for 2014, which reflects our strong performance and increase in cycle2work market share.
Conscious that the majority of our products are sourced overseas, we limit our use of air freight.
Where possible we ship our products which, once landed in the UK, are brought by rail to our Coventry and Redditch Distribution Centres.
This year we have seen an increase in tonnes airfreighted due to improved reporting and certain sales requirements but predominantly as a result of having to airfreight 61.6 tonnes of bikes from Cambodia due to shipment delays caused by strikes immediately before the Chinese New Year shutdowns.
This was an exceptional requirement for air freight and we anticipate our levels of air freight returning to normalised levels in subsequent periods.

In addition, the Distribution Centres will be establishing a Halfords Lift Share website to promote car sharing as part of their Green Travel Plan.
All our Autocentres deliveries are made from local branches in small vans that are route managed.
All goods supplied for Autocentres are from local branches within England, Scotland and Wales.
