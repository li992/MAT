STRATEGIC REPORT Sustainability Protecting the future We care about our customers and helping improve Behavioural safety campaign peoples lives.
We also care about the people who work for us, the environment in which we operate and The Dont drop the ball campaign is all about raising awareness of safety in the workplace.
This initiative started the societies in which we do business.
Addressing in our Memphis facility and will be rolled out across other unmet social need with more affordable products divisions in the coming year.
Employees sign the ball, thereby gathered pace in 2014 with the introduction of our pledging to put safety at the forefront of all of their actions.
Syncera range and further growth and consolidation No team wants to be the one who drops the ball!
As part of our commitment How this delivers value: to build trust we increased our engagement with Awareness of safety in the workplace is increased suppliers to increase assurance around compliance in a fun and engaging way Employees share a collective responsibility for the safety and ethics.
of the entire team This is a summary of our sustainability activities and progress in 2014.
Our Sustainability Report will be published in April 2015.
In 2014, there were no employee or contractor fatalities and our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate LTIFR fell again for the fourth successive year, this time by 20%.
Compared to the previous year, total waste increased by 13%, however waste disposed to landfill fell by 19% as we found new ways to recycle.
Energy consumption has increased by 9% since 2011.
However, after adjusting for the transient effect of transferring some production to China and the impact of newly acquired businesses, there was a net fall in energy consumption of 2%.
After three consecutive years of increases, water consumption reduced by 7% in 2014 compared to the previous year.
As part of the Great Place to Work strategy, substantially more of our employees enjoyed the benefits of wellness programmes.
We donated approximately $9 million in philanthropic activities, Safety of which $2 million was in product donations and charitable gifts.
Volunteering programmes were active in most of the territories Total recordable incident rate TIR where we work and the benefits to society and the level of employee involvement continued to increase.

Making health and safety a priority for all of our employees and contractors was an imperative in 2014.
This was supported by the progressive rollout of our integrated management system and the wide introduction of behavioural based safety programmes.
