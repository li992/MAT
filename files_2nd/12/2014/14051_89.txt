Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Strategic Report Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting year This section includes our mandatory Our reporting year for greenhouse gas emissions is reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, one quarter behind our financial year, namely 1 as required by Section 7 of the October 2013 to 30th September 2014.
We established this reporting period last year to ensure that the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report emissions information we obtain from supplier invoices and Directors Report Regulations 2013 is complete and we set last year as the baseline.
Global greenhouse gas emissions data For the period 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014 our total carbon dioxide equivalent CO e was 368,012 2 tonnes.
A breakdown of this by emission type is provided in Figure 1.
This reflects an 8% reduction compared to last years emissions which were 398.519.
This results from the impact of weather, a warmer winter in 2013 14: changes in contributing contracts: and the impact of initiatives taken.
Figures 2 and 3 draw comparisons between years by type scope 1 and 2 and by Division.
Reporting boundary and responsibility We report our emissions data using an operational control approach to defining our organisational boundary.
This follows the greenhouse gas protocol and defines how we meet the Regulations requirements in respect of the emissions we are responsible for.
We have reported all material emission sources for which we consider ourselves responsible and have set our materiality threshold at 5%.
These sources align with where we consider we have operational control.
In 2014 we achieved an overall materiality level of just under 5% and our objective is to maintain this for future reporting.
We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are beyond our operational control, for example, business travel other than by our own transport, and therefore do not report them here.
Scope 3 emissions can be found in our annual Carbon Disclosure Project FTSE 350 submission.
Methodology Serco quantifies and reports to ISO 14064-1 2012.
We have used the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA 2014 conversion factors within our reporting methodology.
We have also opted to use operational control as the consolidation approach, due to the nature of our business, with employees who are often on customer sites where no operational control is possible.
As this approach is inconsistent with the financial statements, we have described the classification of reporting boundaries in detail in our Basis of Reporting 2014 document, which is available on our website, www.
In some cases, we have estimated emissions based on similar Serco facilities.
This is done, for example, where our staff work in leased premises but have no access to actual consumption figures.
In other cases, we have extrapolated total emissions by using available information from part of the reporting period and extending it to apply to the full reporting year.
This occurs for the rare occasions where gaps are identified in our data.
The sum of all estimated emissions is below x5% of our global emissions, so we consider the potential error to be immaterial.
74 Strategic Report Scope of reported emissions % breakdown 2014 by emission type We have reported emissions data for our operations in the following countries: Division Country ASPAC Australia & New Zealand Middle East Bahrain Hong Kong India UAE Americas USA Electricity 54% Canada Gas 12% Petrol 0% Global Services Australia Diesel 7% India Ireland Fuel Oil, mostly Marine 7% UK Specialist Marine Fuel 20% Fugative Emissions 0% Central Government UK Local and Regional Ireland Government Summary of emissions by Corporate Divisions tonnes CO e 2014 v 2013 2 The emissions that have not been included in this 232,736 years report relate to refrigerant gases from air conditioning and refrigeration outside the UK.
After 267,081 analysis, we believe these emissions are immaterial.
Central Government and Local and Regional Government For countries where we have very limited operations, 52,227 such as Dominican Republic and Virgin Islands where we have fewer than ten employees we have 63,423 undertaken a materiality assessment and consider that the related emissions are not material and are Serco Global Services therefore excluded.
39,461 Intensity ratio To express our annual reported emissions in relation to 11,508 the scale of our activities, we have used full time equivalents FTE as our intensity ratio.
This is the most Americas relevant indication of the constantly changing nature 43,588 of our business and provides the best comparative measure over time.
56,507 Our frontline operations have an emissions intensity of AMEAA 6.86 tonnes CO e per FTE whilst our back office 2 operations reported significantly less at 1.03 tonnes 2014 CO e per FTE.
Combined our normalised emissions 2 2013 are 3.80 tonnes CO e per FTE which is a 6% 2 improvement on 2013 4.04.
