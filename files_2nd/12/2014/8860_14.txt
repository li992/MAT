27 The division is focused on maintaining differentiation through technology by STRATEGY investing in R&D.
This investment is vital to ensure Emission Control Technologies can continue to develop high performance leading edge catalysts for its customers.
Maintain differentiation through technology by A deep understanding of markets and customers enables the division to provide investing in R&D the right solutions for its customers in evolving markets driven by tightening legislation.
Strong relationships and a good understanding of customers needs A deep understanding of are crucial to the divisions success.
markets and customers Manufacturing Excellence is an important element of the strategy.
The divisions Manufacturing Excellence activities involve manufacturing products for its customers.
It is focused on optimising raw materials and plant efficiency to produce the best quality products Deliver superior growth at minimum operating cost and ensuring the highest standards of environmental, health and safety performance.
The division aims to deliver superior growth in markets that are driven by global trends, such as environmental regulation and increasing wealth, and where applying its expertise in leading edge catalysis can generate growth at rates ahead of industry baselines.

Sales to non-road up 44% on last year.
During the first represents approximately 10% of the nine months of the year, our sales applications accounted for nearly potential market.
As we have said 60 million of our 2013 14 HDD were boosted by truck and engine before, although China is a large market manufacturers pre-buying Euro V catalyst sales.

We estimate that in North America grew by more than 6% America and the EU combined, the helped by the continued recovery in the this added around 10 million to our cost of a truck is markedly lower, engine sales in that period.
In Europe the market grew sizes are smaller and the Euro IV strongly, supported by a pre-buy ahead On 1st January 2014 tighter legislation requires relatively simple Euro VI legislation came into force of the new Euro VI legislation which non-platinum group metal catalyst came into force on 1st January 2014. which requires the addition of particulate technology.
