Overall performance summary business context HSBC Holdings plc In 2014, the Group maintained a strong balance sheet and robust capital position.
Excluding the effect of currency translation, loans and advances grew by US$28bn and customer accounts increased by US$47bn, with a ratio of customer advances to customer accounts of 72%.
Profit before tax fell on a reported basis compared with 2013, primarily reflecting lower gains from disposals and reclassifications in 2014 and the effect of other significant items, which included provisions for fines, settlements and UK customer redress of US$3.7bn.
On an adjusted basis, excluding the effect of significant items and currency translation, profit before tax was broadly unchanged from 2013.
Adjusted profit before tax was up in three out of five regions.

This reflected growth in CMB offset by a fall in revenue in GB&M, together with lower revenue in RBWM and GPB reflecting the remodelling of these businesses.
Net interest margin for the Group stabilised during 2014.
Loan impairment charges were lower, reflecting the changes to our portfolio since 2011.
The reported cost efficiency ratio increased from 59.6% in 2013 to 67.3% in 2014, and on an adjusted basis it increased to 61.1% in 2014 from 57.7%, principally reflecting higher operating expenses due to an increase in Regulatory Programmes and Compliance costs, inflationary pressures, continued investment in strategic initiatives, and a rise in the bank levy.
These factors were partly offset by sustainable cost savings in the year of US$1.3bn.
The return on average ordinary shareholders equity was 7.3%, down from 9.2% in 2013, primarily reflecting lower gains from disposals and reclassifications, together with higher operating expenses, including provisions for fines, settlements and UK customer redress.
Dividends in respect of 2014 increased from US$0.49 per ordinary share in 2013 to US$0.50 per ordinary share.
Our capital position strengthened in 2014 with our CRD IV transitional CET1 ratio increasing to 10.9% from 10.8% in 2013.
RBWM CMB Lower reported profit before tax was principally driven by lower CMB reported an increase in profit before tax reflecting higher revenue from the continued run-off of our US CML portfolio and revenue performance in our home markets of Hong Kong and higher operating expenses in our Principal RBWM business.

Elements of remuneration Group Group Executive Managing General Other Other Directors Directors Managers MRTs Employees Base salary Fixed pay allowance Annual incentive GPSP long-term awards Benefits and pension Material factors taken into account when setting pay policy The Committee takes into account a variety of factors when determining the remuneration policy for Directors.
Funding Annual incentive and GPSP awards are funded from a single annual variable pay pool.
Funding of the Groups annual variable pay pool is determined in the context of Group profitability, capital strength, shareholder returns, the distribution of profits between capital, dividends and variable pay, risk appetite statement, market competitiveness, and overall affordability.
Details of the calculation of this years variable pay pool can be found on page 309.
Pay and employment HSBC considers pay across the Group when determining remuneration levels for its executive Directors.
In conditions within considering individual awards, a comparison of the pay and employment conditions of our employees and the Group senior executives is considered by the Committee.
The Committee invites the Head of Group Performance and Reward to present proposals for remuneration for the wider employee population and to consult on the extent to which the different elements of remuneration are provided to other employees.
Feedback from employee engagement surveys and HSBC Exchange meetings are taken into account in determining the Groups remuneration policy.
Regulation There is still a wide divergence in local regulations governing remuneration structures globally.
This presents significant challenges to HSBC, which operates worldwide.
In order to deliver long-term sustainable performance, it is important to have market-competitive remuneration which is broadly equivalent across geographical boundaries in order to attract, motivate and retain talented and committed employees around the world.
We aim to ensure that our remuneration policy is aligned with regulatory practices and the interests of shareholders.
HSBC is fully compliant with the FSB, FCA, PRA and HKMA guidance and rules on remuneration which apply at the date of this report.
Comparator group The Committee considers market data for executive Directors remuneration packages from a defined remuneration comparator group.
This group consists of ten global financial services companies, namely Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ANZ, Banco Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Standard Chartered and UBS.
These companies were selected on the basis of their broadly similar business coverage, size and international scope, and are subject to annual review for continuing relevance.
ANZ is an additional firm added to the group as part of the Committees 2014 review.
The Committee can also review other companies where relevant in determining the remuneration policy.
Shareholder views The Chairman of the Committee, the Head of Group Performance and Reward and the Group Company Secretary meet with key institutional shareholders and other representative bodies.
We consider these types of meetings important to gather views on our current and developing remuneration practices to ensure that our reward strategy continues to be aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders.

In addition, the Committee received advice from the Group Head of Group variable pay pool Unaudited Human Resources and Corporate Sustainability, Ann Almeida, the Head of Group Performance and Reward, Variable pay pool determination Alexander Lowen, the Group Chief Risk Officer, Marc The Committee considers many factors in determining Moses, and the Global Head of Financial Crime the Groups variable pay pool funding.
Compliance and Group Money Laundering Reporting Variable pay pool determination Performance and risk The variable pay pool takes into account the performance of the Group which is considered within appetite statement the context of our risk appetite statement.
This helps to ensure that the variable pay pool is shaped by risk considerations and any Group-wide notable events.
The risk appetite statement describes and measures the amount and types of risk that HSBC is prepared to take in executing its strategy.
It shapes the integrated approach to business, risk and capital management and supports achievement of the Groups objectives.
The Group Chief Risk Officer regularly updates the Committee on the Groups performance against the risk appetite statement.
The Committee uses these updates when considering remuneration to ensure that return, risk and remuneration are aligned.
Counter-cyclical funding We use a counter-cyclical funding methodology which is categorised by both a floor and a ceiling methodology and the payout ratio reduces as performance increases to avoid pro-cyclicality risk.
The floor recognises that competitive protection is typically required irrespective of performance levels.
The ceiling recognises that at higher levels of performance it is possible to limit reward as it is not necessary to continue to increase the variable pay pool, thereby limiting the risk of inappropriate behaviour to drive financial performance.
Distribution of profits In addition, our funding methodology considers the relationship between capital, dividends and variable pay to ensure that the distribution of post-tax profits between these three elements is considered appropriate see next page for the 2014, 2013 and target split.
Commerciality and Finally, the commercial requirement to remain competitive in the market and overall affordability affordability are considered.
Both the annual incentive and GPSP are funded from a single annual variable pay pool from which individual awards are considered.
Funding of the Groups annual variable pay pool is determined in the context of Group profitability, capital strength, and shareholder returns.
This approach ensures that performance-related awards for individual global businesses, global functions, geographical regions and levels of staff are considered in a holistic fashion.
Market competiveness is one of the inputs in the determination of the variable pay pool.
This allows us to address any gaps to market identified when comparing total reward with our global peers.
This recognises the challenges which arise from being headquartered in the UK and hereby having to apply more stringent reward practices than those applied in markets outside the EU.
Factors which influence our competitive market position in Asia, Latin America and the US in attracting and retaining talent are the discounts applied on their pay by employees arising from regulations covering a variable pay cap, higher and longer deferrals, malus and now clawback.
This years variable pay pool was established by reference to the Groups reported profit before tax, which is adjusted to exclude movements in the fair value of own debt attributable to credit spread, the gains and losses from disposals, and debit valuation adjustment.
Reported profit before tax includes the costs of fines, penalties and other items of redress.
Taking into account all of the above, the Committee decided that in light of performance, the competitive market environment, risk inputs, and other factors, the adjusted pre-tax pre-variable pay profit payout ratio for 2014 would be 16% 15% in 2013.
The higher payout ratio reflects stronger performance in Asia and the Middle East, and an increased emphasis on risk and control functions.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 325 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Directors Remuneration Report continued Appendix Pillar 3 remuneration disclosures The following tables show the remuneration awards made by HSBC to its Identified Staff and MRTs for 2014.
Individuals have been identified as MRTs based on the qualitative and quantitative criteria set out in the Regulatory Technical Standard EU 604 2014 that came into force in June 2014.
This replaces the criteria that were previously used to identify Code Staff for the purposes of the PRAs and the FCAs Remuneration Code.
The scope of the qualitative and quantitative criteria specified in Regulatory Technical Standard EU 604 2014 to identify MRTs is much broader than the criteria used to identify Code Staff in previous years.
Accordingly, the number of individuals identified as MRTs for 2014 is significantly larger than the number of individuals that were identified as Code Staff in previous years.
The figures for 2013 in the tables below relate to the number of individuals that were identified as Code Staff for 2013.
