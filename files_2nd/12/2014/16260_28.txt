The defined benefit pension schemes included in the following disclosures are: i UK schemes: the UBM Pension Scheme UBMPS and the United Newspapers Executive Pension Scheme UNEPS : and ii US schemes: CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan: Both the UK plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
The vast majority of the liabilities in the schemes relate to members who are no longer employed by the Group but are not yet retired deferred members, and pensions in payment.
Responsibility for governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees must comprise one-third nominated by the plan members and the remainder are appointed by the Company and can include independent appointees, in accordance with the plans regulations.
Deferred members benefits and pensions in payment are generally increased by a fixed amount or updated in line with inflation.
Plan assets are held in Trusts and are invested in accordance with the Statement of Investment Principles.
Every three years, in accordance with legislation, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding of the pension plans and the level of contribution required by the Group to clear the deficit.
In 2013, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes of 3.5m per annum until 31 January 2018.
This contribution schedule remains in place until the 2014 funding valuations are finalised expected in the first half of 2015.
126 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Accounting policy For the defined contribution schemes, the contributions paid or payable in respect of employee service rendered during the accounting period are recognised as an expense in that period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the liability for the benefits earned by employees in return for service rendered in the current and prior periods is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based upon a number of assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the valuation.
The following are charged to operating profit: the net finance expense measured using the discount rate applied in measuring the defined benefit obligation: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period current service cost : the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest past service cost : gains and losses arising on settlements curtailments: and scheme administration costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Defined benefit pension surpluses are recognised when scheme rules indicate that such surpluses are recoverable as either an unconditional right to refund if the scheme were to be wound up or reductions in future contributions.
The availability of refunds or reductions of future contributions takes into account any minimum funding requirement of the UK defined benefit schemes.
Any tax expense arising on refunds is deducted from any surplus recognised.
Any gains or losses arising on the recognition of defined benefit plan surpluses or adjustments to such surpluses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes The expense for the year for defined contribution schemes was 3.1m 2013: 3.1m.
Defined benefit schemes The preliminary results for the 2014 actuarial funding valuations for the UK schemes were updated to 31 December 2014 for accounting purposes by independent qualified actuaries.
Assumptions and sensitivities Principal actuarial assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Groups schemes: UK Other UK Other schemes schemes schemes schemes 2014 2014 2013 2013 % % % % Discount rate 3.40 n a 4.40 n a Future salary increases 3.75 n a 3.75 n a Weighted average pension increases 2.70 n a 2.84 n a Retail price inflation 2.70 n a 3.10 n a Consumer price inflation 1.70 n a 2.35 n a The discount rate has been based on available yields of AA rated corporate bonds of a similar duration to the UK schemes liabilities.
The inflation assumptions have been set by reference to the yield on the Bank of England implied inflation curve.
The life expectancy rates used are 105% of the SAPS S2 tables based on the year of birth of scheme members, which is currently on average 1943 for pensioners and 1958 for non-pensioners.
Allowances for future improvements in mortality rates are in line with the CMI 2013 projections with a 1% p. a. long term trend rate.
These projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.9 years for males and 23.9 years for females 2013: 21.3 years and 23.5 years respectively.
For current non-pensioner members aged 45, the assumed average life expectancy at age 65 is 23.3 years for males and 25.4 years for females 2013: 22.2 years and 24.6 years respectively.
The average rate of improvement underlying the standard tables is an increase of approximately 0.8 years life expectancy in every 10 years 2013: 0.6 years.
For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, RP 2014 mortality tables and MP 2014 longevity improvements model have been used.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.6 years for males and 23.8 years for females 2013: 19.1 years and 21.0 years respectively.
Non-pensioner members are assumed to take cash lump sums at retirement.
Additional assumptions used for valuing the UK scheme liabilities are an allowance for all non-pensioners to take 15% of pension as tax-free cash upon retirement 2013: 15%.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 127 Financial Statements Section 7: Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued The discount rate, assumed salary increases and assumed mortality all have a significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit obligation.
The sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions is as follows: Impact on Impact on deficit deficit 2014 2013 m m 0.25 percentage point decrease to discount rate 20.0 19.0 0.25 percentage point increase to discount rate -20.0 -18.0 0.25 percentage point increase to inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 10.0 9.0 0.25 percentage point decrease to inflation including pension increases linked to inflation -10.0 -9.0 One year increase to life expectancy 16.0 17.0 One year decrease to life expectancy -16.0 -17.0 The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
Risks and uncertainties Plan assets are mainly invested in equities, bonds, gilts, property and diversified growth funds and are exposed to the risks outlined below: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
The Group believes that due to the long term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
Some of the plans assets are invested in Diversified Growth Funds.
These funds invest in a wide range of assets including equities, bonds, commodities and cash.
These actively managed funds aim to provide equity-like returns over the medium to long term, but with less volatility.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
Within the plans assets are some UK government bonds linked to inflation however the majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by inflation or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
128 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Life expectancy The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.

Over the year the corporate bond holdings and majority of the government bond holdings for the UK plans were replaced with a combination of credit, LIBOR and bespoke Liability Driven Investment LDI funds.
The objective of this was to broadly maintain the overall level of hedging but increase expected returns slightly.
The LDI fund is a unit fund invested with Legal & General, and the underlying investments include derivatives.
The illiquid credit fund is managed by M&G, with underlying investments in a variety of credit instruments.

7.3 Share-based payments The Group maintains seven share-based payment schemes.
Awards granted in three of these schemes have exercise prices Executive Share Option Scheme and the UK and International Save As You Earn Option Schemes.
Awards granted by the other four schemes are nil cost options Bonus Investment Plan, Executive Retention Plan, Performance Share Plan and Medium Term Incentive Plan.
Accounting Policy Equity-settled transactions The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to all grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments granted.
The fair value is measured by an external advisor using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo methods as appropriate, and takes into account any market vesting conditions or non-vesting conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as an expense, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the periods in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition or a non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense or increase in equity is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions i. e. vesting conditions are satisfied.
When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation.
Any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the entity or the employees are not met.
