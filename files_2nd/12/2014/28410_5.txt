Provident Financial plc 6 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Our social purpose No business can operate sustainably in todays world without a compelling social purpose Provident Financials social purpose is financial inclusion for those who are not well served by mainstream credit products or are excluded altogether.
To do this, we provide non-standard credit customers with appropriate amounts of credit, maintain close contact with them throughout the term of their loan and work with them sympathetically if they experience difficulties.
Terms and conditions are designed to meet their particular needs and rigorous checks are made to ensure customers can afford the repayments.
We have been doing this successfully since 1880.
The non-standard credit market The UK non-standard credit market comprises around 12 million people who, for a variety of reasons, are not well served by the mainstream credit market, either because they would not be accepted by a mainstream lender, or because mainstream credit products would not suit their particular needs.
The main reasons that a customer will turn to the non-standard market is that they have a relatively low income, they have a poor credit history because of past problems, or have a limited credit history, or have no credit history at all.
Specialist non-standard lenders such as Provident Financial have the expertise to serve non-standard consumers in a responsible manner.
