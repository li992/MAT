Strategic report 36 Progress against our sustainability commitments Weve made good progress against many of the five-year commitments we set in 2010, although there is still work to do to achieve targets over the coming year.
Heres how we are progressing across a number ofour key sustainability commitments: Our material issues What we said What we did 2014 Performance highlight Status We will maintain our FSC certification of all owned and leased forests.
In 2014, we maintained 100% FSC certification of our owned and leased forests.

Overall we have reduced our specific energy consumption by 21%.
reduction of specific energy On target We will progress towards being a carbon neutral business in the longer term, by increasing 59% of the total fuel consumption of our pulp and paper mills came from renewable energy the proportion of renewable resources for primary energy needs against the 2010 baseline.
59% of fuel consumption of mills from renewables On target We will report on land set aside for conservation purposes.
In 2014, 25% of our owned and leased forestry land was set aside for conservation purposes.

Further planned investments in our pulp and paper mills such as at 5% to deliver Syktyvkar and wiecie, as well as improvements from action plans resulting from water impact reduction of specific 2015 target assessments, will help us improve further going forward.
