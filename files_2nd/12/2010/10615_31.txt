It is estimated that Mothercare stores usage is 70 per cent of the group total.
Energy and fuel carbon emissions Our energy use in buildings has continued to fall as we have consolidated stores and opened Early Learning Centres inside parenting centres and larger Mothercare stores.
This underlying reduction has been supported by a range of actual and pilot projects to cut our energy use still further: 53 stores have voltage limiters installed, reducing the electricity consumption.
O ur Edmonton store trialled fide-stratfication fans to circulate warm air more efficiently around the store, cutting energy costs.
We completed the installation of automatic meter reading equipment AMRs in all Mothercare stores, allowing each store to monitor its energy consumption constantly and spot waste as it happens.
The environment Up to this point, all our environmental work Our targets above concentrate on our has focused on the UK since it is where O ur National Distribution Centre at biggest environmental impacts energy most of our directly controlled business lies.
Daventry continues to invest in energy and fuel carbon emissions, waste and All the data in this section therefore relates efficient technology, this year installing packaging.
An important third aspect to the UK.
As our overseas operations grow, a new fluorescent lighting system is the environmental impact of making we will begin to manage their impacts controlled by movement sensors, our products.
We also plan to engage and also fitting individual temperature our franchise partners, encouraging them regulators to each heating unit.
Together to consider environmental efficiency too.
these initiatives have led to an annual energy saving of 35 per cent.
