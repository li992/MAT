Pidgley, Perrins and Whiteman receive payments in lieu of pension at 17%, 15% and 15% of base salary respectively all these payments are subject to income tax and national insurance.
These payments are not included in salary figures for the purposes of determining any other benefit entitlement.

Full details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 52.
Benefits in kind Policy: Market practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits: a fully expensed company car or cash allowance alternative: and medical insurance.
Other remuneration matters All employee share plans The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was appropriate to introduce all employee share plans.
The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan.
The Board, therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees.
Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
Non-executive Directors fees Policy: Upper decile fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
