Directors Report and Business Review 15 n Treasury & financial risk management The main financial risks of Next relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, default by counterparties to financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
In addition, Nexts business expansion and share buyback strategy may necessitate the raising of additional finance, which would in turn increase interest costs and could give rise to fluctuations in profit.
Higher debt levels would also result in an increase in the proportion of cash flow dedicated to servicing debt and potentially increase its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Next operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing its liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups treasury policy allows the use of derivative instruments provided they are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Further details of the Groups treasury operations are given in Notes 30 to 34 to the financial statements.
