The Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work.
Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division.
The Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Companys current circumstances.
It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible.
Both the Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
In addition, a number of senior employees of the Company have been granted awards under Part B of the 2009 LTIP.
