The Remuneration Committee has oversight of the main reward structures throughout the Group.
In addition, in respect of the Committees specific review for executive directors, the Committee is satisfied that the Groups incentive structures are consistent with the risk profile of the Company set by the Board and also encourage a long-term sustainable view to be taken by participants.
One of the features of the Groups remuneration which the Committee believes is particularly relevant in this context is the availability of plans encouraging wide share ownership at all levels of management.
The Management Incentive Plan is used to incentivise management below the most senior level and provide share ownership.
Approximately 300 employees are eligible to participate in the plan.
Participants come from all levels of management excluding those who participate in the Long Term Incentive Plan and are based in many of the Groups geographical areas of operation, as the table below demonstrates.
