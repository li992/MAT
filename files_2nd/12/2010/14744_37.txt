Across its electricity generation portfolio taking account of contractual 2006 622 shares, SSE now has an allocation of 18.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions allowances per calendar year, Renewable generation capacity MW including the allowances for Marchwood and Uskmouth.
Its emissions allowances 2010 2,370 requirement for 2009 10, beyond those allocated under EU ETS, was 4.9 million 2009 2,220 tonnes.
This compares with 2.5 million 2008 2,030 tonnes in the previous year.
During 2009 10, the price of allowances ranged 2007 1,518 from around 11.50 to around 15.50 2006 1,390 per tonne.
From 2013, all of the carbon dioxide emissions allowances for electricity producers will be auctioned.
Renewable energy capacity composition % Emissions of carbon dioxide In 2009 10, emissions of carbon dioxide from power stations in which SSE has an ownership or contractual interest totalled 23.1 million tonnes, compared with 19.3 million tonnes in the previous Wind 36 840MW year, reflecting the increase in the Hydro 61 1,450MW amount of electricity generated from thermal power stations following the Biomass 3 80MW unusually low level in the previous year.
Assuming it displaced electricity produced from coal-fired power stations, the output of SSEs wind farms and conventional hydro electric schemes see below extensive programme of investment Renewable Energy Directive imposes saved around 4.5 million tonnes of in energy from renewable sources, legally-binding targets on Member carbon dioxide in 2009 10.
