Corporate responsibility The Groups vision is to be the most highly respected company in the industry.
To achieve this vision we have to build, maintain, protect and enhance our reputation among our employees, customers, supply chain partners and investors, as well as among the community at large.
A fundamental contribution to making this vision become reality is our robust approach to corporate responsibility, led by the Board and embedded in all the processes and services we undertake as a business.
