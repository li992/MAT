In practice, this means using performancebased environmental management systems to drive improvement throughout the business.
All Smiths manufacturing facilities with more than 50 employees are required to achieve certification to the international environmental management system standard ISO 14001.
New acquisitions and sites that grow above this threshold have two years to comply.

However, during FY2010, we experienced an increase in energy consumption, CO2 emissions and water use.
When these environmental metrics are normalised to turnover, they have lower increases than the absolute values, indicating that parts of the increases are associated with increased output.
Increases were also associated with the addition of new businesses that began reporting in FY2010, and the acts of relocating and consolidating operations.
Though we work to minimise environmental impacts caused during our operational changes, opportunities to reduce still exist, on which we will continue to focus.
In addition, our newly acquired businesses will implement actions Health and safety to reduce their environmental footprint.
