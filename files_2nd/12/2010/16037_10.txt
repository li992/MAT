We were asked to provide certified timber for 17m of sales 9% of total timber sales.
We also detected a growing awareness of the Building Research Establishment BRE framework standard for the responsible sourcing of construction products BES 6001 amongst our largest customers: although we have seen very little change in awareness of any aspect of responsible sourcing from smaller building firms.
As one of the largest multi-site holders of FSC and PEFC Chain of Custody and the only multiple merchant that offers certified timber at every branch selling timber, we strive to ensure that our supply chain operates at the highest levels of integrity.
However, in 2010 we recorded 16 complaints about our Chain of Custody system and responded to all of them.
