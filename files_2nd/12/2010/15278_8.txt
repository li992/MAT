Over the Group as a whole the rate improved by a factor of 3 over the decade: our performance on all lost to nearly 5 Near Misses per member of staff an excellent time accidents is now over 25% better to that achieved on performance.

As a company, Yule Catto was one of the initial group of signatories 4.0 to the programme of SD goals put forward by UK CIA to its 3.0 member companies in 2005.
The Companys commitment to these SD goals has been shown by a continuous record of 2.0 investment in environmental improvement and a continuous record of achievement against the targets set.
This has led to Actual 1.0 a significant reduction of our environmental impacts since 2000.

Both of the main contributors to Yule Cattos global warming performance moved adversely in 2010: the Groups energy Not all of the Groups measures of our SD performance are performance per tonne was worse than 2009 discussed recorded in the graphs presented here.
A good number of above and the quantity of VOCs released also increased.
the other measures which we use internally also show very The quantity of VOCs increased for the second year in a row, significant improvement over the last 10 years.
As examples: mainly due to an increase in the production of nitrile rubber for our releases of nitrogen oxides to air have fallen by more than the gloves market in Malaysia.
The manufacture of this grade 80% per production tonne over the last 10 years: our releases of latex is inherently more likely to give rise to the release of phosphorous to water have fallen by over 75% over the of VOCs than other materials we produce.

the releases and these are expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2012.
This record of success is reflected in all of our SD measures which have improved considerably since 2000: indeed all are Although the performance in 2010 was disappointing the well ahead of the targets we set for improvement over this longer term picture is still of continuing improvement in the period.
However, on 3 measures the Group performed less Groups releases of greenhouse gases with only the period from well in 2010 than in 2009, though the performance was still 2007-2009 being better than the figure for 2010.
Yule Catto beat considerably better than in earlier years and below target.

0.35 0.30 Energy 0.25 Although 2010 saw an increase in energy use per tonne 0.20 compared to 2009, it was still easily the second best year ever for energy consumption across Yule Catto.
Over the 0.15 10 year period the Groups energy consumption per tonne 0.10 Actual has improved such that the energy used to make 2 tonnes 0.05 10-year target in 2000 now makes over 3 tonnes of product.
Compared to 0.00 our 10-year SD commitment energy consumption was 30% 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 better than the target set.
The increase in energy use was widely distributed across most of the Groups sites.
It partly reflects lower volumes and changing products mix but this is an area where Yule Catto remains committed to further significant improvements in both specific energy use and fide-carbonisation of our energy supplies.
We will be proposing new Group energy targets during 2011 for the next 5 year period which will reflect these commitments.

Despite this setback the hazardous waste disposal to landfill from Group sites in 2010 was still only 5.0 27% of 2000 levels and only 35% of our SD target.

The incidents reported are either unforeseen releases, mainly spillages on site which have managed to circumvent the sites containment system: or are routine releases from our Effluent Treatment Plants ETP which have breached their permitted limits.
All these incidents have been investigated and appropriate remedial actions taken to reduce the chance of the incident being repeated.
Although all such incidents are matters of concern to Yule Catto, none of the incidents in 2010 have led to any noticeable environmental damage being reported to any Group company.
Two of the incidents were in Durban, South Africa where the site has plans to construct new ETP during the coming year.
This will considerably improve the quality of the effluent routinely released and reduce the chances of exceeding the release limits in future, even if the local authorities further tighten the permitted releases from the plant.

The key measures suggested were energy use, emissions to air, waste disposal and water consumption, on an absolute and a per tonne basis.
Yule Catto has reported on these indicators for a number of years, and to aid transparency in environmental performance reporting Yule Catto adopted DEFRAs preferred format in 2008 for the report on our 2007 performance.
This format is used in the table below which gives the data for the period 2008-2010.
Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport.
Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel: and therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to bought-in electricity.
