Revenues Revenues generated by Kazakhmys Copper increased by 35% or $825 million in 2010 as the higher commodity prices for its principal products more than compensated for the lower sales volumes of copper cathode.
Kazakhmys Copper generated around 75% of its revenue from copper products, the sales of which grew by $673 million compared to the prior year.
Copper cathode and rod realised prices were 50% above 2009, rising from $5,024 to $7,523 per tonne.
Pricing in the second half of 2010 was particularly strong as the average realised price exceeded $8,000 per tonne.
Copper cathode equivalent sales volumes of 317 kt were 24 kt or 7% below the prior year due to the lower own copper concentrate production volumes and as 2009 benefited from a 17 kt reduction in finished goods stock, 4 kt greater than the finished goods reduction in 2010.
The trial sales of copper concentrate which occurred in the first seven months of 2009 were not repeated in 2010.
The volume of copper rod sales increased from 8 kt to 35 kt as premiums on sales to China improved with stronger demand which justified a greater allocation of cathode to rod production.

Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and MET, increased by 24% on the prior year, reflecting the higher prices for consumables and supplies used in the mining process and greater consumption as ore extraction and preparation volumes increased in 2010.
Repair costs also rose as additional focus was placed on improving the performance of assets, including work to overhaul the furnaces at the smelters and reducing outage rates at the captive power stations.
Environmental taxes were impacted by emission claims for prior periods.
Employee costs were 5% above the prior year as staff placed on part-time work in 2009 in response to economic conditions returned to full-time work to support the higher ore production.
Inflationary salary increases were also awarded, partially offset by the transfer during 2009 of personnel to outsourcing companies.
Costs associated with the transportation of ore, which has been outsourced to third parties, increased due to higher tariffs and as stockpiled ore from Akbastau and Kosmurun was processed during the year.
In 2010, administration costs rose by 34% to $479 million, excluding the $130 million charge for major social projects.
These higher costs include the additional support provided by Kazakhmys to a range of smaller social projects within the local community during 2010 given the better pricing environment after the focus on cost reductions in 2009.

The installation of commence drilling of a fifth well in early 2011, the site the ESP at Unit 6 is expected to be completed in 2011 and the for which is undergoing preparation, possibly to be ESPs for Units 7 and 8 are planned to be operational in 2012. followed by the drilling of a sixth well later in the year.
The installation of ESPs for Units 3 and 4 will follow on from the aforementioned works.
The four year exploration licence for the Eastern Akzhar block expires in May 2011.
Kazakhmys is in the process of applying for an extension to the licence term which it expects to be granted.

In 2010, investment was MKM is the Groups downstream copper business, which made into the production lines of strips, sheets, tubes and produces and sells copper and copper alloy semi-finished bars to enable MKM to expand its product range.
Based in Germany, the business is structured in raised its slitting capacity which was a bottleneck impacting three sections: wire products, flat products strips, plates and sales of flat products.
Kazakhmys determined in 2009 that MKM was not a core business as it was inconsistent with the Groups geographic and strategic focus and classified it as held for sale.
At the 2010 year end, the business remains classified as held for sale.
gVA Gross Value Added GVA represents the conversion charge that customers pay in excess of the copper cathode cost, and is considered a key performance measure for MKM as it excludes the impact of changes in the price of copper.
MKMs sales recovered in 2010 from the weak demand experienced in 2009, leading to GVA rising from 123 million to 146 million.
MKMs biggest market is Germany, representing over 40% of total sales volumes.
MKM succeeded in growing domestic sales by 17% in 2010, more than compensating for the lower volumes sold to Eastern Europe as MKM focused on higher margin products.
Overall sales volumes grew by 7% in 2010, which was achieved alongside a GVA per tonne increase from 521 to 578.
Management reduced sales of copper wire rods, partly to preserve working capital, and grew sales of higher value add products such as drawn wire, strips and bars which rose 34%, 13% and 9%, respectively, compared to the prior year.
In response to demand, MKM extended its product range during 2010 and added additional capacity to certain lines.
Another factor in raising sales was the availability of debtor insurance, which forms part of MKMs risk management strategy.
Debtor insurance was limited in availability during 2009 but, over the course of 2010, credit limits for customers have been progressively raised, enabling MKM to accept orders they may otherwise have refused.

Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2010 35 Directors Report: Business Review Corporate Responsibility Realising our potential through responsible operations introduction Copper is an essential resource for social and economic development, thanks to its ability to conduct heat and electricity, its resistance to corrosion and its presence in various alloys.
Mining copper brings vital employment to remote communities, and our business is a major contributor to Kazakhstans economy, infrastructure and services.
Mining and smelting also present various risks to people and the environment, which must be carefully and responsibly managed.
We aim to provide fair and safe workplaces, protect the environment and invest in local communities and economies.
