Sustainability 42 RBS Group 2010 Sustainability Building a sustainable RBS Sustainability is fundamental to how RBS is changing the way we operate.
It is a core part of our thinking and we have made improvements in this area over the last year.
However, we are mindful that there is still a long way to go.
Philip Hampton, Chairman At RBS, sustainability means two things.
First, we consider the environmental, social and ethical consequences of our activities and then we manage our business appropriately.
Secondly, we look to capitalise on the opportunities for our businesses that sustainable technologies present.
Our sustainability activities focus on five themes that we chose because our stakeholders have told us that they are the topics that matter most to them.
The themes are: Fair banking Supporting enterprise Employee engagement Safety and security Citizenship and environmental sustainability In addition, we have a number of targeted community programmes that enable us to enhance our contribution to society.
We aim to invest Group resources to maximise our impact, creating real and sustainable benefits in the communities in which we operate.
