Power generator Drax Group plc has selected Eaga in an exclusive agreement to deliver its entire CESP obligation.
Energy suppliers and power generators, such as Drax Group plc, are obliged to contribute to CESP by offering a range of energy efficiency solutions such as solid wall insulation, modern central heating systems and renewable technologies.
Adopting a whole house, house-by-house, street-by-street approach, Drax Group plc will work with Eaga to develop community-based partnerships and promote energy efficiency solutions.
Communities of up to 600 homes will be identified for help in CESP-eligible areas.
Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive of Drax Group plc said: This is the first time that generators have had an obligation which links them directly with end consumers.
Working with Eaga means our obligation can be managed in a very efficient way in what is very unfamiliar territory for us.
With almost 20 years experience of improving the energy efficiency of UK housing stock, we believe Eaga is well placed to assist us in meeting our carbon emissions reduction obligation under CESP.
