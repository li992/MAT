Group safety performance In 2015 BP reported one workforce fatality in Turkey that occurred when a ceiling collapsed during renovations at a recently acquired retail site.
We deeply regret the loss of this life and continue to focus efforts on eliminating injuries and fatalities in our workplaces.

We report our safety performance using industry metrics, including the 52% of the 353 million hours worked by BP in 2015 were carried out American Petroleum Institute API recommended practice 754.
These include tier 1 process safety events, defined as a loss of primary by contractors.
containment causing harm to a member of the workforce, costly damage Process safety events to equipment or exceeding defined quantities.
Tier 2 events are those of number of incidents lesser consequence than tier 1.
Tier 1 Tier 2 Loss of primary containment We seek to record all losses of primary containment regardless of the 400 volume of the release, and to report externally on losses over a severity threshold.
These include unplanned or uncontrolled releases from pipes, 300 containers or vehicles within our operational boundary, excluding releases of non-hazardous substances such as water.
200 We have seen improvements in our process safety performance over the 100 past five years.
This has been true across our upstream and downstream businesses, with fewer tier 1 process safety events, fewer leaks and spills 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and fewer recordable injuries.
At the same time, the reliability of our rigs and refineries has improved.
We believe this shows that the rigour needed to produce safe operations tends also to produce reliable Recordable injury frequency operations.
We will maintain our focus on systematic safety management, workforce incidents per 200,000 hours worked including self-verification and testing the effectiveness of our risk a American Petroleum Institute US benchmark a mitigation measures.
International Association of Oil & Gas Producers benchmark Our figures for loss of primary containment in 2014 and 2015 include 0.8 increased reporting due to the introduction of enhanced automated 0.6 monitoring for remote sites in our US Lower 48 business.
