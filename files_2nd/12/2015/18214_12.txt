Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: the Directors statement, set out on pages 70 and 71 in relation to going concern: and the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Companys compliance with the ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code Our application of materiality specified for our review.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 2.6 million 2014: 2.7 million, which is 5 per cent 2014: 5 per cent of pre-tax profit.
We used pre-tax profits as we determined this to be the most relevant measure of profitability for the Group.
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of Alistair Denton Senior Statutory Auditor further audit procedures.
For and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor Hull On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that overall performance 18 May 2015 materiality i. e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance for the Group should be 75 per cent 2014: 75 per cent of planning materiality, namely 1.9 million 2014: 2.1 million.
Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality level.
Audit work at individual components is undertaken based on a percentage of our total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative size of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to components was 0.2 million to 1.3 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 0.13 million 2014: 0.14 million, as well as any differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
