The results of the GHG emissions inventory arepresented in the format recommended by the GHGProtocol.
Direct GHG emissions Scope 1 The baseline in the GHG emissions allocation plan was setas the mean value of the total emissions for the years 20112012 in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent.
Thequota allocated for 2015 is calculated based on commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.5%from this baseline.
The following direct GHG emissions Scope 1 sources have been identified: flares, heaters, incinerators, boilers, gas turbine plants, electric power stations, compressors and fugitive emissions.
Historically, the major part of stationary combustion emissions was attributed to flaring of associated gas at the Oil Treatment Unit OTU and at the Gas Treatment Facility GTF.
The situation has changed considerably since the GTF was completed.
Total direct GHG emissions Scope 1 subdivided by gastypes and by source types are summarised in Tables 1 and 2.
