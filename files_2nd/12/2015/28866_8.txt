Business model and strategy 19 Our Customers RBS remains committed to achieving its target of being number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy by 2020.
In recent years, RBS has launched a number of initiatives to make it a simple and fair bank to do business with, and it continues to deliver on the commitments that it made to its customers in 2014.
We use independent surveys to measure our customers experience and track our progress against our goal in each of our markets.
Net Promoter Score NPS Customers are asked how likely they would be to recommend their bank to a friend or colleague, and respond based on a 0-10 scale with 10 indicating extremely likely and 0 indicating not at all likely.
Customers scoring 0 to 6 are termed detractors and customers scoring 9 to 10 are termed promoters.
NPS is established by subtracting the proportion of detractors from the proportion of promoters.
The table below lists all of the businesses for which we have a NPS for Q4 2015.

Each quarter we ask customers to what extent they trust or distrust their bank to do the right thing.
The score is a net measure of those customers that trust their bank a lot or somewhat minus those that distrust their bank a lot or somewhat.
Customer trust in RBS is at its highest in two years and NatWest has also improved.
