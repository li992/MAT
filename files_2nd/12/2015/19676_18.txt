Responsible operator Being the operator of a broad range of energy assets involves working on challenging sites, responding to issues of concern such as climate change and managing wider environmental impacts connected with the use of resources.
SSE aims to take a responsible approach to addressing each of these issues so that people are safe, environmental challenges are tackled and resources are used effectively.
