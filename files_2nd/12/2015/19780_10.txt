PEOPLE AND ORGANISATION EMPLOYEES We rely on the combined efforts of around 800 employees to manage relationships with both our Members and Partners, and deliver a consistently high quality of service at all times.
We pay considerable attention to recruiting, developing and retaining people with appropriate skills.
We continue to recruit new members of staff through our own Assessment Centre designed to give the Company greater control over the recruitment process and to ensure we select the very best candidates for our positions.
Once they have joined, new starters go through a structured training programme to ensure that they are fully equipped to resolve any queries from our membership and to provide the high level of service that we demand.
Everyone who successfully completes this programme celebrates their achievement at a quarterly Academy graduation ceremony, where they are presented with a certificate and Champagne by the Chief Executive.
The combination of valuing and developing our staff, our service-oriented culture and the day-to-day reinforcement of our core values are key competitive advantages in enabling us to attract and retain a motivated, talented and diverse workforce.
We continue to invest in our people, and have comprehensive Manager and Supervisor development programmes, which are accompanied by selective executive coaching.
We have an online learning portal to assist in the development of all our employees, and make available a wide range of Skills Builder Courses in addition to e-learning modules.
We promote from within where possible into both specialist and managerial roles.
Our monthly employee recognition awards known internally as Piggy Awards enable the Company to celebrate and reward employees who have gone over and above in the performance of their role.
We actively seek to engage all our employees in changes that may concern them, rather than just a representative few on a committee.
Focus groups are held on a continual basis to ensure that any changes we have introduced continue to encourage our staff to perform to their best.
We keep employees informed on a regular basis of the financial performance of the business and other matters of potential concern to them, through the Company intranet, ad-hoc emails, the monthly Company newsletter and quarterly breakfast forums with the Chief Executive.
We operate an open-door policy throughout the business, provide employees with various mechanisms for providing feedback and making suggestions, and include open ended questions within the staff survey.
This year we held our very own Dragons Den competition, The Piggies Pen to elicit innovative suggestions for improving our business from our staff, and were delighted when over 70 members of staff submitted entries.
We have an active staff social committee which organises a wide range of events, supported by the Company, including the annual summer and Christmas parties, quiz nights and many other ad hoc fun events.
We also have a Fun Fund set aside for departmental social events.
30 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements We promote staff wellbeing, through an employee assistance helpline, periodic at-desk massages, healthy meal options in the staff restaurant and a cycle to work scheme.
Each September we run our Fit Pig Week to promote health and well-being within the Company with a range of fun events and initiatives, such as offering well-being check-ups.
Last year we introduced private health care with BUPA, which our staff can elect to join at advantageous corporate rates, with premiums deducted from salary.
This has been taken up by a significant number of our staff, and in particular, longer-standing members and management.
Our new headquarters has been designed to offer our staff a much enhanced working environment.
In addition to offering state of the art facilities, the offices include design features to inspire our staff and encourage collaboration.
Spacious and light, there are break out rooms on all floors and a recreation suite that boasts a wide-screen TV lounge, pods for relaxing in, plenty of seating areas and a library area with table-tennis and pool tables.
Our new staff restaurant has been upgraded to a brasserie style eatery, complete with its own Deli Bar.
This highly subsidised restaurant is an increasingly popular benefit for our staff and provides a great venue for the staff social events: including regular Drinks After Work.
With the exception of our logistics team, all our employees work together in Network HQ, our new Head Office building in London.
We provide a wide range of other staff benefits including a significant discount on the services we provide, employee loans at preferential interest rates, a generous Christmas bonus scheme, Gourmet Society dining membership and recognition for five, 10 and 15 years service.
The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved employee share option plan, under which employees are granted options to purchase shares in the Company which are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise price is the market price at the time of granting the option.
Our policy is to issue options to all employees after the satisfactory completion of their probationary period, and additional options when 10 years service has been completed and in other appropriate circumstances e. g. promotion.
As at 31 March 2015 there were outstanding options over 1,882,082 shares which had been granted to staff, representing approximately 2.3% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Employees returning from maternity leave with children less than 12 months old are able to benefit from a company contribution towards the cost of an external childcare service provider of their choice.
We also provide facilities for staff to purchase childcare vouchers in a tax-efficient manner using a salary sacrifice scheme, in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines.
We encourage all employees to participate in a stakeholder pension scheme operated by Aviva.
Participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain limits, depending on length of service.
As a result of pension auto-enrolment the Company is contributing to the pension funds of virtually all employees, on a monthly basis.
We actively facilitate Access to Work grants for employees who have a disability, health or mental health condition providing the practical support to enable them to continue working effectively.
