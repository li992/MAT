Positive Places is our strategy for making that happen.
OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY KEY FACTS 2015 The environmental and social impacts of our business 4% reduction in Group CO emissions 2 operations are significant, presenting both risks and intensity opportunities.
We work consistently through our Positive Places framework to ensure we manage and Four Sustainability awards mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities.
The outcome is a consistently strong track record for 2 million saved through waste sustainability that makes us attractive to investors, management particularly those with a sustainability mandate.
Our business has five major sustainability impact areas: 3% reduction in UK electricity demand Retained GRESB Green Star and improved energy security and demand scores in all sustainability benchmarks waste management The strength of this approach can be seen in the activities and achievements we are able to report for 2015.
Our scores against all key industry benchmarks water consumption have improved and we have made significant progress against our corporate targets, with particular successes investment in our local communities in supplier engagement.
Waste management has been more challenging, particularly in France, as has water management in the UK.
The influence of weather materials use and procurement on carbon emissions is also becoming increasingly important as we face more extreme conditions.
These will all be areas of particular attention in 2016.
Our sustainability initiatives reflect these issues and go beyond them.

A different reporting period from our financial reporting year has been selected, in accordance with the DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidance, to avoid the use of estimated utility consumption data.
The data has been calculated and recorded in accordance with the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064.
We are required by the new Scope 2 GHG Protocol to report our Scope 2 emissions using both market-based and location-based methods.
However, our utility provider has been unable to provide specific emissions factors for our renewable energy contract to calculate emissions using the market-based approach.
