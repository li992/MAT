com Projects When selecting safety initiatives to implement across the Group, EVRAZ has focused on those that would have a long-lasting effect on its safety performance.
Above all, in the long term, it is vital that all employees receive training in relevant safety issues and demonstrate EVRAZ NTMK LAUNCHES MODERN compliance not only in the classroom, but also by behaving with the utmost care and AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM ROLLING MILL attention in the workplace.
To this end, the Group launched corporate HSE training to supplement obligatory training, and introduced awareness-raising safety conversations to ensure that managers observe and discuss employees actions on the shop floor.
In addition, the risk mitigation system should be designed in a way that is difficult to bypass, LOTO system is aimed at preventing machinery from deliberately or accidentally.
The releasing hazardous energy by physically locking the controls.
LOTO | In 2013 and 2014, the Group suffered serious fatalities that were due to failure to observe energy isolation initiatives.
As a result, it decided to focus on improving procedures and standard work regarding energy isolation.
EVRAZ took the strict energy isolation procedures and equipment used in North America and applied the same procedures using similar LOTO equipment at other locations.
HSE Training | In 2013, the management realised that to improve safety on the shop floor, EVRAZ NTMK has launched a state-of-the-art air purification system in its rolling mill.
The equipment the Group needed to invest in training employees in safety well beyond the obligatory level.
Each site then devised a comprehensive HSE training programme designed to give every has been installed in the fixed mounts section of the rolling shop.
Previously, workers used face masks to employee on the shop floor extra 10 hours of safety-related training a year.
protect themselves from graphite and metal dust.
Now, the system removes the dust from the air, and Safety Conversations | Best practice in occupational safety prescribes that regular safety conversations take place on shop floors among employees and managers.
Recognising that employees have noted considerable improvements.
such conversations are an essential part of encouraging safety, EVRAZ introduced a system of scheduling them regularly across its sites.
Every manager, from a first line supervisor to The Group spent c. RUB8 million on the project.
EVRAZ NTMK is implementing various initiatives to the CEO, has a personal target to conduct a certain number of such conversations.
enhance health and safety at its enterprises, which is one of its top priorities.
Alcohol Testing | In 2012-13, EVRAZ registered several incidents that involved employees or contractors being in a state of alcohol or drug intoxication on-site, in clear violation of one of the Groups cardinal rules.
As a result, the management decided to equip all sites with alcohol and drug testing equipment to ensure strict enforcement of EVRAZ zerotolerance policy.
At present, those entering underground mines undergo alcohol and drug tests, and the Group is working to implement similar practice at its steelmaking facilities.
Based on analysis of lost-time indicators for 2014, EVRAZ focus in 2015 was on mobile equipment, railway operations and operational hazards in underground mining.
In 2016, the Group will continue to focus on those areas, while further implementing energy isolation principles LOTO and behaviour-based conversations.
The zero-tolerance policy regarding alcohol and drug intoxication remains in place.
Regarding coal mining, in 2015, EVRAZ implemented an e-mail and SMS notification system to report on excess amounts of dust and carbon monoxide and falling volumes of air in mines.
This builds on the SMS and e-mail emergency notification system on excess methane levels that was installed back in 2010.
In 2016, EVRAZ will continue to improve the quality of its safety training.
Every employee on the shop floor will continue to receive an extra hours of targeted safety training.
In addition, EVRAZ plans to complete the implementation of employee positioning systems at all of its Russian iron ore mines.

By the end of the year, the Group had met the targets set for water consumption, which EVRAZ is committed to further strengthening its environmental management systems, was reduced by 15%, and recycling, with particularly by continuing its ISO 14001 audit programme.
Although the Group has no legal 126% of waste being recycled exceeding obligation to obtain international certification, it currently has nine ISO 14001-certified the 100% target by recycling waste from sites, including its largest facilities, such as EVRAZ NTMK, EVRAZ ZSMK and EVRAZ DMZ.
The certificate of EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli has been temporarily suspended due to production stoppage.
At the end of 2015, EVRAZ was yet to fulfil the target for air emissions, having EVRAZ is undertaking the environmental reviews of its new business activities projects registered a 19% increase since 2011. on the basis of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ESIA.
This process involves consultations with local and regional authorities, local businesses and community members.
The study provides an evaluation of both the direct and indirect impacts of the new operation on the local community and on the wider environment.
The key tasks are to develop mitigation plans to minimise and manage the possible impacts.
It also provides a process to ensure that local communities are consulted in decisions we make throughout the life of the project.
EVRAZ supports the health and environmental goals of Regulation EC No.

The Groups registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals REACH goal is to ensure continued compliance with REACH requirements.
EVRAZ environmental strategy is to seek to minimise the negative impact of its operations and to use natural resources efficiently, while seeking optimal solutions for industrial waste management.
Compliance with environmental standards is a major long-term target.
In 2012, after determining the key challenges and focus areas, EVRAZ voluntarily adopted 2 over 2012-17 aimed at: five-year environmental targets 3 reducing air emissions by 5%: decreasing fresh water consumption by 15%: 4 recycling 100% of non-mining waste.
The Groups  environmental levies and fines decreased by 20% from US$2.5 million in 2014 to US$2.0 million in 2015.
No significant environmental permits or licences were missing or revoked in 2015, and there were no significant environmental incidents at EVRAZ assets.

Air emissions Key air emissions | Reducing air emissions is one of EVRAZ main environmental objectives.
EVRAZ key air emissions, kt The key air emissions primarily consist of nitrogen oxides NOx, sulphur oxides SOx, dust and volatile organic compounds.
2015 134.17 Even before 2011, the Group had made significant progress in reducing air emissions.
2014 124.24 Today, its air emissions reduction strategy includes plans to modernise gas treatment systems, implement modern technologies and withdraw obsolete equipment.
2013 119.12 Nevertheless, in 2015, key air emissions increased by 9.9 thousand tonnes or 8% compared 122.11 2012 with 2014.
The main drivers of the rise are an increase in sulphur content in the coal and ore used at EVRAZ ZSMKs power and sinter plants, which has resulted in higher SOx emissions, and 124.56 2011 higher NOx emissions at EVRAZ KGOK due to increase of production.
146.33 2010 Taking into account the managements decision to re-base the target by excluding data related to divested assets EVRAZ VGOK, EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel, Evrazrudas Krasnoyarsk mines, ZSMKs central power plant, EVRAZ Highveld and EVRAZ NTMKs Nizhnesaldinsky 2009 The above graph illustrates the dynamics in the total metal mill, key air emissions have increased by 19.2% since 2011. amount of key air emissions nitrogen oxides NOx, sulphur oxides SOx, dust and volatile organic compounds rebased to 2011.
Greenhouse gas emissions EVRAZ operations are also associated with emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The Group recognises the importance of seeking to prevent climate change and supports the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions into the atmosphere.
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 Strategic and Directors Report Regulations 2013, EVRAZ has undertaken to assess full GHG emissions from facilities under its control.
Since 2011, it participates in the CDP Climate Change Programme.
1 and indirect The assessment covered direct Scope 1 emissions of all seven Kyoto GHGs 2 Scope 2 emissions from the use of electricity and heat.
The inventory approach was based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC 2006 and WRI WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
The Group provides data in tonnes of carbon dioxide CO equivalent tCO e, calculated using IPCC 2006 global 2 2 warming potentials.
1 These are carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons HFC PFC, sulphur hexafluoride SF6 and nitrogen trifluoride NF3 2 The inventory of emissions includes all entities that the Group controls.
Entities that were disposed of during the year were included for the period in which they were part of the Group.
Only entities deemed immaterial for consolidated emissions based on their operational indicators were omitted.
Direct CO2 emissions from operations were calculated using the carbon balance method for carbon flows within production facilities, including fuel use.
Emissions of other GHGs were calculated based on measured volumes, inventory changes or IPCC 2006 factors and models including that for post-mining coal methane emissions where direct measurement data was not available.
Indirect emissions were estimated using emission factors specifically developed for the country or region, if available, or otherwise factors provided by UK Defra.
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 89 CSR Report GHG emissions data was collected for 2015 and compared with the 2014 and also 2013 EVRAZ GHG emissions in 2015, MtCO2e levels, which were established as a baseline.
The Steel segment is still responsible for more than half of gross greenhouse gas emissions from operations, while almost 93% Direct emissions Indirect energy emissions Scope 1 Scope 2 of full emissions from the Coal segment are due to fugitive methane leakage, caused by methane ventilation from underground mines and post-mining emissions from coal.
36.87 6.17 EVRAZ Total In 2015, the Groups overall greenhouse gas GHG emissions decreased by 8.4% year-on- 28.01 4.64 Steel year.
Emissions of CO2 fell by 6%, due to low operational activity at EVRAZ Highveld Steel and segment Vanadium and a reduction of coking coal consumption at EVRAZ ZSMK amid greater use of 0.7 0.61 Steel, pulverised coal injection technology.
In the coal segment, CH4 emissions dropped by 3% due to NA segment a lower methane content in the coal mined and a decrease in coal production at some mines.
8.15 0.93 Coal segment Overall, these factors enabled EVRAZ to reduce its Scope 1 emissions by 6%.
The Groups 0.01 0 Other Scope 2 emissions decreased by c. 22%, due to EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadiums low activity which accounted for c. 15% and lower volumes of energy purchased by EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK in 2015.
EVRAZ reports an intensity ratio relating its annual GHG emissions to its activities: total Scope 1 and 2 emissions per consolidated revenue for the Group overall and each operating segment see graphs according to the divisional structure.
In addition, specific emissions in the Steel segment per tonne of steel products for 2013-15 are compared with average specific emissions of World Steel Association members for 2014.
Higher specific GHG emissions in the Steel segment may be due to the key role that integrated iron and steel works which inherently emit more GHGs than rolling mills play in EVRAZ steel production.

2012 422.26 In 2015, fresh water consumption increased by 8.1 million cubic metres 2.4% compared with 2014.
The main driver of the rise in 2015 was EVRAZ ZSMKs Heat and Power Plant, which 451.59 2011 increased its water intake due to greater energy production 60.4 million kW and the need for more cooling water.
Given the HSE Committees decision to re-base the target by excluding data 2010 related to disposed assets, fresh water consumption decreased by 67.2 million cubic metres 14.9% compared with the 2011 adjusted baseline.
Water discharge decreased by 77.2 million cubic metres over 201215.
2009 Water pumped from mines dewatering is not included in the fresh water consumption target, although pumped water is partly used for technological needs.
In 2015, 20.5 million cubic metres of mine water were pumped out and used, compared with 44.7 million cubic metres in 2014.
1 The results for 2014 and 2013 were recalculated due to a change in the global warming potential GWP values for methane CH4 and nitrous oxide N2O, improvements in data quality and several identified inaccuracies.
In accordance with recommendations by the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA, GWP values were changed to the given in the fourth assessment report of IPCC - AR4 values 25 and 298 accordingly, instead of values from the second assessment report of IPCC - SAR for a 100-year time horizon 21 and 310 accordingly, used previously.
The total effect of these changes for Scope 1 emissions amounted to 1.45 MtCO2e for 2013 and 1.26 MtCO2e for 2014.
Identified improvements in data quality and inaccuracies regarding material flows resulted in adjustments to Scope 1 emissions of 0.48 MtCO2e for 2013 and of 0.21 MtCO2e for 2014.
