Corporate responsibility How we run our business responsibly The nature of our business means that our carbon emissions will be our largest environmental impact for the foreseeable future.
We continue to be an efficient airline, due to a modern fleet and high load factor.
It is the right thing to continue to work to reduce our environmental impact, but it is also absolutely central to maintaining our cost advantage and wider business efficiency.
In 2013 we set targets to reduce our carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 5% by 2022 and we have already achieved a 3% reduction, so we have increased the target further to 8% by 2020.
We also want to have strong, positive and effective relationships with our partners.
We already have very good relationships with most of them.
