STRATEGIC OUR FINANCIAL SHAREHOLDER REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES OF THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS We recognise that our business can have a direct, as well as indirect, effect on the environment.
We are committed to understanding any impact that our products, stores, Autocentres, support centre and delivery fleet have on the environment.
The data presented below allows us to monitor our impact and manage it responsibly, making improvements wherever feasible.
A great deal has been achieved already, such as the 90% increase in battery recycling and 40% increase in tyre recycling within our Autocentre business and, like other businesses, we will be undertaking a comprehensive assessment pursuant to the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme in the forthcoming year, which we hope will identify further opportunities for us to continue to mitigate our impact on the environment.
During the year we increased the frequency of deliveries to our Retail stores in response to an ongoing shift in product mix towards bulkier items, changing customer service needs and expectations, and rising online sales.
This, combined with high growth in the volume delivered, increased the number of deliveries and litres of fuel consumed by our transport operation in the year.
One of the benefits from a more frequent delivery schedule is a reduction, over time, in the number of deliveries by third party couriers, which will help to offset the increased fuel consumption within our own transport operations.
As part of the 50:39 store refresh programme we have implemented improved store lighting, and customer facing live displays such as TV screens and VRNs, which help to improve the customers in store experience and the look and feel of a Halfords store.
This has resulted in electricity usage increasing year on year in those re-developed stores The following table provides measures for the impact of our operations in the financial year.
The mandatory data required by the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013 is included here.
Data for all material emissions that are within our operational control and therefore our responsibility are included.

This represents the kilometres driven by transport under our direct control and does not include kilometres driven by third-party courier firms.
During the year we commenced more frequent deliveries to our Retail stores.
This increases the kilometres driven by our own delivery fleet, but reduces the number of courier deliveries.

com 23744-04 PROOF DOCUMENT SHELL 09-02-2015 STRATEGIC DELIVERY CYCLE REPUBLIC Cycle Republic is a new, cycling-only store format, focused on city centre locations, where Halfords has a low market share.
Cycle Republic aims to offer award-winning bikes at unrivalled value and best-in-class servicing and repair, served by colleagues for whom cycling is more than just a hobby: its their way of life!
Bikes are priced from 200 to 6,000, principally comprising Halfords own, exclusive brands such as Boardman, 13, Pendleton and Carrera, and complemented with brands such as Pinarello, Cinelli, Raleigh, Kona and Mongoose.
There is a much larger parts, accessories and clothing offer than in a Halfords Retail store, with over 1,000 additional products stocked in a Cycle Republic shop.
Central to the proposition is the cycle repair offer.
Each of the Cycle Republic stores is equipped with new tools, a parts washer and several repair stations, along with multiple highly-trained mechanics.
In December 2014 we opened the first Cycle Republic shop in Euston Tower, London.
By the end of May 2015 there were five shops: three in London, one in Norwich and one in Nottingham.
Four of the shops are brand new premises for Halfords and one, Twickenham, is a conversion from a Halfords Retail store.
The early signs are encouraging and we anticipate having around 15 Cycle Republic shops by the end of FY16.
