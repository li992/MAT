Communication and Engagement We continue to recognise the importance of communication and consultation with an annual Conference, regular formal and informal meetings, quarterly newsletters, and weekly operational updates.
In addition, the Directors and Senior Management spend a significant amount of time in the stores and are accessible to employees at all levels.
In October 2014, we ran our first externally managed Employee Engagement Survey, as we had previously carried out internal feedback surveys.
The new survey was structured to look at key areas including day to day working life, learning and development, team work, communication, management style and leadership.
The survey achieved a response rate of 91% 71% in 2012 and an Engagement Indicator of 86%.
Management are now utilising the feedback from the survey as the focus for their attention to further improve the working environment at both Big Yellow and Armadillo.
Training and Development We continue to promote the development of staff through ongoing training and regular performance appraisals.
For the year ended 31 March 2015 a total of 855 days training were provided across the Company, comprising both sales and operational training and personal and management development.
Our Big Impressions customer experience programme continued throughout the year, with our coaching and development initiatives being specifically designed to further support our people to become more in touch with our customers.
During the last year, seven team members completed our personal development programme designed specifically for Assistant Store Managers, with four of those people having subsequently been promoted to the position of Store Manager.
12 Assistant Store Managers are currently participating in the programme, to prepare them for their future progression within the Company.
41 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 2.0 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY continued Community We recognise the importance of contributing within the local community and we encourage our people to develop close links with charities, schools and other institutions, both locally and nationally, to help to build more economically sustainable local environments.
For the year ended 31 March 2015, we recognised and supported 15 different Company charities which were elected by our store and head office teams.
Our people undertook a variety of activities for both these and other charities, with donations also being made by the Company.
Throughout the year a total of 37,000 was raised for our Company charities and 24,000 was raised for other charities.
Examples of our fundraising activities have included: The London Marathon One of our team members ran the London Marathon, raising 1,600 for the charity RP Fighting Blindness which supports research to find a treatment or cure for Retinitis Pigmentosa, a disease of the eye that leads to loss of vision and blindness.
We really value the relationship we have with Big Yellow Self Storage - the organisation has a great giving ethos and their range of ideas for fundraising and palpable enthusiasm from the staff is just fantastic!
Were delighted to have built such a solid partnership with Big Yellow and look forward to developing this further in the future.
The strong community spirit and great organisational skills of all of those concerned have benefitted RP Fighting Blindness so much, and were extremely grateful for such support.
Hannah Hickman, Project Fundraiser, RP Fighting Blindness British Heart Foundation Donation Stations Nine of our stores have acted as Donation Stations for the British Heart Foundation, raising a total of just under 14,900 from bags of unwanted clothes and household goods, which will support the charitys pioneering heart research, as well as the care of people living with heart disease.
We are delighted with the support we have received from Big Yellow Self Storage staff and customers over the past year.
Were very grateful for the unwanted items that have been donated.
By selling these in British Heart Foundation shops Big Yellow have raised money which will help fund our life saving research.
Its wonderful to have the support of Big Yellow and we are looking forward to building on an already successful partnership Clare Appleby, Corporate Partnerships Account Manager, British Heart Foundation The Three Peaks Challenge This gruelling challenge, which involved climbing Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon in under 30 hours, was completed by seven of our team members and they raised just under 2,600 for Cystic Fibrosis.
Free Storage In addition to our fundraising activities for charities and worthy causes, we have also provided free storage space at most of our stores.
During the year the space occupied by charities in Big Yellow and Armadillo stores on this basis was 37,800 sq ft, worth approximately 750,000 per annum at standard rents.
Some of the many charities that have benefited from this free storage include the National Childbirth Trust, Cancer Research, British Heart Foundation, and a number of food bank charities and local community charities.
Young Enterprise A number of team members within our head office and stores are currently supporting students in schools and colleges within their local communities in conjunction with Young Enterprise, a charitable organisation that creates and develops programmes that complement the school experience and encourages young people to realise the extent of their own talents.
Our volunteering has taken the form of providing classroom support, mentoring students to create their own businesses and participating in Young Enterprise regional board meetings.
For three years I have been a member of the Reading Area Board for Young Enterprise.
The role of the voluntary local board members is to support Young Enterprise in delivering a learning environment for school students on the skills and roles required to lead a successful business.
Using my business knowledge to guide the students in various local schools colleges to establish and trade their companies is hugely motivating, as is the knowledge that I am supporting the development of the business skills of these young people within their local community.
Nicola Crosby, Head of Store Operations, Big Yellow Self Storage 42 We recognise the importance of contributing within the local community to help build more economically sustainable environments.
During the year the space occupied by charities in our stores was worth approximately 750,000.
2.2 OUR HEALTH & SAFETY Big Yellow recognises the importance of maintaining high standards of health and safety for everyone who may be affected by our business.
The Groups Health and Safety Policy for Big Yellow Self Storage and Armadillo Self Storage is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
It is applied in two distinct areas our construction activities and our routine store operations.
The policy states that all employees have a responsibility for health and safety, but that managers have special responsibilities.
Additional duties are placed on Adrian Lee, Operations Director, to keep the Board advised on health and safety issues and ensure compliance with the Policy in respect of both construction activity and store operations, respectively.
The Group has a Health and Safety Committee, which meets quarterly and comprises of Adrian Lee and appointed Department Heads and other relevant Managers.
They meet to discuss any issues that have been reported from meetings held at head office, Maidenhead our distribution warehouse, the stores and any construction sites.
In addition, the Group has appointed an external consultant to review our Policy and to perform audits of our stores on a rolling programme: to ensure the implementation of the Groups Health and Safety policies.
Any actions recommended by our consultant is then considered by the Committee and, if required, then implemented into the operations or construction systems.
Health and Safety audits are also carried out by external consultants on each construction site prior to the opening of a store.
Our Health and Safety Policy covers all of our stores, our head office, Maidenhead and our Fit-out construction sites.
Incidents are recorded for staff, customers, contractors and visitors.
The Board receives reports every other month which monitor Health and Safety performance in all these areas.
Annual Store Health and Safety Meetings take place for all stores and Maidenhead.
Agendas are provided for these meetings via the intranet from the Facilities team and the minutes are reviewed by Area Managers to raise any issues with Facilities or Human Resources where necessary.
Health and Safety performance and incidents are reported and are displayed in the tables below.

No Fatal Injuries, Notices, Reportable Injuries or Prosecutions occurred, indicating a well-controlled environment for staff, contractors and visitors on our construction sites.
Health and safety performance continues to be reviewed in preparation for our next new store development at Guildford in 2016.
A limited level of assurance is provided for our health and safety data.
This assurance was undertaken by Deloitte LLP in accordance with the International Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000 ISAE 3000.
3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our Corporate Social Responsibility CSR Policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the local environment, to control our risks and manage our opportunities in a sustainable way.
Big Yellow has been classified as having a low environmental impact by the Ethical Investment Research Index Series EIRIS because it is involved in Support Services.
Notwithstanding this, and in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for its Stakeholders, Big Yellow has continued to commit significant resources to the environmental and social aspects of its storage operations, real estate portfolio, new store developments and site acquisitions.
This year we report again on our energy use and in compliance with the Companies Act, Climate Change Regulation on Reporting Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions for listed companies.
For the detailed application of our report see our Basis of Reporting at: http: corporate.
We therefore provide a summary in the Directors Report of Scope 1 onsite gas, solar electricity generation and refrigerant use and Scope 2 off site power station grid supplied use for carbon dioxide equivalent CO e emissions.
We have used the DEFRA DECC 2 Version 2.1 2014 Expiry 31 May 2015 conversion factors, for annual GHG emission calculations.
44 Solar electricity generation has increased by 193% since 2011.
Electricity use reduced by 30.8% from our 2011 peak, due to our energy efficient re-lamping and increased solar electricity generation.
3.1 Energy Reductions from Financial Year 2011, Peak Electricity Benchmark Year Our materiality threshold for energy use is 5% and for carbon emissions is 1%.
A limited level of assurance is provided for our Scope 1 and 2 energy use and GHG emissions.
This assurance was undertaken by Deloitte LLP in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 ISAE 3000.
The year ended 31 March 2011 is our peak total electricity and gas use benchmark for medium term assessment.
The year ended 31 March 2015 showed electricity use reduced by 30.8% from our 2011 peak.
Pre 2011, electricity use was also decreased due to the installation of energy efficient motion sensor lighting MSL and Power Saver Fittings on older lamps.
From 2012, larger capacity 50 kWp solar panels were installed on new stores: and from 2013, energy efficient LED lamps were installed across the whole portfolio.
Gas use is variable due to winter heating demand from flexi offices at eight of our stores.
This year our gas use threshold for reporting gas as a percentage of total energy use is just above the materiality level 5%.
The reductions in gas consumption were largely due to a milder winter in 2015, as flexi-office occupancy has been relatively constant over the years.
Last year we set a programme target to reduce electricity by 12% by 2015.
We have reduced electricity use by 17.5% from 2014.
3.2 Mandatory GHG Emissions Statement Summary The ISAE 3000 Standard provides an evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of our CSR management and reporting.
We report our energy use for our wholly owned stores: our head office in Bagshot, Surrey: and our packing materials warehouse in Maidenhead, Berkshire.
Our environmental report does not include any of the 14 Armadillo stores, in which the Group has a 20% interest.
This year Big Yellow acquired and now wholly owns the 12 Big Yellow Limited Partnership Joint Venture stores, and continues to manage the buildings and utilities at these sites.
In previous years we had opted to capture their energy and carbon operational footprint and have voluntarily reported this in our previous annual emissions reporting.
A new store construction fit out at Enfield was completed and we also acquired two additional existing stores at Oxford and Chester, to add to our wholly owned Big Yellow portfolio.
The year ended 31 March 2011 is our peak energy use and carbon emission benchmark year, due to a previous period of new store openings and increased occupancy.
This benchmark is the best year to present information on the most comparable basis.
45 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued Scope 1 GHG emissions from our real estate portfolio on site sources Scope 1 GHG emissions originate from on site natural gas use, which is a variable use for us depending upon winter heating demand for heating flexi-offices.
On site refrigerant top up and or replacement, in air conditioning units is also very variable.
Refrigerant use for cooling store reception areas is only topped up when required.
2012 peak year for gas use: 2014 peak year for gas emissions, refrigerant emissions, and Total Scope 1 Emissions.
The direct emissions from our stores represent only approximately 5% of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions that are under our control.
In the year ended 31 March 2015, less refrigerant replacement was required and the type used, also had a lower GHG emission conversion factor, resulting in a significant reduction in GHG Emissions.
GHG emissions from flexi office gas heating are variable and reduced in the year ended 31 March 2015, due to a mild winter.
Our Scope 1 onsite roof mounted solar panel generation on 17 stores provides an increasing source of annual electricity supply for newer stores.
Solar Electricity Generation Materiality for GHG Emission Reporting Year ended 31 March 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Solar Generation kWh 107,074 134,297 208,807 285,832 314,068 Solar % of electric use kWh 0.8% 1.0% 1.6% 2.4% 3.3% Indicates data reviewed by Deloitte LLP.
Solar generation has increased our self-supply to 3.3% of our total Scope 2 Grid supplied electricity in 2015.
We have set a target last year of 5% self-supply, but this has not yet been achieved due to the opportunity to invest in more efficient LED re-lamping at our stores.
However, we did generate more than our 10% target 12.5% of solar electricity 314,068 kWh, as a percentage of the sixteen solar stores Grid supplied electricity 2,505,045 kWh.
Low carbon solar electricity reduces our GHG emissions but is still below the materiality threshold of 5% of Scope 1 and 2 energy use combined 3.1% for annual reporting requirements.
Scope 2 Offsite Grid Supplied Electricity and Emissions This electricity supply from off site power station emissions remains at around 95% of our annual energy consumption, in the year ended 31 March 2015.
Peak energy use and benchmark year for future reductions.
Electricity use has reduced by 30.8% and Scope 2 GHG emissions have reduced by 29.3%.
This reduction is due to our continued investments in energy efficient technologies, such as LED re-lamping and larger capacity roof top solar installations at our new stores.
Our annual average carbon emission reduction over the last four years has been around 7% per year, double what the commercial property sector needs to do to meet the UK Governments GHG emissions reduction target of 34% by 2020 or 3.5% per year to 2050.
Over a seven year period, from our longer term peak electricity use benchmark 2008, our GHG emission reductions have averaged around 4% per year, and were mainly reduced by earlier motion sensor lighting, power saver fitting to lighting and small scale renewable energy trails.
46 Total Scope 1 2 Emissions In the year ended 31 March 2015 total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions achieved a reduction of 28.7% from peak energy use in 2011, exceeding our target of 25% from last years report.
Peak energy use and benchmark year for medium term performance assessment.
There results were mainly due to the significant reductions in Scope 2 supplied electricity emissions.
Our energy use strategy of reduction, efficiency and low carbon solar generation has reduced our annual energy costs and carbon taxation by proportional percentages.
It has also created an income from energy company payments for generation and exporting excess electricity to the Grid for deemed export payments.
GHG Emission Intensity, Scope 1 2 Key emission intensity indicators can be assessed by taking into account annual growth using customer occupancy and revenue, both of which includes new store portfolio growth.
Over the medium term, from our peak electricity use in 2011, kgCO e emissions have reduced per customer occupied space by 30.6% and 2 45.5% per revenue.
Our future GHG carbon reduction programme is to assess further LED re-lamping and low carbon solar electricity generation investments where viable.
Our future programmes for continuing re-lamping stores internally and externally with energy efficient LED lighting is to be reviewed during the year ending 31 March 2016.
Additional investment in solar PV installations at our new and existing stores will also be assessed in the year ending 31 March 2016.
Our target is to reduce our GHG emissions from peak energy use in 2011, by 39% in 2018.
47 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 4.0 SCOPE 3 VOLUNTARY SUPPLY CHAIN EMISSIONS GHG Emissions Scope 3 supply chain emissions represent GHG emissions during electricity supplier transmission and distribution to our stores.
Peak energy use and benchmark year.
Transmission and Distribution Conversion Factor 2015 0.04322.
Our energy efficiency programmes within our stores have reduced electricity demand and emission from our suppliers power stations.
Transmission and distribution losses have reduced by 23.4% since 2011.
In total, Scope 2 and 3 emissions have reduced by 28.9% since 2011, compared to a 22.6% reduction last year.
Scope 3 Store Waste Supply Chain Recycling and Landfill GHG Emissions Year ended 31 March 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Waste Recycling t 266 263 259 265 273 Landfill waste t 37.3 36.8 34.6 37.0 38.2 Landfill GHG tCO e 10.8 10.7 10.0 10.7 11.0 2 FY 2015 Landfill gas conversion factor 0.2892.
Waste generation in self storage is assessed as a low environmental impact.
The majority of non-hazardous bulk office waste is segregated by our staff and then further recycling by our waste contractor takes place after collection.
This year 86% of our waste was recycled and 14% went to landfill.
Landfill GHG emissions are estimated to be 11.0 tCO e. These emission levels represent a negligible 2 percentage of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions, well below the materiality threshold for carbon emissions.

All of our new stores sign up to the Considerate Constructors Scheme, and aim for high Energy Performance Certification EPC B rating.
3 Water use has been assessed as a low environmental impact for self storage 28,486 m. Our data has provided an average of 20.3 tCO e emissions per year.
This represents less than 0.4% of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which is below the materiality 2 threshold for carbon emissions.
Water use monitoring will be continued in order to review water use efficiency.
48 5.0 STAKEHOLDERS Big Yellow engages with its main stakeholders to provide information and gain useful feedback from a variety of groups, as described below.
Government Legislation and Standards EU Energy Efficiency Directive, The UK Energy Savings Opportunities Scheme ESOS ESOS is enforced by the Environment Agency EA and involves reporting our annual energy savings once every four years in order to identify cost effective energy saving measures.
Big Yellow is required to comply with the ESOS scheme as we are a large undertaking 250 employees and have an annual turnover of 50 million.
We have appointed an accredited assessor, measured all our energy consumption, determined significant areas of use and will complete the audit before December 2015.
Climate Change Act 2008: Carbon Reduction Commitment CRC Tax Reporting The Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC and the Environment Agency EA are stakeholders in the policy for reducing energy demand from large private sector organisations energy use 6,000 MWh year.
The scheme uses carbon dioxide CO conversion factors, and so is not directly comparable to the Companies Act GHG reporting.
2 The current CRC Tax Rate has risen from 12.00 to 16.40 per ton of CO for 2015: this will rise again in 2016 to 16.90 tCO.
The CRC is 2 2 another financial driver for energy and carbon emission reductions and for investing in energy efficient technologies.
From 2013, we have reduced CRC tCO carbon emissions by 37% and an average of 18.5% per year and are reducing CRC tax payments against future increase 2 in the tax rate.
Last year we set a programme target to reduce CRC carbon emission by 10% and we have exceeded this with a reduction of 25.4% from 2014.
UK Government Climate Change Act 2008 National Target to Reduce GHG tCO e Carbon Emissions by 34% by 2020 2 As part of the UK commercial property sector, Big Yellow has been reducing its energy use by energy efficient technology since its first electricity peak use in 2008.
In 2008 the Government set a national target to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 against a 1990 base line.
Considering approximately 95% of our material energy use is Grid supplied electricity, we can estimate an absolute carbon reduction from 2008, of 27%.
We can also estimate over the last seven years, an annual average reduction of approximately 4% per year.
The UK commercial property sector Real Estate Environmental Benchmark recommends a 3.5% annual reduction target to align with the Governments 2050 goal set in 2008.
Our more immediate target is to reduce emissions by 34% by 2020.
Last year we set a programme target to reduce electricity and GHG tCO e by 12 %.
We have reduced electricity use by 17.5% and GHG tCO e emissions by 8.5% from 2014.
