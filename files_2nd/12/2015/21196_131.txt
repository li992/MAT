Our conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2015 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report.
Selected Information The scope of our work was limited to assurance over the information marked with the symbol in Avivas Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 the Selected Information as found on pages 312 and 313.
The Selected Information has been listed below and the Reporting Criteria against which it was assessed can be found at http: www.
% of employees who confirm that they have read, understood, and accepted the Business Ethics Code annually: and all employees in Aviva France who are obliged to comply with the Business Ethics Code as a term of their employment 2.
% of CO e emissions offset annually 2 3.
% reduction of CO2e emissions relative to our 2010 baseline 4.
% of women in senior management including subsidiary boards 9.
% of managed supply that has agreed to the supplier Code of Behaviour 10.
% of managed supply that has been engaged on Corporate Responsibility during the term of their contract with Aviva 11.
Amount of community investment, Our assurance does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 Revised Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.
Our independence and quality control We applied the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ICAEW Code of Ethics, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
We apply International Standard on Quality Control UK & Ireland 1 and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our work was carried out by an independent team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.
Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies The Selected Information needs to be read and understood together with the Reporting Criteria, which Aviva is solely responsible for selecting and applying.
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
The Reporting Criteria used for the reporting of the Selected Information are as at 31 December 2015.
Work done We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information.
In doing so, we: made enquiries of Avivas management, including the Corporate Responsibility CR team and those with responsibility for CR management and group CR reporting: evaluated the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording and reporting the Selected Information.
This included visiting head offices in two out of sixteen markets, and performing alternative testing procedures for the remaining fourteen markets, selected on the basis of their inherent risk and materiality to the group, to understand the key processes and controls for reporting site performance data to the group CR team: performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported: and considered the disclosure and presentation of the Selected Information.
