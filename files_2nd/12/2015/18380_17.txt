Energy reductions and the use of green energy also help to improve Our primary waste streams include card, paper, wood and emissions efficiency.
As most energy use is related to plastics, much of which is recycled, and general commercial heating and cooling, our energy-related performance is waste from our operations.

Product Energy case study Green Apple Environment Award RS UK has won further recognition for its innovative LED project.
The Green Apple Environment Award recognised the significant environmental impact reduction achieved through combining the right product, a new LED lighting unit, with a revolutionary business model and service to encourage the purchase of energy-efficient lighting whilst also eradicating all waste at the end of the products life.
The LED technology reduces energy use by up to 80% and offers customers maximum longevity, whilst the buyback scheme removes the barrier created by the products high purchase price, accelerating the take-up of the new product.
