2 Johnson Matthey Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Progress Towards Sustainability 2017 In 2007 we launched Sustainability 2017, a key element of Johnson Mattheys vision for building a sustainable business.
It includes challenging targets to support future growth.
We aim to double our underlying earnings per share while cutting carbon intensity by half, achieving zero waste to landfill and halving the key resources that we consume per unit th of output by 2017, the 200 anniversary of the companys foundation.
We also aim to eliminate accidents and occupational illness cases across the group.

4 Whilst we continue to track our progress against zero greater than three day accidents, this year we have added more stringent measures of long term injury and illness rate LTIIR and total recordable injury and illness rate TRIIR to give a more accurate picture of performance.
We have a target of 0.2 for our LTIIR and our aspiration is one of continual improvement towards zero LTIIR.
6 Baseline is incidence of occupational illness cases per 1,000 employees in calendar year 2008, restated.
Continued progress towards Sustainability 2017 targets this year.
Underlying earnings per share EPS target exceeded in 2013 14: further progress this year due to growth in the business and a favourable tax rate.
Remain well on track to achieve carbon intensity and key resource reduction targets as a result of continued focus on efficiency programmes across the group.
Lost time injury and illness rate reduced supported by groupwide focus on health and safety culture.
Further good progress in reducing occupational illness cases.
