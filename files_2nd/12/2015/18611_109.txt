160 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures Methodology We have reported on all EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures, using the EPRA Best Practices Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting 2nd Version, the main requirements of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard revised edition and emissions factors from the UK Governments Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2015 and 2014.
We have used the GHG Protocols location-based methodology for conversion factors for Scope 2 emissions.
Organisational boundary We have used the Operational Control boundary approach for all Sustainability Performance Measures.
Data is reported for our property investment portfolio and own occupied offices.
Our property investment portfolio includes our UK Residential portfolio, our Germany Residential portfolio and the GRIP Fund.
Reporting on landlord and tenant consumption Grainger only reports on landlord-obtained energy, water and waste consumption.
Data on tenant consumption is not available, however we report estimated tenant carbon dioxide emissions in our Mandatory Greenhouse Gas statement on page 35.
Coverage Where we are not able to include 100% of all assets within our operational control in our reporting for a Sustainability Performance Measure, we have specified the level of data coverage.
Energy and greenhouse gas notes Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the UK Governments conversion factors for Company Reporting 2015 and 2014.
Transmission and distribution losses are reported as Scope 3 emissions.
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as metric tonnes CO 2 equivalent t CO e and greenhouse gas intensity is reported as kilogrammes of CO equivalent kg CO e. Greenhouse gas emissions for 2 2 2 German electricity consumption and transmission and distribution are reported in carbon dioxide CO only as per the UK Governments 2 conversion factors for Company Reporting 2015 and 2014.
The unit of measurement for natural gas consumption has been updated from 100s of cubic feet as a default to the actual known unit of measurement and natural gas consumption data for 2014 has been restated accordingly.
Estimation of landlord-obtained utility consumption Where data for Grainger-obtained utility consumption is missing or unreliable, we have used the following estimation methodology: Where data is available for the same period quarter for the previous reporting year, we have estimated missing utility consumption using the daily consumption rate from the previous year.
Where data is not available for the same period quarter for the previous reporting year, we have estimated missing utility consumption using the daily consumption rate from all previous quarters in the current reporting year.
Where insufficient previous data was available, we have excluded the property from reporting.
We have only estimated data to fill gaps using known consumption from other periods for the metered supply in question.
We have disclosed the proportion of total disclosed data that is estimated in the data notes that accompany each Performance Measure.

Our London offices in Knightsbridge and Putney were closed in April and May 2014 and a new consolidated London Bridge office was opened in April 2014.
Consumption has been reported for the period of the reporting year that each office was occupied by Grainger.
Like-for-like energy and GHG emissions: 0.4% of data is estimated.
Due to office consolidation in 2014, there are only three UK offices that have been occupied for two full reporting years: Newcastle, Birmingham and Altrincham.
Our Frankfurt office in Germany has also been occupied for two full reporting years.
Putney and Knightsbridge are no longer occupied by Grainger and the London Bridge office opened in April 2014, therefore these three properties have been excluded from like-for-like reporting.

Grainger does not report on energy or water consumed by tenants.
All annual consumption is reported as the portfolio stood at year end for the period from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015.
We have used the market value of assets under management as our main intensity Performance Measure as this is also what we use to measure our business efficiency KPI as reported in our Strategic report.
Absolute energy and GHG emissions: 4% of electricity consumption data has been estimated.
1% of fuels consumption data has been estimated.
No properties have been excluded from electricity consumption for the UK Residential portfolio.
One property has been excluded from reporting for the GRIP Fund because there was no confirmed electricity supplier and so consumption could not be calculated.
Absolute water: 8% of water consumption data has been estimated.
There are no properties excluded from reporting.
Water consumption data is not available for our German Residential portfolio for the reporting year.

GRIP Fund: Waste data is gathered for all properties in the GRIP Fund portfolio where Grainger has waste management contracts in place, excluding Bethnal Green and West Tenter Street where it was not possible to convert the available waste data into weight.
100% of data is estimated because data is not gathered by waste management contractors for actual weight of waste generated by Grainger-owned properties.
Waste weight in metric tonnes is calculated from bin volume in litres using the WRAP waste conversion factor 20 0301 for mixed municipal waste, rather than actual weight measurements at each property.
Proportion of waste by disposal route is based on statistics for each applicable waste management contractor as a whole and is not specific to Grainger properties.
Food waste for three properties has been excluded because it was not possible to calculate weight from the data provided.

Total weight was calculated for the 255 working days per year, excluding bank holidays and weekends.
Cardboard waste at our London office has been excluded because it was not possible to calculate weight from the data provided.
Waste data was not measured at our German occupied office.
