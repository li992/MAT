The Committee concluded that the KPIs continued to represent a broad spectrum of Group performance.
However, during this review, we recognised that the Administration Cost Ratio as % of net rental income target needed to be realigned such that it remained sufficiently challenging but was attainable.
It is the Committees opinion that the current target would become unattainable given that the Group anticipates wage growth below executive director level to be in excess of inflation and a reduction in net rental income caused by portfolio sales and redevelopments.
