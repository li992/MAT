We report our emissions data using an operational control approach which means we include emissions from all parts of the business where we are able to control activities and operating policies.
This approach meets the definitional requirements of the Regulations in respect of those emissions for which we are responsible, following the guidelines and principles of the WBCSD WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
NEXT remains committed to reducing its carbon footprint by reducing energy consumption throughout its operations, minimising and recycling waste, cutting transport emissions and reducing the packaging in our products.
