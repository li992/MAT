STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY MAKING A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION We also further improved our score on the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB, earning coveted GreenStar status for the second year running.
All of this reflects and recognises our commitment to continually improving our environmental, social and governance performance.
ENVIRONMENT Our environmental strategy is focused on three core objectives: environmental management, sustainable behaviour and sustainable buildings.
These help us to manage and reduce our most significant environmental impacts: energy consumption, carbon emissions, water use and waste generation.
During 2015 we achieved further improvements, achieving a place on the CDPs Climate Disclosure Leaders Index with a Climate Change Disclosure score of 99 out of 100 and a performance rating of C on an A to E scale.

44 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 01 Strategic report 02 Corporate governance 03 Financial statements 04 Other information In addition to absolute energy consumption and emissions for all of our buildings under operational control, we also report on a per-bed basis historically using total beds in ownership at year-end.
This year we have used a carbon contributing beds number, including a pro rata contribution from any sites acquired or disposed of during the reporting period, according to the number of months it was in Unite Students ownership e. g. a 400 bed site owned for three months would contribute 100 beds to the total.
This approach allows the calculation of site level emissions and improves the accuracy of whole estate calculations.
In addition we are 2 now reporting on a per carbon contributing m basis, which similarly includes a pro rata proportion of the total floor area for sites acquired or disposed of during the year.
This allows more straightforward benchmarking against other real estate and property 2 organisations which report on a per m basis.
In future years only the carbon contributing bed numbers will be reported.

Absolute electricity consumption reduced by 0.89% during 2015, although carbon contributing bed numbers increased by 10.12%, reflecting the savings delivered by activity such as our LED lighting installation programme, as well as the impact of consecutive mild winters.
Absolute natural gas consumption increased by 15.64%, reflecting an increase in proportion of sites using gas for heating and or hot water both new openings and acquisitions.
The larger proportion of estimates within the gas data reflects sixmonthly billing where data loggers have not or cannot be fitted.
All sites under operational control are included, while sites fully leased to a third party and so under their operational control are excluded.
This year, in line with amended guidance from the greenhouse gas GHG Protocol on emissions reporting, we are reporting Scope 2 emissions using both a location based using DEFRA UK grid average emissions factor and market based using emissions factor based the actual generation mix of our supplier, nPower approach.
Therefore two sets of Scope 2 and combined Scope 1 2 data are included in the table on page 48.
2 Scope 3 emissions reported here include business travel train, flights & private vehicles, water, paper, and energy transport related transmissions & distribution and well-to-tank emissions.
