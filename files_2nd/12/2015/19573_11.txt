The Group aims to collect and report its environmental data in accordance with the guidelines specified by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol GHGP, to the extent that this is currently practicable.
The figures reported above include data from the Groups wholly-owned or majority-owned operations.
The Group has followed the 2014 UK Government environmental reporting guidance and applied the greenhouse gas conversion factors contained within the GRI Guidelines and the Defra DECCs 2014 Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.
Billed or metered sources represent the basis of the majority of our data: however, the travel data which represents less than 10% of the total is calculated on an estimated basis which we believe to be an accurate representation of use.
The Group has used the financial control approach to define its organisational boundary.
The Group has chosen sales as its intensity ratio.
We are unable to normalise our environmental performance to our products because the Groups products differ greatly in size, form and weight.
