With 2.4 million hectares of timberland found within a 50 mile radius of Morehouse, it is perhaps not surprising that Drax chose it as the location for one of its two pellet mills.
We now employ around 50 full-time workers and according to Louisiana Economic Development support several hundred additional jobs within the regions logging, transportation and forestry sectors.
