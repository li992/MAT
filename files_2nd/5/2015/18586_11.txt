Strategic r Strategic report eport Metals and minerals Highlights Metals and minerals total Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was $5,310 million, down 38% compared to 2014.
US$ million The key driver was clearly commodity prices which reduced significantly in most key markets, reflecting widespread fears as to Chinas decelerating rate of growth, the strong 5,310 US dollar, lower oil prices and other general deflationary 2013 2014 2015 cost drivers.
The weaker economic conditions and bearish sentiment surrounding China pressurised commodity Marketing activities 1,643 2013 1,545 2014 1,280 2015 prices throughout the year.
In addition, from H2 2014, Industrial activities 7,203 2013 7,077 2014 4,030 2015 prompted by the dramatic fall in oil prices, investors accelerated their liquidation of existing commodity long positions accumulated through indices and commodity Adjusted EBIT basket ETFs.
On the supply side, there remains too much US$ million sticky higher cost supply, which delays the eventual rebalancing of markets to more sustainable levels.
In response, however, Glencore has acted decisively in curtailing a sizeable amount of its copper and zinc 1,403 production, with the aim of supporting prices near term and 2013 2014 2015 preserving scarce resources and value for the future.
Marketing activities 1,622 2013 1,515 2014 1,255 2015 In contrast with these severe challenges, Marketing Industrial activities 4,036 2013 3,674 2014 148 2015 performed solidly, delivering EBITDA of $1,280 million.
While this was down 17% on 2014, the reduction occurred in the first half, on account of the collapse in aluminium physical premiums and weakness in the global stainless steel industry, impacting our nickel and ferroalloys businesses.
The stronger H2 performance, on an annualised basis, came in 7% above 2014, reflecting the underlying strength and consistency of this business.
Industrial EBITDA declined from $7,077 million to $4,030 million reflecting lower metals prices net of foreign currency benefits, proactive efficiency and cost reduction drives and the passive lowering of other input costs e. g. oil and the associated incremental costs associated with the decisions to curtail copper production at Katanga and Mopani and zinc production at Mount Isa and McArthur River.

These fundamental developments occurred amid a collapse in general commodity market sentiment, resulting in a 41% fall in the LME nickel price from $14,880 t at the start of 2015 to $8,780 t at year end.
While the fundamental outlook for nickel now appears brighter, with the market ending the year in balance, following improved Q4 demand and continued supply-side adjustments, further supply cuts are required to support materially higher prices, absent a significant pickup in demand.

58 Glencore Annual Report 2015 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Additional information Coal Oil The decline in Chinese import demand was the key Following a collapse in oil prices in 2014, the first half of 2015 feature of the seaborne thermal coal market in 2015. saw some recovery, with Brent trading in a range of $50 to Lower economic growth, some shift away from $65 per barrel, the crude oil contango narrowing and manufacturing, rising hydro and nuclear power supply and volatility declining.
Sharp increases in demand for motor increased domestic coal supply for coastal ultra-high voltage fuels and a very cold winter in the United States provided transmission were all important factors that led to such significant fundamental support.
However, by the middle decline.
Lower gas prices and increased renewable ofthe year, a combination of fears over slowing economic generation contributed to a reduction in European coal growth in China and weaker general emerging market demand, however this was more than offset by demand sentiment, with the realisation that excess crude production growth in the Mediterranean, Africa, the sub-continent and was not being curtailed, returned the focus to relentless South East Asia, where the need for low-cost, stable power stock builds and triggered renewed selling pressure.
Prices ended the year under sustained pressure as Middle East tensions were overshadowed by US dollar strength and On the supply side, low energy coals, principally from the prospect of a significant El Nio event for the winter.
Indonesia, were most impacted by the declining Chinese demand, leading to a significant reduction in Indonesian The high market volatility, entrenched contango, a decent coal exports during 2015.
US coal exports also declined as refinery margin environment and promising returns on falling prices forced mine closures.
Supply from Australia, tanker freight were all factors underpinning strong margins Colombia and South Africa remained relatively stable, in oil marketing activities in 2015. having benefited from weaker domestic currencies and reduced quality-based pricing differentials, which is supportive of demand for these generally higher-quality coals.
Changes to demand based on quality are supportive of trading and arbitrage opportunities, which are expected to continue as the current low market prices contribute to further supply reductions during 2016.
Glencore Annual Report 2015 59 Strategic report Energy products Industrial activities Highlights Industrial Adjusted EBITDA was $2,269 million, a 20% reduction on 2014, due to substantially lower coal and oil prices.
Significant operating cost savings were achieved through a relentless focus on all areas of the business, including supply chain, contractor management and employee productivity, which combined with lower producer country foreign currencies, somewhat mitigated the pricing effect.
In this regard, the Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 28% to 29%.
Optimum Coal part of Thermal South Africa was deconsolidated in H2 2015, with sale of the business now concluded and expected to close in 2016, following its business rescue proceedings.
The remaining coal business is well positioned for price recovery.
The Oil E&P business showed strong production growth in Chad: however the lowest prices in a decade dampened returns and led to a steep scale back in exploration and development activities.

primarily due to curtailed production in response to market conditions and deconsolidation of Optimum Coal since its Cerrejn August 2015 placement into business rescue proceedings.
Glencores share of production was 11.1 million tonnes, Australian coking in line with the prior year.
Production of 5.9 million tonnes was in line with 2014.
Oil Australian thermal and semi-soft Glencores share of production was 10.6 million barrels, 44% Production of 59.9 million tonnes was 3.6 million tonnes higher than 2014, following the increase in ownership of the 6% below 2014, reflecting that, in the face of weaker Chad assets and first oil from Mangara Chad in December markets, production was curtailed.
In light of lower oil prices, the drilling campaign has been significantly reduced in order to preserve the resource South African thermal for a more favourable pricing environment.
Production of 37.0 million tonnes was 9.1 million tonnes 20% below the prior year, mainly due to Optimum being placed into business rescue proceedings, with associated production deconsolidated from August 2015.
Glencore Annual Report 2015 63 Strategic report Agricultural products Highlights Adjusted EBITDA Agricultural products Adjusted EBITDA US$ million of$734million was down on 2014, the latter benefiting from an exceptionally strong Canadian harvest.

In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the imposition of a Russian wheat export tax inFebruary 2015.
Oilseeds, cotton, sugar and freight marketing all performed well, despite their relatively quiet markets.
Viterras Canadian operations contributed solidly in 2015, but were unable to match the strong 2014 results, mainly due to asmaller crop.
Viterra Australias results were in line with expectations, although in both Canada and Australia the weaker local currencies reduced US dollar returns.

Oilseed crush volumes of 6.1 million tonnes increased by 405,000 tonnes, reflecting the opportunistic acquisitions of the Magdeburg plant in Germany and the Becancour TRT plant in Canada.
Currency devaluation and relaxation of export taxes later in the year were supportive of the Argentinian oilseed processing and export business.
The Timbues soyabean crushing joint venture in Argentina continues to perform well.
Biodiesel production was 556,000 tonnes, down 27% compared to 2014, reflecting reduced demand due to regulatory changes and lower competing diesel prices, although it recovered somewhat in the second half of the year.
The biodiesel environment combined with a lower EU rapeseed crop and lack of farmer selling reduced EU softseed crushing margins.
Sugar cane processing increased by 520,000 tonnes 23% compared to 2014, due to significantly improved agricultural yields following the severe drought of 2014, assisted by Brazilian Real devaluation and higher ethanol prices.
Conversely, currency devaluation and the economic slowdown adversely impacted wheat milling in Brazil as we were unable to pass on the increased cost of imported wheat in Brazilian Real terms.
