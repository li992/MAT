A number of Bodycotes multinational new agreements with a range of customers and for a variety of customers fall within the compass of ADE and Bodycote intends end uses.
In ADE Heat Treatment, new agreements were signed to continue to leverage its unique market position to increase with key suppliers to the growing A350 and A320NEO aerospace revenues in these market sectors.
The business incorporates the programmes.
In Surface Technology, a new agreement was signed Groups activities in hot isostatic pressing and surface technology for the provision of thermal spray coating services for helicopter as well as the relevant heat treatment services, encompassing turbine blades.

1 Headline operating profit for ADE was 59.2m 2014: 70.6m and headline operating profit margin reduced from 26.8% to 24.3%, demonstrating good cost control in the face of reduced demand.
In 2015, the Group added capacity in a number of facilities, including installation of a new high pressure HIP in the USA.
In addition initial works have been undertaken to establish a new aerospace focused facility in South East Poland.
In the coming year it is expected that capital expenditure will be slightly above depreciation as further capacity and capability are added to support anticipated growth in the Groups Specialist Technologies and other high-value offerings.
