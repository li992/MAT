Payment transaction growth was driven by adding new merchants and organic growth.
Parking transaction growth was driven predominantly by the continued increase in consumer adoption in existing clients.
The decline in transaction value is due to a change in mix and the impact on parking from the weakening of the US and Canadian currency against sterling.
We have continued to add parking contracts with cities, operators and local authorities, as we provide them with a more convenient and cost effective method for collecting parking charges.
The business has rolled out the first phase of parking payment services in Paris during the period, which has 155,000 parking spaces.
This and other increases have made up for the loss of the Westminster contract in July 2014.
Overall revenues decreased by 1.5% and net revenues by 3.8%, reflecting a decline in payment revenues, due to larger merchants benefitting from lower pricing on core payment transactions, offset by the growth in parking revenue.
In payments, the first sales have been achieved of two new licensed products, Cashier and Cardlock.
Cashier enables enterprise merchants to offer a highly customised payment experience for their online or mobile customers, hosted by PayPoint.
It also has a built in capability to allow customers to store multiple cards.
Cardlock reduces the complication and cost of Payment Card Industry compliance for merchants by removing card data from their websites and apps at the point of data entry and securing it remotely within PayPoint systems.
In time, the new platform will also enable the business to replace the existing payments gateway platforms.
Significant work has also been undertaken on the core parking system to enable new functionality and to increase flexibility for future developments.
Work is also advanced on the next generation of the PayByPhone app, due later this year.
Continued expenditure in technology, product development, sales and marketing are necessary to take this venture forward and grow net revenue.
As a consequence of the expenditure, this business is currently loss-making and we expect it to remain in loss in the current financial year.
The assets of the Mobile and Online parking and online payment processing businesses, including their related goodwill, are shown as assets held for sale within current assets on the statement of financial position.
