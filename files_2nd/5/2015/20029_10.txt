Zoopla Property Group Plc Annual Report 2015 21 Strategic report Business and financial review continued Financial review Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly as a result of the newly acquired Comparison Services division, which performed ahead ofexpectations, and the continued robust performance in the Property Services division.
Revenue increased by 34% to 107.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 23% to 48.7 million.
These figures include four months of uSwitch trading which was acquired on 1 June 2015.
The acquisition was funded by a mixture of existing cash and a new five year revolving credit facility.
The Group had net debt of 93.2 million at the end of the period with substantial headroom against its covenants.
The total consideration for the acquisition was 160 million, plus a performance-based earn-out of up to 30 million.
The earn-out is based on Adjusted EBITDA and revenue performance targets payable in FY16 in cash or up to 50% in shares at ZPGs discretion, with 50% of the earn-out consideration payable to uSwitch Management to be paid in FY17 and FY18.
Due to the strong performance of uSwitch over the earn-out period so far which runs from 1January 2015 to 30 April 2016, Management is currently forecasting to pay the earn-out in full.
The Group maintains a dividend pay-out ratio of 3545% of profits excluding share-based payments and exceptional items and the Directors have proposed a final dividend of 2.5 pence per share.
This, together with the interim dividend of 1.0 pence per share, brings the total dividend to 3.5 pence per share for the period.
When reviewing performance, the Directors use a number of adjusted measures, including Group Adjusted EBITDA, to measure the Groups underlying performance.

The Comparison Services division contributed 27.7 million of revenue for the four months following the acquisition of uSwitch.
The majority of Comparison Services revenues came from the Energy and Communications verticals, which benefited from uSwitchs market-leading position and competitive consumer deals.
Operating costs Total operating costs increased by 45% to 58.9 million.
The increase inoperating costs can be attributed to the four months trading of the Comparison Services division.

Staff costs increased as a result of the Groups continued investment in technical expertise and the full year impact of operating as a plc.
In Comparison Services, the Group continues to invest in marketing and product development as it seeks to further build brand awareness and develop nascent business areas.
Comparison Services costs of 19.9 million comprise staff costs of 3.7 million and other costs of 16.2 million.

Depreciation The depreciation charge increased to 0.4 million in 2015.
The increase was due to the full year impact of depreciation of leasehold improvements recognised on the Groups relocation to a new head office during 2014.
Amortisation The Group splits out amortisation of intangibles arising on the acquisition of uSwitch and amortisation of other intangibles for the purposes of calculating adjusted basic EPS.
The charge for amortisation of intangibles arising on the acquisition of uSwitch for the four months of ownership in 2015 was 2.0million.
The amortisation of other intangibles charge was broadly flat at 1.6 million.
Exceptional items Exceptional items include costs which Management believes to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence.
Total exceptional items of8.2 million in 2015 represent costs incurred as a result of the Groups acquisition of uSwitch, comprising 5.1 million of transaction costs and 3.1million of consideration and deal related performance payments payable to uSwitch management.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, consideration contingent on continued employment is considered remuneration.
Therefore the management related payments arerecognised within the Groups income statement over the period until the payment becomes unconditional.
Net finance costs Net finance costs of 1.0 million comprise finance costs of 1.2 million, which were partly offset by finance income of 0.2 million.
The increase in finance costs compared to the prior year was due to the interest paid for the use of the Groups new five year, 150 million revolving credit facility secured as part of the uSwitch acquisition.
