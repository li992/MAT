The annualised rent rose by 0.2%, or 3.0% excluding Vnerparken.
The increase in capital values was driven by a fall in yields of 40 bps, whilst rent-free periods given in the year reduced net initial yields by a further 20 bps: consequently, the EPRA net initial yield of the overall investment property portfolio excluding developments at 31 December 2015 fell to 5.9% 2014: 6.5% and the EPRA topped-up net initial yield to 6.2% 2014: 6.6%.
