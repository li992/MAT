In April 2018, the Company completed an over-subscribed equity issue raising 115.0 million of new share capital.
Despite the competitive investment market these funds have been successfully invested over the course of the year in a selective and disciplined way in acquisitions and asset management projects.
In particular, we have made good progress in Ireland, increasing the portfolio to eight carefully selected assets valued at over 100 million, valuing developments as complete.
The Group has continued to focus its activities on large hub primary care facilities both in the UK and Ireland and together with asset management activity this resulted in the portfolios average lot size increasing to 4.8 million at the end of 2018 2017: 4.5 million.
We now only have one investment property valued at less than 1.0 million, which will be subject to a future asset management project, and continue to maintain our very strong metrics, with a long WAULT of 13.1 years 31 December 2017: 13.2 years, high occupancy at 99.8% and only 1.5% of our rent due to expire in the next three years.
Investment activity We have continued to maintain a strict selection criteria and pricing methodology to ensure investments are high quality, accretive to net earnings and offer the opportunity for future growth.
This has resulted in the acquisition of just eight assets, two in the UK and six in Ireland, for 106.2 million during 2018 2017: 71.9 million.
