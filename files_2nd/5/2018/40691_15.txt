Ella My childhood was difficult, and I went into foster care when I was 16.
During that time my studies were my escape and when I visited Sheffield Hallam University for an open day I knew it was where I wanted to be.
The Unite Foundation Scholarship made that possible, so when I was awarded it I was over the moon!
But its not just the money that helped it gave me support to be who I wanted to be.
All year round I had a home to call my own that was safe and fit for study.
Worries about money were hugely reduced and I got to pursue the academic course I loved.
My confidence has grown, and Ive got a whole new set of skills for the future.
I had some health problems early on as I was anxious about fitting in, but I was supported by the University team, the staff where I lived and the amazing new friends I had started to make.
After this initial help, I worked hard through University to reach out and seize opportunities and trust those around me.

Staff members across the country have also played a vital role by volunteering at our local learning centres in towns and cities all over England.
Unite has generously provided free accommodation for both IntoUniversity staff from outside London while they complete our 6-week initial training programme in the capital and for a large number of our regional students who would otherwise be unable to take up internship opportunities we provide in London during the summer holidays.
In addition, Unite Students has harnessed expertise in student housing to design Leapskills workshops for IntoUniversity students.
These workshops including a tour of Unite accommodation help our students to understand what it will be like living in halls of residence.
We are immensely grateful to Unite for going the extra mile to prepare our young people for University life.
We are very excited to see what the future holds for our partnership and would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has volunteered and the Social Impact team for all that they do to support our young people in achieving their potential.
