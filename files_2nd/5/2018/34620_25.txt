2018 Executive Overview 2018marked another strong financial performance, achieving double-digit ROICand the highest full year earnings in the companys history.
Keyinformation for 2018compared to the prior year see KeyPerformance Non-GAAPFinancial Indicators for definitions and reconciliations : Net income increased 21% to $3.2billion from $2.6billion in 2017and diluted earnings per share increased to $4.44from $3.59in 2017.
Adjusted net income increased 9.3% to $3.0billion from $2.8billion in 2017and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $4.26from $3.82in 2017.

In constant currency, net cruise revenues increased 5.7% to $15.1billion from $14.3billion in 2017.
In constant currency, net revenue yields increased 3.7%, comprised of a 3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields and a 5.1% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.
Gross cruise costs including fuel per ALBDincreased 3.9%.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD in constant currency increased 1.6%.
Changes in fuel prices including realized fuel derivatives and currency exchange rates decreased earnings by$0.21per share.
We achieved double-digit ROICand the highest full year earnings in our companys history, our fifth consecutive year of adjusted earnings growth and third consecutive record year.
Our120,000team members went above and beyond to deliver a more than doubling in ROICand near tripling of adjusted earnings per share, in just five years, byexecuting onour strategy to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth while leveraging our industry leading scale, despite numerous headwinds.
Their efforts, combined with the strong support of our valued travel agent partners, enabled our record breaking results.
While the journey over the last five years to sustained double-digit ROICwasbuilt onthe foundation of exceeding guest expectations every single day, wehad many other contributions that helped pave the way.
Ourproactive public relations effort to increase understanding and reduce misconceptions has clearly had a positive impact.
Theabsolute number of positive media mentions are multiples of what they were five years ago and our brands consistently capture over 75percent of all positive media in our industry.
Ourbrands marketing efforts have shared the spotlight with many well-known personalities who brought with them a greater audience of potential new-to-cruise to our respective brands, including Oprah Winfrey for Holland America Line, Shaquille ONeal for Carnival Cruise Line, Shakira for Costa, and Her Majesty the Queenfor P&OCruises UK.
Ourbrands were featured ontelevision programs all around the world including TheNewCelebrity th Apprentice, TheEllen DeGeneres Show, ITVreality show, TheCruise, in its 6 season in the UK, and Ant& Dec, also in the UK.
We created our ownoriginal content TVprograms which have already reached more than 400million views airing onmajor U. S. networks.
Ourproprietary shows, which include the Voyager with Josh Garcia, Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin, Vacation Creation, and LaGran Sorpresa, are among the most popular travel series onTV.
With our history making voyage to Cubain 2016, webecame the first U. S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U. S. cruise guests directly from the U. S. to Cuba, and opened upan exciting new destination option for guests of Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line and Seabourn.
Ourcruise brands continue to further the guest experience through newdestinations like Cubaand Amber Cove and newterminals like Barcelona and Dubai.
Ourongoing fleet replenishment efforts are central to our strategy to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth.
Over the last five years, wewelcomed 12state-of-the-art, larger, more efficient vessels and 31 Strategic Report exited nine less efficient ships from our fleet, building a more return resilient fleet.
We leveraged our scale to reduce costs, achieving cumulative savings of over $350million in just five years.
We also created many innovations and made other investments along the way.
OceanMedallion debuted onboard CaribbeanPrincess and has received 36billion favorable media impressions.
We have been recognized globally for our innovation efforts, including being recognized byFast Company as one of the TopTenMost Innovative Companies in the travel category.
Ourstate-of-the-art revenue management tool has been deployed across half the company to facilitate further yield growth.
Across many of our brands, weare in the process of rolling out newtechnology both onboard and shoreside.
This includes enhanced targeted marketing, improved CRMcapabilities, newmobile apps and redesigned websites, which collectively contribute to an enhanced guest experience, added empowerment to our travel agent partners, increased revenues and reduced cost of sales.
We underwent multibillion dollar fleet wide reinvestment efforts, including Funship 2.0for Carnival Cruise Line and Signature of Excellence for Holland America Line.
We signed a historic joint venture agreement with CSSC, China State Shipbuilding Corporation, forming a local cruise operating company and forging a significant long-term relationship to help build the cruise industry in China.
Over the past five years, wealso had many notable achievements in our sustainability efforts including the opening of our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in the Netherlands, delivering state of the art maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum.
We also opened three state-of-the-art Fleet Operations Centers around the globe to provide real time support, ship to shore.
Onthe environmental front, weexceeded our target unit fuel consumption reduction of 25percent, three years ahead of schedule.
We are fully committed to continuous improvement in health, environment, safety and security.
Goingforward, our fleet replenishment efforts are purposely designed to achieve greater economies.
Over the next five years, weexpect net capacity growth of approximately five percent compounded annually.
Thehigher rate of capacity growth will enable us to better contain costs, leaving us less reliant onrevenue yield growth to produce double-digit earnings growth over time.
This, in combination with our strategy of creating demand in excess of measured capacity growth, will allow us to continue to growour earnings and to deliver sustainable and growing double-digit ROICover time.

 Ourcritical accounting estimates are those webelieve require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Adiscussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates wouldbe reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows: Ship Accounting , , whichrepresent 78%.
Inaddition, , suchasthehull, cabins, mainelectric, superstructure andengines.
We determine the residual value of our ships based onour long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful life to us but before the end of their physical and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships and viability of the secondary cruise ship market.
We have estimated our residual values at 15% of our original ship cost.
Given the large size and complexity of our ships, ship accounting estimates require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain.
We donot have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ships.
In addition, since wedonot separately componentize our ships, wedonot identify and track depreciation of original ship components.
Therefore, wetypically have to estimate the net bookvalue of components that are retired, based primarily upontheir replacement cost, their age and their original estimated useful lives.
If materially different conditions existed, or if wematerially changed our assumptions of ship useful lives and residual values, our depreciation expense, loss onretirement of ship components and net bookvalue of our ships wouldbe materially different.
In addition, if wechange our assumptions in making our determinations as to whether improvements to a ship add value, the amounts weexpense each year as repair and maintenance expense could increase, which wouldbe partially offset bya decrease in depreciation expense, resulting from a reduction in capitalized costs.
For Carnival Corporation & plc, our 2018ship depreciation expense wouldhave increased byapproximately $42million assuming wehad reduced our estimated 30-year ship useful life estimate byone year at the time wetook delivery or acquired each of our ships.
In addition, our 2018ship depreciation expense wouldhave increased byapproximately $213million assuming wehad estimated our ships to have noresidual value at the time of their delivery or acquisition.
We believe that the estimates wemade for ship accounting purposes are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied in all material respects and result in depreciation expense that is based ona rational and systematic method to equitably allocate the costs of our ships to the periods during which weuse them.
In addition, webelieve that the estimates wemade are reasonable.
We applied our methods consistently in determining 1 the useful life and residual values of our ships, including ship improvements: 2 which improvement costs add value to our ships and 3 the net bookvalue of ship component assets being retired.
Finally, webelieve our critical ship accounting estimates are generally comparable with those of other major cruise companies.
Asset Impairments Impairment reviews of our cruise ships, goodwill and trademarks require us to make significant estimates to determine the fair values of these assets and reporting units.
For our cruise ships, weperform our impairment reviews, if required, at the individual cruise ship level, which is the lowest level for which wehave identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of ship impairment reviews.
Thedetermination of ship fair value includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, unless a comparable, viable actively-traded market exists, which is usually not the case for cruise ships, cruise brands and trademarks.
Ourships fair values are typically estimated based either onship sales price negotiations or discounted future cash flows.
Theprincipal assumptions used to calculate our discounted future cash flows include forecasted future operating results over the expected period.
We believe the ships, including their estimated residual values, will have economic benefit to us.
Asof July 31,2018, weperformed our annual goodwill and trademark impairment reviews.
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill and trademark impairment reviews.
33 Strategic Report Thedetermination of our reporting unit goodwill and trademark fair values includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
Theprincipal assumptions, all of which are considered Level 3 inputs, used in our cash flow analyses consisted of: Forecasted operating results, including net revenue yields and net cruise costs including fuel prices Capacity changes and the expected rotation of vessels into or out of each of these cruise brands, including decisions about the allocation of newships amongst brands, the transfer of ships between brands and the timing of ship dispositions Weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to the geographic regions in which these cruise brands operate Capital expenditures, proceeds from forecasted dispositions of ships and terminal values We believe that wehave made reasonable estimates and judgments.
Changes in the conditions or circumstances may result in a need to recognize an additional impairment charge.
Contingencies We periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us, as well as for other knownunasserted claims, including environmental, legal, regulatory, guest and crew and tax matters.
In addition, weperiodically assess the recoverability of our trade and other receivables and our charter-hire and other counterparty credit exposures, byfinancial and other institutions with which weconduct significant business.
Ourcredit exposure also includes contingent obligations related to our guests cash payments received directly bytravel agents and tour operators in Australia and Europe.
In most of Europe, weare obligated to honor our guests cruise payments made to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether wehave received these payments.
While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters, weuse our best judgment to determine if it is probable, or more likely than not MLTN for income tax matters, that wewill incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable or MLTNloss, if any, can be made.
In assessing probable losses, wemake estimates of the amount of probable insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets where appropriate.
We accrue a liability and establish a reserve whenwebelieve a loss is probable or MLTNfor income tax matters, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with U. S. GAAP.
Such accruals and reserves are typically based ondevelopments to date, managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters, our experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar non-income tax matters, historical claims experience, actuarially determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverages.
Given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that wemay have made.
In addition, as newinformation becomes available, we may need to reassess the amount of asset or liability that needs to be accrued related to our contingencies.
All such changes in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
ResultsofOperations We earn substantially all of our cruise revenues from the following: Sales of passenger cruise tickets and, in some cases, the sale of air and other transportation to and from airports near our ships home ports and cancellation fees.
We also collect fees, taxes and other charges from our guests Thecruise ticket price typically includes the following: Accommodations Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club and sun decks Supervised youth programs Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs Visits to multiple destinations 34 Sales of goods and services not included in the cruise ticket price are generally the following: Substantially all liquor and some non-alcoholic beverage salesInternet and communication services Casino gamingFull service spas Shore excursionsSpecialty restaurants Gift shop salesArt sales Photo salesLaundry and dry cleaning services These goods and services are provided either directly byus or byindependent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee.
We incur cruise operating costs and expenses for the following: Thecosts of passenger cruise bookings, which represent costs that are directly associated with passenger cruise ticket revenues, and include travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation and credit and debit card fees Onboard and other cruise costs, which represent costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues, and include the costs of liquor and some non-alcoholic beverages, costs of tangible goods sold byus in our gift shops and from our photo packages, communication costs, costs of cruise vacation protection programs, costs of preand post-cruise land packages and credit and debit card fees Fuel costs, which include fuel delivery costs Payroll and related costs, which represent all costs related to our shipboard personnel, including bridge and engineering officers and crew and hotel and administrative employees, while costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in selling and administrative expenses Foodcosts, which include both our guest and crew food costs Other ship operating expenses, which include port costs that donot vary with guest head counts: repairs and maintenance, including minor improvements and dry-dock expenses: hotel costs: entertainment: gains and losses onship sales: ship impairments: freight and logistics: insurance premiums and all other ship operating expenses Concession revenues donot have significant associated expenses because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne byour concessionaires.

ALBDs assume that each cabin weoffer for sale accommodates twopassengers and is computed bymultiplying passenger capacity byrevenue-producing ship operating days in the period.
b In 2018compared to 2017, wehad a 1.9% capacity increase in ALBDscomprised of a 2.9% capacity increase in our NAAsegment and a 0.2% capacity increase in our EAsegment.
OurNAAsegments capacity increase wascaused by: Partial period impact from one Princess Cruises 3,560-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in April 2017 Partial period impact from one Carnival Cruise Line 3,960-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in April 2018 Partial period impact from one Seabourn 600-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in May 2018 These increases were partially offset bythe partial period impact from one P&OCruises Australia 1,550-passenger capacity ship removed from service in April 2017.

Nonoperating Income Expense Years Ended November 30, inmillions 2018 2017 Unrealized gains onfuel derivatives $ 94 $ 227 Realized losses onfuel derivatives, net 35 192 Gains onfuel derivatives, net $ 59 $ 35 Explanations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use net cruise revenues per ALBD net revenue yields, net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as non-GAAPfinancial measures of our cruise segments and the companys financial performance.
These non-GAAPfinancial measures are provided along with U. S. GAAP gross cruise revenues per ALBD gross revenue yields, gross cruise costs per ALBDand U. S. GAAPnet income and U. S. GAAPearnings per share.
Net revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBDenable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or ALBDchanges from price and other changes that affect our business.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our U. S. GAAPconsolidated financial statements.
Under U. S. GAAP, the realized and unrealized gains and losses onfuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings.
We believe that unrealized gains and losses onfuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings.
Therefore, webelieve it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses onfuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, wepresent adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses.
We believe that gains and losses onship sales, impairment charges, restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance.
Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses onship sales, impairment charges, and restructuring and other non-core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items.
Thepresentation of our non-GAAPfinancial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with U. S. GAAP.
It is possible that 39 Strategic Report our non-GAAPfinancial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies.
Net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a companys cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes.
We use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields.
We believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees.
Net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues, net of commissions, transportation and other costs.
Net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues, net of onboard and other cruise costs.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBDis the measure weuse to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments costs rather than gross cruise costs per ALBD.
We exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non-GAAPfinancial measures.
Substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices once the number of ALBDshas been determined.
Reconciliation of Forecasted Data We have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted U. S. GAAPnet income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted U. S. GAAPearnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful U. S. GAAPforecasts of gross cruise revenues, gross cruise costs, net income and earnings per share wouldrequire unreasonable effort.
We are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices.
While weforecast realized gains and losses onfuel derivatives byapplying current Brent prices to the derivatives that settle in the forecast period, wedonot forecast the impact of unrealized gains and losses onfuel derivatives because wedonot believe they are an indication of our future earnings performance.
We are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales, restructuring expenses and other non-core gains and charges.
Constant Dollar and Constant Currency Ouroperations primarily utilize the U. S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition.
Functional currencies other than the U. S. dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk.
Ouroperations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency, which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk.
We report net revenue yields, net passenger revenue yields, net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBDona constant dollar and constant currency basis assuming the 2018periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2017periods rates.
These metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates.
Constant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates onthe translation of our operations.
Constant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates onthe translation of our operations as in constant dollar plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
Examples: Thetranslation of our operations with functional currencies other than U. S. dollar to our U. S. dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported U. S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U. S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported U. S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U. S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies.
40 Ouroperations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency.
If their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies, it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses.
If the functional currency weakens against these other currencies, it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses.

The3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields wasdriven primarily byprice improvements in our European, Australian, China and various other programs.
This 3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields wascomprised of a 2.4% increase from our NAAsegment and a 4.8% increase from our EAsegment.
The5.1% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields wascaused bysimilar increases in our NAAand EA segments.

Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources Ourprimary financial goals are to profitably growour cruise business and sustain and growour double-digit ROIC, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong investment grade credit ratings.
We define ROICas the twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest divided bythe monthly average of debt plus equity minus .
Ourability to generate significant operating cash flow allows us to internally fund our 43 Strategic Report capital improvements, debt maturities and dividend payments.
We have $11.5billion of committed export credit facilities available to fund the vast majority of our newship growth capital.
Other objectives of our capital structure policy are to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity through our available cash and cash equivalents and committed financings for immediate and future liquidity needs and to maintain a reasonable debt maturity profile.
Based onour historical results, projections and financial condition, webelieve that our future operating cash flows and liquidity will be sufficient to fund all of our expected capital improvements, newship growth capital, debt maturities and dividend payments over the next several years.
We believe that our ability to generate significant operating cash flows and our strong balance sheet, as evidenced byour strong investment grade credit ratings, provide us with the ability, in most financial credit market environments, to obtain debt financing.
We had a working capital deficit of $7.0billion as of November 30,2018compared to a working capital deficit of $7.2billion as of November 30,2017.
Thedecrease in working capital deficit wasdriven bythe increase in our cash and cash equivalents, partially offset byan increase in customer deposits and short-term borrowings.
We operate with a substantial working capital deficit.
This deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that, under our business model, substantially all of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date.
These advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date.
Thecash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash onhand from other sources, such as our borrowings and other cash from operations.
Thecash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses, pay downour debt, make long-term investments or any other use of cash.
Included within our working capital deficit are $4.4billion and $4.0billion of customer deposits as of November 30,2018and 2017, respectively.
In addition, wehave a relatively low-level of accounts receivable and limited investment in inventories.
We generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
We expect that wewill continue to have working capital deficits in the future.
Sources and Uses of Cash OperatingActivities Ourbusiness provided $5.5billion of net cash from operations during 2018, an increase of $227million, or 4.3%, compared to $5.3billion in 2017.
This increase wasdriven byan increase in customer deposits.
InvestingActivities During 2018, net cash used in investing activities was$3.5billion.
This wascaused by: Capital expenditures of $2.1billion for our ongoing newshipbuilding program Capital expenditures of $1.7billion for ship improvements and replacements, information technology and buildings and improvements Proceeds from sale of ships of $389million Purchase of minority interest of $135million Payments of $39million of fuel derivative settlements During 2017, net cash used in investing activities was$3.1billion.
This wascaused by: Capital expenditures of $1.4billion for our ongoing newshipbuilding program Capital expenditures of $1.5billion for ship improvements and replacements, information technology and buildings and improvements Payments of $203million of fuel derivative settlements FinancingActivities During 2018, net cash used in financing activities of $1.5billion wassubstantially all due to the following: Net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $417million in connection with our availability of, and needs for, cash at various times throughout the period Repayments of $1.6billion of long-term debt Issuances of $2.5billion of long-term debt Payments of cash dividends of $1.4billion Purchases of $1.5billion of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares in open market transactions under our Repurchase Program 44 During 2017, net cash used in financing activities of $2.5billion wassubstantially all due to the following: Net repayments of short-term borrowings of $29million in connection with our availability of, and needs for, cash at various times throughout the period Repayments of $1.2billion of long-term debt Issuances of $100million of long-term debt under a term loan Proceeds of $367million of long-term debt under an export credit facility Payments of cash dividends of $1.1billion Purchases of $552million of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares in open market transactions under our Repurchase Program Future Commitments Payments Due by inmillions 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Debt a $ 2,633 $ 2,320 $ 1,243 $ 1,203 $ 1,867 $ 2,095 $ 11,360 Other long-term liabilities reflected onthe balance sheet b 135 90 73 59 178 535 Newship growth capital 4,935 3,849 3,887 3,117 2,110 1,132 19,029 Operating leases 70 48 46 36 35 180 415 Port facilities and other 311 292 249 172 132 1,097 2,253 Purchase obligations 451 451 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 8,400 $ 6,644 $ 5,514 $ 4,600 $ 4,203 $ 4,682 $ 34,044 a Includes principal as well as estimated interest payments.

The primary outflows are for estimates of our compensation plans obligations, crew and guest claims and certain deferred income taxes.
Customer deposits and certain other deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table because they donot require a cash settlement in the future.

Effective April 10and August 27,2018, the company approved modifications of the general authorization under the Repurchase Program, which replenished the remaining authorized repurchases at the time of the approvals to $1.0billion.
TheRepurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued byour Boards of Directors at any time.
In addition to the Repurchase Program, wehave programs that allow us to obtain an economic benefit when either Carnival Corporation common stock is trading at a premium to the price of Carnival plc ordinary shares or 45 Strategic Report Carnival plc ordinary shares are trading at a premium to Carnival Corporation common stock the Stock Swap Programs.
For example: In the event Carnival Corporation common stock trades at a premium to Carnival plc ordinary shares, we may elect to sell shares of Carnival Corporation common stock, at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of Carnival plc ordinary shares in the UK market.
In the event Carnival plc ordinary shares trade at a premium to Carnival Corporation common stock, we may elect to sell ordinary shares of Carnival plc, at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of shares of Carnival Corporation common stock in the U. S. market.
During 2018and 2017, there were nosales or repurchases under the Stock SwapPrograms.
Anysales of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
Funding Sources AtNovember 30,2018, wehad liquidity of $14.6billion.
Ourliquidity consisted of $710million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes $271million of cash used for current operations, $2.3billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities, net of our outstanding commercial paper borrowing, and $11.5billion under our committed future financings, which are comprised of ship export credit facilities.
These commitments are from numerous large and well-established banks and export credit agencies, which webelieve will honor their contractual agreements with us.
inbillions 2019 2020 2021 2022 Availability of committed future financing at November 30,2018 $ 3.4 $ 2.9 $ 2.8 $ 2.4 AtNovember 30,2018, all of our revolving credit facilities are scheduled to mature in 2021, except for $300million which matures in 2020.
Substantially all of our debt agreements contain financial covenants as described in the consolidated financial statements.
AtNovember 30,2018, wewere in compliance with our debt covenants.
In addition, based on, among other things, our forecasted operating results, financial condition and cash flows, weexpect to be in compliance with our debt covenants for the foreseeable future.
Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect onour consolidated financial statements.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a discussion of our hedging strategies and market risks, see the discussion below and the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks Operational Currency Risks Ouroperations primarily utilize the U. S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro or sterling as their functional currencies.
Ouroperations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial statements.
46 Based ona 10% change in all currency exchange rates that were used in our December 20,2018guidance, we estimate that our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance wouldchange bythe following: $0.27per share onan annualized basis for 2019 $0.01per share for the first quarter of 2019 Investment Currency Risks Theforeign currency exchange rates were as follows: November 30, USDto 1: 2018 2017 AUD $ 0.73 $ 0.76 CAD $ 0.75 $ 0.78 EUR $ 1.14 $ 1.18 GBP $ 1.28 $ 1.33 RMB $ 0.14 $ 0.15 If the November 30,2017currency exchange rates had been used to translate our November 30,2018non-U.
S. dollar functional currency operations assets and liabilities instead of the November 30,2018U.
S. dollar exchange rates, our total assets wouldhave been higher by$615million and our total liabilities wouldhave been higher by$308million.
Asof November 30,2018, wehave a cross currency swapof $156million which settles in September 2019.
This cross currency swapis designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign operations, which have a eurodenominated functional currency, thus partially offsetting the foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Based ona 10% change in the U. S. dollar to euro exchange rate as of November 30,2018, weestimate that this cross currency swaps fair value and offsetting change in U. S. dollar value of our net investments wouldchange by $16million.
Newbuild Currency Risks AtNovember 30,2018, our remaining newbuild currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to eurodenominated newbuild contract payments, which represent a total unhedged commitment of $10.1billion and substantially all relates to newbuilds scheduled to be delivered from 2019through 2025to non-euro functional currency brands.
Thefunctional currency cost of each of these ships will increase or decrease based onchanges in the exchange rates until the unhedged payments are made under the shipbuilding contract.
We may enter into additional foreign currency derivatives to mitigate some of this foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Based ona 10% change in euro to U. S. dollar exchange rates as of November 30,2018, the remaining unhedged cost of these ships wouldhave a corresponding change of $1billion.
Interest Rate Risks Thecomposition of our debt, including the effect of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, wasas follows: November 30, 2018 Fixed rate 29% EURfixed rate 29% Floating rate 6% EURfloating rate 28% GBPfloating rate 8% AtNovember 30,2018, wehad interest rate swaps that have effectively changed $385million of EURIBORbased floating rate euro debt to fixed rate euro debt.
Based ona 10% change in the November 30,2018market interest rates, our annual interest expense onfloating rate debt, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, wouldchange byan insignificant amount.
Substantially all of our fixed rate debt can only be called or prepaid by incurring additional costs.
