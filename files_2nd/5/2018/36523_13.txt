BUSINESS REVIEW 33 BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE USE OFNON-GAAP MEASURES The reported statutory results for the year ended 31 December 2018 reect the acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral Group which took place at the close of business on 28 March 2018 and therefore include the results of the Ladbrokes Coral Group from that date only.
As such, 2017 reects the trading for GVC Holdings PLC only as this was prior to acquisition of the Ladbrokes Coral Group.
In order to aid the comparison of year-on-year results, the Directors have deemed it appropriate to provide and analyse proforma results for the combined Group as if it had existed from 1 January 2017.
Given the changes in capital structure arising from the acquisition of the Ladbrokes Coral Group, the historical interest, tax and dividend charges are not deemed to be meaningful.
As a result, proforma results have only been provided down to operating profit.
Proforma results exclude the results of the Turkish business which was discontinued during 2017 and the 360 shops that the Ladbrokes Coral Group was required to divest on the merger of Ladbrokes and Coral.
As a result of IFRS 3 requirements to fair value acquired businesses, proforma depreciation and amortisation charges for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the first 3 months of 2018 may not be comparable with those arising post the acquisition.
Therefore, the Directors believe that the provision of underlying EBITDA within the proforma and segmental information, is appropriate as it aids the comparability of underlying profit whilst the IFRS 3 impact on depreciation and amortisation annualises.
Contribution, which represents gross profit less marketing cost, is a key measure used by the Group in assessing the Online business.
Like-for-like is a measure used in UK Retail to measure performance of the shops that have been open in both 2017 and 2018.
