Liquefied Natural Gas LNG achieved a strong improvement in operating profit, up nearly ten fold, helped by significantly increased activity in shipping and marketing and a near doubling of profits at Atlantic LNG with Trains 2 and 3 in HIGHLIGHTS 2003 Trinidad and Tobago contributing fully by the end of 2003.
E&P production volumes up 15% Transmission and Distribution T&D Three year average F&D cost of $3.17 per boe operating profit increased 132% in 2003 10 to 116 million, with strong volume Proved reserves replacement ratio 219% for the year growth at Comgas in Brazil, an improved Delivered 1.1% of the gas consumed in the USA result from MetroGAS in Argentina and in 2003 good performance from our other smaller distribution assets.
Strong contribution from T&D and Power With operating profit of 129 million in 2003, Power remains a strong contributor to BG Groups operating profit and continues to offer attractive rates of return.
In 2003, proved oil and gas reserves increased by 10% to 2 104 mmboe from 1 919 mmboe in 2002, after production of 156 mmboe, acquisition of 2 mmboe and disposal of 20 mmboe.
Proved reserve changes from existing fields and from projects that received sanction during the year resulted in an addition of 359 mmboe.
The principal fields that contributed to these reserves were in Egypt, Kazakhstan, Trinidad, Tunisia and the UK.
BG Group uses an external consultant DeGolyer & MacNaughton to perform independent reviews of reserves, an arrangement that has been in place since 1997.
