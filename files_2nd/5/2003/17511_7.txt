ZINC LEAD Developments Zinc Lead Australia Sustaining capital expenditure of US$19 million in 2003 consisted principally of underground mine development, equipment replacement, and water and tailings management.
Capital expenditure is expected to increase in 2004 by some US$10 million as the mine development inventory is increased in the George Fisher Mine.
Expansionary capital expenditure of US$7 million in 2003 centred on the feasibility study into the potential MRM expansion and work done on an open pit project to secure zinc lead ore at Mount Isa Mines.
Expenditure in 2004 will also be dedicated towards these projects.
Work done as part of the MRM feasibility study includes additional demonstration plant testing of the Albion process, continuation of environmental and engineering programmes, market studies and power supply feasibility studies.
Competitively-priced power supply remains the greatest challenge for the project.
At Mount Isa Mines, open cut evaluation work continues to focus on resource evaluation drilling and metallurgical testing of the northern sections of the resource, which holds predominantly zinc lead silver mineralisation and is close to the surface.
The zinc lead mineralisation outcrops and resources from the Mount Isa open cut may provide a near-term benefit by improving the capacity utilisation of the zinc lead stream from its current 70% level.
This area, known as Black Star, may also provide a starter pit for a larger open cut copper and zinc lead mine development in the future.
Zinc Europe During 2003 a new expansion of 7,000 tonnes per year was approved for the San Juan fide Nieva smelter in Spain.
The project involves the implementation of direct leaching for an annual 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate 2 2 and the replacement of the 3.4m cathodes and anodes in Tankhouse D for new electrodes of 3.6m.

Construction activities will continue through 2004, with commissioning scheduled for the first quarter of 2005.
At Nordenham, further debottlenecking and cooperation with the San Juan fide Nieva plant are expected to result in increased production of over 6,000 tonnes in 2004.
Nordenham will continue to benefit from its competitive power contract this year, with negotiations underway to limit the negative impact of increasing electricity prices in Germany when the contract expires at the end of 2004.
Xstrata Zinc continues to assess investing opportunities in mining and smelting where it can apply its operating and technology expertise.
Lead Europe The focus for the Northeet operation in 2004 is to optimise primary operations with crude feed sourced from Mount Isa.
The timing of shipments will have a one-off negative impact on BRM lead production due to the decision to move to shipments every two months rather than monthly from second quarter 2004, in order to reduce transport costs.
Capital projects will focus on improved environmental systems, structural replacements and information systems that will contribute to improved operational control and reduced health and environmental risk.
A pre-feasibility study to review expansion opportunities for primary operations will commence in January 2004.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 69 OTHER BUSINESSES Nursed Eucalyptus Globulus species, between seven and eight months of age, ready to be planted, Chile Scott Foster, Laboratory Analyst, operates the mass spectrometer at the Townsville copper renery laboratory Gold Xstrata announced on 13 January 2004 that it has entered into an agreement with Resolute Mining Limited for the sale of the Ravenswood Gold Mine, located in Queensland Australia, for a headline price of US$45 million.
The transaction, which was reached through a competitive tender process, is expected to complete on 1 March 2004.
Xstrata assumed ownership of the Ravenswood Gold Mine with the acquisition of MIM Holdings Limited in June 2003.
At the time, Xstrata identied the mine as non-core to its business and indicated its intention to sell the operation.

The increase in depreciation and amortisation is due to higher production resulting in a negative EBIT of US$ 0.9 million, compared to a negative EBIT of US$ 0.5 million in 2002.
