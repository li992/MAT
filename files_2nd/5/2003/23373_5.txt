This has been at the heart of Eggs success Customer Acquisition both in cross-selling loans to the card base and in Egg UK delivered a record year of growth with 635,000 growing lending balances in total.
Egg now runs over net new customers acquired during 2003, leading to a 80 campaigns a month into its customer base, focused year-end total of 3.2 million.
Since launch in 1998 Egg on selling new products, encouraging value positive has achieved a compound annual growth rate in net customer behaviours and maximising retention.
It is pleasing to note that our card offer remains attractive to customers more than two years after we introduced the 0% interest rate offer on balance transfers, given the number of imitation offers now available.
We believe the brand still benefits from first-mover advantage and research shows Egg to be one of the most trusted financial services brands in the UK.
We have constantly outperformed our internal target of 500,000 net new customers per annum and believe this level of acquisition is therefore highly achievable moving forward as our target market continues to grow in line with internet penetration and usage and the widening appeal of the brand.
Added to this is our proven track record in brand, marketing and product development.

Acquisition costs fell markedly, conversion rates improved, brand awareness reached new highs and customer satisfaction levels climbed to 95%.
