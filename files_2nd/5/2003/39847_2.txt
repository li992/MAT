Business review Carnaby Carnaby, our largest village, has been valued at 306 million and now represents 42% of our assets.
After capital expenditure of 10 million this year, this represents a 3.6% increase over book value.
When we purchased the bulk of Carnaby in 1997, we owned 116 shops and restaurants totalling 134,000 sq.
Since then we have changed over 90% of the retail and restaurant tenants and have materially increased the number and floor areas of shops and restaurants, mainly through refurbishment and re-configuration as well as through acquisitions.
As a result of these changes the estate now includes 165 shops and restaurants, totalling 252,000 sq.
ft. which currently represent 59% of Carnabys rental value.
Our largest projects, which have been at the southern end of Carnaby Street, have been key elements of our whole strategy.
In the past, this area had the greatest amount of offices and least retail space.
Now it contains the greatest range of shop sizes, including our largest units, and, at Kingly Court, our smallest ones, which we are letting on flexible leases.
These changes have resulted in both prolonged periods of disruption and loss of income during refurbishment works.
However, with the successful completion both of Kingly Court and the seven shops on the east side of Carnaby Street, we now have only two larger shops to let.
Our next phase of works will include the reconfiguration of a number of smaller but prominent corner shops.
Recent shop lettings have increasingly been to European and American, as well as British retailers, eager to open concept stores or to launch entirely new brands in Carnaby, which has become synonymous with distinctive and different fashion styles.
We encourage new independent retailers so that shoppers are attracted by a changing retail scene.
Traditionally offices in Carnaby have been mainly occupied by media companies but recently most of our new office lettings have been to fashion-related retailers and businesses.
We believe these companies are attracted both by the quality of space and the opportunity to locate in this exciting fashion district.
Whilst a priority for the immediate future is to let our vacant offices of 19,000 sq.
ft. of offices currently under refurbishment, we remain alert to any opportunities to convert office space to other more profitable and less cyclical uses.
Page 07 SHAFTESBURY PLC Annual Report 2003 Page 08 SHAFTESBURY PLC Annual Report 2003 Business review continued Covent Garden Covent Garden now represents 30% of our property assets and has been valued at 218 million.
With two exceptions, there has been a general 2% increase over book value during the year.
The exceptions are the Wellington House block, held for redevelopment, and the Thomas Neals Centre, where values of these assets have fallen by around 12%, resulting in a write down totalling 8.0 million in the year.
The value of our Wellington House office block has continued to decline in part due to the general fall in office rents but also because of our requirement to offer only short leases, so as to give us essential flexibility until we have settled our plans for reconstruction.
We have identified potentially profitable opportunities for reconfiguring the block and changing uses and we expect to be able to advance these ideas during 2004.
As a preliminary step, we have made a planning application for new shops 13,500 sq.
ft. and residential accommodation 11,500 sq.
ft. on that part of the site which fronts Mercer Street and is presently used as a car park.
In May we reported that, having obtained vacant possession of key areas at the Thomas Neals Centre, we had decided to make changes, with the purpose of improving visibility and access into the Centre from Neal Street.
This work is now in hand and in addition, we are refurbishing 8,000 sq.
ft. of offices which became vacant during the year.
Consequently, rental income has fallen and outgoings have temporarily increased.
However we remain confident that this phased programme of works will lead to greater rental growth at the Centre, to levels of rent which we are experiencing at other investments in adjoining streets.
Two of the three new shops in Shorts Gardens which were completed in August have been let.
We have pre-let a large corner shop at the junction of Earlham Street and Mercer Street in Seven Dials, which is currently being reconstructed.
Completion is anticipated in January 2004.
Covent Garden is an area of particular interest to us for further expansion.
During the year, we purchased additional retail and leisure properties at a total cost of 13.3 million.
Page 09 SHAFTESBURY PLC Annual Report 2003 Business review continued Chinatown This village has been valued at 194 million, representing an increase of 2% after expenditure.
This village now represents 26% of our assets.
As we reported in May, Chinatown, where we own 104 restaurants and shops, has experienced a reduction in trade due not only to the extensively publicised problems with public transport, safety concerns and the SARS health scare, but also to local difficulties, especially the installation of a new gas main.
These depressed conditions continued into the summer.
However, since October, and for the first time for over eighteen months, we have started to see a return of business confidence.
Consequently, two further restaurants which became vacant over the summer are now under offer and we expect to let our other vacant restaurant at the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Wardour Street on completion of our improvement works in January 2004.
As we had hoped, in September Westminster City Council approved its Action Area Plan for Chinatown.
Having started to implement improvements which we initiated for the collection of refuse and in highway cleaning, we are now encouraging the Council to be equally determined in advancing other elements of the plan, which include resurfacing the streets, improving lighting, providing better facilities for the Chinese community and most importantly introducing a special planning policy for Chinatown.
New Opportunities We have identified further areas in the West End where we are keen to invest.
Most of our activity in the last two years has been in new locations within Covent Garden and we expect this to continue.
In addition we have identified the Charlotte Street area as being of particular interest.
Located north of Oxford Street and west of Tottenham Court Road, this is reputed to be the oldest restaurant district in London and we now own properties which include seven restaurants and shops.
