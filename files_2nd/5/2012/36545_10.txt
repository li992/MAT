A slight decrease in France was principally the result of acquiring vacant possession of a number of units in SQY Ouest in advance of its proposed redevelopment.
UK retail parks occupancy at 31 December 2012 reflects vacancy in The Junction Fund portfolio which was acquired in October.
Like-for-like net rental income On a like-for-like basis and excluding properties held for sale, net rental income for the continuing portfolio increased by 2.1% during 2012.
At our shopping centres, the figure was 2.8% comprising 3.6% in the UK, driven principally by lettings at The Oracle, Bullring and Union Square and increased car park income at the latter, and 1.4% in France, primarily reflecting indexation.
Income at UK retail parks grew by 0.5% despite the impact of tenant administrations.

HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 29 Strategic review Business and financial review Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Analysed in the table below are net and gross valuations, income and yields for the investment portfolio.
The prime locations and high quality of the portfolio are reflected in yields which are low relative to other property classes.
For the continuing portfolio at the end of 2012, the net initial yield, based on the gross portfolio value, was 5.3%, unchanged since 31 December 2011.

30 HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Strategic review Business and financial review Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Capital returns For the calendar year 2012, the total return of the property portfolio as a whole was 5.0%, comprising a capital return of 0.1% and an income return of 5.0%.
For the continuing portfolio, the figures were 4.5%, -0.5% and 5.0% respectively.
Total and capital returns are analysed by segment in the valuation data table on page 48 and the chart below analyses the components of the changes in valuation for the continuing portfolio for 2012.
The capital return of 5.3% for the discontinued portfolio reflected the sales agreed in the year.
Investment yields for the UK shopping centres increased slightly in the year, and the change contributed about one-third to the decline in values, whilst just less than half of the fall resulted from lower income.
In France, the positive impacts of increased rental income, principally as a result of indexation, and development surpluses at Les Terrasses du Port were partly offset by a modest increase in investment yields.
The valuation of the UK retail parks portfolio was largely influenced by increased yields and the impact of reduced income, although these negative impacts were partly offset by the increase in value following the acquisition of The Junction Fund.
