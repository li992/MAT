Financial review Packaging Paper delivered another good financial performance despite the more challenging trading environment, with a ROCE of 17.9% and underlying operating profit of E227 million.
The early part of the year was characterised by weak demand, with market related downtime continuing from the end of 2011 into the first quarter of 2012.
Demand improved during the first half, enabling the business to implement price increases in the virgin containerboard and kraft paper grades, which became effective during the second half of the year.
Sales volumes of containerboard were similar to those of the previous year whilst volumes of kraft paper increased as a result of stronger export markets.

benefited In 2012, virgin containerboard pricing was weaker on average than in 2011 and average significantly benchmark kraftliner prices were 6% lower.
However, supply side contraction coupled with reduced imports from the US resulted in an improved supply demand balance with from profit price increases being realised in stages throughout the second half of 2012.

European virgin containerboard markets remain firm in early 2013. improvement Surplus capacity in recycled containerboard continued to influence pricing and average initiatives benchmark prices were 10% lower than in 2011.
After recovering through the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter from the January 2012 lows, pricing weakened in the second half on lower input costs.
Average benchmark prices in the second half of 2012 were 4% lower than in the first half.
Recent capacity closures coupled with a stable demand environment have firmed up the recycled containerboard market.
As yet, there has been little impact from the start-up of new capacity in Poland.
A price increase of E60 tonne was announced in January 2013.
Sack kraft paper prices were on average 2 4% lower than in 2011 despite price increases having been implemented in the third quarter, reflected in average prices in the second half being around 2% higher than the first half.
European price levels have weakened marginally in early 2013, while pricing in export markets remains stable.
Packaging Paper benefited from lower input costs particularly in the second half of the year with lower wood costs in central Europe, and paper for recycling costs being on average 16% lower than in 2011.
The acquisition by Mondi Swiecie of the power and heat generating operation benefited the business with lower costs and increased green energy credits, although the lower average selling prices achieved for green energy credits did provide some offset.
The business also benefited significantly from profit improvement initiatives which, along with improved productivity, enabled the business to continue to realise good returns on invested capital.
The containerboard business is expected to benefit from synergies from the acquisition of the Duropack corrugated packaging operations in Germany and the Czech Republic, completed in November 2012, primarily through reduced transportation costs refer to European & International Fibre Packaging for more detail.

Financial review Fibre Packaging realised a 17% increase in underlying operating profit to E101 million in 2012.
The improvement reflects the benefits of ongoing profit improvement initiatives and lower input costs.
The ROCE of 12.5%, whilst still below our 13% target, reflects a pleasing improvement on 2011 levels.
The corrugated packaging business benefited from generally stable pricing and volumes coupled with lower paper input costs.
Market demand for corrugated packaging products was broadly unchanged in the mature central European markets whilst pleasing growth continued to be seen in emerging Europe.
Average selling prices in emerging Europe were higher than in 2011 which offset in part the declines experienced in the more mature markets.
In line with the Groups strategy to strengthen its leading market position in corrugated packaging in central and eastern Europe, Mondi acquired two corrugated box operations 48 Integrated report and financial statements 2012 6313 12 Mondi IR 2March13 ES1.

For more detail annum, and a 105,000 tonne recycled containerboard mill in the Czech Republic from see page 2.
On 19 November 2012, Mondi announced its intention to close the recycled containerboard mill.
The acquisition of the packaging operations is expected to provide the Group with improved access to these regional markets and generate logistics synergies from their proximity to the Swiecie containerboard mill in Poland.
Cost synergies are estimated at approximately E10 million per annum, up around one-third from the original estimate at the time of acquisition.
After taking into account the restructuring and closure costs of E3 million, the contribution to underlying operating profit in 2012 from this acquisition was a loss of E2 million.
Industrial bags benefited from lower paper input costs and productivity and cost improvement initiatives, which more than offset lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices.
Growth in the CIS, Middle East, North Africa and Asia regions was positive whilst the western European markets continued to be weak, particularly in the south.
This has necessitated restructuring in Belgium, Spain and France with restructuring provisions and an asset impairment charge amounting to E21 million being recognised in special items.
The coatings business benefited from lower input costs for both paper and resin as well as from stringent cost management measures and productivity improvements.
These gains were offset in part by weaker demand, particularly from the automotive and building industries, and consequently lower selling prices.
The new facility in the US continues to ramp up its activities, particularly in respect of product qualification in higher value markets.
Sustainability Good progress was made with certifying the Groups largest converting business unit against OHSAS 18001 for occupational safety and health.
Forty six converting operations achieved certification in 2012 with a further twenty two remaining in progress.
Twenty six operations involved in food contact packaging have been certified and the remaining sixteen have a hygiene management system in place according to GMP.
The business units 2012 safety performance showed an improvement with a reduction in TRCR from 1.72 to 1.49 compared to 2011.
3 3 Water input decreased from 4.74 million m to 3.99 million m due to reduced production volumes and process improvements, such as introducing water recycling.
Waste to landfill decreased in 2012 following the slight increase in 2011 due to increased production.
Although energy usage slightly increased, carbon emissions remained at the 2011 levels due to a reduction in the use of carbon intensive purchased heat.

Financial review The growth in consumer packaging reflects a significant step in the Groups strategic development in higher growth markets.
Mondi acquired a 99.93% interest in Nordenia with effect from 1 October 2012.
SSFIR For further detail on the Nor SD denia Nordenia, as an international supplier of innovative consumer packaging solutions and acquisition, see the chief executives review hygiene components, enables the Group to develop a leading consumer packaging on page 16 and note 29 on page 160 of the business, building on existing deep, long-term customer relationships.
Nordenia enjoys annual financial statements a strong competitive advantage through its proprietary technology, global presence and a proven track record of innovation and growth.
Stripping out the effects of one-off costs and depreciation and amortisation charges largely related to the acquisition accounting of E18 million detailed below, the exNordenia business delivered underlying operating profit of E19 million in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations at the time of the acquisition.

indd 50 2013 03 04 3:00 PM E million Percentage DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Overview Performance Governance On acquisition, the Group recognised the net assets of Nordenia at their fair market value the details of which are set out in note 29 of the annual financial statements resulting in a higher depreciation and amortisation charge than recognised in the stand-alone Nordenia business.
In the three months to 31 December 2012, this charge amounted to E4 million.
The increase in depreciation and amortisation from 2013 will be approximately E13 million per year.
In the fourth quarter a number of one-off costs, amounting to E14 million were recognised.
These costs mainly related to the acquisition accounting for the Nordenia transaction and include the effect of the recognition of short-term assets at their fair value which were subsequently recognised as an expense in the income statement.
Comparability with the prior year is further complicated by the sale of Unterland in October 2011 which contributed E7 million of EBITDA and E5 million of underlying operating profit up to the date of disposal.
In addition to the full year contribution from Nordenia in 2013, synergies amounting to approximately E20 million per annum are expected to be realised by the end of 2014, with approximately half the benefit already expected in 2013.
This synergy target exceeds the original estimates at the time of the acquisition of E15 million per annum, largely due to increased confidence on the delivery of a number of cost reduction initiatives.
Consumer Packaging has a strong product pipeline in development.
The business expects its plant in China to commence operations towards the end of 2013 with full capacity being reached by 2015.
Sustainability The acquisition of Nordenia was subject to an appropriate level of sustainability due diligence and, in accordance with our policies, these operations will be aligned with Mondis standards and requirements by 2014.
Given the importance of food contact certification in this business unit, a 100% certification of all operations against recognised hygiene standards was maintained.
Six out of seven converting operations also maintained or achieved OHSAS 18001 certification for occupational safety and health.
Safety performance showed an improvement from a TRCR of 2.27 in 2011 to 1.60 in 2012.
The reasons for the improvement include the introduction of a Major Incident Cause Evaluation system for investigating incidents and to prevent repeat incidents.
In addition, over the years considerable effort has gone into contractor safety management to ensure that contractor companies understand the requirements and adhere to them whilst on site, as well as monitoring and evaluating their performance.
3 3 Water input reduced significantly from 1.88 million m to 0.11 million m mainly due to the sale of the cooling water intensive Unterland operation in Austria in 2011.
In 2012, an increase in landfilled waste was experienced compared with 2011, mainly due to the amended calculation of previously under estimated waste streams.
While carbon emissions remained stable, energy usage decreased compared with 2011 levels mainly due to the sale of the Unterland operation.

Whilst western European markets remained soft, impacted by both short-term cyclical and longer-term structural challenges, demand growth in eastern Europe excluding the CIS region was marginally positive.
In aggregate, Mondis sales volumes for uncoated fine paper were on a similar level to that of the previous year.
In Europe selling prices were stable throughout the year with average benchmark European uncoated fine paper prices declining by 1% in the year, while marginal price increases were achieved in the Russian market.
Russia entered the World Trade Organisation in August 2012 and, as a consequence, import duties for uncoated fine paper will reduce by 2.5% per year until they reach a level of 5% in 2016.
Implementation is due to start in 2013.
The reduction in trade duties, coupled with new capacity coming on stream in Russia and France, is expected to place some pressure on pricing in the short to medium term.

indd 52 2013 03 04 3:00 PM E million Percentage DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Overview Performance Governance The business benefited from lower input costs, driven by lower pulp costs for the unintegrated Neusiedler operation, partially offset by higher wood costs in Russia and generally higher energy costs.
Fixed costs were higher, largely due to a higher depreciation charge offset by ongoing cost optimisation initiatives.
Sustainability Mondis 2015 product related sustainability commitments include increasing the CoC-certified portion of our fibre based products.
74% of timber input in the business unit was CoC certified and was sourced largely from our 100% FSC-certified Russian forests, with the balance meeting the FSC Controlled Wood Standard.
All mills maintained ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification.
The Group has focused on eliminating injuries resulting from working at heights and it is particularly disappointing to the business unit that a fatality occurred as a result of this at the Syktyvkar mill in Russia.
A full investigation was completed and a detailed improvement plan developed.
The TRCR remained at a similar level, 0.25 in 2012 compared with 0.26 in 2011.
3 3 Water input reduced to 144 million m in 2012 from 149 million m in 2011.
The business units 2012 waste to landfill figures showed an 11% reduction against the 2010 base year, in line with our commitment to increase the recycling and re-use of materials.

Whilst still below the Groups target rate, it is pleasing to note the continued improvement in this business from the lows of 2009.
Sales volumes increased across all grades, largely on the back of increasing domestic demand.
Domestic selling price increases for uncoated fine paper and newsprint were implemented early in 2012 and prices remained at those levels throughout the year.
Both pulp and white-top kraftliner sales prices decreased on the back of lower average international benchmark US dollar selling prices.
Lower average selling prices were offset in large part by gains from the weaker South African rand versus the US dollar and euro.
Above inflation wage and energy price increases were mitigated through ongoing cost management and efficiency improvement initiatives such that overall cost increases were kept below prevailing inflation rates.
