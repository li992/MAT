Despite record demand for imported thermal coal from China and India, the displacement of US coal into the export market by shale gas as a feedstock for electricity generation and increased supply from Australia and Indonesia resulted in falling coal prices in the first half of 2012.
Copper and zinc prices followed similarly fluctuating trajectories through 2012 as they closely followed the years macro-economic events.

The preexceptional items effective tax rate before this adjustment was 24% for 2012, due to lower earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions, compared to 26% for 2011.
Attributable profit and earnings per share both fell 37%, mainly as a result of the reduced operating EBITDA.
During the year we recognised a number of exceptional items in the income statement, which in total reduced attributable earnings by $2.5 billion.
These were predominantly due to the impairment of assets, including the write down of Xstratas investment in Lonmin $840 million and the write down of the Brunswick zinc mine in Canada as it reached the end of its operational life and write downs in response to adverse market conditions for the Cosmos nickel mine in Australia, the Eland PGM operation in South Africa and the Africa Carbon Group $978 million.
Our share of the exceptional items recognised by Lonmin in its 2012 annual results was $105 million and consisted of employee strike related costs, impairments, net financing costs and related taxation credits.
We incurred costs of $136 million in relation to the recommended all-share merger of equals with Glencore International plc.
Following the approval by our shareholders in November, the expected vesting date for all share-based compensation plan awards was revised forward resulting in an accelerated share-based compensation plan charge of $185 million.

As a result we typically source debt capital in US dollars, either directly or by borrowing in other currencies and swapping them into US dollars.
From time to time we also use currency cash flow hedging to reduce our short-term exposure to fluctuations in the US dollar against local currencies.
We realised currency hedging gains for the year of $117 million, reflected in the income statement.
These gains are related to coal sales for which prices were contractually fixed.
We did not enter into any strategic, long-term base metals hedging contracts in the year.
In October, we successfully issued $4.5 billion of notes.
The US dollar-denominated notes were issued through Xstrata Finance Canada Limited and comprise four tranches: $1.25 billion 1.8% guaranteed notes due October 2015: $1.75 billion 2.45% guaranteed notes due October 2017: $1 billion 4.0% guaranteed notes due October 2022: and $500 million 5.3% guaranteed notes due October 2042.
