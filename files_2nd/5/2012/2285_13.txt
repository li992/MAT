Business review Aerospace, Defence & Energy Extending productivity Subsea components Components operating in the harsh environments of the oil & gas industry must withstand extreme material demands and resist attack from a variety of aggressive mediums.
Corrosion and wear can lead to expensive downtime in exploration, where equipment is in continual use.
The application of thermally sprayed coatings and the use of powder metal HIPed Near Net Shape PM - NNS components offer optimised material solutions allowing these components to operate reliably for extended periods of time, reducing cost and downtime.
