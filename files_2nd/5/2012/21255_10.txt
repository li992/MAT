This strong progress continues to reflect the strength of the Banks earnings power and resulted in a return on average equity of 19.1%, which is an increase from 18.3% for 2011, and earnings per share growth of 17.6% to GEL 5.22 per share, reflecting a strong business performance, significantly reduced cost of funding and improved efficiency across the business.
Revenue The Group maintained strong growth momentum across all main revenue items in 2012, delivering record revenue of GEL498.3 million, a 14.9% increase compared to 2011.
Adjusted for the impact of the last years one-off BYR currency hedge gains, total revenue increased by 21.9% compared to 2011.
The key driver of this solid revenue growth was net interest income, which increased by 18.7% to GEL 284.1 million.
Net interest income before interest rate swaps grew 22.0% to GEL 285.8 million, a result of healthy growth of the consolidated loan book, largely stable loan yields 2012: 17.5%: 2011: 17.6% and reduced funding costs 2012: 7.3%: 2011: 8.0%.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 29 Performance: Business review Overview of financial results continued Net Interest Margin Year ended 31 December 31 December GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted 2012 2011 Change Net interest income 284,117 239,285 18.7% Net Interest Margin 7.9% 7.8% 1.3% Average interest earning assets 3,614,921 3,082,850 17.3% Average interest bearing liabilities 3,904,874 3,292,724 18.6% Average customer funds outstanding 2,772,597 2,217,275 25.0% Monthly averages are used for calculation of average interest-earning assets, average interest bearing liabilities and average customer funds.
The Groups NIM for the year ended 31 December 2012 remained broadly flat at 7.9% compared to 31December2011, reflecting the loan book growth, reduced cost of funding due to deposit rate cuts and repayment ofcostly international borrowings, which more than offset the impact of the carrying cost of the Eurobond issued in July2012 and the increase of average customer funds outstanding in 2012 compared to 2011.
Net non-interest income Year ended 31 December 31 December GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted 2012 2011 Change Net fee and commission income 86,487 75,337 14.8% Net insurance revenue 34,138 17,738 92.5% Net healthcare revenue 23,346 2,458 NMF Other operating non-interest income 70,167 73,879 -5.0% Net non-interest income excluding one-off gain from BYR hedge 214,138 169,412 26.4% Gain from BYR hedge 25,056 -100.0% Net non-interest income 214,138 194,468 10.1% Other operating non-interest income includes net gains from foreign currencies, net revenue from sale of goods of the Groups non-banking subsidiaries and other operating income of the Group.
In a positive shift towards diversifying revenue sources, net non-interest income excluding the effects of one-off gains fromthe BYR currency hedge in 2011 grew 26.4% in 2012, boosted by the net insurance and net healthcare revenues, aresult of a combination of organic growth and acquisitions by Aldagi BCI, the Groups insurance and healthcare subsidiary.
Net insurance revenue almost doubled to GEL 34.1 million, net healthcare revenue grew nearly tenfold to GEL 23.3 million.
The two businesses together contributing 11.0% to the consolidated revenue in 2012, compared to 4.7% in 2011.
An increase in the level of economic activity in 2012 had a positive effect on the activity of the Groups clients across alllines of settlement operations, including the Groups card business operations, guarantees and letters of credit and cash operations.
The growth of our Express Banking service, through which the Group delivers extremely cost-effective self-service transactional and remote banking facilities, has supported strong growth in banking operations.
As a result, net fee and commission income grew 14.8% to GEL 86.5 million in 2012.
Other operating non-interest income, adjusted for one-off gains from the Belarusian Ruble currency hedge, decreased 5.0% to GEL 70.2 million, as a result of a 3.5% decline in net gain from foreign currencies reflecting the slowdown in economic activity in the second half of 2012 and a 4.4% decrease in other operating income.
Affordable Housing and theGroups non-core segments contributed GEL 4.4 million and GEL 9.6 million respectively to other operating income in2012.
Overall, other operating non-interest income declined by 29.1% year-on-year, due to the one-off gain of GEL25.1million on the BYR currency hedge in 2011.
Net non-interest income amounted to 43.0% of total revenue compared to 41.5% in 2011 excluding the one-off gains fromBYR hedge in 2011.
30 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Net operating income, cost of credit risk, profit for the period Year ended 31 December 31 December GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted 2012 2011 Change Salaries and other employee benefits 122,556 114,622 6.9% General and administrative expenses 67,041 61,942 8.2% Depreciation and amortisation expenses 28,606 27,254 5.0% Other operating expenses 2,949 6,347 -53.5% Operating expenses 221,152 210,165 5.2% Operating income before cost of credit risk 277,103 223,588 23.9% During 2012, the Groups operating expenses increased by 5.2% to GEL 221.2 million, significantly lagging behind the revenue growth rate of 14.9%.
Adjusted for the one-off BYR hedge gain in 2011, operating leverage was 16.7% in2012.
The increase in expenses primarily reflected a 6.9% increase in salaries and other employee benefits as a result of the Groups headcount growth to service the Groups increased revenue base over the course of 2012.
General and administrative expenses for the reporting period grew by 8.2% to GEL 67.0 million, which included expenditure on new branches, distribution channels such as ATMs and Express Pay terminals, and marketing costs.
The cost to income ratio improved further to 44.4% in 2012 from 48.5%, benefiting from ongoing cost efficiency measures undertaken by the Group.
When adjusted for the one-off revenue gains in 2011, the cost to income ratio improved substantially from 51.4% adjusted for Belarusian Ruble hedge gains to 44.4%, reflecting significant underlying cost efficiency improvements.
The Groups operating income before the cost of credit risk increased by 23.9%, to GEL 277.1 million.
Cost of credit risk Year ended 31 December 31 December GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted 2012 2011 Change Impairment charge on loans to customers 39,186 23,216 68.8% Impairment charge on finance lease receivables 495 317 56.2% Impairment reversal charge on other assets and provisions 5,036 1,337 NMF Cost of credit risk 44,717 22,196 101.5% Net operating income 232,386 201,392 15.4% The cost of credit risk increased by GEL 22.5 million to GEL 44.7 million in 2012, reflecting the absence of the previous years recoveries, the increase in the Retail Banking impairment charge as a result of job reductions made in a large payrollclient during the first half of 2012 and the increase in the Corporate Banking cost of risk in the second half of 2012, predominantly due to provisions attributed to a single corporate client in the fourth quarter of 2012.
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Group recognised an impairment charge of GEL 14.2 million increasing respective allowance for losses to 50% of total balance sheet exposure in respect to one of the larger corporate clients of the Group in the infrastructure sector, with a total exposure of GEL 58.8 million, of which GEL 36.2 million comprises a loan and GEL 22.6 million off-balance sheet guarantee.
Bankruptcy procedures have been initiated against the borrower, and while the Group expects to be ableto recover the un-provisioned amount of the loan from the borrowers assets including pledged collateral in the bankruptcy proceeding it will continue to assess objective evidence of further impairment of the overall exposure in 2013.
These factors, which negatively affected the cost of risk, were partially offset by the effects of a change in the collective assessment methodology.
The loss experience used to determine the appropriate collective assessment rates was changed from seven years to three years in Retail Banking in 2012.
As a result of the foregoing, in 2012 cost of risk amounted to 1.3%, compared to 0.9% in2011.
The allowance for loan impairment was GEL 110.5 million or 3.5% of total gross loans as at 31 December 2012, compared to 4.2% as at 31 December 2011.
The Groups Non-performing loans NPLs increased to GEL 126.3 million as at 31 December 2012 from GEL 100.3 million a year earlier, reflecting the addition of the above-mentioned corporate client.
NPLs are defined as the principal and interest on loans overdue for more than 90 days and any additional losses estimated by Execuitve Management.
The Banks NPLs to total gross loans ratio was 3.9% as at 31 December 2012, an increase from 3.7% in 2011, while NPL coverage ratio, including discounted value of collateral was 87.5% at 31December 2012.
NPL coverage ratio excluding discounted value of collateral was 110% at 31 December 2012.

The annual growth in total assets reflects a strong growth in net loan book, which increased byGEL476.0 million or 18.2% compared to 2011.
On a constant currency basis, the net loan book grew by 19.2% compared to2011.
The Groups liquid assets, which comprise high quality assets including NBG certificates of deposit, Georgiangovernment treasury bills and bonds and interbank deposits and cash and cash equivalents, grew by21.3%toGEL 1,624.3 million at 31 December 2012.
The funds raised as a result of the Eurobond issuance byBankof Georgia inJuly 2012 contributed to the significant increase in the liquidity pool.
The growth of the Groups loan book during the course of 2012 was driven by a 10.4% increase in Retail Banking lending to GEL 1,348.3 million and a 23.1% increase in Corporate Banking lending to GEL 1,696.3 million.
Approximately 87.1% ofthe Groups loan book was collateralised as of 31 December 2012 2011: 85.0%.
Loans denominated in foreign currencies primarily in US dollars accounted for 68.3% of the Groups net loan book as at 31 December 2012, comparedto 69.6% as at 31 December 2011.
Total liabilities Total liabilities amounted to GEL 4,596.1 million, an increase of 19.3% in 2012, driven by the growth in borrowed funds, which increased 42.0% to GEL 1,225.8 million as a result of the Eurobond issued in July 2012.
The Groups average customer funds grew 25.0% to GEL 2,772.6 million during 2012, while the deposit rate cuts during the course of 2012 ledto a reduction of the more costly GEL denominated deposit base, decreasing customer funds to GEL 2,693.0 million as at 31 December 2012, a 1.5% decrease compared to 31 December 2011.
Client deposits denominated in foreign currency accounted for 68.7% of the Groups total client deposits as at 31 December 2012 2011: 59.1%.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 33 Performance: Business review Overview of financial results continued The composition of the Banks balance sheet reflects its aim to maintain a diversified funding base, while optimising funding costs.
Customer lending was largely funded by customer deposits, as the increase of the average client loans by GEL 441.9 million in 2012 compares to the increase of average customer funds by GEL 555.3 million.
The strong trend of client deposit inflows in the first half of 2012 was reversed in the second half of 2012, as reduced deposit pricing led to lower customer account balances of corporate clients in particular in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The targeted deposit repricing resulted in the further reduction in the cost of client deposits to 7.3% in 2012 from 7.6% in 2011.
The change in the funding structure also reflected the issuance of the five-year Eurobond in July 2012, which accounted for 34.3% of the borrowed funds and 9.2% of total liabilities.
Long-term lending from DFIs accounted for 54.9% of the Banks borrowed funds and 14.6% of total liabilities, translating into good quality long-term less expensive funding source for the Group.
Reflecting the continued discipline with deposit pricing, the cost of client deposits declined from 7.6% in 2011 to 7.3% in 2012.
Cost of funds from credit institutions decreased by 161 basis points to 7.2% in 2012, largely as a result of repayment ofcostly international borrowings.
As a result of targeted liability management during the year, Cost of funds declined from 8.0% in 2011 to 7.3% in 2012.
Net loans to customer funds and long-term DFI funding ratio was 91.9% as at 31December 2012 2011: 79.1%, while net loans to customer funds ratio was 114.8% 2011: 95.7%.

This is a further improvement from the 19.9% Tier I Capital of the Group in 2011.
Risk-weighted assets increased 24.6% to GEL 4,785.9 million, reflecting the increase in interest earning assets during 2012, while Tier I Capital BIS increased by GEL 289.2 million, due to the generated retained profits and the conversion of the EBRD and IFC subordinated and convertible loans into Bank of Georgias equity, subsequently acquired by BGH upon the completion of the Tender Offer.
Total Capital resources increased by GEL 197.3 million.

This is a further improvement from the 10.5% Tier I Capital ratio of the Bank in 2011.
Tier I Capital increased by GEL 227.6 million, due to the generated retained profits and due to the conversion of the EBRD and IFC subordinated and convertible loans into the Banks equity.
Total Capital per NBG increased by GEL 75.2 million, affected by a decline in subordinated debt due to repayments.
Risk weighted assets increased by 9.8% to GEL 5,352.2 million, reflecting the increase in interest earning assets.
Among other differences between BIS and NBG capital regulations, the key ones are summarised below: BIS is based on Group consolidated audited IFRS numbers, while NBG is based on Bank standalone unaudited numbers per NBG standards: Per NBG standard, 175% total risk weighting including both credit risk and market risk is applied to loans denominated in foreign currency with an exception for export-related income of a borrower, while a maximum of 100% total risk weighting is applied to such loans under Basel.
Current year profit per the NBG is part of Tier II Capital and moves to Tier I Capital at the start of the next year, while per BIS current year profit is part of total retained earnings and, therefore, included in Tier I of current year.
