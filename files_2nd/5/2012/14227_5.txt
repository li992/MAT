DEMAND DRIVERS The main driver of demand for SIGs products in the new build residential and non-residential markets is construction activity, which in turn is largely determined by economic growth.
Conversely, demand for construction products in the RMI market tends to be more constant and in some markets can even be counter-cyclical to the macroeconomy.
Although current economic conditions are subdued, SIG believes that the medium to long term drivers for its products remain strong given that the current relatively low levels of residential and private non-residential building activity do not appear sustainable when compared to demographic growth trends.
Given the Groups strong market position in the majority of the countries in which it operates, SIG believes that it is well positioned to benefit from any upturn in demand over the medium term.
In addition to macroeconomic conditions: Insulation and Energy Exteriors Interiors Management T he need for reducing energy consumption T he replacement of old damaged roofs gives Increasingly stringent re and acoustic and related costs, particularly given recent rise to an ongoing RMI requirement, providing regulations, which as well as driving demand higher energy prices.

SIG has a strong focus on cost control and is continuously looking for improvements in working practices and other associated opportunities to reduce costs.
Two particular areas where the Group has spent time and effort to deliver operational ef ciencies are transport & warehousing and in the effectiveness of its Sales function.
For example, by implementing more ef cient working practices in 01 the Group saved 1.4m in SIG Distribution, its UK insulation and interiors business, reducing headcount by nearly 100 and the delivery eet by 6 vehicles.
At the same time, the Group is also targeting further structural opportunities to reduce cost, and has identi ed 10m of additional ef ciencies from its branch network across Europe.
3m of these savings have been delivered in 01, with a further 7m incremental to 013.
As a result of the Groups continued focus on cost control, operating cost in ation net of cost savings was only 0.

To reduce this risk the Company has a risk of being over reliant upon any one provider.
