The business responded carefully and decisively and limited new supply throughout 2009. to these challenges at the beginning of the year, with the result that, in the latter part of the year, the Group was able to position itself to take advantage of the improved market sentiment and subsequent capital flows.
UNITE significantly strengthened its financial position in 2009 through a number of self-help measures.
It continued to focus on its operational performance to deliver a profit for the year at the net portfolio contribution level, selling non-core assets at valuations ahead of its targets, securing a significant joint venture with a new partner, Oasis Capital Bank, and renegotiating maturities for a small number of debt facilities.
These actions strengthened the Groups financial position and consequently enabled it to raise 82 million from shareholders, at a small discount to net asset value, to fund its future development business.
In December, the Group successfully raised 167 million of capital into the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund USAF, providing the Fund with further capacity to acquire assets from UNITE and explore other acquisition opportunities.
