uk Management of liquidity risk and financing The Groups Treasury policy is intended to ensure that there are adequate financial resources for the development and growth of the business whilst financing its operations at the lowest cost and minimising foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The objective is to achieve this without operational disruption or recourse to complex financial instruments.
The strategy and policies are approved by the Board.
The Group does not engage in speculative transactions.
The key financial risks relate to meeting debt repayments as they fall due, interest rate risk and limited foreign currency exposure.
The Groups term based borrowings are a direct result of the acquisition of businesses in the UK and Europe and the strategic investment in a new systems and warehouse and cutting facility.
The borrowings are denominated in Sterling and Euros.
The Group anticipates that there will be sufficient Euro cash flow to pay both the interest on the Euro borrowings as well as the capital repayment amounts due over the life of the underlying loan.
The Group fixes the interest rate on at least 75% of term borrowings via interest rate swap arrangements to provide interest cost certainty and reduce risk.
Any current account deposits generated from the strong operational cash flows of the Group are invested in the currency in which they are received unless there is a clear need for conversion.
During the year the Group invested these deposits in a combination of overnight and longer term investment graded accounts arranged via the Groups principal bankers in the countries in which it trades.
