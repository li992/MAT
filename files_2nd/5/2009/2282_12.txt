Revenues in constant currencies were lower by 23.5% reflecting reduced aerospace after-market requirements, some postponement of large power generation projects and the impact of lower oil prices on oil & gas exploration 189.5m REVENUE and production.
Revenues benefited by 9.6% as a consequence 2008 : 220.1m of the weakness of sterling compared to most of the currencies in the countries in which the Group operates.
Headline operating profit for ADE was 24.7m 2008: 45.5m, with margins weakening from 20.7% to 13.0%.
The restructuring programme delivered cost savings of 9.8m in 2009 and the 24.7m OPERATING PROFIT annualised rate as we enter 2010 is expected to amount to 14.5m.
2008 : 45.5m 2009 was characterised by a significant reduction in capital expenditure across the Group, including in ADE, as widespread reduction in customer demand left capacity available for medium-term development.
Long lead-time projects which were started before the MARKETS recession, most notably the installation of a new large HIP unit in Sweden, were, however, completed or largely completed in 2009.
The reduction reflects the effects of the restructuring programme, Aerospace & Defence which included the closure of facilities and the removal of assets Energy from service in a number of other locations, partly offset by investment General Industrial to enhance the capabilities of the business.
Net capital expenditure in 2009 was 19.1m 2008: 20.2m which represents 1.1 times depreciation 2008: 1.2 times depreciation.
MARKETS TURNOVER BY GEOGRAPHY Aerospace demand declined at a steady rate throughout the year with after-market requirements falling in response to reduced flying hours by airlines.
Business with OEM airframe and engine manufacturers remained solid, especially for wide-body programmes.
Defence demand North America has remained good.
Western Europe Emerging Markets Power generation requirements softened as the year progressed and in Europe demand fell substantially in the second half.
This impacted both heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing and reflects customer inventory adjustments and some push-back in major power station build programmes around the world.
Oil & gas suffered significant decline as global energy prices fell and with them exploration and production activity, although work for production activity started to strengthen towards the end of the year.
ADVANCED 18 BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS ID4874 Bc AR2009 14. qxp 5 3 10 16:07 Page 19 ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2009 2009 saw the formation of the global Aerospace, Defence & Energy business.
This has resulted in the realignment of some 63 facilities into a single, market-focused organisation targeted at meeting the requirements of major OEMs and their supply chains throughout the world.
The ADE business has 34 Nadcap accredited facilities.
Many facilities are also approved to the aerospace quality standard AS 9100.
An important area of development in 2009 was to position the business to benefit from the impending growth in build programmes for the Airbus A380 and Boeing Dreamliner for airframe, engine and landing gear components.
ORGANISATION AND PEOPLE The establishment of the ADE business required a number of organisational changes to enable the new market-focused approach to operate efficiently.
At the same time, management implemented significant cost cutting measures, including the closure of six locations to deal with the effects of reduced demand.
The majority of the processing capability and sales were transferred to other facilities.
The objective has been to reduce the cost base and, at the same time, improve the efficiency of service.
Although this resulted in a headcount reduction of 439 during the year and 489 since July 2008, the business is now positioned to be more effective in meeting customer requirements.
LOOKING AHEAD The key objective for ADE in 2010 is to realise the benefits of the new market-facing organisation and drive the expansion of its proprietary and differentiated technologies.
The new market-facing organisation is targeted at improving the customer experience of Bodycote and increasing the businesss understanding of the requirements of prime manufacturers.
This, in turn, is expected to increase sales to existing clients and to improve the conversion rate of potential into actual business.
