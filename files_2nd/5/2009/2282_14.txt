General industrial sectors were down by an average of 22.7%.

General industrial sales declined by 17.7% in 2009 and Emerging Markets have remained at these reduced levels in the latter part of 2009.

As a consequence of reductions in demand, restructuring of the AGIs cost base has been critical and has been pursued vigorously.
The business has continued to increase capacity in several specialist technologies which have all suffered less than average reductions in demand during the downturn and, in some cases, sales have increased in 2009.
