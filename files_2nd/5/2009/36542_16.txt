PrOPerty POrtfOliO AnD AllOCAtiOn We use external and internal research to analyse in detail the markets in which we operate and base our decisions on overall portfolio allocation using this analysis.
As part of our annual business planning process, we review the current and projected performance of each of our properties and identify assets for disposal.
The result of this active approach to managing the portfolio is the 2.1 billion raised from disposals in the last five years, whilst 2.2 billion has been invested in acquisitions and new developments over the same period.
At 31 December 2009, Hammersons retail portfolio in the UK and France 2 provided 1.6 million m of space including 16 major shopping centres and 16 retail parks.
Our office portfolio includes six prime buildings in central 2 London, providing 169,000 m of accommodation.
Our property portfolio was valued at 5.1 billion at the end of 2009, with our investment portfolio valued at 5.0 billion and developments making up the balance.
Joint ventures, including eight major shopping centres in the UK, accounted for 37% by value of the total portfolio.
During 2009, acquisitions, disposals, development completions and the effects of changes in exchange rates have combined to change the weighting of the portfolio.
At the end of the year, the retail portfolio represented 88% of the total, whilst the UK accounted for 66%.
The comparative figures for 31 December 2008 were 76% and 60% respectively.
24 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 Business AnD finAnCiAl review The 2009 capital return for the UK and French portfolios was -8.9%, as shown in the table below.

For the year as a whole, more than half of the decline in values resulted from changes to investment yields with the remainder principally due to lower rental values.
However, this masked contrasting performances in the first and second halves of the year.
In the UK portfolio in the first six months, investment yields weakened and rental values fell.
The second half saw investment yields recover and the rate of decline of rental values slow.
Investment yields in the French portfolio increased in both halves of the year, although the rate of increase slowed significantly in the last six months.
Rental values in France increased slightly in the first half, but were virtually unchanged in the second.

3 Further analysis of development properties by segment is provided in note 3B on page 78.
In the table above, the initial yield calculation is based on passing rents excluding rent of 21.6 million per annum which will be received after the expiry of rent free periods.
2 On 29 October, Union Square, our 49,600m major shopping and leisure development in Aberdeen, opened to the public.
The scheme received its one millionth visitor just three weeks after opening and was 79% let or in solicitors hands at the end of December.
Anchored by Marks & Spencer, and featuring a 203-bed Jurys hotel and Cineworld, Aberdeens largest cinema, Union Square was awarded a BREEAM Very Good environmental rating and created over one thousand retail and leisure jobs.
In 2009, we successfully completed a number of extensions in our retail parks portfolio.
The extension of Westwood Retail Park, Thanet, was completed in June and was fully let on opening to Bhs Homestore, Brantano and Dunelm.
The extension to Cleveland Retail Park, Middlesbrough, was finished in July and the scheme was fully let by the end of the year.
At Fife Central Retail Park in Kirkcaldy, we completed in August 2 an 11,000m extension which is fully let to tenants including B&Q, Mothercare and Toys R Us.
The total cost of these three projects was 59 million and the annual rent receivable is 4.8 million.
We pursued our disposal programme during the year, which commenced with the exchange of contracts for 2 the sale of Forum Steglitz, our remaining German asset, in May.
The net proceeds of 58 million for the 31,600m shopping centre were received in July and the comparable book value of the property at the end of 2008 was 79 million.
We expect the sale to reduce administration expenses by around 0.5 million per annum.
26 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 Business AnD finAnCiAl review 2 June saw three further disposals.
Les Trois Quartiers, the 29,700m retail and office building in Paris 1er was sold for net proceeds of 172 million and its comparable book value at 31 December 2008 was 238 million.
Hammerson loaned the purchaser 30 million for a two year term, extendable at the option of the purchaser for a further two years.
2 We sold a 75% interest in Bishops Square, London E1 in June.
The principal tenant of the 71,500m building is international law firm Allen & Overy and the asset is now held in a 25:75 joint venture between Hammerson and the Oman Investment Fund, an investment arm of the Government of Oman.
The consideration for the property was 445 million compared with its book value at the end of 2008 of 486 million.
Hammersons interest in the property, including the related secured debt, is accounted for as an associate and the balance sheet includes Hammersons share of the associates net asset value.
We provide asset management services to the joint venture for which we receive a fee of 300,000 per annum.
In December, our office building at 148 rue fide lUniversit, Paris 7me was sold for 74 million.
The equivalent book value of the property at 31 December 2008 was 108 million and at the time of sale, the property was 38% vacant and passing rents were 3.6 million.
During the year we disposed of five retail parks: Victoria Retail Park, Nottingham: Les Rives fide LAa, St Omer: Cap Malo Boutiques, Rennes: Seacourt Retail Park, Oxford: and Berkshire Retail Park, Theale for total proceeds of 114 million.
In January 2010, we started work on a 30 million extension and refurbishment of our building at 54-60 rue du 2 Faubourg Saint-Honor in the eighth arrondissement of Paris.
The scheme will result in a 7,400m mixed-use 2 2 property comprising 4,100m of retail space and 3,300m of residential accommodation and is expected to be completed in January 2011.
The estimated rental uplift from the refurbishment is 2.5 million per annum and all of the space has been pre-let.
We completed our first major acquisition since 2007 in December, with the purchase of a 50% interest in 2 Silverburn, a 91,100m shopping centre in Glasgow.
The scheme, which opened in 2007, is a single-level covered mall anchored by Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, New Look, Next and Tesco Extra.
It has 98 retail units let to high quality retailers and is 97% occupied with an average unexpired lease term of 12 years.
The centre is held in a 50:50 joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Hammersons share of the acquisition cost of the property was 152 million.
There are opportunities to increase the value of the scheme through active asset management and by extending the property.
Hammerson is the asset manager for the joint venture.

5 The percentage by which the ERV exceeds, or falls short of, rents passing together with the estimated rental value of vacant space, all at 31 December 2009.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, net rental income was 294 million, whilst passing rents from the investment portfolio totalled 318 million at that date.
Further details of net rental income, including a like-for-like analysis, are provided in the Financial Review on pages 33 and 34.
In the UK we agreed 77 rent reviews in 2009, for which the current rents receivable were 8.5 million, and secured additional income of 1.3 million per annum.
Assuming that rent reviews outstanding at the end of the year are settled at ERV, annual rents could increase by a further 3.4 million.
Rents at shopping centres in France change annually according to either a composite index, partly based on retail prices, or a construction cost index.
From 1 January 2010, indexation of 0.84% will be applied to around 60% by value of the retail leases in Hammersons French portfolio.
The corresponding index for 2009 was 3.85%.
The balance of the leases is indexed according to construction costs, for which the index for 2010 is -4.1%.
28 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 Business AnD finAnCiAl review OCCuPAnCy vACAnCy EPRA has issued revised guidance for the calculation of vacancy.
Previously, vacancy was reported as a percentage of the total ERV of a property or portfolio.
The revised definition expresses vacancy as a percentage of rents passing plus the ERV of vacant space.
We have adopted this new definition and restated our 2008 comparatives for vacancy and occupancy data.
By the end of 2009, occupancy in the investment portfolio returned to its December 2008 level of 95.2%.
A strong letting performance at the developments completed in 2008 offset the effects of the inclusion of 60 Threadneedle Street and Union Square following their completion in 2009.
The retail schemes at Highcross, Leicester: Cabot Circus, Bristol and OParinor, to the north of Paris, were respectively 94%, 95% and 99% let at 31 December 2009, whilst, in the City of London, 125 Old Broad Street was 91% let and 60 Threadneedle Street was 73% let.
At the latter property, leases for the remaining space are in solicitors hands.
inCOme seCurity AnD QuAlity The weighted average unexpired lease term in our investment portfolio was around nine years at the end of 2009, indicating both a secure income stream and the potential for rental growth.
In the UK at 31 December 2009, 45 retail units were let to tenants in administration, and of these, 23 were still trading.
The equivalent figures for France were 19 and 13 units respectively.
The number of tenants in administration is lower than at the beginning of 2009, and substantially lower than at 30 June 2009.
For the Group as a whole, income from tenants in administration represents 1.6% of passing rent at 31 December 2009.
Hammersons largest tenants by rental income are shown in the table below.
The ten largest retail tenants account for 52 million or 16% of total passing rents at 31 December 2009.
In the office portfolio, the five largest tenants represented 23 million or 7% of total passing rents.

Hammersons investment in Bishops Square is now accounted for as an associate and is excluded from the rental and other data presented for the investment portfolio.
All new leases are assessed for the covenant strength of prospective tenants.
Our credit control team monitors the credit ratings of all key tenants, using a credit rating agencys risk indicator scale of one to five, with one being low risk and two lower-than-average risk.
At 31 December 2009, all but two of the top ten retail tenants had a rating of one, whilst the remainder scored two.
Tenants with a low or lower-than-average risk indicator comprised 78% by passing rent of the UK retail portfolio.
Our office tenants are generally of lower risk than retailers, although we also monitor their risk indicators.
At 31 December 2009, four of the top five office tenants had a low or lower-than-average risk indicator and the rent of the fifth was guaranteed by its parent company.
There have been no significant rent payment defaults in our office portfolio in 2009.
Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 29 Business review continued retailer performance In the UK, like-for-like turnover at Hammersons core shopping centres rose by 0.4% during 2009 when compared with 2008, with a poor first half offset by a strong finish to the year.
The Bullring in Birmingham saw like-for-like growth of 3.8%, outperforming the Hammerson portfolio average.
At Highcross, Leicester, the extension, which opened in September 2008, diluted turnover at comparable retail stores.
In the UK, like-for-like sales at medium-sized stores increased by an average of 4.0% in 2008 and by 0.4% in 2009, whilst sales at department stores have fallen by 4.5% over the same period.
Across merchandising ranges, fashion, non-fashion and leisure have performed reasonably well, but general merchandise has suffered.
Footfall trends have been mixed with growth at Highcross, Leicester, following the opening of the extension and at WestQuay, Southampton, as a consequence of the opening of an IKEA store next door which also attracted customers to the shopping centre.
Elsewhere footfall declined slightly, suggesting a general picture of fewer visits but higher spending per visit.
In France, retail spending was subdued in 2009, despite a good Christmas season.
Nationally, sales at regional shopping centres fell by 4.2%, with Hammerson centres showing a decline of 3.6%.
Italie 2 recorded the best performance with sales stable, thanks to the introduction of new concepts and the rebranding of the supermarket.
OParinor, Espace Saint Quentin and Cergy 3 Fontaines also performed better than the national average whilst Bercy 2 and Place des Halles suffered from competitor activity.
In the Hammerson France portfolio, turnover at unit shops was flat whilst larger stores saw sales decline by 2.8%: hypermarket sales decreased by 7.5%.
Footfall performances matched the national benchmark at -3.7% year-on-year.
Bercy 2 0.6% and OParinor -1.5% outperformed within the portfolio.
Affordability of rents In the UK, affordability levels, measured as rents as a percentage of sales turnover, at stronger locations such as Bullring, WestQuay and Oracle were marginally lower at the end of 2009, which should enable future rental growth as turnover levels recover.
Elsewhere, and particularly at the recently completed centres in Bristol and Leicester, rent to sales ratios are high.
As these centres mature and sales grow, affordability is expected to improve.
In France, the level of rents in relation to turnover is generally lower than in the UK.
However passing rents have risen due to increases in the rental indices in 2008 and 2009 and there is pressure on turnover due to the economic downturn.
For the UK it includes tenants break options.
For France, it is based on the earliest date of lease expiry.
2 The ERV at 31 December 2009 for leases that expire or break in each year and ignoring the impact of rental growth and any rent-free periods.
30 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 Business AnD finAnCiAl review The table above shows that leases with current rents passing of 80.7 million will expire, or are subject to tenants break clauses, during the period from 2010 to 2012.
Assuming renewals take place at current rental values, we estimate that additional rents of 5.2 million per annum would be secured.
Rental uplifts in the retail portfolio would be partly offset by over-renting in the UK office portfolio.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, lease incentives or possible changes in rental values.
2 Projected rents for space that is subject to review in each year, based on the higher of the current rental income and the ERV as at 31 December 2009 and ignoring the impact of changes in rental values before the review date.
The investment portfolio as a whole was 4.1% reversionary at the end of 2009, compared with 3.8% at 31 December 2008.
Although reversion in the UK portfolio has fallen, particularly at our office buildings where rental values have declined, the impact was more than offset by the sale of over-rented properties in France.
The table above shows that in the UK, leases with passing rents of 84.4 million are subject to review over the next three years.
On review, we estimate that rents receivable in respect of these leases would increase by 4.4 million per annum by 2012, if reviewed at current rental values.
Assuming that outstanding rent review negotiations are concluded at current rental values, an additional 3.4 million per annum would be secured.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of potential changes in rental values before the relevant review dates.
In France, the majority of leases are subject to annual indexation.
COntrACteD inCOme: DevelOPments COmPleteD in 2008 AnD 2009 In 2010, our cash flow will increase substantially due to leases and contracts that have been signed at recently completed developments.
The table below shows contracted income on both cash flow and accounting bases.
Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 31 Business review continued DevelOPments Our objectives from development are: to create assets which generate an attractive initial yield with significant future growth in income: to create assets valued at a surplus above our costs: and to create prime assets of a type which are difficult to obtain in the open market.
Hammerson has built a reputation as one of the leading developers in the UK and France, managing complex urban regeneration schemes and forging strong links with local authorities and key occupiers.
In April 2009, we were named Property Weeks Developer of the Year.
The completion of Union Square in October marked the end of our recent programme of major developments.
The developments shown in note 11 to the accounts on page 87 principally represent the costs incurred to date on the development pipeline.
Hammerson has a substantial pipeline of potential future development opportunities.
We have maintained close contact with the local authorities involved with these schemes and continued to progress planning, legal and design work so that we may benefit from them as market conditions improve.
In December, we acquired Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille, one of the largest shopping centre developments anticipated in France over the next few years.
The initial capital commitment, including the acquisition cost, is 2 expected to be approximately 45 million in the first six months.
The 52,000m centre will provide 150 stores, a 260m-wide restaurant terrace overlooking the sea and 2,850 car parking spaces.
There is strong retailer interest in the scheme, with leases in respect of 44% of the retail income pre-let or under offer.
Net rental income is anticipated to be 29 million per annum and the total development cost will be around 400 million.
We expect to start enabling work later in 2010.
We have also achieved the following milestones during 2009: In April, Southampton City Council granted outline planning consent for Watermark WestQuay, a project set on a four hectare brownfield site adjacent to our existing WestQuay Shopping Centre.
The consent was subject to confirming S106 provisions, which were agreed in February 2010, and a development 2 agreement with the Council is now in place.
The mixed-use scheme will include up to 24,000m of retail space, a hotel, a residential building with up to 240 apartments and leisure facilities.
We have entered into an agreement with The City of London Corporation, which provides us with a development option for the St Alphage House, London EC2 site.
We intend to follow a full consultation process and work up the scheme design over the next two years.
In November, The London Borough of Hackney approved Hammersons Bishops Place Regeneration Project.
The scheme will open up a 1.3 hectare site in the heart of London and almost half of the schemes 2 footprint will be allocated to the public realm.
The 140,000m project, designed by Foster Partners, will include high quality offices, residential accommodation, a hotel, serviced apartments and retail space.
The site will also accommodate 50 affordable housing units, comprising properties for both shared ownership and rental.
The London Borough of Barnet passed a resolution to grant planning consent in November for the 4.5 billion Brent Cross Cricklewood regeneration plan.
The partners of the joint venture proposing the scheme are the owners of Brent Cross Shopping Centre, Hammerson and Standard Life, and a separate joint venture between Hammerson and Brookfield Europe.
A new town centre will be created, incorporating the delivery of 7,500 new homes, 27,000 jobs, three schools, a new train station, six bridges, new open spaces and an extension to Brent Cross Shopping Centre.
Our proposed retail-led regeneration of Leeds city centre, Eastgate Quarter, has outline planning consent.
We have a development agreement with Leeds City Council and agreements for lease with anchors John Lewis and Marks & Spencer.
In Sheffield, we have outline planning consent for the retail-led Sevenstone development and detailed planning consent for some of the buildings within that scheme.
A development agreement is in place with Sheffield City Council and we have an agreement for lease with John Lewis to anchor the centre.
Discussions continue with the city council to complete the land acquisition phase of the project.
Since the year end, Hammerson has been appointed as development and asset manager by the administrators of Thornfield Ventures Limited TVL, a non-trading holding company within the Thornfield Capital Limited group.
Hammerson has not committed any capital to TVL or its subsidiaries.
The principal asset of TVL is The Rock in 2 Bury, a 60,000m shopping centre development which is scheduled for completion this summer.
As well as managing the development and the letting process, we will manage and evaluate the other properties and potential developments of the group.
