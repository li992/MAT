DIRECTORS REPORT BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Business and financial review Introduction concurrently without degradation in optimum CSR is a leading provider of multifunction connectivity, performance and that Bluetooth, FM radio, GPS audio and location platforms.
CSRs technology location finding technology, Wi-Fi, high quality audio portfolio includes: for music, NFC and other to be developed future wireless technologies can all ultimately co-exist alongside each other.
Bluetooth: We believe that the market for connectivity, audio and Global Positioning Systems, GPS : location products in the medium term will be driven primarily by developments in smart and feature Frequency Modulated FM Radio: phones.
We believe that, with our help, customers can put world-class connectivity in their products at competitive prices and are able to choose, within Wireless-Fidelity or Wi-Fi typically associated reason, what capabilities they need for any particular with wireless communication standard product to meet end-customer demand.
This IEEE802.11 : provides our customers with an important differentiator.
Despite the economic slowdown, we Audio: believe that these markets have the potential to grow from around $3.5 billion in 2008 to between $5 billion Near Field Communication NFC which is a and $7 billion by 2012. short range wireless frequency which enables the transfer of data, including larger files and Increase software content in new products.
We believe that increased software content can improve the robustness and flexibility of our solutions Together these technologies enable silicon platforms and helps to distinguish them from competing that incorporate fully integrated radio, baseband and offerings.
We also believe our software can increase microcontroller elements to seamlessly access the the overall value proposition of our products and Connectivity Centre and other platforms for the benefit assists customers in efficient integration of our of consumers.
CSRs technologies have been adopted by market In addition, we believe software developed by us or by leaders into a wide range of mobile consumer devices developers using our development tools, increases such as mobile phones, automobile navigation and the likelihood that customers will use our products in telematics systems, personal navigation devices future designs.
We intend to increase the emphasis PNDs, wireless headsets, personal computers PCs, on software in the future in order to increase the mobile internet devices, GPS recreational devices, software content of our solutions.

This year also saw manufacturers to build Bluetooth accessories that increased adoption of our Bluetooth and GPS into conform to the Made for iPod standard.
In the second half of the year, car Competition in the headset segment is growing, manufacturers increased the volume of new cars particularly in developing markets such as China, largely in response to recycling initiatives by a number CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 12 of governments encouraging consumers to replace which are likely to continue, in addition to factors aged vehicles with new models.
