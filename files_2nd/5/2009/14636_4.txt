Spirax Sarco helps Campil to reduce energy consumption, down time and maintenance costs.
The customer Campil is based in Portugal and makes tomato pastes at a tomato pulp plant.
The challenge The plant has several water evaporators that use steam to concentrate tomato pulp.
Peak loads made it difficult to achieve the stringent steam quality required and at times the boilers tripped out causing shut down of the entire plant.
Our solution We provided a complete control sequencing and supervision system, including steam meters, control valves, controllers, modulating feed water controls and other equipment to improve steam quality, all linked by central software supervision.
Results The plant now runs efficiently with improved steam quality, lower fuel consumption and reduced maintenance costs.
The expected payback period is two years.

The challenge Like many other ingredients, caramel is very viscous when cool and Kinnerton required pumps which would perform effectively in a new line for caramel production.
Our solution In place of the gear pumps already used by Kinnerton in similar applications we recommended the MasoSine SPS2 sanitary pump, which is part of a range that can handle flow rates up to 90,000 litres per hour and pressures up to 10 bar.
MasoSine pumps have a very gentle pumping action which is frequently used in sanitary applications to handle chocolate, cheese curd, yogurt, concentrates, yeast, batter and stews.
Results Kinnerton have now standardised on MasoSine pumps.
Not only does the SPS2 handle all its pumping requirements without problem, says plant engineering supervisor Phil Barwick, once again ease of cleaning is very impressive.
Even after pumping glucose a simple but thorough flush-through is all that is required.
This means that hygiene standards are consistently met.
