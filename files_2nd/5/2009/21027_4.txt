Business review The financial and operational highlights previously described are analysed further in the following Financial and Business review, providing a detailed account of the Groups activities and their financial impact in the period.
Key performance indicator Definition The movement between opening and closing assets under Year-end assets under management management provides a good indication of the overall success average assets under management aum of the business during the period, both in terms of net subscriptions redemptions and investment performance.
The average AuM balance during the period, along with the average margins achieved, determine the level of management fee revenues.
The AuM and margin trends are lead indicators for short-term profitability.
The average net management fee margin is calculated in US Dollars, average net management fee margins bps and is assessed after management fee rebates.
The average is affected by changes in the product and investor mix.
Certain themes attract higher gross fee levels, generally where investment return opportunities are higher.
The operating profit margin measures total operating profits against operating profit margin net revenues.
Net revenues are calculated after deducting third-party distribution costs and any rebates.
Included within total operating costs are both fixed and variable personnel expenses, and other operating expenses.
The Groups variable compensation represents the majority of the Variable compensation VC eBVCIT overall personnel expenses payable, and is assessed as percentage of profit before tax, interest, and variable compensation.
The amount includes performance-related bonuses, share-based payments and associated social security costs.
The Group analyses its headcount by function investment vs. support, Year-end headcount and by geography central vs. local asset management subsidiaries.
