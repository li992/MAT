In addition, one regional distribution centre will close in the first half of this year.
Whilst this restructuring meant we had to take an exceptional charge of 9.6 million this year, we expect the future annualised cost savings to be approximately 14 million.
Comet continued to improve its service offer with on-line delivery tracking, additional installation services for integrated appliances, a 24-hour helpline for Comet on Call customers and the extension of free 30-day helplines for televisions and multimedia ranges.

An exceptional charge of 13.6 million was taken in the year and is expected to generate annualised cost savings of approximately 11 million.
DEVELOPING OUR ONLINE OFFER The internet represents a unique opportunity for the well known consumer brands we operate and we do not expect any cannibalisation with our store network.
Experience clearly demonstrates that the share of customer spend increases with the development of a cross-channel approach.
On that basis, the Group will progress the established brands with the combined internet and bricks and mortar approach.
