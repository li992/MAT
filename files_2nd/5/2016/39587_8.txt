The US National Oceanic and efficiency Atmospheric Administration NOAA was the launch customer and installed T56 engine upgrade kits, known as the Series 3.5, on its two Hurricane Hunter P-3 aircraft.
The result: fuel economy improvement of 12% on average after more than 3,000 engine flight hours through and around hurricanes.
The USAF completed a Series 3.5 installation on the first of its fleet of C-130H aircraft and early flights showed similar results.
The USAF will roll out the upgrades into C-130s operated by USAF Reserve and Air National Guard units, leading the way for installation of the Series 3.5 kits into the global fleet of hundreds of transport aircraft flown by other customers around the world.

Compared with current large-scale reactors, SMRs can deliver significant programme risk reduction through controlled offsite modular manufacturing, compact passive safety systems and easier financing.
