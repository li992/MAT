SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 10 Business Review The right assets in the right places Our products: Big box warehouses generally 10,000 sq m Demand for large warehouses for inventory storage and regional, national and international distribution is growing, particularly amongst retailers.
The cost of efficiently servicing both a store network and delivery of items direct to homes and offices, along with competitive pressures from discount and online-only retailers, has forced companies to restructure their supply chains.
Our big box warehouse portfolio is situated in the major logistics corridors and hubs in the UK and Continental Europe to ensure efficient and rapid transport to our customers major markets.
Urban warehouses generally less than 10,000 sq m Proximity to major urban areas is of critical importance to many occupiers: retailers and parcel delivery companies must distribute goods efficiently to both store networks and homes and offices the last mile delivery : businesses need premises which are easily accessible for both their customers and their employees: data centre operators need to be located close to users of the data particularly financial services to ensure the fastest possible data transfer speeds: and air cargo companies must be located close to major airports.
Our smaller warehouses located in, or on the edge of, major cities in the UK and Continental Europe cater for all of these requirements.

These will usually form a small element of a larger urban warehouse estate.
