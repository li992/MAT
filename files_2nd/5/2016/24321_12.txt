Unsurprisingly, the greater part of the increase flowed 2014 2015 2016 from the Industrial side, augmented by large productivity improvements and cost reductions implemented over the Marketing activities 1,545 2014 1,280 2015 1,586 2016 last 18 months, and to a lesser extent, by price increases Industrial activities 7,077 2014 4,030 2015 6,030 2016 in the second half of the year and the stronger US dollar effect on producer country costs.

These increases were fundamentally supported by demand strength from Chinas industrial base and confidence in the sustainability thereof, together with the enhanced realisation that fear of a supply glut in many markets was overdone, as evidenced by declining stock levels in most key commodity categories.

58 Glencore Annual Report 2016 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Additional information Industrial activities Highlights The Metals and minerals industrial portfolio delivered a $2,000 million 50% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $6,030 million and a $1,454 million reduction in capex.
Some external factors played a part, such as the relative strength of the US dollar versus key producer country currencies, notably in South Africa, Kazakhstan and Argentina, and price increases towards the end of the year, however the largest positive impact on earnings and cash generation was the extensive cost reduction and efficiency initiatives embedded into the businesses over the last 18 months.
It is noteworthy that among the asset groups where some tough decisions were made in 2015 regarding production curtailments, Adjusted EBITDA is up strongly year-over-year, demonstrating the successful implementation thereof.
More generally, the overall portfolio has benefited from such supply discipline, which saw copper and zinc own production decline year-over-year by 5% and 24% respectively.

Coal news was dominated by Chinas effective domestic supply reduction campaign to restore accelerate financial health to an oversupplied industry and its consequential effect on seaborne pricing.
Oils persistent fears of oversupply and inventory builds were eventually tackled by OPECs first agreed production cut in almost a decade and pledges to do likewise by various non-OPEC countries, including Russia.
Solid contributions from both the oil and coal divisions showcase Glencores abilities to successfully navigate such choppy markets.

Glencore Annual Report 2016 69 Strategic report Energy products Industrial activities Highlights Energy Products Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was down year-over-year, on account of the coal economic price hedging initiatives noted above.
Prior to such hedging impact, underlying Coal Adjusted EBITDA was up 14% year-overyear, with Adjusted EBITDA margins consistent at 30%.
In a period of considerable uncertainty around the oil market, the development programme in Chad was significantly curtailed, resulting in year-over-year capex savings of almost $0.5 billion but, inevitably, also in lower production and earnings.
Some limited development will recommence in 2017.

Viterra Canada faced challenges in the first half of 2016, as the crop harvested in September 2015 was below average, with margins suffering from competition amongst handlers in the face of low prices and farmer retention.
Margins improved in the final quarter with a near-record, albeit poor quality, crop harvested in September 2016.
South Australia was broadly similar, with the first half impacted by the disappointing October 2015 harvest and the final quarter benefiting from a record 2016 South Australian crop.
In the meantime, we had added storage and were well prepared for the large Viterra Australia intake.
The crop size and delayed Australian harvest is also expected to positively impact results in the first quarter of 2017.

At Becancour, margins were poor early in the year as sales of meal proved challenging, but increased in the second half.
In Argentina, where the fiscal environment has improved, margins were reasonable in the post-harvest period, but contracted somewhat with farmer retention later in the year.
Softseed crushing and biodiesel in Europe struggled with the smaller rapeseed crop and resulting over-capacity.
Sugar milling volumes increased as we attracted ample third-party cane and the business benefited from higher sugar and ethanol prices.
Wheat milling in Brazil was challenging in early 2016 as demand contracted due to poor domestic economic conditions, however this business recovered well in the second half.
