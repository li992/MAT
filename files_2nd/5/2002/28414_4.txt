The strategic focus is on annuities, corporate pensions, with-profits bonds and Individual Savings Accounts.
The UK insurance operations recorded a like-for-like 10 per cent increase in total sales on the previous year as a result of strong sales of bulk and individual annuities throughout 2002.
Cost savings Successful marketing campaigns and an effective pricing policy m helped the business to achieve a significant increase in sales of 250 single premium individual annuities for the year, which were 200 up 39 per cent to 1.76 billion.
Single premium bulk annuities 150 also performed well with a 23 per cent increase in total sales for the year to 710 million.

Life product sales were down on 2001 with total sales down five per cent and APE sales down eight per cent to 247 million.
However, during 2002, the UK insurance operations maintained its position as a leading distributor of with-profits bonds through Independent Financial Advisers.
Prudential believes that with-profits continue to offer an attractive investment option for investors.
It expects to remain one of the leading providers of with-profits policies in the future and is developing new products, which offer the advantages of a smoothed investment return, but with increased transparency.
In October 2002 Prudential entered the structured ISA market, launching the first offer of the Prudential Growth and Income Plan, sales of which were encouraging.
A further series of offers are planned for 2003, the first of which was launched in January.
Prudential broadened its distribution during the year through a distribution agreement with Abbey National for an initial four-year period.
This arrangement anticipates proposed changes to polarisation rules that will liberalise sales channels and allow banks to offer advice on other companies regulated 6 Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 products and will allow Prudentials with-profits bonds to be made available for distribution through Abbey Nationals extensive high street branch network.
Pre-depolarisation, BROADENED Prudential has entered into a similar distribution arrangement that will meet the current regulatory requirements, and will provide similar benefits.
This arrangement was launched on 11 December 2002 and sales have been encouraging.
DISTRIBUTION Since the year-end Prudential has announced a proposed PROPOSED RULE CHANGES WILL distribution arrangement with Zurich Financial Services, LIBERALISE SALES CHANNELS FOR which is expected to further broaden Prudentials distribution, INSURANCE PRODUCTS.
In November 2001 the Company announced a target for cost savings of 175 million by the end of 2004 and in July 2002 increased this target to 200 million.
These savings arise from the creation of the single customer service organisation, the rationalisation of support services and a refocusing of IT investment.
Of this amount, it is estimated that 65 million on an achieved profit basis will be attributable to shareholders.
Good progress has been made and 130 million of savings were delivered in 2002 with an annualised value of 155 million.
Prudential remains confident of achieving this important reduction in operating costs.
In September 2002 the Company announced plans to establish an offshore service centre in India to improve customer contact service and achieve additional cost savings.
The new processing centre will be established in Mumbai and is now expected to be operational in 2003.
This initiative is expected to incur a restructuring charge of approximately 20 million.
The current estimated impact on shareholders would be a charge of 5 million against achieved basis operating profit, spread over 2002 and the next two years.
However, due to the creation of a lower-cost servicing centre, this charge will be offset by expected annual gross cost savings from 2006 of approximately 16 million, of which 4 million per annum will be attributable to shareholders.
As a result of the continuing depressed levels of world stock markets, bonuses were reduced on conventional and unitised with-profits policies in February 2003.
This followed earlier reductions on unitised with-profits policies in September and December 2002.
These actions were taken to protect the strong financial position of the with-profits fund and to protect the long-term interests of customers.
2002 was a turbulent year for global equity markets, with the FTSE 100 falling by 24.5 per cent during the year.
However, the investment return on Prudentials with-profits fund was negative 8.1 per cent in the year to 31 December 2002 reflecting its diversified investment mix.
In 2002, profits distributed from Prudentials main with-profits fund amounted to 2.7 billion, of which 2.45 billion 90 per cent was added to policies as bonuses, and 273 million 10 per cent is available for distribution to shareholders.
We believe that the UK market for long-term savings will continue to be difficult in 2003.
Prudential with its trusted brand and financial strength is well placed to compete strongly in this environment.

Prudential Europe In early 2002 Prudential reviewed its strategy for the Prudential and Scottish Amicable branded long-term business within continental Europe.
The review concluded that an organic strategy based on investment in the German and French markets would be unlikely to meet return on capital targets.
Analysis indicated that the returns achievable from any available acquisition would be too low to justify the investment of capital.
As a consequence, in November 2002 Prudential agreed to sell its German life business to Canada Life Financial Corporation Canada Life for 129 million 82 million.
The sale was completed on 1 January 2003.
Irish High Court approval for the transfer of the relevant life assurance policies to Canada Life is expected early in the second half of 2003.
Prudential will continue to run its existing operations in France for value, but not push for growth.

PCA now has 89,000 agents across Asia and regional teams ensure that quality training and best practice are applied consistently.
The largest increases in agent numbers in 2002 have been in its recently established operations in Vietnam and India.
During the year PCA also made significant progress in enhancing agent productivity through sales and product training programmes in many of its operations.
Bancassurance, through distribution agreements with banks, has continued to provide a material source of new business.
Across the region, PCA now has a total of 18 bancassurance agreements in 10 countries.
Alternative distribution, which includes bancassurance, produced 21 per cent of insurance APE sales in 2002, compared with 17 per cent in 2001.
PCAs success in markets across the region is in large part due to its product innovation, and its readiness to package and market products to meet specific customer needs.
In 2002 PCA continued to leverage its regional leadership in capital efficient unit-linked products with successful launches in India, the Philippines and regular premium unit-linked products in Taiwan.
Additionally, PCA LIFE Japan secured regulatory approval for variable annuity products, drawing on technical expertise developed in Jackson National Life in America.
Working with JNL on product design and pre-launch preparations meant a successful launch in October 2002 was possible, very soon after regulatory approval was received.
Being a pioneer and leader in the introduction of capital efficient unit-linked life insurance remains a significant source of competitive advantage in both its established and newer markets: 30 per cent of PCAs APE sales in 2002 came from unit-linked life products, up from 23 per cent in 2001.
PCAs operations in Greater China achieved significant growth in 2002.

In Singapore a new regulatory Direct regime was introduced in late 2002.
While the full impact of 1994 this will be known over time, PCA has thoroughly evaluated the December 2002 potential outcomes and consequences and is well positioned to build upon its strong franchise in 2003 and beyond.
PCA has recently entered the very large and material North Asian markets of Japan and South Korea through the acquisition of small but operationally and financially sound local companies.
There are clear plans in place to build significant and sustainably profitable operations over the long term in both countries.
In 2002 very good progress was made with management teams being strengthened and the product ranges and pricing structures re-based.
The focus is on building distribution and raising brand awareness.
In 2002, PCA continued to pursue its long-term strategy of building a complementary, material and profitable regional mutual fund business.
Progress to date has been very encouraging with market-leading positions in India and Taiwan, growing operations in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong and the recent acquisition of a mid-sized investment trust management company in the large South Korean market.
As at 31 December 2002 total mutual funds under management have increased to 5.1 billion, up 59 per cent on last year, with strong net inflows of 1 billion.
As would be expected in the current economic environment the majority of the funds under management are in lower margin fixed income type products.
This, coupled with ongoing investment in the development and start-up of this business, means net MSB profits from PCAs mutual fund business are currently not material in the Group context.
During 2002 PCA undertook a comprehensive review of the regions life and mutual fund markets and updated its strategy to optimise growth and profit prospects within a rigorous capital allocation framework.
The long-term prospects for the region, and for PCA as a significant force in the market, remain very positive.
Continued successful implementation of Prudentials strategy should deliver material and sustained profitable growth in the years ahead.
PCA remains well positioned to participate in Asias outstanding long-term growth prospects.
It has a strong track record of successful delivery and a robust business model firmly focused on building businesses in markets and sectors that combine scale opportunities with secure long-term profitability and very attractive returns on capital.
