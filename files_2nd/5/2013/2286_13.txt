Business review Automotive & General Industrial Harvesting strength Harvester heads There is nothing more important than keeping harvesters up and running during harvest times.
Unexpected breakdowns and repairs cost time and money, so each component must be reliable and long lasting.
Some components in contact with abrasive crops require an extremely hard wearing surface and may need more than one surface treatment.
Bodycotes services help to ensure components do not wear out prematurely.
Processes such as carburising, carbonitriding, ferritic nitrocarburising, marquenching and tempering may all be used to extend the life of harvesting components.
