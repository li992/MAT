BUSINESS REVIEW GKN AEROSPACE GKN Aerospace is a world leading global tier 1 supplier of airframe and engine structures, components, assemblies and transparencies to a wide range of aircraft and engine prime contractors and other tier 1 suppliers.
It operates in three main product areas: aerostructures, engine components and sub-systems, and special products.
Products Strategy Integrated aerostructures, including wing empennage and Our strategy is to focus investment in core market flight control surface assemblies and fuselage structures.
technology development and application to: Fixed and rotating propulsion products for aircraft exploit our strong positions on existing programmes engines, fan cases, engine components, exhaust systems for new aircraft platforms, and pursue long-term contracts and nacelles.
on selective high-growth and long-running platforms: Transparencies including specially coated cockpit and deploy new technologies for future commercial and cabin windows.
defence aircraft, to improve fuel efficiency, reduce Niche products such as ice protection, fuel systems and emissions and minimise the environmental impact flotation devices.
of aviation: expand into adjacent markets with similar product technologies and manufacturing capabilities: and expand our global footprint.

During 2013 GKN Aerospace was selected by Boeing to manufacture the Advanced Technology Winglet for the new Boeing 737 MAX.
Production of this advanced structure will take place in the UK, with final assembly at GKNs facility in South Carolina.
The first delivery to Boeing is expected in 2015.
