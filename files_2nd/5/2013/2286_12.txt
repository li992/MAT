Business review Aerospace, Defence & Energy Safe landings Landing gear Critical landing gear must perform without fault every time the aircraft flies.
The nature and position of this critical component requires strength as well as wear and corrosion protection to fulfil design requirements.
A combination of thermal processing techniques is used to ensure the materials desired characteristics are achieved.
Heat treatment is performed to change the properties of the materials allowing the parts to endure their harsh punishment.
Environmentally friendly thermal spray processes such as HVOF have superseded traditional coating methods to aid corrosion and wear resistance properties.

1 Headline operating profit for ADE was 70.7m 2012: 69.1m.
The headline operating profit margin improved from 26.8% to 27.0% as a result of a continuing improvement in mix of business.
In 2013, the Group added capacity in a number of aerospacefocused facilities, including the establishment of a new Surface Technology location in Houston, Texas.
In the coming year it is expected that capital expenditure will again be slightly above depreciation as further capacity and capability are added to support continuing growth in aerospace demand.
Net capital expenditure in 2013 was 20.4m 2012: 21.0m which represents 1.1 times depreciation 2012: 1.1 times.
Average capital employed in ADE in 2013 was 235.4m 2012: 227.9m.
The small increase is primarily due to investment in new capacity to meet continued sales growth in the aerospace markets.
