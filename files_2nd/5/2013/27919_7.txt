A3.2 Business review OPERATING SEGMENTS First Mortgages Buy-to-let loan completions increased by 90.5% to 359.8 million for the year 2012: 188.9 million.
Application volumes increased over the year, with the pipeline of applications and offers outstanding totalling 231.9 million at 30 September 2013 2012: 129.9 million.
The credit quality of the new lending business written in the year has remained excellent.
The increase in available warehouse capacity and the success of the Groups securitisation activity has ensured that the Groups first mortgage business has been well placed over the year to capitalise on the strength of the private rented sector and the renewed strength of the housing market, which has become evident during 2013.
The Group has maintained two distinct propositions, one targeting professional landlords and the other private investor landlords, which together have ensured that we have maintained a strong market position through the year.
The housing market has seen a strong recovery in 2013 albeit against the background of an extended period of low levels of activity and at house prices.
It is now clear that the combination of a general improvement in the economy, higher levels of consumer con dence and continuing government stimulus in the form of the Help-to-Buy and Funding for Lending schemes, have prompted increased levels of house purchase and re-mortgage transactions, which in turn have led to increases in house prices in most regions.
By August 2013, house purchase transactions reported by HMRC had reached, at 107,000 a month, the highest level since December 2007.
Transactions in the quarter ended 30 September 2013 were up 21.9% on the comparable period last year, whilst mortgage advances in that quarter were, according to estimates made by the Council of Mortgage Lenders CML, 32% up on the same quarter in 2012.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported in its September Residential Market Survey that tenant demand and new landlord instructions continue to increase.
This is consistent with the information published by the CML which reports further growth in new buy-to-let lending over the year with completions stronger in the quarters ended 30 June and 30 September 2013 4.8bn and 5.7bn respectively, lending in the quarter ended September being up 42.5% on a year earlier.
The arrears performance of the buy-to-let sector continues to be better than the owner-occupied market note 6.
At 30 September 2013, the buy-to-let portfolio was 8,324.4 million, compared with 8,196.4 million a year earlier.
The redemption rate on the back book remained low at 2.5% for the year 2012: 2.2% with landlords continuing to display a long-term commitment to property investment, whilst alternative offerings from other lenders remain unattractive as a result of generally higher funding and capital costs.
The credit performance of the portfolio over the year continued to be exemplary, with the percentage of loans three months or more in arrears including acquired loans and receivership cases but excluding possessions and receivership cases held for sale standing at 0.35% at 30 September 2013 30 September 2012: 0.48% and remains considerably better than the comparable market average of 1.16% as recorded by the CML at that date 30 September 2012: 1.51%.
With the strong credit performance over the year and with increased house prices impacting on security values, the impairment charge attributable to First Mortgages decreased to 6.8 million for the year from 12.4 million for 2012.
At 30 September 2013 there were 1,395 properties across all portfolios where a receiver had been appointed 30 September 2012: 1,504.
Of those available for letting, 94.8% were let 30 September 2012: 94.2%.
The owner-occupied book reduced to 77.4 million from 99.2 million during the year ended 30 September 2013 and performed in line with the Groups expectations.
Save for the management of this book in run-off, there has been little activity in recent years in this area as the Group has focused on other lending markets, portfolio acquisitions and other sources of revenue generation.
Consumer Finance At 30 September 2013, the total loans outstanding on the Consumer Finance books were 399.7 million, compared with 399.0 million at 30 September 2012, as portfolio purchases covered below have balanced redemptions across the portfolios.
The performance of the Consumer Finance book, including the acquired assets, remains satisfactory and in line with our expectations.
Strategic report A3.2 Business review continued The Groups secured loan portfolio at 30 September 2013, including the acquired assets, was 248.4 million 2012: 279.9 million.
The unsecured loan, retail finance and car finance portfolios, including the acquired assets, totalled 151.3 million at 30 September 2013 30 September 2012: 119.1 million.
The Groups increased exposure to consumer loans in recent years has primarily resulted from portfolio purchases.
Preparations are currently under way to recommence consumer lending in a new banking subsidiary.
Further details on the progress of this development are set out below.
PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS AND SERVICING A major area of strategic focus for the Group is the acquisition of loan portfolios through Idem Capital and the servicing of third party loan portfolios as opportunities are created through the ongoing process of financial institutions disposing of loan assets.
The Group is rmly established as a mainstream purchaser of consumer debt in the UK, in addition to taking advantage of ad-hoc deleveraging-led opportunities as a range of large institutions seek to rationalise their balance sheets.
In addition to assets acquired in its own right, Idem, through its sister companies, Moorgate Loan Servicing and Arden Credit Management, has established two new servicing contracts with co-investment partners during the year.
These add volume to the Groups servicing operations and enhance earnings.
The contribution to operating pro ts from these activities increased to 33.3 million 2012: 26.3 million during the financial year.
Further possible investment opportunities are currently under review and the Groups strong track record in loan servicing, risk management and portfolio investment positions it well to continue to exploit similar opportunities as they arise.
Idem Capital The Groups investment division, Idem Capital, invests in loan portfolios either as principal, where Idem acquires pools in its own right, or as co-investor alongside other partners with, typically, Moorgate Loan Servicing appointed to act as servicer.
Co-investing has the potential for higher returns where the Group also derives income from servicing the loans within the underlying portfolio.
Investments are made only after signi cant due diligence work on the portfolio and sensitivity testing of potential returns.
During the year Idem Capital purchased 71.9 million of unsecured loan assets and invested a further 20.9 million in loan portfolios through structured entities as a co-investor.
At 30 September 2013, the balance outstanding in respect of investments in portfolios was 193.7 million 2012: 135.4 million.
A further 13.5 million was invested in loan portfolios after the year-end.
Moorgate Loan Servicing The Groups third party loan servicing business operates through Moorgate Loan Servicing and its recoveries division, Arden Credit Management, utilising our core administration and collections skills.
Our experience in loan management established over many years has enabled us to extend this service to our third party clients, providing signi cant added value to the performance of their loan portfolios.
During the year Moorgate Loan Servicing has assumed the servicing of further portfolios, comprising 50,000 accounts, for third parties 2012: 149,000 accounts with the result that 43.8% of accounts under management by the Group at 30 September 2013 were managed on behalf of third parties 2012: 49.9%.
At the end of the year, an agreement to take on the servicing of a further 26,300 third party accounts was in place and these accounts were migrated on to the Groups systems during October 2013.
