Thus, given the considerable balance sheet resources available to the Group, the Board is satisfied that the Group is adequately capitalised to continue its operations effectively.

Risk Risk is inherent in all businesses and is therefore present within the Groups activities.
The Group seeks to identify, quantify, monitor and manage each of its risks effectively.
The ultimate responsibility for risk management rests with the Board.
However, from a practical perspective some of this activity is delegated and the Group actively promotes a risk awareness culture throughout the organisation.
The principal risks, their mitigants, and their delegated owners are set out on pages 32 and 33 for each of the four risk categories that Ashmore considers most important: strategic and business, investment, operational, and treasury with reputational risk being a common characteristic across all four categories.
