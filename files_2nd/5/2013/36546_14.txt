Returns are shown for each of the portfolio segments in the valuation data table on page 53.
The chart below analyses the sources of the valuation change for the continuing portfolio.
During the course of 2013, and principally in the second half of the year, investment yields fell and increased valuations for the UK shopping centres, UK retail parks and French retail properties.
Rising rental values at shopping centres in the UK and France boosted valuations, but declined marginally for UK retail park assets.
The positive effect of yields, rents and the development progress at Les Terrasses du Port on the valuation of the continuing portfolio was offset to some extent by capital expenditure including that to progress the development pipeline.
