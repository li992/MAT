Strategic Report Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 20 Business Review POWERING GLOBAL AVIATION At the same time as delivering a significant increase in Civil Aerospace engine production, Rolls-Royce marked the entry into service of the Trent 1000 TEN on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in November 2017.
That milestone followed the first test flight of the Airbus A330neo, powered by the new Trent 7000, in October and the first test flight of the Airbus A350-1000, powered by the new Trent XWB-97 in late 2016.
That means Rolls-Royce successfully flew three new civil widebody engines in a period of just 12 months an unprecedented achievement in the aerospace industry.
Each programme has brought together more than 20,000 parts to create engines that have undergone rigorous testing at facilities around the world.

Using industry-leading data analytics, the Centre plans engine operations and maintenance, driving efficiency in an industry where one per cent fuel savings can be worth $250,000 per aircraft per year.
With a Rolls-Royce powered aircraft taking off or landing every 16 seconds, the business can use data from thousands of aircraft across the world to ensure they are available for service 24 7.
The Centre will also be a hub for the introduction of new technologies including real-time collaboration systems which allow engineers working around the world to share live pictures from inside an engine with the team at the Centre and receive advice on what action to take.
In addition, remote surgery techniques will enable experts at the Centre to carry out complex engineering tasks by remote control.
STRATEGIC REPORT Strategic Report Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 23 Business Review THE TRENT XWB ONE IN A MILLION In late 2017, the Trent XWB-84 passed an important milestone: one million flying hours.
The engine, which powers the Airbus A350 XWB and is the most efficient large aero engine flying in the world today, achieved the milestone while delivering the best ever widebody entry into service performance, with despatch reliability reaching 99.94% in October and zero in-flight disruption.
The engine continues to set new standards of performance and popularity in our industry.
Not only is it the most efficient large aero engine flying in the world today, it is also the fastest-selling widebody engine ever, with more than 1,600 already sold or on order.
The engine, assembled in Derby, UK, and Dahlewitz, Germany, has a front fan that is just under ten feet across, which draws in up to 1.3 tonnes of air every second at take-off.
The highpressure turbine blades inside the engine rotate at 12,500rpm, with their tips reaching 1,200rpm twice the speed of sound.
At take off, each of the engines 68 high-pressure turbine blades generates around 900 horsepower per blade similar to a Formula One racing car and at full power, air leaves the nozzle at the back of the engine travelling at almost 1,000mph.

STRATEGIC REPORT Strategic Report Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 25 Business Review CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR POWER GEARBOX TECHNOLOGY In November, Rolls-Royce officially opened its state-of-the-art power gearbox PGB test facility in Dahlewitz, Germany.
The facility is part of the new centre of excellence for power gearbox technology, one of the key enabling technologies for the UltraFan engine.
Development and testing is already well underway.
The facility has already set a new world record for the running of the worlds most powerful aerospace gearbox with the PGB successfully reaching 70,000hp.
But it wont stop there: our PGB is designed to run at up to 100,000hp.
When running at maximum power, each pair of teeth on the gearbox transmit more power than the whole starting grid of a Formula 1 race.
