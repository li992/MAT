Business and financial review Strategic investment with strong cost discipline 2017 has been another successful year for Schroders, as we delivered record pre-tax andexceptionals profits of 800.3 million, up 24% on 2016.
Our pre-exceptional earnings pershare for the year are 226.9 pence and we are recommending a final dividend of 79 pence.
This results in a full year dividend of 113 pence, which represents a 50% payout ratio.
After exceptional items, profit before tax was up 23% to 760.2 million, resultingina 21% increase in basic earnings per share to 215.3 pence.

20 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report We report both our profits and AUMA in sterling.
Asanet exporter of investment services from the UK, we have benefited from the devaluation of sterling which followed the UKs decision to exit from the European Union in June 2016.
The Groups revenues and AUMA are predominantly denominated in non-sterling currencies, whereas the cost base is less impacted by currency changes.
The weakness in sterling in the first half of the year, compared to 2016, contributed positively to profit before tax and exceptional items by around 27 million.
Overall, we believe we are well placed to deal with the industry challenges, including those related to Brexit, and remain focused on our strategic priorities alongside strong cost discipline.
Based on these strong results, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 79 pence per share 2016: 64.0 pence, bringing the total dividend for the year to 113 pence, an increase of 22% from 2016.

This year we have made changes to our remuneration approach for employees deemed to be material risk takers under the UCITS or AIFM Directives UCITS AIF MRTs.
We have increased bonus deferral levels for these employees, to create further alignment with clients and shareholders and to meet the requirements of those regulations.
This has resulted in an increase inthe proportion of variable remuneration that is deferred.
Under accounting rules, the cost of employees deferred remuneration ischarged over the period in which the remuneration becomes payable.
This increase in the proportion ofremuneration deferred has resulted in a reduction ofaround one percentage point in our total compensation ratio for 2017.
This is an accounting benefit and will largely unwind over the next two years.
