47 Directors Report | continued Financial instruments and risk management The Board agrees and reviews policies and financial instruments for risk management.
Further information on financial instruments is contained in note 35 to the financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed are detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 19.
Going concern and future developments The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position as well as the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and the borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report on pages 1to19.
In addition, note 35 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: itsfinancial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidityrisk.
The Groups debt maturity profile for its long-term funding is detailed in the Strategic Report on page 15.
None of the Groups significant current bank loan facilities are due to expire within the next 12 months.
As part of its risk management process the Group has considered its forecast cash flows and forecast covenant compliance taking into account: the impact on the various loan covenants of reasonable reductions in the property valuations, decline in rental income and increase in interest rates: the impact of potential events arising from adverse movements in general economic conditions on the Groups operating cash flow generation, including tenancy failures and increased vacancies: and the proposed capital distribution of 35p per share 144.5 million to shareholders in the first half of 2018.
These forecasts show that the Group has sufficient headroom and available finance to manage its business risks successfully.
Based on thisassessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Thus, they continue to adoptthe going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Long-term viability statement In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2016 Code, and considering the Groups current position and the principal risks detailed on pages 18 and 19, the Directors have assessed the Groups prospects and viability.
The Groups future prospects are assessed primarily through its annual strategy review.
This review is led by the Joint Chief Executives drawing on expertise from across the management team.
It includes an assessment of the macro-economic environment, forecasts of key property market metrics including yields and value growth, and annual valuation progressions for the portfolio.
The Directors assessment for the purposes of viability is over a three-year period to December 2020 in line with the typical lease lengths of its tenants.
The review is based on a detailed three-year forecast, taking into account financial and operating positions, forecast cash flows, debt maturity and renewal prospects, forecast covenant compliance and REIT compliance along with current and available mitigating actions.
The financial model has been stress tested for severe but plausible scenarios, such as increases in interest rates, reduction in property valuations and a 10% reduction in earnings before interest and tax, both individually and in aggregate, specifically to understand the impact of reductions in property valuations, declines in rental income and therefore operating profit and increases in interest rates along with current and available mitigating actions.
The stress tests enable the Group to model the impact of a variety of external and internal events that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and allow the Board to assess the effectiveness of any management actions that may be required to mitigate the impacts of the events.
The nature of the Groups business as the owner and asset manager of a diverse high-yielding portfolio of industrial property principally located throughout the UK and let to a wide variety of tenants reduces the impact of adverse changes in the general economic environment or market conditions in any one sector on the overall Group.
The Groups property portfolio comprises predominantly light industrial units.
These are the most simple, flexible and economical of all commercial property types and have shown themselves to be extraordinarily adaptable to changing working practices and new occupational trends.
Furthermore, in the main the properties are valued at substantially below replacement cost and let at rents below the levels necessary to justify new builds.
Taken together these factors operate to limit the supply of new stock and help to maintain the demand for the existing stock.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their detailed assessment.
