Other Exploration Activities The Fresnillo Group has a number of early stage prospects in the central Mexican States of Guanajuato, Guerrero and Morelos.
The Group targets prospects that are likely to yield a minimum of 2 million ounces of gold or 100 million ounces of silver.
In 2008, exploration activities at early stage prospects included parametric drilling at La Sauceda in Guanajuato and Ximotla in Guerrero, with sufficient results to warrant a second phase of drilling in 2009.
General exploration advanced in the Guanajuato-Pachuca silver belt, Guerrero-Morelos gold belt, and Jalisco-Michoacn silver-gold belt.
Combined, these activities identified five areas for additional drilling in 2009.
In May 2008, a joint venture agreement was signed with International Northair Mines Ltd to explore the India property at Durango State where a group of gold-silver bearing veins show potential.
The Group could gain up to an 80% interest in the project through property payments and by funding exploration over a four-year option period.

Our commitment to optimize water usage extends to reducing reliance on fresh water and control and reclaiming wastewater.
Over the past four years we have increased the vol- 3 3 ume of recovered water from 15.7 million m in 2005, to 18.6 million m in 2008.
In 2008 construction commenced on a wastewater treatment plant at Fresnillo, which will take sewage water from Fresnillo municipality at no cost and the treated water will be used in the milling process instead of fresh water.
This will preserve the aquifers and 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 31 FRESNILLO PLC reduce costs.
An investment of US$4.3 million was approved, with a completion date scheduled for the third quarter of 2009.
At Cinega, a project was implemented to recover treated water from the encampment.
Energy consumption: Total consumption of electricity and other energy at the Fresnillo Group in 2008 was 2.6 million Gigajoules GJ.
Although this represents a 24% increase with respect to the prior year, it reflects greater production at the mining units.
Energy consumption per tonne of production increased from 0.152 GJ per tonne to 0.157 GJ per tonne.
To optimize energy consumption, we implemented demand control systems that shut off non-critical equipment during peak hours.

For example, at Herradura, rather than utilise diesel in the preparation of explosives, we recycle 90% of the lubricants from heavy equipment.
Waste that cannot be reused internally is sold for recycling.
Campaigns to promote recycling of materials such as plastic PET containers and cardboard take place within the Groups operations.
Fresnillo and Cinega have tailing dam management systems that ensure their physical stability and restoration plans.
At Cinega, Tailings Dam 2 was put into operation in 2008, which will have a useful life of 9 years and was recognized by environmental authorities as an exemplary model of construction and management.
Fresnillo Group tailings dams comply with the Mexican Official Norm to build, operate and close of tailings dams.
Atmospheric Emissions: Atmospheric emissions are caused by combustion from the Groups equipment and dust.
In order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from combustion, all operating and transport equipment is periodically inspected for preventive and corrective maintenance.
At Cinega and Fresnillo, minerals are wet milled in SAG mills and at Herradura the critical sections of compacted dirt roads are watered with effluents from the treatment plant.
Care is taken to ensure that the substances used or emitted in the Fresnillo Groups processes and not those that will deplete the ozone layer.

Plant nurseries have been established at Cinega and Fresnillo with capacity for 110,000 plants.
In 2008 a total of 76,637 trees were planted in the various units.
Herradura signed an agreement with the Secretary of the Environment and Natural Resources Secretara fide Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, or SEMARNAT and the State of Sonora Commission on Ecology and Sustainable Development Comisin fide Ecologa y Desarrollo Sustentable del Estado fide Sonora, or CEDES for the preservation of the Sonoran pronghorn antelope to research and facilitate their reproduction and safe migration.
Fresnillo made progress with the planting of two hectares of mesquite and four hectares of wild prickly pear nopal under an agreement with the National Research Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Instituto Nacional fide Investigaciones Forestales, Agrcolas y Pecuarias, or INIFAP.
Cinega concluded Phase II of its Sustainable Forest project.
Fire prevention and control: The Fire Prevention and Control Programme in Cinega uses specialised instructors.
During the year, 35 people were trained.
The result of this training is reflected in the reduction from 30 fires that occurred in the two-year period 2005-2006 to only seven in 2007-2008.
Use of Cyanide: The Fresnillo Group adheres to the Code of the International Cyanide Management Institute.
Both Herradura and Cinega are seeking certification in accordance with that Code.
Herradura will obtain certification during 2009 and the certification process has now commenced at Cinega.

The Fresnillo Group therefore engages in a number of different projects with the local communities around our three operating mines.
Each of the operations has an established development plan that is designed to improve the quality of life of its local communities whilst respecting ideology and culture.
The ongoing community initiatives undertaken by the Fresnillo Group can broadly be split into two categories: education and health and wellbeing.
Direct investments in these programmes totalled US$688,000 in 2008, while Fresnillo Group employees voluntarily contributed a further MXN299,000 through a United Way campaign for projects of interest and benefit to these communities.
Education: Investment in education includes both infrastructure and programmes.
The key investment in educational infrastructure and equipment during the year was made in Fresnillo where support was provided for the remodelling of the Ortega Gonzlez Elementary School in the city of Fresnillo.

Another aspect affecting the cost per tonne was the price of diesel in Mexico, which the Mexican Oil Company PEMEX increased The increase in production costs at Fresnillo accounted for 28.3% steadily over the course of the year to gradually adjust prices to of the total increase in the Groups consolidated production costs.

To highlight the magnitude of these factors, consumption of electricity at Fresnillo represents 69.0% of total electricity consumed by the Fresnillo Group, while personnel, including contractors, unionised and administrative employees, account for 50% of the Groups total personnel.
Lastly, the 22% increase in metres of development activity, and the associated cost, was another important aspect impacting this mines 2008 production costs, however the increase of stopes is helping to control the grades to the mill.
Cost at Cinega, which accounted for 22.1% of the total increase in the Groups consolidated production costs, was affected mainly by an increase in contractors and higher consumption of operating materials, both of which are mainly related to development activities at the mine and to rock bolting and shotcreting to ensure the stability of the stopes for safety reasons.
In 2008, total metres developed increased by 34.0% from 8,334 metres in 2007 to 11,169 metres in 2008.
In addition, personnel costs were affected by higher premiums paid for medical insurance claims.
The 4.5% increase in ore milled also impacted production costs.
GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, before hedging losses for each mine, is a key indicator continuously monitored by management to measure the performance of each business unit and the Group as a whole.
Consolidated gross profit for 2008 remained stable when compared to the previous year thanks to solid results obtained at Fresnillo and the record profit achieved at Herradura up 30.2%, which reflected an increase in ore deposited and greater production: these gains fully offset the decline in Cinegas gross profit down 33.4%, which was mainly due to lower ore grades extracted.
In 2008, Fresnillo continued to be the largest contributor to consolidated gross profit, representing 69.4%, followed by Herradura and Cinega.

In 2008, EBITDA, which is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation less administrative and exploration expenses, achieved record levels, rising 21.7% year-on-year to US$337.4 million as a result of the slight increase in gross profit and lower administrative expenses.
This increased the EBITDA margin from 42.8% in 2007 to 46.8% in 2008.

2008 ANNUAL REPORT 47 FRESNILLO PLC While discovery of additional mineral potential is key to the Fresnillo Groups strategy, minerals exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently unsuccessful.
Once mineralisation is discovered, it may take a number of years to complete the geological surveys to assess whether production is possible and, even if production is possible, the economic feasibility of production may change during that time.
Substantial capital expenditure is required to identify and delineate ore reserves through geological surveying and trenching and drilling, to determine metallurgical processes to extract the metals from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.
There can be no assurance that the Fresnillo Group will be able to identify future reserves or continue to extend the mine life of its existing operations.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY RISKS o Employee Relations The Fresnillo Groups business depends in significant part upon the contributions of a number of the Fresnillo Groups key senior management and personnel, in particular its senior management team and its highly skilled team of engineers and geologists.
There can be no certainty that the services of its key personnel will continue to be available to the Fresnillo Group.
In Mexico, where the Fresnillo Groups operations and development projects and exploration prospects are located, it may be difficult for the Fresnillo Group to hire sufficiently skilled and qualified people or to obtain all of the necessary expertise locally or at reasonable rates due to the shortage of appropriately qualified individuals.
The retention of senior management, geologists and engineers is being monitored by the Remuneration Committee on the advice of the Chief Executive Officer.
Although management believes its labour relations, with both employees and contractors, are good, there can be no assurance that a work slowdown, a work stoppage or strike will not occur at any of the Fresnillo Groups operating units or development projects or exploration prospects.
There have been a number of instances in recent years of mining companies facing industrial action and work stoppages at their Latin American operations which, in certain instances, have led to the operations being shut down.
Furthermore, under Mexican law, it is permissible for employees to engage in industrial action i. e. work stoppages in sympathy with unionised employees of other companies who are engaged in a dispute, despite the absence of any dispute with their own employer.
Work slowdowns, stoppages, disputes with employee unions or other labour-related developments or disputes could result in a decrease in the Fresnillo Groups production levels and adverse publicity.
o Environmental Mining activities are generally subject to environmental hazards as a result of the processes and chemicals used in the extraction and production methods.
In particular, the Fresnillo Group employs cyanide at Herradura and Cinega and the transportation of lead and zinc concentrates gives rise to the risk of spillage in areas where there could be damage or harm caused to the environment or to the public.
