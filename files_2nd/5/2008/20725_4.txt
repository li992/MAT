This overall return masks periods of extreme volatility during the year and diverging returns from global equity markets.
Our best absolute returns were in our Asia Pacific and North American portfolios.
Our North American investments, driven by strong sector and stock selection, delivered an outstanding relative return of 8.5% in the year, rising by 5.9% against a fall of 2.4% in the benchmark index.
In the Asia Pacific region, although we made a positive absolute return of 6.4%, we underperformed the regional market index due to our over-cautious stance in strongly rising markets through most of the year.
In addition our strong relative performance in our core UK Large Cap portfolio was very encouraging.
