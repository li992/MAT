It is too early to assess any particular outcome of these discussions.
It was recently found by the World Trade Organisation that the US legislative position with respect to Internet Gambling violates US trade commitments.
Following this decision, the USA is seeking to withdraw its trade commitment in the sphere of gambling: while several trade partners required compensation from the US following this withdrawal, none of the agreements reached, so far, between the USA and trade partners, have had an impact on the online gambling market.
Antigua did not reach an agreement with the USA, and applied to the WTO to arbitrate a settlement between it and the USA, in connection with the withdrawal of the USA commitment.
There are still ongoing negotiations between the US and Antigua in this respect.
In December 2007, the Remote Gaming Association a trade body representing several online gaming operators, of which the Group is a member filed a complaint with the European Union against the USA in connection with the breach of its trade commitments.
Following this complaint, the European Commission decided to open an investigation into whether the United States is in breach of its WTO obligations in the sphere of gambling in relation to the period prior to the withdrawal of its commitment.
The investigation is expected to conclude during the first few months of 2009, at which date the Commission will present its findings, which could lead to the initiation of WTO proceedings.
The Board continues to monitor these developments closely, and is alert to changes as they may occur in areas where the Group operates.
