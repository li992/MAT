a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2 0 0 8 Business Review Chief Executives Review In spite of the global economic downturn occurring in the later months of 2008, Hunting PLC is delighted to report excellent results for the year with a number of our operating facilities reporting record earnings.
Further, management was able to conclude the sale of Gibson Energy on 12 December 2008, during a period of severe credit issues.
This sale has enabled the Company to enter the new-year with no debt, a strong cash balance of 372.3m and the opportunity to capitalise on acquisitions having lower valuations than the recent past.
Accordingly, your Company is in an admirable position to weather the short term of reduced energy demand and lower commodity prices.
The oil and gas industry experienced historical highs and lows throughout the year including oil at US$147.27 per barrel on 11 July and natural gas averaging US$13.06 mcf for the month of June, then ending the year at US$44.60 per barrel and US$5.99 mcf respectively.
In addition, the second half of the year saw two major hurricanes wreak havoc on the Gulf of Mexico operations resulting in a loss of oil and gas production for over a month.
In February 2008, the Canadian rig count reached a high of 647.
In the US, the rig count high point was attained in September at 2,031, as did the international rig count of 1,108.
By year end, the US had fallen 15%, Canada 44% and International 2%.
It is important to note, most of the North American rig decline is attributable to medium and shallow gas drilling to which the Company does not provide significant products and services.
Profits before tax from continuing operations before exceptional items grew 25% year-on-year on 10% annual revenue growth reflecting margin improvement from price increases, equipment utilisation and manpower efficiencies.
Return on gross capital employed was 37%.
Business Development Capital expenditure for continuing operations reduced to 35.0m 2007 38.3m of which 10.6m 2007 14.1m was new business development and 24.4m 2007 24.2m replacement capital.
Hunting Energy Services invested 34.3m 2007 36.7m in capital expenditures during 2008 of which 8.8m 2007 7.0m was for exploration and production expenditure.
The balance of 25.5m included expenditure of 2.9m for additional facilities in Monterrey, Mexico and Houston, Texas.
A further 22.6m was for new rental tools or equipment as well as new machinery.
Health, Safety and the Environment Hunting Energy Services US manufacturing operations incurred a total of 10 recordable incidents in 2008.
Approximately 50% of the incidents were inexperienced workers with less than one years employment.
Huntings incident rate of 2.7% remains far below the Bureau of Labor Statistics industry average of 7.5%.
Our European facilities accident statistics were again below the level of the industry average in engineering and manufacturing.
The company received its second British Safety Council Sword of Honour.
It is rare to win this accolade once only 40 are awarded worldwide each year but winning it twice is testament to the companys rigorous health and safety practices.
To receive a Sword, companies have to be able to demonstrate their ability to manage health and safety risks via a proven culture of aiming for best practice, which is promoted through an entire organisation.
No environmental issues occurred in the year and all of Hunting Energy Services primary manufacturing facilities are ISO 14001 Environmental Management System certified.
Our goals remain no accidents, no harm to people and no damage to the environment.
Outlook With a declining rig count, primarily in North America, the oil and gas service industry will experience a decline in revenue and profits specifically in the medium and shallow oil and gas well drilling.
Deep 4 a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2008 water activity, high temperature high pressure wells, national oil company projects and well intervention activity will be impacted but not to the same degree.
The Companys plan for 2009 is to: Contain and reduce costs Continue new product development Replace existing facilities with more efficient plants to prepare for the eventual upturn Acquire companies that complement and strengthen existing operations and products Improve further its Health, Safety and Environmental record The Company will adjust to the short term economic pressures without losing sight of the eventual recovery later on.
We remain confident that when the global economies recover, demand will rebound strongly, driven largely by the growth economies which were so pervasive during the oil price rise, namely China and India.
Our operating and growth strategy is to expand our proprietary technology, geographic footprint, market share strength and asset utilisation.
Operating Review The Companys technology and capacity investments will further its earnings growth as demand for oil and gas continues to grow in the future.
Huntings five year compounded growth rate of 52% is exceptional and Huntings 2,077 dedicated employees will continue to deliver excellent value to its shareholders.
Hunting Energy Services Hunting Energy Services recorded a profit from operations before exceptional items of 52.7m versus 49.3m in 2007, a 7% increase.
At the end of the year, there were 1,475 2007 1,476 employees under four business platforms: Well Construction, Well Completion, Exploration & Production and Hunting Energy France.
The Well Construction platform provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build out.
Products and services in oil and gas activity are focused on well depths greater than 10,000 feet and most often in high temperature, high pressure environments.
Technology is the key asset to the products within this division, including proprietary connections for oil country tubular goods and accessories, proprietary mud motors and non-magnetic drill collars and shock tools.
The trenchless business focuses on supplying drill rods and ancillary tools to manufacturers and dealers for underground utility installations.
For North America, this application is expected to grow from the various stimulus spending proposals by the US government.
The Well Completion platform provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
This includes production tubing, accessories, couplings, blast joints, pup joints and numerous other components, all requiring Huntings proprietary connections.
Major oil and gas operators as well as major OEM service companies are the primary customer base.
This division also provides wireline and slickline tools for testing, cleaning and inspecting of the oil and gas well that has been on production for some time.
The products and services in this division will be utilised throughout the life of an oil and gas well and provide numerous opportunities for repeat activity.
Patented products are the clam blow-out preventer for wireline applications as well as the variball roller system.
Given the growth and successful application of various products within this Group, financial reporting will be segregated for 2009.
All products are processed and or manufactured at Hunting Energys 17 facilities located throughout the world.
Two additional facilities will be added in 2009, one in Mexico and one in Indonesia.
Exploration and Production includes the Groups oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
The Group takes minority non-operating equity holdings and currently participates in over 80 oil and gas production facilities.
The first half of 2008 saw record high prices for oil and natural gas, and the second half of the year experienced greatly diminished prices compounded by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike which struck the Gulf Coast.
As a result, the E&P Division showed reduced production year on year, but full year revenues were at a record level.
On a Net Equivalent Barrel NEB basis, production was down 10% compared to 2007 due to wells being shut-in as a result of damage from the hurricanes.
Full year output of 409,000 NEB combined with high average prices resulted in increased revenues, with profit from operations at 135% of the previous year.
The division participated in the drilling of 17 wells with 9 successes 5 gas, 3 oil and gas, and 1 oil.
Year end reserves of oil and gas on an SEC basis were 1.8m NEB compared with 2.2m NEB at the end of 2007.

Hunting Energy France comprises the Groups French based businesses which provide petrochemical equipment to the French and international energy and associated industries.
The 2008 result was a 23% decline in profit from operations over 2007.
This reduction was a function of postponement of key components to customers following the credit crunch of 2008.
However, its high specification forge and cast valve division more than doubled its profit from operations year-on-year.
Hunting Specialized Products is a US based business supplying products and services for the trenchless rehabilitation of deteriorated pipelines.
At the end of 2008 the Specialized Products operations were discontinued and in January 2009 the sale of substantially all the assets of Specialized Products was agreed.

Spot and forward foreign exchange contracts are used to cover the net exposure of purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.
Prior to the receipt of Gibson Energy sale proceeds and the elimination of debt, interest expense was hedged using interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps.
Surplus cash is invested in AAA Money Market Funds and in bank deposits.
Critical Accounting Policies The Group accounts are prepared using accounting policies in accordance with IFRS.
The principal accounting polices are set out on pages 39 to 46.
The preparation of these accounts require the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Directors estimates are based on historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that they believe are reasonable and appropriate.
Employee Benefits The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Actuarial the UK, which was closed to new entrants with effect from assumptions 2008 2007 31 December 2002, as well as a number of defined contribution schemes within the Group.
