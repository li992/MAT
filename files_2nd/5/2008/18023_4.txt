REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The groups results and financial position for the year ended 31 December 2008 are set out in full in the consolidated income statement, the group and company balance sheets, the statements of recognised income and expense, the statements of cash flows and the related notes.
The Groups loss before taxation was 1,551.1 million 2007 loss 166.8 million.
Net assets attributable to equity shareholders at 31 December 2008 were 279 million 2007 1,839 million.
The result for the year should be considered in the context of the markedly more adverse UK financial and economic background.
The groups results are dominated by the 1,370 million deficit on revaluation of investment properties, an overall reduction of approximately 25 per cent.
This deficit has driven the fall in the groups net assets attributable to equity shareholders from 1,839 million to 279 million.
The result for the year has additionally been adversely affected by a 221.6 million charge arising from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
This is a non-cash charge relating to the groups interest rate swap contracts.
The charge was caused by the reduction in UK interest rates that occurred in 2008, in particular during the last quarter of the year.
Net rental income, a key measure of operational performance fell from 239.6 million in 2007 to 222.8 million in 2008, a reduction of 16.8 million 7.0 per cent.
The most significant factor in the reduction was the higher level of bad and doubtful debts and lease incentive write-offs, as illustrated below, caused by the increased level of tenants entering administration.

However the final quarter in particular saw a number of additional retailer failures.
The resultant reduced occupancy level, adjusted for units affected by administrations still to be re-let, was 94.0 per cent at 31 December 2008.
Good progress has been made on re-letting in the first quarter of 2009 with the occupancy level, adjusted for units affected by administrations still to be re-let, increasing to 95.1 per cent at 31 March 2009.
The continued health of our retail tenant base is of overriding importance to the groups long term success.
We are dealing proactively with tenant issues which have emerged in 2008 and will undoubtedly continue to be a factor in 2009 given difficult trading conditions for retailers.
The groups retailer tenant mix is diverse, with no significant concentration exposure to one major tenant.
The quality of the tenant roll can be illustrated by the fact that national or international multiple retailers represent over 90 per cent of the rent roll.
The winning retailer formats in 2008 were value brands and trusted names with a strong complementary on-line presence.
2008 saw the disappearance of several high street names such as Woolworths, The Pier and Zavvi together with a number of smaller and independent retailers.
The most significant rent review activity in 2009, is the second cycle of rent reviews scheduled for Braehead, Glasgow in September 2009. Notable active management initiatives in 2008 have been as follows: - Upgrade of the leisure and dining facilities in the Yellow and Blue Quadrants at MetroCentre, Gateshead - A new 36,000 sq.
ft. flagship store for New Look at Braehead, Renfrew, Glasgow and intended relocation of Sainsburys to the adjoining retail park - Remodelling of Bromley High Street units to provide 50,600 sq.
ft. of new space at The Glades.
The groups largest development project, St Davids, Cardiff, a joint venture with Land Securities, is on programme to complete in Autumn this year.
The project will extend the existing St. Davids centre by 967,500 sq.
Overall around 125 new shops and restaurants are being developed which, when added to the existing centre, will enlarge St. Davids into one of the UKs largest city centre retail schemes.
We are confident of the future prospects for the enlarged St. Davids centre with the existing centre already attracting 22 million customer visits each year.
th Cardiff is expected to rise to 8 place in the UK retail rankings on completion of the St. Davids development which has already attracted several new retailers to Wales.
