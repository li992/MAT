The increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and or loss of market share.
We may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors.
Within each of our markets, we face competition from public and private companies, as well as our customers in-house design efforts.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we do.
We may fail to compete successfully, which would adversely affect our business and financial performance.
We rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue We work with a broad range of customers across our product portfolio but a number of large customers represent a material portion of our total revenue.
If we fail to meet schedules for the launch of new products or we fail to sell our products to one or more of these customers in any particular period, our revenue could decline materially and our operating results may be affected.
We are also subject to the risk that one or more of these major customers are themselves adversely affected, which could result in a decline in our sales and financial performance.
