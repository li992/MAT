1 This information was not collected for Continental Europe before 01.01.09 Our stay close to our customers principle helps us develop an 66 65 64 64 in depth understanding of our customers real business needs.
This is demonstrated by our strong retention rates on lease expiry or potential break of 65 per cent and 64 per cent respectively by rental income in 2008 which is almost identical to the strong performance delivered in 2007.
This also compares very favourably with the IPD Strutt and Parker 2007 Industrial Lease Renewal benchmark rate of just 24 per cent the 2008 study has not yet been released.
As at UK Leases renewed by 31 December 2008 excluding joint ventures, our weighted rental value average lease length to expiry was 8.3 years 6.0 years with UK Breaks unexercised break options.
The outperformance on lease renewals relative by rental value to the IPD All Industrial benchmark, together with contracted 2007 2008 rental streams from pre-lets and the consistently high customer satisfaction levels, further reinforces our belief in the resilience of our future income streams.
Consistently high levels of customer satisfaction also translate % Growth over ERV in the UK into tangible results on rental growth on lease rent reviews 3.6 and lease renewals.
For example, in the UK in 2008, rent reviews and lease renewals were agreed at 3.6 per cent and 3.0 0.6 per cent above ERV respectively.
