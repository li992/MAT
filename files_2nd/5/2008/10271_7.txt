Cash flow measures In presenting and discussing the Group reported results, free cash flow is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with IFRS.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: free cash flow allows the Company and external parties to evaluate the Groups liquidity and the cash generated by the Groups operations.
Free cash flow does not include items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items that are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions or financing activities.
In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which the Group has an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the balance sheet or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although the Groups measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community.
