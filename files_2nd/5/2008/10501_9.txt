The charge for share options is the average expected charge over the vesting period of options still to be exercised following the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007.
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share figures which have been included are based on an adjusted net profit figure assuming that the number of ordinary shares and options in issue at 31 December 2007 had been in issue since 1 January 2007.
Options and shares issued since 28 December 2007 have been included in the adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation on a pro rata basis.
The adjusted earnings per share calculations assume a 30% tax rate for 2007 and a 28.5% rate for 2008.

Directors and certain senior managers profit share, discretionary bonus and employers national insurance contributions have been added back in calculating adjusted EBITDA in 2007 to reflect the fact that following the listing on 31 July 2007 these elements of compensation no longer apply to these individuals.
No adjustments are required for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Share option charges relating to options granted to Directors, senior managers and other employees of the Group before the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007 have been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA.

The internet business generated 172.5m of revenue representing an increase of 13% on 2007.
Revenue growth was impacted by the credit crunch which reduced the supply of credit to the market in general and reduced revenue year on year in the Money vertical.
Revenue in all of the other internet verticals grew compared with last year.
The intermediary business generated 6.3m of revenue representing a decrease of 41% on 2007.
The intermediary business also suffered as a result of lower lending volumes in the UK mortgage market.
The Group is currently considering a number of options in respect of the intermediary business.
Gross margins fell slightly compared with last year from 67% to 65%.
Gross margins benefited from a favourable sales mix, as the lower margin intermediary business contributed 3% of Group revenue in 2008 compared to 7% in 2007.
The Group was able to maintain its direct-to-site revenue as a proportion of total revenue over the period.
During the third quarter customer acquisition costs increased substantially in the Insurance vertical which reduced gross margins overall.
However these returned to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
The adjusted cost base before depreciation increased by 23% from 55.7m to 68.4m.
Distribution costs, which consist primarily of TV advertising, increased by 10% on last year to 21.6m.
Although the Group advertised across all of its verticals, more of the spend was targeted at insurance, this being both the most competitive market segment and the fastest growing in absolute terms.
The Group has further strengthened its online brand recognition which increased to 80% in 2008 as measured by a YouGov survey regularly commissioned by the Group.
Adjusted administrative expenses increased by 34% over the period.
Total adjusted staff costs increased by 7.6m to 30.4m in 2008.
The Group reduced its permanent headcount over the period, and particularly the second half of the year, from 647 to 555 reflecting declining revenue in the Money vertical and a downsizing of the workforce in the intermediary business.
The Group invested approximately 3.3m in third party resource in the Money vertical to transfer its technology from ASP to ASP.
net to ensure its core technology remained current and supported by Microsoft and to improve the look, feel and functionality of a number of the key channels.
This work was completed in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Other administrative costs, including irrecoverable VAT, increased by 3.0m accentuated by a change in sales mix towards sales which were exempt from VAT, notably insurance, together with the introduction of a second data centre to provide business continuity management capability in the first quarter of 2008.
The Group reshaped its operations in Germany and invested 2.2m in 2008 against 0.7m in 2007, launching operations in the Money vertical in January 2009 through the website www.
Adjusted EBITDA margins fell from 32% in 2007 to 27% in 2008.

The internet business operates across four vertical markets.
These are discussed below: Revenue 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 I 000 % 000 % 1 Money 68,265 38 75,996 46 1 Insurance 77,739 44 56,436 35 Travel 19,089 11 15,004 9 Home Services 7,416 4 4,540 3 Other UK 23 0 87 0 Total internet UK 172,532 97 152,063 93 Germany 0 157 0 Total internet 172,532 97 152,220 93 Intermediary 6,268 3 10,662 7 Total 178,800 100 162,882 100 1 During 2008 the Group undertook an exercise based on additional information made available to it to reallocate impression-based advertising revenue between the Money and Insurance verticals in 2007 consistent with the results presented for the year ended 2008.
As a result of this exercise 2.0m previously shown in the Money vertical in other revenue has been reallocated and recorded in other revenue in the Insurance vertical in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
Internet business The UK internet business accounted for 97% of Group revenue in the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Directors use key performance indicators KPIs to assess the performance of the internet business against the Groups strategy.
These are reviewed on a regular basis.
The principal KPIs for the internet business are as follows: Visitors The Group measures the number of visitors to its website as the number of unique visitors per day per channel, measured on a cumulative basis using cookie-based tracking methodologies.
Transactions The Group measures transactions at the point in time that the customer leaves the Groups website having clicked through to a third party website, or in some cases having completed an application form hosted on the Groups website.
Revenue per visitor RPV The Group measures the total revenue including click and other internet revenue divided by the number of visitors defined above.
Revenue per transaction RPT The Group measures the click based revenue divided by the total number of transactions defined above.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Business Review Financial and Business Review continued Revenue 2008 Visitors 2008 68.3m down 10% 35.1m up 27% 2007 2008 2007 2008 76.0m 68.3m 27.7m 35.1m The relative performance of each of the internet verticals is discussed below: Money The Money vertical currently offers customers the ability to search for, and compare, products for, amongst other things, business finance, credit cards, current accounts, mortgages, loans, debt solutions and savings accounts.
It also includes elements of the Groups lead business PAA and advisory business MCAT together with advertising revenue that derives from financial products.
The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 to the end of June 2008 following a release made in respect of the anti-virus software AVG.
In assessing whether a webpage was safe it followed every link or url displayed on an email or webpage to the destination website.
This meant that many web based businesses including the Group recorded visitors from users of the AVG software who themselves did not technically visit the website.
The 2008 visitor count has been adjusted for the estimated impact of this.
AVG released a further update to its anti-virus software in early July 2008.
During 2008 the Group undertook an exercise based on additional information made available to it to reallocate impression-based advertising revenue between the Money and Insurance verticals in 2007 consistent with the results presented for the year ended 2008.
Total revenue in the Money vertical decreased by 10% from 76.0m to 68.3m and click based revenue by 6% from 60.8m to 57.4m.
Visitor growth of 27% has been offset by a decline in RPV of 29% in the year.
The Group noted during the year, and in particular the second half of the year, that lenders significantly tightened their lending criteria.
Indeed a number of providers withdrew from the market completely as the credit crunch began to deepen, reducing the supply of available credit.
This impacted all of the credit based channels but most markedly the secured loans channel, which also suffered as home equity declined with the falling housing market.
First Plus, a subsidiary of Barclays, which was the Groups largest single provider by revenue in 2007 closed to new business in August 2008.
First Plus represented approximately 10% of Group revenue at the time it closed to new business.
Revenue generated from savings grew significantly year on year as customers sought both to maximise their returns on investments and reduce exposure to individual banks amidst the uncertainty that arose following the collapse of a number of financial institutions.
The overall impact of the change in sales mix away from debt products towards savings products, together with the reduced availability of credit, was to reduce the average RPT and consequently RPV.
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of leads through PAA, commission based sales through MCAT for mortgages and loans, and advertising revenue, declined 28% over the year.
Leads and commission based revenue fell in line with the declining credit markets.
Revenue from advertising declined relative to 2007 following a deliberate reduction in the space made available for impression-based advertising, aimed at improving the user experience on the website.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Revenue 2008 Visitors 2008 77.7m up 38% 24.8m up 20% 2007 2008 2007 2008 56.4m 77.7m 20.7m 24.8m Insurance The Insurance vertical currently offers customers the ability to search for, and compare, insurance products for, amongst other things, breakdown, dental, home, life, medical, mortgage payment protection, motor, payment protection, pet and travel insurance.
It also includes elements of the Groups lead business PAA and advisory business MCAT together with advertising revenue that derives from insurance products.
As noted in the prospectus issued in connection with the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007, the Groups visitor numbers during the period between January and May 2007 were understated due to certain visitors not being assigned a unique global user ID.
The issue was resolved in May 2007 and has not impacted visitor numbers in the Insurance vertical after May 2007.
The Group has not been able to quantify the exact extent of the understatement.
Total revenue in the Insurance vertical grew by 38% from 56.4m to 77.7m and click based revenue by 43% to 66.6m.
RPT increased by 28% to 4.49 as a number of contracts with providers were migrated from a pure cost per click to a cost per action arrangement over the course of 2007 and 2008.
This has allowed the Group to benefit from improved conversion rates as a result of better search functionality on its website and improvements made to provider websites.
A number of significant enhancements to the website were made in the fourth quarter including the launch of the Policy Wizard in motor insurance, which enables customers in real time to make changes to policy details and compare the impact this has on pricing across multiple providers simultaneously.
It is anticipated that the Group will continue to benefit from these improvements in 2009.
Other revenue increased by 14% to 11.1m over the period.
The insurance comparison market remains the most competitive that the Group currently operates in.
Advertising and in particular television advertising spend in the insurance comparison market increased significantly over the period.
In response to this, the Group increased its spend in the Insurance vertical to protect its market share whilst only marginally increasing Group television advertising spend over the prior year.
Customer acquisition costs from search engines also increased significantly in the third quarter which is traditionally a competitive period for the motor insurance industry.
Customer acquisition costs returned to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
The increased marketing expenditure in 2008 lowered the relative contribution in the Insurance vertical compared to 2007.

Total revenue in the Travel vertical grew by 27% from 15.0m to 19.1m and click based revenue by 29% from 13.1m to 16.8m.
Visitors grew by 32% over the period whilst RPV fell by 4%.
Revenue from the flights channel was impacted in the year by the continued popularity of the low cost branded carriers, a number of which do not pay commissions to the Group.
Revenue growth slowed in the second half of the year as customers began to reduce their levels of discretionary spend.
This impacted the flights and hotels channels in particular.
Package holidays and car hire revenue continued to grow strongly throughout the period.
Other revenue grew 18% to 2.3m driven by increased visitor numbers.
The Group ceased television advertising activity in the Travel vertical for the majority of the second half of the year in response to the weakening market conditions and only recommenced activity in the post Christmas period.
Full year television advertising expenditure in the Travel vertical was 2.2m lower than the previous year.

Total revenue in the Home Services vertical grew by 63% from 4.5m to 7.4m.
Revenue grew particularly strongly in the utilities channel aided by the rising prices in the electricity and gas markets.
The Groups shopping channel launched in September 2008 and this helped drive the significant year on year increase in visitors of 97% to the Home Services vertical.
RPV and RPT are significantly lower in shopping than the other channels in the Home Services vertical and the change in sales mix has resulted in a fall in both KPIs compared with 2007.
Germany During 2008 the Group refocused its operations in Germany.
Launched in October 2007, the German operation originally concentrated on motor insurance using a third party provided solution to test the market.
Whilst the initial reaction from customers was broadly positive, the third party technology was not sufficiently flexible to allow rapid development, particularly to the front end customer offering, and was therefore discontinued.
The Group invested in its own proprietary technology in the second half of 2008 developing a loans channel which commenced trading in January 2009 at www.
com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, is party to contracts and other arrangements which the Directors judge are essential to the Groups business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent upon its ability to attract customers to its website either directly or through paid search or portal partners, and revenue generated from commercial arrangements with its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract customers to its website directly.
The Group incurred costs of 19.0m relating to television advertising in 2008.
The Group has contracts with a number of media agencies to acquire advertising inventory from commercial television companies.
The Group typically has a commitment of between 6 and 10 weeks expenditure at any one time.
Television costs represent 88% of distribution costs.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Business Review Financial and Business Review continued The Group uses search engines to acquire traffic via paid search.
The Group spent 38.3m on paid search in 2008.
Although there are a number of search engines that operate in the UK, Google is the dominant search engine and accounts for the majority of the Groups spend in this area.
The Group has had contracts with a number of media agencies in the year to manage search engine marketing.
The Group has no forward commitment to search engines and manages its spend on a real time basis.
The Group does not consider any of the contracts it has with portal partners to be material.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers which are based either on a cost per click basis or a cost per action basis or a hybrid of the two.
It also has a number of commercial arrangements based on the number of page impressions served in the case of banner advertising.
Following the cessation of trade with First Plus in August 2008 the Group does not consider it has any material contracts with providers in any one channel.
The Group does however frequently deal with providers across a range of different channels managed under different contracts, often to different parts of the same organisation, and occasionally through third party media agencies.
At this consolidated channel level the largest individual provider represented approximately 4% of Group internet revenue.
During 2008 there was consolidation in the financial marketplace with the number of independent organisations reduced.
The brands under these group umbrellas are usually run independently and the marketing budget managed separately.
The largest group represented approximately 9% of Group internet revenue.
com Financial Group Limited On 22 June 2007 the Company, at that time controlled by Simon Nixon, purchased the entire issued share capital of Moneysupermarket.
This was funded partly by a cash payment of 162m to one of the founder shareholders, Duncan Cameron, and partly by a share-for-share exchange.
This transaction has had a number of impacts on the Financial Statements and will also impact on subsequent periods.
Goodwill and intangibles The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited gave rise to 125.0m of goodwill and the recognition of 207.2m of intangible assets.
Individual intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives which are in the range of 3-10 years with a charge of 25.2m per annum in the first three years in the full year accounts.
A charge of 13.3m has been included in the accounts covering the period from 22 June 2007 to 31 December 2007, and a full years charge of 25.2m has been included in the Adjusted Income Statement for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 and the Statutory Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2008.
On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
For the current period, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use, and this was calculated by reference to the cash flows taken from the Groups forecasts, discounted to their present value by a discount rate reflecting not only the time value of money but also additional risks specific to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and the limited visibility inherent in the current economic environment.
As a result of this exercise, the Group concluded that it should recognise an impairment charge against goodwill of 70.0m in 2008, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill balance to 55.0m.
No impairment was deemed necessary against the other intangible assets.
Further details of this exercise and the resulting impairment are provided in note 12 to the Financial Statements on pages 67 and 68.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Treasury and funding The Company raised 180m from the proceeds of the listing on 31 July 2007.
Approximately 178m of the proceeds raised were used to fund the costs of the acquisition by the Company of Duncan Camerons shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited including all related costs and expenses of the acquisition, the raising and draw down of debt finance and the costs of the listing.
The Company acquired 14.3m of cash at the acquisition and has continued to generate cash from operations.
The Company had cash balances of 73.5m at 31 December 2008 and no debt.
The Company has invested its cash over the period predominantly in instant access cash deposits and short-term deposits of no more than three months, and in light of the events which occurred in the banking sector over the past year, now holds balances with a larger range of different UK and Irish institutions.
As such the interest earned has closely followed movements in the Bank of England base rate.
Dividend The Directors have adopted a progressive approach to dividend payout and initially had a dividend payout of approximately one third of adjusted net profit each year, with one third of the annual amount payable as an interim dividend and two thirds as a final dividend.
The Group announced on 27 August 2008 following a review of its cash position that it would increase its annual dividend payout to approximately one half of adjusted net profit, to be paid on a broadly similar basis.
The Board is recommending a final dividend, subject to shareholder approval, consistent with the policy above in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008.
This equates to 11.1m and represents 2.2p per ordinary share.
Together with the interim dividend of 1.3p per ordinary share paid on 17 October 2008, this gives a total dividend for the year of 3.5p per ordinary share.
The total cost of the dividend for the financial year will be 17.6m.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 25 March 2009, with a record date of 27 March 2009 and a payment date of 1 May 2009.
Shareholders have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the Company through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Tax The Group tax charge of 8.1m in the Group Income Statement on page 54 represents an effective tax rate of 16%.
This is significantly below the prevailing rate for the period of 28.5%.
The current year has been impacted by a number of items.
The Group has disallowable expenses in the year of 76.0m including 70.0m of goodwill impairment, and a further 1.2m of losses have arisen in the year relating to the German operation, for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
The Group has also recognised a deferred tax charge of 2.5m representing the revaluation of the deferred tax asset held in relation to share options.
In future, the Group expects the underlying effective rate of tax to revert to close to the standard UK corporation tax rate of 28%.
Loss per ordinary share Basic statutory loss per ordinary share for the period to 31 December 2008 was 11.8p 2007: earnings per share of 3.0p.
Details can be found in note 9 to the Financial Statements on page 66.
Adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share decreased from 7.5p to 6.9p per share.
The adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on adjusted EBITDA after deducting depreciation and adding estimated interest income for each period to calculate an adjusted profit before tax.
A tax rate of 28.5% 2007: 30% has been applied to calculate adjusted profit after tax.
