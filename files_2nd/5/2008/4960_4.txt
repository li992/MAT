Drax Group plc 12 Annual report and accounts 2008 Business review Business and financial review The Groups principal performance indicators are highlighted on page one of this report.
Solid operating performance, an improvement in our average achieved electricity price and an increase in net power sold were offset by an increase in coal prices, the cost of CO2 emissions allowances and operating expenses, resulting in EBITDA of 454 million compared to 506 million in 2007.
The Business and financial review includes further explanation and commentary in relation to our principal performance indicators and the results for the year.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 15 In considering mark to market movements, it is important to recognise that EBITDA is driven by our strategy to deliver market level or better dark green spreads, not by the absolute price of electricity at any given date.
After allowing for the unrealised gains on derivative contracts, operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 464 million compared to 471 million in 2007.
Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2008 were 22 million compared to 23 million in 2007, as a result of lower interest rates and debt levels.
The tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 110 million, compared to 96 million in 2007.
Tax for 2008 includes a one-time charge of 9 million to reect the estimated impact on deferred tax of the withdrawal of industrial buildings allowances introduced by the Finance Act 2008.

As a result of the above factors, profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 333 million compared to 353 million in 2007, and basic and diluted earnings per share were 98 pence compared to 99 pence in 2007.
Key factors affecting the business General commodity market conditions Commodity market conditions were generally favourable for Drax in the first half of the year.
During the third quarter, trading conditions continued to improve primarily as a consequence of low capacity reserve margins in the electricity market.
However, in the last quarter we saw dark green spreads narrow and significant falls in power, coal and CO2 emissions allowances prices.
These trends in forward power, coal and CO2 emissions allowances prices, are illustrated in the charts on pages 16 and 17, and described further in the following paragraphs.

Commodity market conditions through the Summer were such that it was profitable to generate these additional volumes, albeit at moderate margins.
Plant availability was approximately 86% for both years ended 31 December 2007 and 2008.
The planned outage rate achieved for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 8.9% compared to 8.1% in 2007.
Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our six units once every four years.
Consequently, there is an irregular pattern to planned outages and associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will each undergo a major planned outage.
Two major planned outages were completed in both 2007 and 2008.
The forced outage rate for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 5.8%, compared to 6.9% in 2007.
The Winter forced outage rate was 6.5% for the year ended 31 December 2008, compared to 4.2% in 2007.

This continues to demonstrate that the safety programmes implemented in the last few years are becoming well entrenched and are delivering sound performance.
Our safety record compares favourably with our sector peers and international benchmarks.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 21 Drax will manage and operate the biomass businesses, and will also be responsible for all biomass procurement and trading.
It is proposed that the plants will use Siemens turbine technology.
Current estimates of the total capital cost of this business are around 2 billion, including investments in ancillary biomass logistics and processing facilities.
Construction of the first plant is targeted to commence in late 2010, following execution of the construction and nancing contracts and agreed capital commitment, with the first plant expected to be operational in 2014.
We are now in the advanced feasibility stage of developing and planning but we will only commit to investment once it can be plainly demonstrated that we will secure attractive returns.
Whilst no commitments to construction contracts or nancing have been made to date, we expect to nalise these arrangements by the second half of 2010.
We expect to incur expenditure of around 20 million in 2009 in developing this business.
Since we made the announcement in October 2008, we have made good Biomass handling and processing progress.
We now have five site options Construction of the main biomass handling and under review.

We have also moved forward on the engineering design, with our strategic partner, Siemens Project Ventures.
We believe that the long-term investment case for this business remains strong, particularly in the light of the UKs need for reliable renewable generation capacity by 2020.
Straw pellet plant The straw pellet plant development at Goole, some three miles from Drax Power Station, is rapidly taking shape.
With commercial operation due to commence in the first half of 2009, the plant will produce 100,000 tonnes of straw pellets a year for co-firing alongside our coal.
