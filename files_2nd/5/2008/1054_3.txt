This was mainly due to lower by-products credits and to a lesser extent higher on-site and shipping costs, partly offset by lower tolling charges.
By-product credits decreased by 57.5 cents in 2008.
This was due to both lower molybdenum market prices including the impact of provisionally priced sales as explained above as well as the lower molybdenum volumes.
The increase in on-site and AMSAs operations, projects and principal exploration prospects shipping costs of 23.2 cents was largely in line with budget, reflecting the increased costs of electricity, shipping and steel during the year.
Tolling charges TOCOPILLA decreased by 12.6 cents per pound partly due to the more favourable annual treatment and refining charges CALAMA achieved in the negotiations with smelters in the 2008 calendar year, together with continued benefit from nil price participation first achieved in 2007 as a result of ANTOFAGASTA the brick system under which the annual terms agreed are often averaged over two years.

Following the completion of a feasibility study in 2007 and expenditures on early works, Los Pelambres approved a further upgrade of its plant capacity in July 2008 through additional infrastructure including a third SAG mill and sixth ball mill.
The repowering is within existing environmental permits and when completed is expected to increase production of payable copper by an annual average of 90,000 tonnes over the first 15 years from early 2010.

Excluding 78.6 66.1 impairment charges, this represented a decrease of 52.4 25.1%, reflecting the combination of lower realised copper prices and higher cash costs.

This included US$69.3 million related to pre-stripping 1.35 1.23 1.23 1.16 1.16 at the Tesoro North-East satellite deposit located 1.08 approximately one kilometre from the existing open pit and US$22.3 million related to expenditures required 04 05 06 07 08 09E to enable the processing of the Esperanza low-grade Plant throughput 000 tonnes per day of ore oxide ores through a run-of-mine operation.
These Copper grade per cent projects have a total estimated combined capital cost of approximately US$150 million with the remainder to be incurred in the first half of 2009.
As explained below, these projects mitigate the decline in grades that would otherwise occur from mining exclusively from the open pit and extend the mine life to 2020.
Outstanding corporate loans at El Tesoro of US$14.0 million at the beginning of 2008 were fully repaid in the first half of the year, with minor leasing obligations of US$0.4 million outstanding at the end of 2008.
For 2009, cathode production is expected to be approximately 95,000 tonnes as the processing of a greater volume of ore from the higher grade Tesoro North-East deposit and the dump-leaching of ore from the oxide cap at Esperanza, both from the second quarter of the year, are expected to offset lower production from the existing open-pit.
Average ore grades are expected to decrease to approximately Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 21 Business Review continued 1.08% with the inclusion of lower grade material Selected data for Michilla from Esperanza.
El Tesoro announced in January 2009 that it had taken 50.0 47.7 47.3 46.4 45.1 a number of steps to minimise costs to respond to the significant weakening in the copper market in the 38.0 second half of 2008: these include renegotiation of 191.1 sulphuric acid and other contracts where possible to 136.7 benefit from the weaker market as well as deferral of 143.5 126.4 waste removal not required for current production to 118.8 85.6 minimise the volume of material moved at the open pit.
The latter measure has resulted in a reduction in the workforce at El Tesoro of approximately 50 04 05 06 07 08 09E employees.
El Tesoro should also benefit from the Copper production 000 tonnes weaker Chilean peso and lower energy costs reflecting Cash costs US cents per pound recent falls in diesel and gas prices.
These factors should help offset the higher costs associated with the 16.1 15.5 15.2 run-of-mine operation, and cash costs at El Tesoro for 14.9 14.8 2009 are expected to average approximately 116 cents 11.7 per pound, a reduction of approximately 20%.
Capital expenditure in 2009 is estimated at approximately US$80 million, including approximately US$60 million 1.13 1.11 1.10 to complete the run-of-mine project.

As explained under Exploration Plant throughput 000 tonnes per day of ore below, the Group has an on-going exploration Copper grade per cent programme in the Sierra Gorda district to identify further oxide deposits that could in future years provide additional ore to the El Tesoro plant.
Michilla 74.2 per cent owned Cathode production at Michilla in the year reached 47,700 tonnes, 5.8% above 2007 production of 45,100 tonnes and 10.9% above the original forecast for the year of 43,000 tonnes through the combined effect of better throughput, ore grades and recoveries.
Ore throughput averaged 15,500 tonnes per day compared to 14,800 tonnes in 2007 when some disruption occurred as a result of the earthquake in northern Chile in November of that year.
Ore grades were 1.06% compared with 1.03% in 2007.
Cash costs for 2008 were 191.1 cents per pound, in line with the original forecast for the year but higher than the 143.5 cents per pound in 2007.

The rail businesses in Chile and Bolivia produced another strong operational performance, with combined volumes of 5.6 million tons transported compared with 5.0 million tons in 2007, which itself had been a record year.
This was driven by FCAB and Andino rail networks the continued ramp up of Apex Silvers San Cristbal mine in Bolivia which benefited both the Chilean and Bolivian rail networks and to a lesser extent the startup of Codelcos Gaby mine which contributed to rail tonnages in the second half of the year.
These helped offset minor variations from existing customers as a result of continuing production disruptions at mines in the early part of the year, and the loss of tonnages from some smaller contracts which ended in 2007.

A further prospect known as Mirador, located approximately 5 kilometres east of Tesoro North-East, was identified by the Groups exploration team during 2008.
A 17,000 metre drilling programme was carried out in the year at a cost of US$1.0 million, with initial indications suggesting potential for identifying additional oxide resource.
Further exploration is Sierra Gorda district planned for 2009 to establish the mineralisation of this prospect and to assess its potential.
With combined resources for Esperanza and El Tesoro of 1.5 billion tonnes and a mineral inventory for other prospects in the range of 2.2 to 3.4 billion tonnes, the Sierra Gorda district has good potential for Tesoro NE Llano Paleocanal consolidation of the Groups mining properties in the El Tesoro Mirador area and development as a single complex for oxide Esperanza and sulphide deposits.
Telgrafo Norte Telgrafo Sur Los Pelambres district During 2008, Los Pelambres completed the evaluation Caracoles of a two-year exploration programme in order to identify additional resources in the area around the existing open pit through a 44,300 metre drilling Centinela programme.
This resulted in an increase of the total mineral resource in the Los Pelambres area from Polo-Sur 2.9 million tonnes with an average copper grade of 0.61% to 4.9 billion tonnes with an average copper grade of 0.56%.
This includes 1.5 billion tonnes at Frontera, a newly discovered porphyry to the south-east of the existing pit and 0.4 billion tonnes identified by drilling the existing open pit resource to greater depth.
While the increase in mineral resource has no immediate impact on the existing mine plan Resource mineral Type of interest for Los Pelambres, it will present opportunities for inventory estimates longer-term planning either by providing additional 100 MT Cu Operation 100 400 MT Cu material in future years when grades at the existing Project under construction open pit decline, or by enabling Los Pelambres to 500 800 MT Cu Exploration consider possibilities for long-term future growth.
