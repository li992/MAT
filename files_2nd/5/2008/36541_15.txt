BUSINESS REVIEW REAL ESTATE STRATEGY There are three strands to our real estate strategy, which is aimed at maximising the total returns from the portfolio: the allocation of the portfolio between the markets and sectors in which we operate by appropriate investment and disposal decisions: the management of our investment properties so that they continue to be attractive to occupiers, enabling us to increase the Groups rental income and other revenues over time: and the generation of attractive income and capital returns through development.
More detail on our performance in these areas during 2008 is provided in this Business Review, together with information on the potential future growth in income and value in the portfolio.
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AND ALLOCATION We analyse in detail the markets in which we operate using both external and internal research.
We then base our decisions on overall portfolio allocation using this analysis.
As part of our annual business planning process, we review the current and projected performance of each of our properties and identify assets for disposal.
This active approach to managing the portfolio has seen 2 billion raised from disposals in the last five years, whilst 2.5 billion has been invested in acquisitions and new developments.
2 Hammersons retail portfolio provides 1.4 million m of space comprising 15 major shopping centres and 19 retail parks, principally in the UK and France.
Our office portfolio includes nine prime buildings, most 2 of which are located in and around the City of London and in central Paris, providing 255,000m of accommodation.
At the end of 2008, our property portfolio was valued at 6.5 billion with our investment and development portfolios valued at 6.1 billion and 0.4 billion respectively.
Joint ventures, including seven major shopping centres in the UK, accounted for 29% by value of the total portfolio.
Following the completion of the shopping centre developments at OParinor, Highcross, Cabot Circus and the sales of two London office buildings, the retail weighting of the portfolio increased from 72% at the end of 2007 to 76% at 31 December 2008.
The weighting of the UK portfolio decreased from 71% to 60% over the same period.
Both the sector and geographic weightings reflected the greater rate of decline in UK property values compared with those in France and the impact of exchange rate movements.
At constant exchange rates, the UK portfolio would have constituted around 66% of the total.
Hammersons strategy is to allocate the majority of the portfolio to regionally dominant shopping centres and retail parks.
Over the last ten years, IPD data for the UK shows that shopping centres and offices have produced similar average total returns of 7.0% and 6.8% respectively.
However, the volatility of office returns has been greater.
The movement in the value of the portfolio during 2008 is analysed in the table below.
Movement in portfolio value in 2008 m Portfolio value at 1 January 7,275 Valuation decrease 1,675 Capital expenditure Acquisitions 20 Development programme 385 Expenditure on existing portfolio 19 Capitalised interest 36 Disposals 284 Exchange 681 Portfolio value at 31 December 6,457 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 22 BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED The capital return for the whole portfolio for the year ended 31 December 2008 was -20.9%, reflecting the reduction in value of 1.7 billion in the year.

Almost 70% of the fall in values occurred during the second half of the year.
The City office portfolio showed falling rental values throughout 2008, although the reduction in the second six months was just over half that of the first.
The chart below shows the components of the valuation change in 2008.

Rent reviews are assumed to have been settled at the contractual review date at ERV.
2 The capitalisation rate applied to future cash flows to calculate the gross property value.
The cash flows reflect the timing of future rents resulting from lettings, lease renewals and rent reviews based on current ERVs and assuming rents are received quarterly in advance.
The property true equivalent yields are determined by the Groups external valuers.
3 Further analysis of development properties by segment is provided in note 3B to the accounts on page 66.
In the table above, the initial yield calculation is based on passing rents and excludes rent of 18.7 million per annum which will be received after the expiry of rent-free periods.
Four major developments, three retail schemes and one office building in the City of London, were completed during 2008 and transferred to the investment portfolio.
On 4 September 2008, Highcross shopping centre in Leicester, a 60:40 joint venture with Hermes, opened to the public and was visited by over one million people in the first fortnight.
The project has 2 more than doubled the size of the former Shires shopping centre to over 100,000m.
The occupancy rate for the combined scheme at Highcross at 31 December 2008 was 86%.
The anchors of the 2 scheme, John Lewis and a 7,000m Showcase Cinema fide Lux, are housed in iconic buildings.
The centre won a BCSC the UK retail property body gold award in December in recognition of the contribution made by the scheme to the quality of the built environment.
2 Cabot Circus in Bristol is a 95,800m retail-led mixed use scheme which opened on 25 September 2008.
The project was developed in a 50:50 joint venture with Land Securities and at the end of 2008 was 91% let with anchor stores occupied by Harvey Nichols and House of Fraser.
Within the first two weeks of opening, Cabot Circus also attracted over one million visitors and has re-established Bristol as a topten UK retail destination.
The scheme was awarded the BREEAM Excellent environmental rating in October 2008 and, in December, was awarded the supreme gold award by BCSC.
The second and final phase of the extension to OParinor was opened on 11 September.
The project 2 increased the number of stores at the centre to 220 and, at over 90,000m, made it the largest shopping centre serving the north of Paris.
Anchored by Plante Saturn and Toys R Us, the extension was 94% let at the end of 2008 whilst the centre as a whole was 96% let.
In the City of London, the redevelopment of the former London Stock Exchange at 125 Old Broad Street was completed in July.
The project is a joint venture with two co-investors, Bank of Ireland and GE Real 2 Estate, each of which has a 25% interest.
The 26-storey, 30,900m tower building was 46% let at 31 December 2008 and we are continuing to progress discussions with prospective tenants for the remaining space.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 24 BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED In our UK retail parks portfolio, a number of smaller extensions and reconfigurations were completed in 2008 or are underway.
In Scotland, we are extending the existing Fife Central Retail Park in Kirkcaldy by 2 2 11,000m, which will increase the size of the scheme to 28,000m.
The extension will be fully integrated with the existing centre, and will be anchored by B&Q.
Five of the six units, representing 88% of the target income, have been pre-let and completion is expected in June 2009.
In July 2008, an extension was started at Victoria Retail Park, Nottingham which completed in December.
A Tesco Homeplus store opened in November and negotiations are underway with 2 2 prospective occupiers of two units, each of 700m with a 330m mezzanine level.
2 At Cleveland Retail Park, Middlesbrough, a 6,600m restructuring project will create seven units, five of which have been pre-let.
Work started on site in September 2008 and the units will open in Autumn 2009.
We sold two properties during 2008, in line with our strategy of recycling the proceeds from mature 2 assets.
In March we completed the sale of One London Wall, a 18,500m office building in the City of London, in which Hammerson and Kajima each held a 50% interest.
The development of the building was completed in 2003 at a cost to Hammerson of 50 million and the net proceeds were 67 million.
2 Our 67% interest in Moorhouse, the 30,100m office building in the City of London, jointly owned with Pearl, was sold in September.
The Groups share of the net disposal proceeds was 152 million compared with its total development cost of 142 million.
In April, we exchanged our properties in Paris Street and Sidwell Street, Exeter with Land Securities for their 50% interest in Parc Tawe, Swansea.
We now own the whole of the latter scheme which is integral to our proposed regeneration of Swansea city centre.
Also in April, we made a payment of 137 million, contracted and provided for in 2007, to acquire the City of Londons 25% long leasehold interest in Bishops Square, London EC1.
The City retains the freehold interest in the scheme.
2 Average rent passing at 31 December 2008 before deducting head and equity rents and excluding rents passing from anchor units and car parks.
3 The annual rental income receivable from an investment property at 31 December 2008, after any rent-free periods and after deducting head and equity rents.
4 The estimated market rental value of the total lettable space in a property at 31 December 2008, after deducting head and equity rents, calculated by the Groups valuers.
5 The percentage by which the ERV exceeds, or falls short of, rents passing together with the estimated rental value of vacant space, all at 31 December 2008.
Net rental income for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 300 million, whilst passing rents from the investment portfolio totalled 368 million at that date.
In 2008, we agreed 65 rent reviews in the UK, for which the passing rents were 9.6 million, and secured additional annual income of 2.2 million.
In France, shopping centre rents have historically been indexed annually according to a construction cost index.
A new composite index, partly based on retail prices, has been agreed with tenants with the result that, from 1 January 2009, the indexation to be applied to the majority of retail tenants in Hammersons French portfolio is 3.85%.
The applicable index for 2008 was 5.05%.
The majority of rents at our French office properties are indexed annually based on a construction cost index.
From 1 January 2009, the index to be applied to the majority of our office tenants is 8.85%, compared with 5.05% for 2008.
OCCUPANCY In the investment portfolio, the occupancy rate at 31 December 2008 was 95.4%, compared with 98.2% at the end of 2007.
The reduction was principally the result of the transfer of the recently completed developments to the investment portfolio.
Excluding these recent developments, the occupancy rate was 97.2%.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 26 BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED INCOME SECURITY AND QUALITY Hammersons investment portfolio benefits from leases with long terms and provides a secure income stream with growth potential.
The weighted average unexpired lease term was ten years at the end of 2008.
Currently, 56 retail units in the UK are let to tenants in administration, and of these, 38 are still trading.
In France, there are 16 units in administration of which nine are still occupied.
For the Group as a whole, income from tenants in administration represents less than 2% of passing rent at 31 December 2008.
The table below provides information on Hammersons largest tenants by passing rent.
The ten largest retail tenants account for 56 million or 15.3% of total passing rents at 31 December 2008.
In the office portfolio, the five largest tenants represent 59 million or 16.0% of passing rents.
Retail Office % of total % of total passing passing Tenant rent Tenant rent B&Q 2.6 Allen & Overy 9.4 H&M Hennes Limited 2.3 Deutsche Bank 2.8 Printemps 2.2 Barclays Bank 1.5 Home Retail Group 1.4 Latham & Watkins LLP 1.3 Arcadia 1.4 HM Government 1.0 Mulliez 1.3 DSG Retail Limited 1.1 Inditex 1.1 Vivarte 1.0 Next Group 0.9 Total 15.3 16.0 Covenant strength is assessed for all new leases and our credit control team monitors the credit ratings of all key tenants, using a credit rating agency.
At 31 December 2008, seven of our top ten retail tenants were rated as low risk, whilst the remainder were rated as lower than average risk.
Tenants with a low or lower than average risk rating comprised 81.3% by passing rent of the UK retail portfolio.
Our office tenants are generally of lower risk than retailers, although we also monitor their risk ratings.
At 31 December 2008, three of the top five office tenants were rated as low risk, one was unrated due to insufficient information being available and anothers rent is guaranteed.
For the UK it includes tenants break options.
For France and Germany, it is based on the earliest date of lease expiry.
2 The ERV at 31 December 2008 for leases that expire or break in each year and ignoring the impact of rental growth and any rent-free periods.
Leases with current rents passing of 92 million will expire, or are subject to tenants break clauses, during the period from 2009 to 2011, as shown in the table above.
We estimate that, assuming renewals were to take place at current rental values, additional rents of around 6 million per annum would be secured.
The rental uplifts relate principally to the shopping centres at Brent Cross, Italie 2 and OParinor, and the London office, Exchange Tower.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, lease incentives or possible changes in rental values.
2 Projected rents for space that is subject to review in each year, based on the higher of the current rental income and the ERV as at 31 December 2008 and ignoring the impact of changes in rental values before the review date.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 28 BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED At the end of 2008, the investment portfolio was 3.8% reversionary overall, compared with 6.6% at 31 December 2007.
The reduction in reversion was largely due to a decline in rental values, particularly in the office portfolio, which is now over-rented.
Leases with passing rents of 119 million in the UK are subject to review over the next three years, as shown in the table above.
We estimate that, on review, rents receivable in respect of these leases would increase by 9 million per annum by 2011, if reviewed at current rental values.
An additional 4 million per annum would be secured if outstanding rent review negotiations are concluded at current rental values.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of potential changes in rental values before the relevant review dates.
The majority of leases in France are subject to indexation.
CONTRACTED INCOME In 2009 and 2010, our cash flow will increase substantially due to leases and contracts that have been signed at current and recently completed developments.
The table below shows contracted income on both cash flow and accounting bases.
CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS Our objectives from development are: to create assets which generate an attractive initial yield with significant future growth in income: to create assets valued at a surplus above our costs: and to create prime assets of a type which are difficult to obtain in the open market.
Hammerson has built a reputation as one of the leading developers in the UK and France, managing complex urban regeneration schemes and forging strong links with local authorities and key occupiers.
The delivery of these schemes requires us to take a view of future market conditions, anticipate occupiers needs, exercise strong project management skills and carefully manage risk.
Six major developments were underway at the beginning of 2008 and of those, four were completed during the year and transferred to the investment portfolio.
At 31 December 2008, future committed expenditure in respect of these four schemes was 35 million.
The two remaining major schemes, which are shown in the table below, have an estimated total development cost of 385 million, of which 254 million had been spent by 31 December 2008.
We also have a number of smaller schemes within the investment portfolio for which the remaining expenditure is estimated at 29 million.
Reflecting current market conditions, the value of our development portfolio at the end of 2008 was 199 million below its cost.
Most of the deficit related to Union Square, Aberdeen and the future development pipeline.
Following a review in early 2008, only limited capital is being invested in the future pipeline until market conditions improve.

5 The current developments shown in the table above are 100% owned by Hammerson.
Practical completion was achieved in January 2009 at 60 Threadneedle Street, London EC2.
The 2 20,600m nine-storey office building provides prime accommodation in one of the best locations in the City of London.
The building is currently unlet.
There is interest from potential occupiers to take space in the building, however the current economic background means that they are taking time to determine their requirements.
The estimated total cost of the building is 125 million, of which 20 million remains to be spent, and it is expected to generate 10 million of income per annum when fully let.
Work is continuing at Union Square, Aberdeen where a nine-hectare site next to the railway station is 2 being developed to create 49,000m of mixed-use space including retail units, leisure and catering, a 200 bedroom hotel and 1,700 car parking spaces.
The estimated cost of the scheme is 260 million, of which 111 million remains to be spent, and its projected income is 15 million, of which 34% has been secured.
The current economic climate means that letting has been more difficult than originally envisaged.
The scheme is planned to open towards the end of 2009.
The first of our two retail park developments in France, St Omer, was recently completed and 96% of the target income of around 2 million has been secured.
The cost of the scheme at 31 December 2008 was 30 million.
Cap Malo, which is anticipated to be completed in April 2009, has an estimated total cost of 20 million and the target income for the scheme is approximately 2 million.
Of the latter, 98% has been secured.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS Over a number of years, Hammerson has secured a substantial pipeline of potential future development opportunities.
We do not intend to start construction of any major new projects, although we are continuing to progress the planning and design stages so that the schemes could be advanced in the longer term.
During 2008, we have made progress in the early stages of these schemes: Site assembly for the Sevenstone scheme in Sheffield has progressed with a number of private treaty acquisitions and confirmation of the Compulsory Purchase Order in the summer.
At Eastgate Quarter, Leeds, agreements for lease have been signed with John Lewis and Marks & 2 2 Spencer for anchor stores of 26,000m and 18,250m respectively.
In addition, the CPO inquiry was confirmed by the Secretary of State in July and the initial phase of enabling works is complete.
A planning application for the masterplan for the regeneration of Brent Cross and Cricklewood, in north-west London, was submitted in March.
2 In Southampton we are progressing outline proposals for a 42,000m mixed-use, leisure-led extension to WestQuay Shopping Centre called Watermark WestQuay.
A public consultation was held earlier in 2008 and an outline planning application has been submitted.
