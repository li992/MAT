10 Business review Meggitt PLC Report and accounts 2008 PIONEERING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLLING ELECTRIC BRAKES With my First in Mathematics and a control technology doctorate in hand, my first mission at Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems was to develop control strategies and algorithms for Ebrake through simulation modelling.
With hydraulics, the pilot presses the pedal and brake pressure is transmitted through the system.
With electric braking, control, timing and sequencing can be much more complex.
There are multiple signals and communications to get right.
Meggitt was the first to y an electric brake successfully on a fully autonomous UAV with EADSa triumph of control technologyand the first to y a full complement on a civil aircraft with Bombardiera triumph of brake design.
In todays competitive business environment, innovation isnt enough.
Through the Ebrake programme, we have proved we can create stateof-the art technology and have the engineers who can turn that technology into tangible, saleable results.

I understand overheads, labour and material content and thats the perspective Im bringing to Meggitts global sourcing programme.
With full-time teams in the US, Europe and Asia, we exceeded our goals this year.
Some 35 business units act in unison now, exercising their combined spending power.
Group specialists in the core Meggitt technologies of casting, forgings, machining, cabling, metal fabrication and PCB assemblies have helped them save up to 70% on some packages this year.
Many companies struggle with strategic sourcing but our success comes from looking at it as a way to win new business as well as cut the cost of existing programmes.
Strategic sourcing is not just about purchasing.
It is also about sales and quality.
We are winning contracts because we are cost competitive and we are ensuring the best suppliers of service and technology work with us.
We bring it all together with the superior project management skills needed to migrate Meggitt businesses between supply chains, delivering acceptable first articles on time and establishing the right inventory models.
