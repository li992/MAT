The Group is not currently subject to external regulatory risk-based capital requirements.
In 2008, it was, however, required under certain of its funding agreements, to ensure that its gearing ratio did not exceed six times.
For this purpose gearing is calculated as the ratio of consolidated borrowings to tangible net assets.
The precise denition of borrowings used in the calculation varies according to the funding agreement, but is broadly consistent with that disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet.
Adjustment is made to exclude items such as accrued interest, unamortised discount and fees, and net off certain bank deposits.
Tangible net assets are based on net assets equivalent to total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets.
As a result of the restatement of the Groups 2007 results, at the 2008 year end the Groups shareholders funds excluding goodwill and other intangible assets was negative, putting it in breach of its gearing covenant limit of six times.
