29 fide La Rue Annual Report 2008 Business Review Financial Review IAS 19 Accounting It is the responsibility of the independent Trustee to set the method and assumptions for calculating the Scheme liabilities under Scheme Funding Valuation.
The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 valuation used in the Companys accounts are set by the Company in compliance with the guidance given in IAS 19 and advice from its actuary.
The discount rate used for calculating IAS 19 liabilities is the yield prevailing on AA rated corporate bonds.
Those used for ongoing funding valuation are based on actuarial advice taking into account the actual investment profile of assets between bonds and equities over the longer term.
This is the principal difference between the two sets of assumptions.
The valuation under IAS 19 principles indicates a Scheme deficit after tax at 29 March 2008 of 14.9m 31 March 2007 : 72.7m.
The charge to operating profits in respect of the UK Pension Scheme for 2007 2008 was 10.0m 2006 2007 : 9.8m.
In addition, under IAS 19 there is a finance credit of 0.3m arising from the difference between the expected return on assets and the interest on liabilities 2006 2007 : 1.8m.
This amount is included with the Group interest income in the profit and loss account.
