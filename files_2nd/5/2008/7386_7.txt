Key performance indicators The Board measures progress on our strategic objectives by reference to five key financial performance indicators KPIs applied on a Group-wide and segmental basis.
These same indicators are used by executive management to manage the business.
Performance in 2008 against these indicators is set out in the table below left, together with the prior year performance data.
It is important to note that the 2008 gures were impacted by the difficulties experienced in the US Generics business.
For 2009 and onwards, the Board will measure Group performance by reference to an amended set of key performance indicators that better reect the Groups focus on continued revenue growth and operational excellence.
These indicators will be measured on both a Group-wide and a segmental basis.
These new performance indicators are: Hikmas key performance indicators 1.

The revenue contribution from Hikma Egypt previously Alkan, APM and Thymoorgan the acquisitions completed since the beginning of 2007 was $102.5 million.
Underlying organic revenue growth excluding the impact of these acquisitions was 9.5%, driven by strong performances in both the Branded and Injectables businesses but offset by a 14.9% decline in revenues in our US Generics business.
As a result, the Branded and Injectables businesses accounted for 81% of revenues in 2008 compared with 71% in 2007.

Investment in R&D increased by 14.6% to $22.2 million, with total investment in R&D now representing 3.8% of Group revenue, compared with 4.3% in 2007.
This decline mainly reects an increase in the proportion of our development Branded: 55.3% projects in the MENA region where development costs tend to be lower than in Generics: 18.2% the USA or Europe.
It also reects a strategic shift towards the acquisition of Injectables: 25.7% product les and related product intangibles.
Other net operating expenses, consisting mainly of provisions against slow moving items of $8.6 million partially offset by foreign exchange gains of $1.2 million, were $6.2 million, compared with $2.8 million in 2007.
The major reason for the increase in 2008 was the provision that we made in our US Generics business for slow moving items due to deteriorating market conditions.
Operating profit for the Group decreased by 12.7% to $80.7 million, compared with $92.4 million in 2007, and Group operating margin decreased to 13.9%, compared with 20.6% in 2007.

Diabetes is growing in the MENA region, where the ageing population together with lifestyle changes have led to an increase in type 2 diabetes.
In fact the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman are amongst the 10 countries in the world experiencing the greatest increases of diabetes amongst their populations.
With the growing incidence of diabetes comes an increase in cardiovascular disease, with diabetes patients two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than the general population.
To address the changing needs of patients in our markets our portfolio is more focused on the cardiovascular and metabolic therapeutic areas.
In 2008 we launched five new cardiovascular products, one diabetes product and two central nervous system products.

Expanding our under license business with research based multinational companies is a key part of this strategy and will enable us to continuously launch new innovative medical treatments valued by patients and physicians.
In 2008, we signed three new agreements with originator pharmaceutical companies.
In order to differentiate ourselves from other local generic companies in the MENA region, we are forging strong lasting relationships and loyalty with physicians and the medical community by providing medical education programs and scientific workshops and conducting clinical studies.

The absence of these revenues in 2008 was exacerbated by continued price erosion across other 9 98 8 product lines and lower than expected demand for new products.
In addition, as reported in our interim results, we made a one-off provision of $4.8 million 9 98 8 relating to revisions in our estimates for chargebacks, rebates and returns.
All of these factors, as well as higher than expected production and API costs, led to a 67% decline in the Generics gross profit to $19.3 million, compared with 9 99 9 $58.6 million in 2007.
The Generics gross margin was 18.3%, compared with 47.2% in 2007.

These included the appointments of a new General Manager and a new Vice-President, Sales and Marketing for all US operations.
This strengthened management team undertook a comprehensive review of the business in the second half of 2008 and identied a number of approaches to improving operating performance.
Following an in-depth examination of profitability by product and by customer, we withdrew from the supply of some low margin products, implemented price increases where possible, secured lower cost sources of APIs, improved our manufacturing and distribution efficiencies, raised service levels and renegotiated our standard terms of trade.
We are pleased to report that these actions resulted in the Generics business returning to profitability in the closing months of 2008, although the profit achieved was not sufficient to offset losses incurred earlier in the year.
We expect profitable trading to be sustained during 2009 as we continue to focus on implementing these actions.
We have also noted a recent improvement in the prices of certain products in the US following the FDA-enforced withdrawal of some non-US suppliers in 2008.

This was primarily due to a decline in the profitability of Hikmas 51% owned subsidiary in Sudan.
profit for the year The Groups profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent decreased by 8.7% to $57.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2008, compared with $62.6 million in 2007.
Adjusted profit for the year Excluding the amortisation of intangible assets other than software and exceptional items, which include integration costs and revisions to estimates for charge-backs, rebates and returns, the Groups adjusted profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by 4.5% to $67.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2008, compared with $64.5 million in 2007.
Earnings per share Diluted earnings per share for the year to 31 December 2008 were 29.6 cents, down by 16.4% from 35.4 cents in 2007. Dividend The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.0 cents per share approximately 2.8 pence per share, which will make the dividend for the full year of 7.5 cents per share, the same amount paid in 2007.
The proposed final dividend will be paid on 2 June 2009 to shareholders on the register on 1 May 2009, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting.
Operating cash ow and investment Net cash inow from operating activities was $75.0 million, compared with $53.3 million in 2007.
The previously reported 2007 operating cash ow has be reclassied and increased by $8.1 million.
This improvement came as a result of our focus on effective working capital management where, excluding acquisitions, receivable days decreased by nine days and inventory days decreased by 21 days.
Net cash used for investing activities was $66.1 million, compared with $348.9 million in 2007.
The latter included just under $300 million of expenditure on acquisitions $71.7 million for Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan, $58.7 million for Alkan Pharma in Egypt and $163.4 million for Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing in Jordan.
Capital expenditure amounted to $56.2 million, compared with $50.4 million in 2007.
This expenditure related primarily to expansion projects in the Branded and Injectables businesses.
During the year the Group also made regular investments to upgrade and maintain existing facilities.
On 17 January 2008 we successfully raised gross proceeds of 81.6 million approximately $160 million in an equity placing of shares, funding the acquisition of APM, strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our exibility to finance future growth.

Principal risks and uncertainties The Groups business faces risks and uncertainties.
The section below includes the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group considers could have a significant effect on its financial condition, results of operations or future performance.
The list is not set out in order of priority and other risks, currently unknown or not considered material, could have a similar effect.
qxp 31 3 09 01:16 Page 51 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 51 Annual report 2008 Risk management: Operational risks Regulatory Hikma is subject to extensive regulation on the approval, manufacture and distribution of its products in all its markets.
There is no single worldwide harmonised set of regulations relating to the development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products and the Group is therefore subject to different laws, regulations and codes depending on the regions or countries in which products are marketed.
This is particularly relevant in the MENA region where there is no mutually-recognized regional regulatory body.
Specic jurisdictions can therefore refuse to register a product or may require additional information even though it is approved in another jurisdiction.
This can create significant compliance costs, and can also increase the time it takes to realise the full penetration of products into all markets.
The Group operates in diverse markets and geographic regions and is therefore subject to a broad range of industry, economic and political dynamics.
The laws and regulations governing the manufacture and supply of our products are subject to change, which may lead to unanticipated business interruption or increased costs for compliance.
Whilst the cost of such disruption of compliance can be significant, we believe that the wide geographic spread of our operations gives the Group the strength and exibility to lessen the impact on the Groups results and financial condition of any such disruption.
Economic and political dynamics The Group operates in emerging markets, some of which have less developed political and legal systems, or which have a history of political volatility and therefore present greater challenges to the conduct of business than more developed markets.
Whilst the Group has a wide geographical spread of operations, the failure of control, a change in the economic conditions or political environment or sustained civil unrest in any particular market or country could adversely affect the financial condition of the Group.
Risk of interruption of production Product manufacture is subject to continual regulatory control, and products must be produced in accordance with good manufacturing practice regulations.
Our manufacturing sites are subject to approval and ongoing inspection by a large number of regulatory agencies.
In addition, small changes in manufacturing processes may require further regulatory approval.
These issues could result in additional compliance expense, and compliance failure could result in interruptions to production, product recalls, closure of manufacturing sites and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our business and its financial condition.
Regulated and other suppliers A compliance failure by any of our regulated suppliers for both active and bulk ingredients could lead to delays in production, product recalls, the potential for product liability claims and other regulatory sanctions.
The business undertakes supply chain planning, and alternative sourcing of key products.
However, for some components we may have to rely on single sourcing, which creates a greater risk of disruption to production in the event of regulatory non-compliance or interruption of supply.
While the Group does not believe that any third-party supplier relationship is individually significant in terms of the entire Group, a failure in supply could disrupt production and restrict sales.
Government tender bids Whilst the majority of Group sales are to the private sector, each of our three businesses participates in government tenders.
The timing and outcome of these tenders are unpredictable, and the Groups results could be affected by the gain or loss of a significant government contract.
qxp 1 4 09 23:45 Page 52 52 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Our strategy Annual report 2008 Maintaining our world-class manufacturing and API sourcing capabilities We are extremely proud of our 12 world-class manufacturing facilities, most of which have passed inspections by regulators from multiple jurisdictions.
Five of our facilities have been FDA approved.
We are committed to maintaining an excellent compliance record at all of our facilities and to this end we make continuous investment in training our excellent workforce.
API sourcing also remains a key priority.
Our dedicated API sourcing team is focused on identifying high quality, cost effective suppliers for all our markets.
One more FDA approved manufacturing plant We continually seek to improve our production facilities.
During 2008 Hikma Portugals new cephalosporin plant was granted FDA approval and the same approval process was started at Thymoorgan.
In Portugal we have commenced construction of a third plant containing state of the art liquid nitrogen freeze drying capacity and a high speed liquid ling line.
FDA appoval of this plant is expected towards the end of 2010.

qxp 1 4 09 23:47 Page 54 54 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Our strategy Annual report 2008 Business and financial review continued Research and development and commercialisation of new products The Groups results of operations may be impacted signicantly by the timeliness of its research and development and product commercialisation activities.
In order to bring a pharmaceutical product to market successfully, the Group must identify products for which it can generate attractive margins and growth, undertake the required research and development and obtain regulatory approvals.
Additional costs may be incurred, and sales opportunities lost, if there is any significant delay in any of these steps.
Given the importance of research and development, Hikma has expanded its investment in research and development, particularly in Jordan where it can benefit from lower labour and bio-equivalency costs.
API and other raw material costs Raw material costs represented over 30% of the Groups net sales in the year ended 31 December 2008, with the most significant portion of these costs relating to APIs.
Whilst the prices of the APIs that the Group uses have in general fallen in recent years, these prices are volatile and can vary signicantly from supplier to supplier.
In some cases, increase in API and other raw material costs may not be able to be passed on to customers and can therefore have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations.
Hikma has a dedicated API sourcing function that has been successful in sourcing lower cost APIs through more competitive suppliers in Asia.
Seasonality The Groups business, in particular the Branded Pharmaceuticals business, is seasonal, and it generally experiences higher net sales and net profit in the first half of each financial year, as compared to the second half of its financial year.
Accordingly, the Groups outstanding borrowings historically have been higher during the first half of the financial year in order to finance the working capital requirements of the Group.
Acquisitions and strategic alliances Acquisitions remain a key part of the Groups strategy to develop and grow its business.
The Group also seeks long-term licensing arrangements and strategic alliances to expand its product portfolio and geographical presence.
The risks associated with this strategy include the availability of suitable acquisition candidates and assimilating and integrating acquired companies into the Group.
Other risks include delays in implementation or unexpected costs or liabilities.
The Group may be at risk of failing to realise operating benets or synergies from completed acquisitions.
The Group mitigates these risks by implementing a structured integration process which can include placing experienced management into the acquired company to effect the swift installation of internal controls and by subjecting management processes to close monitoring and review by internal audit and senior management.
In respect of long-term licensing arrangements, a failure to agree appropriate commercial terms on renewal of such agreements could lead to a reduction in revenues as replacement products are sourced.
Risk management: Financial risks Group Treasury is responsible for Financial Risk Management and setting the appropriate controls and risk policies.
Group Treasury is supported by treasury departments at the operating company and segmental levels and reports to the Chief Financial officer.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements, primarily in the European, Algerian, Sudanese and Egyptian currencies, that could materially affect the Trusted to deliver Our strategy 12751 p26 p57.
qxp 1 4 09 23:47 Page 55 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 55 Annual report 2008 Groups financial results.
Group Treasury attempts to mitigate this risk through various methods: entering into currency derivative contracts where possible, foreign currency borrowing and matching foreign currency revenues and costs.
Using these methods has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31 December 2008.
See Note 29 to the Groups consolidated financial statements for a description of the Groups Foreign Exchange risks.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of xed rate debt and variable rate debt in its total debt portfolio.
To manage this mix the Group may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges the periodic payments based on notional amounts and agreed upon xed and variable interest rates.
Using these swap agreements has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31 December 2008.
See Note 29 to the Groups consolidated financial statements for a description of the Groups interest rate risks.
Credit risk In most cases, the Group grants its buyers credit terms for settlement of sales invoices.
Credit risk is managed through the Group Credit policy and the use of various financial instruments such as letters of credit, factoring and credit insurance arrangements.
Further details are set out in Note 29 of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity risk The Group has constant nancing requirements, both for short-term working capital needs and for long-term strategic plans.
Corporate Treasury ensures the Group debt capital structure and banking arrangements can accommodate these nancing needs.
Corporate Treasury also endeavours to efficiently utilise excess liquidity from one subsidiary to another, while complying with any foreign currency, legal or tax restrictions.
Going concern Although, the current economic conditions may affect short-term demand for our products, as well as place pressure on customers and suppliers which may face liquidity issues, the Groups geographic spread, product diversity and large customer and supplier base substantially mitigate these risks.
In addition, the Group operates in the relatively defensive generic pharmaceuticals industry which we expect to be less affected compared to other industries that are subject to greater cyclical changes.
The Group has $229 million of banking facilities of which $121 million were undrawn as at 31 December 2008.
These facilities are well diversied across the operating subsidiaries of the Group with a number of financial institutions.
The majority of these facilities are short term, uncommitted working capital related.
See Notes 24, 27 and 29 for details.
However, we continue to expect them to be renewed annually.
In addition the Group maintained cash balances of $63.5 million as at 31 December 2008.
The Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, facility renewal sensitivities and maturities of long-term debt, show that the Group should be able to operate well within the levels of its facilities and their related covenants.
After making enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage its business and nancing risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts, as stated in the Directors report.
Ination risk Hikma believes it is not subject to material risk due to ination in any of its core markets at present.
qxp 31 3 09 00:52 Page 56 56 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Our strategy Annual report 2008 Business and financial review continued Taxation Almost all of the Groups earnings are derived in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom and are taxed there.
Some of these overseas countries offer more favourable tax rates in comparison to each other and the United Kingdom.
In addition to the United Kingdom, tax laws and regulations in many of the countries where the Group operates include international rules that aim to protect the tax base of such country.
Any change to such rules could negatively affect the effective tax rate of the Group or could create costly compliance requirements.
Therefore, the management maintains close observation of any intended or proposed changes to such rules, both in the United Kingdom and in other key countries where the Group operates.
Critical accounting policies and estimates The Groups accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
However, certain of the Groups accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of the Groups results and require the application of significant judgement by the Groups management.
In applying these policies, the Groups management uses its judgement to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimates used in the preparation of the Groups results.
These estimates are based on the Groups previous experience, the terms of existing contracts, information available from other outside sources and other factors, as appropriate.
The Groups management believes that, among others, the following accounting policies that involve management judgements and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Groups financial results.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents sales of products to external third parties and excludes intercompany income and value added taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when the risk of loss and title are transferred to customers and reliable estimates can be made of relevant deductions.
The Groups revenue recognition policies require management to make a number of estimates, with the most significant relating to charge backs, product returns, rebates and price adjustments which vary by product arrangements and buying groups.
Charge backs The provision for charge backs is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.
In the US, the Group sells its products directly to wholesalers, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies.
The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and group purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.
The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products.
The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices.
The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesalers invoice price.
This credit is called a charge back.
The provision for charge backs is based on historical sell-through levels by the Groups wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
As sales are made to the large wholesalers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for charge backs and makes adjustments when it believes that actual charge backs may differ from estimated reserves.
qxp 27 3 09 22:37 Page 57 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 57 Annual report 2008 Accounts receivable and bad debts The Group estimates, based on its historical experience, the level of debts that it believes will not be collected.
Such estimates are made when collection of the full amount of the debt is no longer probable.
These estimates are based on a number of factors including specic customer issues and industry, economic and political conditions.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
Goodwill and intangible assets The Group has significant investments in goodwill and intangible assets as a result of acquisitions of businesses and purchases of assets such as product development and marketing rights.
Under IFRS, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful economic lives are held at cost and tested annually for impairment, whilst the remaining intangibles are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and impairment reviews are undertaken if events occur which indicate impairment to the carrying values of the assets.
Purchases of intellectual property and product rights to supplement our R&D portfolio are capitalised as intangible assets.
Such intangible assets are amortised from the launch of the underlying products and are tested for impairment.
This policy is in line with practice adopted by other major pharmaceutical companies.
The critical area of judgement is in relation to the useful economic life of these product-related intangibles and the impairment tests for that are performed at least annually.
Contingent liabilities In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from productspecic and general legal proceedings, from guarantees or from environmental liabilities connected with our current or former sites.
These potential liabilities are considered to have a remote probability of crystallising and are therefore treated as contingent liabilities in the Group financial statements, and accordingly disclosed in Note 36.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or profitability.
Tax The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where it operates and the likelihood of settlement.
The tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax and the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Introduction Acting responsibly has been a core value of Hikma since its foundation and a value we strive to bring to life in our day-to-day work.
In 2008 we continued to formalise our CSR programme and reporting, and remained focused on working to integrate sustainable behaviour into our business.
This report demonstrates how we continue to extend our engagement with the communities in which we operate, support our people, develop our business practices, and improve awareness of how to minimise our impact on the environment.
Acting responsibly exists at the core of the way Hikma does business, with the ultimate intention of improving the well-being of the patients using our products and building strong relationships with other stakeholders.
Aligning business and CSR Hikma responsibility structure The year ended with a significant review of our CSR governance structure in Board of directors line with our ongoing aim of embedding CSR throughout the Hikma group and driving the CSR programme from the Board and senior management, to Steering Committee operational functions.
The changes seek to ensure that our CSR activities are consistently aligned with the Companys ongoing business objectives.
Working Committee This new structure provides for a Board-level Steering Committee and an expanded Working Committee.
The Steering Committee, is chaired by Hikmas CSR Champions Vice Chairman, and comprises an independent Non-Executive Director Ronald Goode the Corporate Vice President of Finance and the General Counsel.
It is responsible for oversight of the Groups CSR activity, its strategic direction and implementation and reporting to the Board of Directors.

The committees have set goals for Hikmas 2009 CSR programme in the areas of reporting, the Hikma Volunteering Day and the appointment of CSR Champions.
In 2008 we saw increasing levels of activity from our CSR Champions.
Based in six of Hikmas manufacturing units, the Champions play a critical role in implementing CSR practice within the operating units and attaining employee engagement for our growing number of initiatives.
In early 2009 we appointed CSR Champions at our manufacturing sites in Egypt, APM Jordan, Italy and Thymoorgan Germany.
Reporting Number of CSR champions We are guided by the Global Reporting Initiatives GRI G3 guidelines, in particular focusing on data gathering on: 10 community investments: This year we have selected a number of champions at our plants in Egypt, APM Jordan, Italy and Thymoorgan environmental impacts: and Germany and are seeking to raise awareness of the work the champions do in promoting the CSR agenda.

available, establishing trends remains at a preliminary stage.
During 2009 we will implement a dedicated software system to improve data gathering and analysis, to gain better and more consistent data and enable analysis of trends in our business.
We continue to review the need for additional indicators for example, on emissions to ensure that reporting is aligned with our overall business strategy.
People We value our employees as our most important asset, ensuring that we recruit and retain the quality of people that distinguishes us from our competitors.
We aim to be recognised as a leading employer and repay our employees loyalty by investing in their future.
With our commitment to GMP Good Manufacturing Processes, technical training has always been very strong across the business.
GRI data has shown that non-GMP training represents approximately 25% of all training, helping us identify areas of need for further non-technical training.
In 2009 this will include additional training for the CSR Champions and employee training on CSR Policies and the Code of Conduct.
In 2008, we also continued our Continuing Education Scheme which supports employees in fully funded further education programmes.
Gifts in kind We continue to focus on employee welfare.
In November 2008, we celebrated World Diabetes Day, raising employee awareness by the distribution of posters throughout our business, e-mails to employees and hosting an internal lecture in $1.4m Jordan.
We also undertook a breast cancer awareness day, which alerted employees The Company donated $1,411,000 to issues and preventative screening, and have implemented a life insurance of medicines in 2008. scheme for all employees in Algeria.
Community: A Core Value We remain resolute in our belief that investment in our communities brings benefit both to us and to those around us.
This idea was embedded at the foundation of Hikma as a family-owned company.
In many cases, our community involvement focuses on supporting young people with the aim of developing their professional skills, while at the same time providing a broader pool of talented recruits for Hikma.
We have continued to build our university partnerships by providing student scholarships.
Following on from our 2007 acquisition in Egypt, 150 students from Egyptian universities were supported through cross-departmental training at Hikma.
In 2008 we launched a collaboration with the German Jordanian University in Amman, whereby three students will receive six-month technical training scholarships at Hikmas German plant.

We encouraged employees across the business to spend one day giving their time, and 500 employees were involved in the projects.
Activities ranged from assisting a eld survey related to early detection of breast cancer, to spending the day at pediatric oncology hospital units with child cancer patients, to renovating and painting a cancer hospital ward.
We also continued to work with charities in our communities helping to ght poverty.

Hikma was a regional partner for the World Economic Forum Middle East summit in May and was invited to speak on the panel at sessions focused on identifying and building opportunities to improve the global competitiveness of businesses operating in the Middle East.
Health and Safety Hikmas dedication to quality extends across all areas of our business.
It cannot be upheld without a continued commitment to providing a safe working environment and ensuring that the health and safety of our employees is given critical attention.
Following its development in 2007, 2008 brought the initial implementation of Hikmas Health and Safety Policy, which requires the appointment of an HSE supervisor in each business unit.
In 2008 we saw the first appointments to this role, but fell short of our target of appointments in all main business units.
The necessary additional appointments will be made during 2009.
During 2008, many of our units implemented the necessary health and safety processes through the use of external HSE advisors.
The process of employee education on the Group Health and Safety Policy, which was not fully realised in 2008, remains a key priority for 2009.
qxp 27 3 09 22:41 Page 64 64 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Responsibly Annual report 2008 Corporate and social responsibility report continued Nevertheless, our strong commitment to conducting our business within the Health and Safety Policy delivered results during the year.
New health and safety initiatives developed during 2008 include the opening of a weekly health clinic at our Algerian factory.
Attended by local GP, this enables all employees to be given an annual general health check.
We were also delighted to receive external recognition for our commitment to health and safety.
Firstly this was gained through the award of the OHSAS 18001 certication at our AMC facility in Jordan, with the main Hikma Jordan facility also working towards this certication.
Secondly, Hikma Jordan was granted the Award of Excellence in Health and Safety as the best private sector pharmaceutical company in Jordan, a prestigious award granted by the countrys Social Security Corporation, the most comprehensive ofcial body tracking occupational injuries in Jordan.
During 2008 we focused on the collection and analysis of GRI data on absenteeism and occupational injury rates to enable a clearer understanding for ongoing policy development.
2009 will see further emphasis on employee training on the Health and Safety Policy and target a zero level of occupational injuries across all business units.

GRI data collection has heightened awareness of energy usage and is helping us to identify ways to drive energy reduction across the units.
New initiatives that have helped to reduce energy usage in 2008 include: The installation of a solar system for hot water usage in Jordan assessment is ongoing for Algeria and Portugal.
The calibration of the Hikma Jordan boiler system to reduce diesel consumption and reduce CO2 emissions.
Amending overnight lighting procedures at West-wards warehouses in the US.
The use of low energy light bulbs in Saudi Arabia and Portugal.

study in association with National Energy Research Centre NERC to identify additional methods for reducing energy consumption.
The primary data suggest that AMC can save up to 25% of its total energy costs.
Water usage With a significant manufacturing presence in the Middle East water scarcity continues to be a major concern.
A number of new initiatives have quickly led to significant improvements in our water usage.
Water usage decreased by just over 50% at our main Hikma Jordan plant, attributable to the installation of new external cleaning pumps, replacement of corroded pipes, and employee education on water resources.
Waste production We continue to measure our waste and focus on reduction.
Our Environmental Policy commits us to encourage the reuse or recycling of all nonhazardous waste and initial GRI data collected indicates that there has been success in this area, in particular with the introduction of employee led recycling initiatives.
ISO 14001 certication in Jordan also mandates specic procedures for processing hazardous and specialised waste.
Central to all of these changes are education, communication and awarenessraising, and we remain committed to communicating our Environmental Policy Ethics targets in 2009 to employees, customers and other stakeholders.

Ethics Honesty and integrity lie at the core of our business values.
Ethical issues continue to be overseen by the Ethics Committee, which is chaired by Ronald Goode an independent non-executive Director, and reports to the Board of Directors.
Through our partnership with PACI Partnering Against Corruption Initiative we are committed to a zero tolerance policy to all forms of bribery and corruption.
We have also committed to developing and implementing internal systems and controls for that policy, which are supported by the ongoing delivery of anticorruption training.
We previously committed to all Hikma management signing the Companywide Code of Conduct, and this undertaking continues.
The Company continues to operate a whistle-blowing policy to encourage reporting of activities that are not in compliance with the Code of Conduct, ethics or financial reporting guidelines which along with Share Dealing Code and Disclosure Policies will be the subject of further education in 2009.
We have continued to work with our suppliers to understand their ethical policies including human rights and environmental behaviour, targeting certain key suppliers with a questionnaire to investigate this further.
During 2009 the CSR Committee will work to identify where action may need to be taken with suppliers to align their values with those of Hikma.
