The network ensures easyJet has a broad appeal across geographies easyJets business model is centred around the following strengths: and customer types and thus a balanced revenue base.
Low cost, financially strong and highly efficient: Europes number one air transport network: Strong customer proposition.
Through building on these strengths easyJet has improved its underlying return on equity from 7.1% in 2005 to 13.6% in 2007, however in 2008 underlying return on equity has reduced to 7.6% mostly due to the increase in fuel cost per seat of 4.08 equating to an increase in the fuel bill of around 210 million.
Encouragingly though, easyJet was able to offset over half of this increase through revenue and cost initiatives demonstrating the strength and resilience of the business model and its appeal to customers.
easyJet remains committed to achieving a 15% return on equity although the current difficult economic climate and uncertainty over the future may make this a challenging target to achieve over the medium term.
In the current climate, the business will take a prudent approach to cash conservation in order to emerge as the winner in European short-haul aviation when the economic conditions have improved.
