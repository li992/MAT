REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY Many of our properties are in areas across London where there is strong demand for mixed use redevelopment.
These schemes generally require demolition of an existing building to deliver new residential and commercial space.
Our model is to use our expertise and knowledge to obtain a mixed use planning consent at one of our properties and then agree terms with a residential developer to undertake the redevelopment and construction at no cost or risk to Workspace.
We receive back a combination of cash, new commercial space and overage in return for the sale of the residential component to the developer.
