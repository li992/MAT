Adjusted EBITDA US$ million Metals and minerals total Adjusted EBITDA was $8,622 million, down 3% from $8,846 million in 2013.
The modest reduction reflects somewhat more challenging marketing conditions, particularly in iron ore, and the 8,622 impact of lower copper and precious metal prices on 2013 2014 the industrial activities.
These factors were mitigated by Marketing activities 1,643 2013 1,545 2014 higher copper production volumes and currency related costs benefits as the US dollar strengthened against Industrial activities 7,203 2013 7,077 2014 our key producer country currencies.
Adjusted EBIT was $5,189 million, 8% lower than 2013 due to higher depreciation, reflective of higher production.
Adjusted EBIT US$ million Further production growth is expected from key advanced stage and recently commissioned projects, mainly in copper, zinc and nickel.
The business is strongly positioned within its operating markets, with the asset and marketing base 5,189 fully primed to take advantage of growth in both emerging 2013 2014 markets and the developed world.

pressurising prices later in the year.
While global nickel demand improved in 2014, increased ore exports from the Philippines, blended with stockpiled Indonesian ore, kept Chinese nickel pig iron production at elevated levels, maintaining an oversupply of nickel in the global market.
LME inventory increased from 261,000 tonnes at the start of the year to a record high of 415,000 tonnes at year-end, with the cash settlement price averaging $16,892 per tonne, 13% higher than 2013.
While nickel is not immune to the weakness currently seen across the commodity spectrum, market trends support a continued transition from structural oversupply to material deficits in the medium term.
In particular, Philippine ore shipments are insufficient, in terms of quality and quantity, to offset the full impact of the Indonesian ban.

48 Glencore Annual Report 2014 Metals and minerals Industrial activities Highlights Total industrial Adjusted EBITDA and EBIT in 2014 were $7,077 million and $3,674 million, down 2% and 9% respectively over 2013 as a result of lower commodity prices, particularly copper and precious metals, partially offset by higher copper production up 4%, mainly from African copper, higher zinc and nickel prices and the generally stronger US dollar.
The price driven reduction in profitability resulted in a small decline in metal and minerals mining margin from 32% to 30%.

60 Glencore Annual Report 2014 Energy products Industrial activities Highlights Total industrial Adjusted EBITDA was $2,841 million, down 16% from $3,378 million, while Adjusted EBIT was $486 million, down 61% from $1,244 million.
The reduction in Adjusted EBITDA relates to lower prices impacting both the coal and oil results average realised coal prices and Brent oil down 820% and 9% respectively, while the greater reduction in Adjusted EBIT reflects a higher depreciation charge, consistent with the higher production levels.
The reductions were mitigated somewhat by the higher production, real unit cost savings and the stronger US dollar, whereby the Australian dollar and South African rand depreciated by 7% and 12% respectively during 2014.
The price driven reduction in profitability resulted in a small decline in energys industrial EBITDA margin from 30% to 28%.

Viterra, now fully integrated with significant cost savings achieved, performed well.
The record Canadian 2013 crop, a better than average South Australian 2013 crop and a South Australian 2014 crop that, despite the dry weather, recovered strongly late on, were all beneficial.
We were able to overcome the challenges provided by an early season shortage of railroad capacity in Canada, while port facilities in both Russia and Ukraine benefited from strong early crop year export volumes.
Our global marketing network was able to enhance the performance of the handling business and global marketing itself produced satisfactory results.
Oilseed marketing in particular, well integrated with our crushing assets in Europe and SouthAmerica, contributed strongly.
Barring significant crop issues, global markets are likely to remain relatively low priced and subdued.
Crop progress to date, in both Brazil and Argentina is excellent and may be at record levels, which is potentially constructive for the oilseed crushing business.
Conversely, weak diesel prices will adversely impact biodiesel margins.
