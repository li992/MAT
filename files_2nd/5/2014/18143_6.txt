The cost of new bank 60 financing has fallen in the past few months, particularly in the 40 UK, but notwithstanding low medium-term rates, refinancing 20 existing debts as they fall due will probably gradually increase 0 the average cost of debt of the Group.

FINANCING STRATEGY The Groups strategy is to hold its DEBT PROFILE AT END FEBRUARY 2015 investment properties predominantly in single-purpose million vehicles financed primarily by non-recourse bank debt in the currency used to purchase the asset.
In this way credit and 200 Debt Bullet Repayment liquidity risk can most easily be managed, around 75% of the 180 Debt Amortisation Groups exposure to foreign currency is naturally hedged, and 160 the most efficient use can be made of the Groups assets.
140 Bank debt ordinarily attracts covenants on loan-to-value and 120 on interest and debt service cover.
The Group had 60 loans 100 80 across the portfolio from 23 banks, plus a debenture, a zero 60 coupon note, secured notes and two unsecured bonds.
40 To the extent that Group borrowings are not at fixed rates, 20 the Groups exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the 0 use of financial derivatives, particularly interest rate caps and swaps.
Since 2009, the Board has believed that interest rates were likely to remain low longer than the forward interest curve would imply, and, therefore, its policy has been to allow a majority of debt to remain subject to floating rates.
To mitigate the risk of interest rates increasing more sharply DEBT HEDGING than the Board expected, the Group entered into interest rate caps.
This policy has served the Group well.
At 31 December 2014, 32% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates or subject to interest rate swaps, 41% were subject to caps and Fixed rate 32% 27% of debt costs were unhedged.
With long-term rates now at historically low levels, particularly for the euro, the Board Floating rate Floating rate may seek to fix rates over the medium term with interest rate unhedged capped swaps when the opportunity arises, such as on the recent 27% 41% Harburg acquisition.
The Groups financial derivatives predominantly interest rate caps and interest rate swaps are marked to market at each balance sheet date.
