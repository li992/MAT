We delivered record revenue of GEL 605.6 million, up 11.3% y-o-y, as a result of maintained resilient growth momentum across all the major business lines in 2014.
The robust performance was fuelled primarily by solid growth of the loan portfolio coupled with our continued focus on liability optimisation aimed at interest expense reduction.
Additionally, fee and commission income also picked up significantly due to the expansion of our Express Banking footprint and investment management operations.
Finally, our healthcare business also made a significant contribution, increasing 109.6% y-o-y, in line with our strategy to increase the scale of our healthcare business.
Annual Report 2014 | Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 45 Business review: overview of financial results continued We delivered record net interest income for 2014 driven by Interest expense declined, despite a 17.0% y-o-y increase in the combined effect of high teens growth in lending and a average interest bearing liabilities a result of our intensified liability 100 basis point cut in the Cost of Funding.
Net interest income optimisation efforts during the year that drove Cost of Funding 100 totalled GEL 344.1 million, up 9.5% y-o-y and driven by a 3.6% bps lower y-o-y to 4.9%.
The decline in the Cost of Funding was increase in interest income to GEL 594.9 million and a 3.4% decline in supported by a significant cost reduction in all respective items interest expense to GEL 250.9 million.
Interest income grew primarily of interest bearing liabilities Cost of Client Deposits, Cost of Amounts due to a 3.3% increase in interest income from loans to customers due to Credit Institutions and Cost of Debt Securities decreased 130 reaching GEL 540.0 million driven by a 17.7% increase in average net bps, 120 bps and 60 bps, respectively.
The sharp decline in Cost of loans to customers, which more than offset 190 bps decline in the Client Deposits had the largest impact on the reduction in interest Loan Yield to 14.4% in 2014.
The Loan Yield was impacted by strong expense despite an 8.9% increase in average client deposits, a competitive pressures driven by the high level of liquidity in the corresponding balance sheet item.
This decline was partly offset banking sector during the year, although our liquidity levels started by a 53.7% increase in interest expense to debt securities to to decline in the second-half of the year as a result of a significant GEL 54.4 million as a result of an issue of Eurobonds in Q4 2013, pick-up in lending, translating into largely flat Loan Yield in Q4 2014 which increased the corresponding average balance sheet item on q-o-q basis.
Daily averages are used for calculation of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities.
Excess liquidity is the excess amount of liquid assets, as defined per NBG, which exceeds the minimal amount of the same liquid assets for the purposes of the minimal 30% liquidity ratio per NBG definitions.
The NIM at 7.4% in 2014 was comfortably maintained within our target of 7% 7.5%.
It was down slightly by 40 bps y-o-y, reflecting the competitive pressures on Loan Yields driven by high level of liquidity in the banking sector during 2014.
Our NIM of 7.4% in 2014 was a result of average interest earning assets growing faster than net interest income, coupled with decreasing yields Loan Yield down 190 bps and Liquid Asset Yield down 20 bps which were partially offset by declining Cost of Funding down 100 bps.
As mentioned above, our liquidity levels started to decline in the second-half of the year as a result of a significant pick-up in lending which reduced NIM pressure during the second half.
Net fee and commission income 31 Dec 31 Dec Change GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted 2014 2013 y-o-y Fee and commission income 132,455 115,106 15.1% Fee and commission expense 32,793 28,210 16.2% Net fee and commission income 99,662 86,896 14.7% 46 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Governance Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance statements information We posted a record net fee and commission income of GEL 99.7 million in 2014, delivering growth of 14.7% y-o-y.
This robust growth reflects the ongoing success of our Express Banking strategy, which resulted in the addition of over 200,000 Retail Banking clients, mostly emerging mass market customers, and triggered a significant increase in the volume of banking transactions.
The increase in line with the Express Banking strategy has predominantly come through cost-effective remote channels.
Fee and commission expense increased 16.2% to GEL 32.8 million as a result of fees related to client acquisition costs within the Express Banking strategy.
Another factor contributing to the y-o-y increase in fee expenses was the outsourcing of the Banks cash collection service GEL 2.2 million in 2014, the costs of which effectively shifted from salaries and other employee benefits to fee and commission expense.
The Investment Management business also increased its contribution to our net fee and commission income.

Our healthcare business further strengthened its market leader position in 2014 and enjoys a market share of 22.0% in terms of hospital beds as of 31 December 2014 14.3% as of 31 December 2013.
Our net healthcare revenue increased 109.6% y-o-y to GEL 46.9 million in 2014.
The increase was driven by the strong performance of our healthcare operations, growing organically as well as through acquisitions.
Furthermore, Government-funded universal healthcare programme the Universal Healthcare Programme or UHC favourably affected our healthcare business results.
Finally, as the management shifts its focus to integrating the acquired facilities, it expects to realise significant synergies by upgrading the facilities, centralising the back-office functions and bringing their operational performance in line with the internal targets.
As anticipated, UHC had a negative effect on the health insurance businesses, which has over recent years been significant component of our insurance business.
UHC resulted in a structural shift of private insurers revenues that had previously come from state to the UHC system and away from the private insurance companies.
Furthermore, the shift of revenue to the UHC system did not immediately result in the elimination of associated costs, including insurance claims incurred.
As anticipated, this has had a negative effect on the health insurance businesses.
Notwithstanding these changes, our health insurance business strengthened its position in the market and accounted for 36.7% of the total health insurance sector in Georgia based on gross premiums revenue as of 30 September 2014, up from 28.9% as of 31 December 2013.

Other operating non-interest income increased 13.2% to GEL 85.5 million, primarily as a result of nearly a threefold increase in real estate income to GEL 15.8 million.
Real estate revenue predominantly 2 comprises revenue from the sale of apartments in the second project of m Real Estate, following completion of construction works as well as the handover of apartments.
Net gain from foreign currencies is the second largest contributor to our other operating non-interest income and also increased to GEL 49.6 million, up 14.0% as a result of increased economic activity and higher volatility of Georgian Lari, which significantly increased the number of foreign currency transactions.
The growth was also supported by a 34.9% increase in other operating income to GEL 17.9 million, which predominantly consists of revenue from the Banks wine-making subsidiary, Teliani Valley.
The robust growth was partially offset by a decline in net gain from trading and investment securities from GEL 3.1 million to GEL 0.4 million, which comprises realised gains from investment securities consisting of Government-issued securities.
Net gain from revaluation of investment property, which has declined from GEL 9.8 million in 2013 to GEL 1.9 million in 2014, comprises almost entirely of the revaluation of properties 2 that m Real Estate has earmarked for development.

The y-o-y change in the composition of the balance sheet reflects strong growth of lending in the second half of 2014, particularly in Retail Banking, which drove net loans up by 23.8% to GEL 4,360.7 million.
The pick-up in lending decreased the share of liquid assets to total assets to a comfortable level of 25.1% as at 31 December 2014 from 29.5% as at 31 December 2013, when the liquidity pool was significantly higher due to an issue of Eurobonds in Q4 2013.
Our assets increased 16.2% y-o-y to GEL 7,579.1 million.
The Bank funded its growth predominantly through the excess liquidity.
Additionally, more focus was placed on attracting cheaper Development Financial Institutions DFI funds in order to further reduce the Cost of Funding and as a result we prepaid GEL 114.0 million of DFI funding in 2014 with cheaper funds.
As a result, the share of amounts due to credit institutions to total liabilities increased from 21.9% to 23.7%, with the share of client deposits to total liabilities declining from 58.8% to 55.7%.

The deployment of liquid assets into loans in the second half of 2014 led to a 1.2% y-o-y decline in liquid assets.
Consequently, the NBG liquidity ratio decreased to 35.0% from 45.7% at the end of 2013, against a regulatory requirement of 30.0%.
The pick-up in lending during the period also resulted in a Net Loans to Customer Funds ratio of 130.6% compared to 113.0% a year ago.
