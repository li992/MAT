Hence the level of new product introduction across RS in the last year, at around 34,000, was below prior-year levels and over threequarters of the new products were in the Famous For product categories.
Allied added around 42,000 new products in the year.
This is significantly above Allieds run-rate in recent years, reflecting the addition of products from our RS range from TE Connectivity, Omron, ON Semiconductor, Honeywell, Panasonic and Phoenix Contact, being the first of our major suppliers where we are developing a more consistent global range.
There has been increased cost investment accompanying the delivery of this more consistent global offer.
We have strengthened existing partnerships with leading global brands and signed new global agreements during the year with Fairchild Semiconductor, Parralax, Exar, Philips Lumileds and Red Pitaya, whilst our commitment to promoting new and innovative products was enhanced with our distribution agreement with RepRapPro to bring affordable, open-source 3D printing technology to engineers worldwide.
