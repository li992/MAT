This represents a total return including dividends of 9.5% for the year.

In terms of our KPIs, at 9.5%, the NAV per share total return exceeded the absolute return hurdle of 4.6% RPI plus 3% and narrowly missed the relative hurdle of 10.0% ACWI.
The narrowing of the discount was a factor in the share price total return of 13.3%.

Consistent with the AIC guidance, the OC% excludes: non-recurring items: costs associated with our events subsidiary: LTIPs and performance fees.
In addition, the NAV performance also includes the costs incurred directly or indirectly by external fund managers.
Many of these managers include these costs within their valuations and it is not practical to calculate an OC% from the information they provide.
However to assist shareholders, we have estimated that such external management costs amount to approximately 1.07% of the Companys average net assets.
