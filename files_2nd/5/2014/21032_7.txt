Future growth is underpinned by structural rather than cyclical factors and Emerging Markets economies appear better positioned than Developed Markets to contend with higher global interest rates over the medium term.
Public debt to GDP across Emerging Markets is stable at 34%, and is a fraction of that evident in Developed Markets 106%.
The largest asset class is local currency 86% of total fixed income, reducing the reliance of countries and companies on external creditors.
Further, the majority 88% of local currency debt is held by domestic investors such as pension funds, meaning that emerging economies are fundamentally more resilient to market sell-offs.
Ashmores investment capabilities span the broad universe, and an active management style ensures that opportunities are not limited to the relatively small sub-set of instruments represented in indices.
As a result of these factors there are good prospects for AuM growth over the longer term.
