161 Business review Capital resources The following table analyses RBS's regulatory capital resources on a fully consolidated basis at 31 December as monitored by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA for regulatory purposes.
It is RBS's policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the business.
In carrying out this policy, RBS has regard to the supervisory requirements of the PRA.
The PRA uses risk asset ratio RAR as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are 'weighted' to reflect the inherent credit and other risks : by international agreement, the RAR should be not less than 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%.
At 31 December 2014, RBS's total RAR on an end-point CRR basis was 13.7% 2013 - 16.5% on a Basel 2.5 basis and the Tier 1 RAR on an end-point CRR basis was 11.2% 2013 - 13.1% on a Basel 2.5 basis.
