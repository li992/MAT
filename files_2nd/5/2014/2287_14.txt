Business review Aerospace, Defence & Energy Industrial gas turbines Power generation requires reliable moving parts that can operate for long periods under high loads and extreme temperatures.
For example, the compressor comprises various stages of stationary and rotating blades, each progressively increasing air pressure prior to mixing with fuel and igniting.
Around the clock, turbine blades and vanes must be resistant to oxidation, corrosion and wear, and provide longevity in service.
A combination of heat treatment, Hot Isostatic Pressing HIP and coatings allows industrial gas turbine blades and vanes to operate reliably at these high temperatures for extended periods of time.

In 2014, the Group added capacity in a number of facilities, including a new large furnace for aerospace aluminium heat treatments in California, USA, upgraded vacuum heat treatment capability in France and additional high pressure HIP capacity in Massachusetts, USA.
In the coming year it is expected that capital expenditure will be slightly above depreciation as further capacity and capability are added to support continuing growth in the Groups high value activities.

It is valued as an inert material, able to withstand cleaning and sterilisation, while maintaining corrosion resistance.
Demanding applications such as cutting instruments, trauma, electromechanical devices and motors require the benefits of stainless steel.

Bodycotes S P processes for stainless steel provide hardened surfaces that do not crack or chip, and give superior wear resistance and strength without compromising the base materials corrosion resistance.
