The cash consideration paid was 23.7 million and, on the completion of the transaction, the leasehold fixed asset included within Property, Plant and Equipment at 5.4 million and the related lease creditor of 10.2 million included within financial liabilities were both extinguished.
The resulting credit of 4.8 million was offset against the purchase consideration.
A3.2 BUSINESS REvIEw Operating segments Paragon Mortgages Paragon Mortgages is one of the longest established lending brands in the buy-to-let mortgage market.
Alongside its sister brand, Mortgage Trust, Paragon Mortgages maintains a significant presence for the Group in this growing sector of the UK mortgage market.
Trading activity in the year has been strong, with the segment contributing 80.5 million to underlying Group profit 2013 restated : 70.3 million, an increase of 14.5%.
Total loan assets of the segment at 30 September 2014 were 8,842.9 million, 2.4% higher than the 8,631.6 million a year earlier, of which 8,575.6 million were buy-to-let mortgage assets 30 September 2013: 8,306.9 million.
Further expansion of the Groups mortgage capacity, supported by improvements in funding costs, enabled the Group to increase business volumes significantly, resulting in a pipeline of new business of 414.8 million at the year end.
This was 78.9% greater than the 231.9 million at the end of September 2013 and supports growth levels into the new financial year.
The credit quality of the new lending business written in the year has remained excellent.

indd 19 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report A3.2 Business review continued The increase in available warehouse capacity and the success of the Groups securitisation activity have ensured that the Paragon Mortgages business has been well placed over the year to offer competitive products.
It has taken advantage of the opportunities arising from the strength of the private rented sector and the continuing robustness of the housing market during 2014.
The Group has maintained two distinct propositions, one targeting professional landlords and the other private investor landlords, which together ensured that it has maintained and developed its market position throughout the year.
A recent development has been the alternative funding source for buy-to-let completions provided by Paragon Bank, which enables a wider range of products to be offered and broadens the financing options for the existing production.
The UK housing market has continued to grow throughout 2014 albeit at a reduced pace from the strong recovery reported in 2013.
It is clear that the general improvement in the economy, improving customer confidence and historic and current Government stimuli, including the first time buyers initiative, have assisted in increasing levels of house purchase and remortgage activity.
The Bank of England reported that gross residential mortgage lending in the year ended 30 September 2014 increased by 26.1% compared to the previous year.
Tenant demand has remained robust and landlord activity has continued to increase during the year.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders CML reported that the number of buy-to-let transactions in the year increased by 27.5% while values of buy-to-let advances increased by 35.8% to 25.8 billion 2013: 19.0 billion.
The English Housing Survey for 2012-13, published during the year by the Department for Communities and Local Government, found that the private rented sector in England now provides a home for 18.0% of households and has eclipsed the social rented sector for the first time since the 1960s.
At 30 September 2014 the Groups buy-to-let portfolio stood at 8,592.1 million, compared with 8,324.4 million a year earlier.
The redemption rate on the overall buy-to-let book, although higher than the 2.5% reported for 2013, still remains low at 4.1%.
This performance indicates that Paragons landlords continue to display a long-term commitment to property investment.
New loans continue to be of a high quality, with a good affordability profile, low average loan-to-value ratios and strong customer credit profiles.
The credit performance of the portfolio over the year continued to be exemplary, with the percentage of loans three months or more in arrears note 7 standing at 0.25% as at 30 September 2014 30 September 2013: 0.35% and remaining considerably better than the CMLs comparable market average of 0.78% at that date 30 September 2013: 1.15%.
Security values have also benefitted from the effect of increased house prices.
The Nationwide house price index showed appreciation in residential property values of 9.4% over the year, causing the indexed loan-to-value ratio of the buy-to-let portfolio to reduce to 71.7% from 78.4% at 30 September 2013 note 7.
The increase in average prices, however, is part of a more volatile picture, which has been particularly marked at the local and regional level.
The Group maintains a specialist team of in-house surveyors to maximise its understanding of particular markets, both from a valuation and lettings standpoint.
The number of properties with an appointed receiver of rent reduced by 12.2% to 1,225 at 30 September 2014 30 September 2013: 1,395.
At the end of September 2014, 97.2% of the properties available for letting in the receiver of rent portfolio were let 30 September 2013: 94.8%.
Other assets The Paragon Mortgages operating segment includes income generated from other legacy loan books, including owner-occupied mortgages, car loans, secured consumer loans and unsecured consumer loans.
Save for the management of these books in run-off, there has been little activity in recent years in these areas.
These assets form a very small part of the segments results, when compared to buy-to-let assets and performed in line with our expectations.
Their values are shown below.

indd 20 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report Although the Group has returned to lending in the car finance and secured loan markets, this new lending is through Paragon Bank and is reported under that segment.
Idem Capital Idem Capital has continued to focus on the acquisition of paying loan portfolios and the servicing of its own and third party loan portfolios.
Opportunities are created through the ongoing process of financial institutions disposing of loan assets, either through fide-leveraging activities or business as usual sales.
The UK debt purchase market has remained strong during the year ended 30 September 2014 with each of the larger purchasers reporting increased levels of investments over the period.
The major banks continue to trade both paying and non-paying assets and the market is also supported by continued fide-leveraging activity and on-sells.
Idem Capital has established itself as a major purchaser of consumer debt in the UK, both on its own account and with co-investment partners, and is an active panel member of all the major UK based financial service institutions.
The division has a highly developed loan servicing and collections capability which is used for its own purchases, third party assets and co-investment portfolios.
Idem Capital has invested heavily in its compliance infrastructure over the years and is well-placed to meet the requirements of the change of responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit which passed from the Office of Fair Trading OFT to the Financial Conduct Authority FCA in April 2014.
The financial year has been successful for Idem Capital, with 306.3 million invested in consumer finance assets.
Of this total, 254.7 million was invested in secured portfolios with the balancing 51.6 million invested in unsecured loans 2013: 71.9 million of unsecured loan purchases and 20.9 million as a co-investor.
These acquisitions were financed by 130.6 million of dedicated external funding: the first raised by the Group to be secured on Idem Capital assets, resulting in a total net investment of 175.7 million of Group funds in loan portfolios 2013: 92.8 million.
Idem Capitals investments are summarised below.
Outstanding balance Current year investment 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Loan portfolios 407.2 169.9 306.3 71.9 Co-investments 19.3 23.8 - 20.9 426.5 193.7 306.3 92.8 These investments helped to increase the outstanding value of Idem Capital investments by 120.2% to 426.5 million at 30 September 2014 30 September 2013: 193.7 million.
Of the total carrying value, including co-investments, 63.2% related to loans secured on property, a key point in differentiating the Idem Capital performance from the broader debt purchase sector, where the focus remains on unsecured loans.
The performance of the portfolios acquired and managed by Idem Capital remains strong, with 120 month gross estimated remaining collections ERC of 682.2 million 2013: 353.9 million note 7.
ERC is a standard measure of scale in the debt purchase industry, reflecting likely future cash flows from the acquired portfolios over the next ten years.
At 30 September 2014, cumulative cash receipts totalled 105.3% of the values predicted at the point the loans were acquired.
During the year the division assumed the servicing of a further 26,300 accounts 2013: 50,000 accounts.
At 30 September 2014 the Group managed 146,981 accounts on behalf of third parties 30 September 2013: 161,842, 35.4% of the total managed by the Group 30 September 2013: 43.8%, the reduction being due in part to the acquisition by Idem Capital of previously serviced assets.
With increased availability of funding for investments in the year, the Groups strategy has been to focus its servicing capability on its own investments.
The growth in investment levels, strong cash performance and a continued focus on cost management have led to Idem Capitals contribution to underlying profit for the period reaching 48.1 million 2013 restated : 34.5 million, an increase of 39.4%.

indd 21 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report A3.2 Business review continued During the year, new financing opportunities for purchased assets have been developed, both for new acquisitions and extant assets, expanding the scale and scope of the portfolio investment opportunities the Group is able to consider.
Together with the prospects of continuing vendor activity and the investments made in the year in systems and personnel, the division is well placed as it moves into the new financial year.
Paragon Bank On 18 February 2014 the Group launched its banking subsidiary, Paragon Bank PLC, following authorisation by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
Paragon Bank offers savings and loan products, broadening competition and choice in the UK banking market.
Paragon Bank, regulated by the PRA and by the FCA, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
It is led by Managing Director Richard Doe, previously Chief Executive of ING Direct UK, together with an experienced banking and consumer finance management team and Board of Directors.
During the year, Paragon Bank launched car finance, secured personal loan, buy-to-let mortgage and savings products.
The Group provided capital of 48.9 million to Paragon Bank during the year and expects to provide additional capital over time to support its growth.
The initial costs of setting up the bank, obtaining regulatory authorisation and developing its business systems resulted in a loss for the year in this segment of 6.4 million 2013 restated : 1.3 million.
The new lending businesses within Paragon Bank have only recently become operational and as a result, only modest lending volumes were achieved during 2014 while their franchises are being established.
This should, however, lead to significant growth in lending in the coming year.
Paragon Bank continues to investigate further product developments, where these match its risk appetite.
In addition to organic product development it intends to work with the Idem Capital team where potential asset purchases fit with its risk appetite and business model, thereby broadening the scope of both parts of the Group.
Car finance The UK car market has continued to grow during the year.
September 2014 witnessed 426,000 new car registrations 64 plate which was the highest number for a decade and was the 31st consecutive month of growth.
Additionally, calendar year-to-date registrations to 30 September 2014 were 1,958,000 which is a 9.1% increase on the same period in 2013.
The UK car finance market has also experienced considerable growth with the Finance and Leasing Association FLA reporting total finance granted in the year ended 30 September 2014 up 17.6% at 31.4 billion 2013: 26.7 billion.
There were similar percentage increases for new and used car funding at 20.4 billion and 11.0 billion respectively 2013: 17.5 billion and 9.2 billion.
Paragon Bank launched Paragon Car Finance in February 2014 and has progressed in the establishment of its dealer panel and the promotion of products that meet the new regulatory requirements established following the transfer of responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit from the OFT to the FCA in April 2014.
The initial focus has been on the development of the franchise.
Advances of 5.3 million were made by the year end.
Personal finance The secured personal loans market has enjoyed successive year-on-year growth since October 2012.
Statistics released by the FLA for September 2014 showed year-on-year growth of over 34.6% to 548 million 2013: 407 million.
The total lending volume for the three months ended 30 September 2014 at 150 million represented an increase of 32.7% compared to the corresponding period in 2013 quarter ended 30 September 2013: 113 million.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 22 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 22 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report Paragon Bank entered the market trading as Paragon Personal Finance on 30 September 2014 with an experienced workforce recruited from the Groups previous secured loan business.
The initial activity will centre on ensuring systems perform as expected with broker distribution strengthened quickly thereafter.
Initial broker feedback has been very encouraging.
New market entrants over the last year including Paragon Personal Finance have provided additional stimulus to the market and consumers are benefitting from competitive pricing and product development.
However, at present volumes still remain below pre-crisis levels.
The move in April 2014 from OFT to FCA regulation has not led to any noticeable fall in market activity.
We see longer term growth in the market and look forward to becoming a market leader in it.
Buy-to-let During September 2014 Paragon Bank commenced offering buy-to-let mortgages, using the Groups existing systems and distribution channels, with distinct and complementary products to those offered by Paragon Mortgages.
By the year end 0.5 million of advances had been made with a pipeline of 45.3 million.
The buy-to-let market is discussed in more detail under Paragon Mortgages above.
Savings The UK savings market continues to grow strongly, with household balances increasing by nearly 40 billion in the year.
This strong supply has driven down the rates on offer, with term deposit rates falling by 0.57% over the year.
Paragon Bank offered its first savings accounts to new customers in June 2014 and over the remainder of the year expanded its savings activity: increased rates offered, diversified its product range and invested in advertising.
Accounts are offered through the internet and include fixed and variable rate savings products.
Retail deposits at 30 September 2014 had reached 60.1 million 2013: nil.
Paragon Bank savings products featured in 89 best buy tables during August, September and October 2014 and during October Moneyfacts announced Paragon Bank as a finalist for their Online Savings Provider of the Year award.
The initially restricted savings product range is reflective of the stage of development of the bank.
It has the capability and capacity to extend this range as its funding requirements grow.
The current objective is to offer a limited range of competitive products which meet the needs of our customers.
In addition, in July 2014 the FCA published an interim Cash Savings Market Study, with its key findings being consistent, we consider, with the approach to banking which Paragon Bank has adopted since its launch, positioning it for future regulatory developments.
We expect to build on this initial success and to serve those savers looking for a combination of straightforward systems and competitive products.
Regulation In September 2014, HM Treasury published a consultation paper setting out details of the legislative changes necessary to implement the Mortgage Credit Directive and move second-charge mortgages from the FCAs consumer credit regime to its mortgage regime.
In the same month the FCA published a consultation paper which sets out its proposals for the new second charge lending regime alongside its plans for implementation of the Directive.
We will monitor the progress of the consultations but do not believe that either the implementation of the Directive or change of regime for second-charge mortgages will have a material impact on the operation of any of our businesses.
Paragon welcomes the debate on appropriate regulation of the buy-to-let market and notes the application of the Directive to a small subset of the buy-to-let market.
We believe this will have little impact on our activities.
All relevant Group companies hold the requisite interim permissions from the FCA under the new consumer credit regime and have been allocated a prescribed period during 2015 in which to make applications for full authorisation.
