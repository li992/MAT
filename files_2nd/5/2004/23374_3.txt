14-15 Egg plc Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Business Overview Egg UK Unsecured lending Net lending balance growth was an impressive 1.4 billion for the year against the background of intense competition and the uncertainty created by the auction of Prudentials stake in Egg both of which adversely impacted performance in the first half of the year.
Credit card balance growth was almost 500 million in the second half alone, reecting the success of our new MasterCard offer, stronger acquisition of new Visa Card customers and the continuing impact of our retention programme which includes the anniversary balance transfer offer to existing customers.
2004 saw record volumes of personal loan sales with 2.2 billion disbursed.
The product remains predominantly cross sold to card customers.
Savings The overall result was a 51 million net inow in 2004 compared to 1,545 million net outow last year.
The reduction in outows reects the success of our tactical use of the bonus account offering as part of Eggs funding strategy.
Investments We announced in October 2004 an agreement with Fidelity whereby from Q1 2005, Egg will host Fidelitys Funds Network on its website as its exclusive investment platform.
This partnership will signicantly increase the level of funds Egg can offer its customers to over 900 funds from 56 managers, from its current level of 220 funds from 25 managers.
The new platform will also offer enhanced tools, information and services to all Egg Invest users.
As part of this agreement we have sold our existing funds supermarket business, which has assets under management of around 170 million, to Fidelity Funds Network.
The transaction has resulted in one-off costs of 3 million and will lead to annual savings of a similar amount moving forward.

This compares to our previous run-rate of 15,00025,000 a quarter.
This is consistent with our intention to extend our product range given that research in our customer base shows a high propensity to buy general insurance policies from Egg.
We will continue to raise awareness of our general insurance product range in 2005.
