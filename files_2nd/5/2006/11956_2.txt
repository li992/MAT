OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW Pendragon, the leading car retailer in the UK, has delivered another solid financial performance in 2006.
We increased revenues by 55% to 5.1 billion from 3.3 billion in 2005.
Profits before tax and exceptionals were up by 15% to 68.1 million and earnings per share on this basis increased 12.3% to 7.5 pence.
We made exceptional profits and gains on the sale of fixed assets in the year of 28.3 million.
The gains on the sale of fixed assets were mainly in respect of property sales.
Including these exceptionals, profits before tax were up by 51% to 96.4 million from 63.8 million in 2005 giving basic earnings per share of 10.7 pence.
Our achievements in 2006 have been considerable and have consolidated our position as the leading car retailer in the UK.
We implemented a new divisional management structure which integrated the Reg Vardy business which was acquired early in the year.
We have made significant inroads to the reduction of borrowings which we put in place for the Vardy acquisition.
The roll out of our shared services business model is going well along with the implementation of our in house IT systems.
m 2006% 2005% Revenue 5,101.0% 3,284.5% Underlying operating profit 135.3% 98.8% Exceptional operating items and other income 28.3% 4.5% Operating profit 163.6% 103.3% Finance costs share of joint venture 67.2 % 39.5 % Profit before tax 96.4% 63.8% Earnings per share basic 10.7 p 7.0 p Earnings per share adjusted 7.50 p 6.68 p Dividend per share 3.45 p 2.64 p Dividend The final dividend proposed is 2.0 pence per share, which together with the interim dividend of 1.45 pence gives a full year dividend of 3.45 pence per share, an increase of 30.7% over last year.
We believe that this increase reflects the strong earnings potential and cash generating ability of the enlarged Group.
Strategy and shareholder value Pendragon is the largest independent operator of franchised motor car dealerships in the UK, operating 390 franchises.
We also operate motor car dealerships from nine locations in California and five in Germany.
The UK is the principal market, which accounts for 95% of the Groups revenues.
Pendragon sells a broad range of makes of motor cars and commercial vehicles, has a substantial presence in the UK vehicle leasing, wholesale parts and dealer management software markets.
Last year we successfully pursued our strategy of growing the business in partnership with a range of vehicle manufacturers and generating our income from three principal areas: new car sales, used car sales and aftersales service and parts.
We have created economies of scale through the deployment of more of our own IT systems, by further utilisation of our shared services centre and reducing operational gearing through improved asset utilisation.
Having diverse revenue streams, not simply focused on new car sales, we believe, reduces exposure to the normal retail economic cycles.
One of the benefits that we highlighted at the time of the Vardy acquisition was that it gave us more exposure to the used car market which has continued to perform well and will be a major growth area for us.
Our strategy has delivered, and continues to deliver, outstanding results and in 2006 our after tax return on equity rose to 24.8% compared to 18.8% last year.
We have also seen real growth rates in earnings and dividends.
In 2006 adjusted earnings per share increased by 12.3% and dividends by 30.7%.
Over the past five years our compound adjusted earnings per share growth rate has been 26.4% per annum and in the same period the compound dividend growth rate has been 22.1% per annum.
2 OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED Stratstone Aston Martin Cardiff Our markets We operate in markets which offer excellent growth prospects.
The UK vehicle retailing market is our principal one where changes to franchising rules have freed up the market for acquisitions and consolidation.
Pendragon is the leading player in this consolidation.
The total motor car parc in the UK now stands at around 30 million with annual sales of new and used motor cars of just under 10 million units.
The new car market over the past four years has weakened by 5.25% and is expected, by industry analysts, to stabilise around the 2006 level for the next two years.
The used car market by contrast has continued to perform well.
The size of the market for aftersales has grown in line with the car parc in the UK and tends to be less affected by economic cycles as motor cars require regular maintenance and repair for both safety and performance reasons.
We own a large vehicle leasing and contract hire business in the UK.
The market has been stable and importantly used car residual values have held up well enabling end of contract vehicles to be sold profitably.
The commercial van and truck market in the UK has enjoyed a period of growth in line with the UK economy and is around 0.4 million new units per annum.
The key area in this market is aftersales service which remained strong in 2006.
We have gradually built a presence in the UK market for dealer management systems.
The market for these systems is primarily linked to the number of franchised dealers and is served by a relatively small number of providers.
We mainly sell into the UK market although we see other overseas markets such as North America and South Africa being additional markets for our products.
We see this as a good growth area for our business.
3 Operational Review Our group is structured operationally to reflect the range of business activities undertaken and has six distinct trading entities.
Stratstone Under our Stratstone brand we are the UKs leading luxury motor car retailer with 170 locations.
Stratstone holds franchises to sell and service Aston Martin, BMW, Cadillac, Chrysler Jeep, Corvette, Dodge, Ferrari, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lotus, Maserati, Mercedes Benz, MINI, Saab and Volvo.
New vehicle registrations in this luxury sector declined by 1.2% in 2006 with marques represented by Stratstone down slightly more, by 2.8%.
The used car market was stable year on year with no noticeable weakening of prices.
Income from sales of finance and insurance products was up year on year.
The aftersales market continued to perform well and despite increased cost pressures we managed to maintain gross margins in this area.
The split of activities within the Stratstone brand is detailed below showing the respective share of revenue, gross profit and the gross margins achieved.
Aftersales continued to contribute just under half of the total gross profits.
Trade sales represents cars sent to auction which did not fit Stratstones sales profile.
In aftersales we have developed new products priced specifically for vehicles in the 4 to 6 year old market where we expect to grow our business, whereas historically our focus has been on the 0 to 3 year old car market.
We are including information relating to total units sold and gross profits per unit for the first time this year.
We believe this information will give a better understanding of the dynamics of the business.
Total units sold consists of both new and used cars.
Gross profit per unit is the margin achieved on sales before overheads.

Higher rents of 4.3 million, following the sale of some freehold properties to our property joint venture in 2005, and a loss of 3.5 million in respect of our start up Cadillac retail operation resulted in margins in the existing business reducing by 0.8%.
We set up five greenfield sites during 2006 which normally take two years to establish themselves in their market place.
In the year these greenfield sites made a loss of 0.3 million.
4 Evans Halshaw Ford Chorley Evans Halshaw Vauxhall Chilwell OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED Profits per unit in the existing business were down year on year mainly due to the weakness in the new car market.
Profits per unit and the operating margin in the acquired businesses were higher than the existing business due to a richer mix of franchises.
We have been actively branding our luxury car dealerships as Stratstone during the year and this task has now been largely completed.
This means that moving into 2007 we can increase promotion of the brand and firmly establish it as the leading luxury car retail brand in the UK.
Evans Halshaw Under our Evans Halshaw brand we are the UKs leading volume motor car retailer with 183 locations.
Evans Halshaw holds franchises to sell and service Chevrolet, Citroen, Fiat, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault, Suzuki and Vauxhall.
New car registrations have declined in the volume motor car sector by 3.8% in 2006.
Evans Halshaw does not represent all the makes of volume cars sold in the UK and, for makes represented, national registrations fell by 5.1% year on year.
In general the used car market was good and demand for nearly new used cars continued to be strong.
The aftersales market was in line with the previous year although there has been some pressure on costs especially in terms of wage inflation and utility and fuel prices which led to small declines in margins.
Aftersales continued to contribute a significant proportion of profits and margins held up well despite cost pressures during the year.
These cost pressures were absorbed by increased labour sales and tight control of overhead expenses.
Trade sales represents cars sent to auction which do not fit Evans Halshaws sales profile.
National fleet is sales to daily rental operators at very low margins which distorts the overall margin performance.
The large proportion of profits from aftersales helps to mitigate the effect of economic cycles in that motor vehicles are serviced and repaired at least each year to ensure safety and performance standards are maintained.
The additions we made to our dealership portfolio in 2005 have contributed a further 61.4 million of revenue which has in part offset the reduction in sales of 97.9 million from last years disposals.
Profits per unit in the existing business were down year on year mainly due to the weakness in the new car market.
Profits per unit and operating margin in the acquired businesses were higher than the existing business due to a larger proportion of profits in these dealerships coming from higher margin used car sales.
We have a number of initiatives planned in 2007 to promote the Evans Halshaw brand and in January this year we used our first television advertising campaign in the North West.
We envisage more television campaigns throughout the year.
6 OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED Chatfields Under our Chatfields brand we sell and service commercial vans and trucks in the UK from 21 locations.
Chatfields holds franchises to sell and service Iveco, DAF, LDV and MAN ERF.
The market for new truck sales in 2006 was down by 5.6% overall whereas the van market was up 1.3%.
The market was distorted by regulatory changes last year relating to engine emissions standards which have led operators to delay purchases because of manufacturer price increases on these new cleaner engines.
This tends to be a higher proportion than in the motor car divisions because of the shorter service intervals required for commercial vehicles and the use of overnight servicing in many of the locations.

In common with our other businesses inflationary cost pressures have been managed well.
The 2005 figures included 1.6 million of operating profits and 937 unit sales contributed by our Mercedes-Benz franchise prior to its sale in July 2005.
Leasing We operate under three separate brands for vehicle leasing and contract hire.
The brands are Pendragon Contracts, Bramall Contracts and Vardy Contract Motoring.
Each offers a range of leasing and contract hire products mainly to the small corporate and fleet market and to local authorities.
The market in which we operate is predominantly fleet sizes of up to 1,000 vehicles.
m Revenue Gross profit Gross margin% Underlying Underlying% Fleet %% operating operating% numbers profit margin %% 000s Existing 33.9 8.5 25.1 % 7.1 21.1 % 11.1 Acquired 10.4 2.9 27.4 % 2.5 24.0 % 7.1 Total 2006 44.3 11.4 25.7 % 9.6 22.8 % 18.2 Total 2005 48.5 8.9 18.3 % 7.5 15.5 % 10.8 The existing vehicle fleet remained static during 2006 at eleven thousand units with an average lease period of 30 months.
Profits are mainly generated through the sale of the vehicles at the end of the rental period.
In 2006 we increased the profit per unit on disposal in the Bramall and Pendragon brands by 285 and 166 respectively.
We acquired Vardy Contract Motoring as part of the Reg Vardy acquisition in February 2006.
The performance of this business was much improved in the year with disposal profits per unit up considerably.
7 Quickco Parts Chatfields Commercial Vehicles OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED Quickco The market for parts sales via the independent wholesaler has been significantly enhanced by changes to the franchising laws in the UK whereby franchised dealers need no longer source all their parts from the franchisor.
Under our Quickco brand we are the leading independent genuine parts wholesale business in the UK.
Quickco distributes both genuine manufacturer labelled parts and matching quality parts sourced from the original manufacturers.
Currently 75% of revenues come from Ford related business and we are seeking to diversify by developing other profit streams.
For example, we have been awarded franchises from seven other vehicle manufacturers to distribute their parts.
Quickco has a national business with a fleet of 180 vans making 60,000 deliveries per month on a next day or same day basis.
m Revenue Gross profit Gross margin% Underlying Underlying% %% operating operating% profit margin %% Existing 74.0 18.9 25.6 % 4.9 6.7 % Acquired 5.2 1.3 26.0 % 0.1 2.0 % Total 2006 79.2 20.2 25.6 % 5.0 6.4 % Total 2005 74.6 18.1 24.2 % 3.6 4.9 % Revenues in 2006 for the existing business were in line with the previous year.
The improvements in the operating profit have been achieved through a combination of better buying from its main suppliers and through a reduction in overheads.
The overhead reductions were realised mainly by cutting out a number of inefficient delivery routes.
Looking forward, we aim to expand our product lines and build on our new franchise relationships.
Pinewood Under our Pinewood brand we are the UKs third largest provider of software solutions to the retail motor industry.
The principal product is Pinnacle which is a web enabled dealer management system designed with manufacturer interface and modules for vehicle sales and marketing, aftersales and bookkeeping and accounts generation.
The market for technology solutions in the industry continues to grow especially for software packages which are simple to deploy and require minimal training.
Under the CFC brand other products are sold which include fleet and workshop management solutions.
Currently CFC has customers in over 20 countries.
m Revenue Gross profit Gross margin% Underlying Underlying% %% operating operating% profit margin %% Total 2006 25.4 15.2 59.8 % 5.3 21.0 % Total 2005 22.2 11.3 51.0 % 2.9 13.0 % At the end of 2006 we had over 7,000 Pinnacle user licences in place in over 400 dealerships in the UK.
About 40% of the licences have been sold to third party dealers with the balance being used in Group.
The Pinnacle product was launched three years ago and sales are now gathering momentum.
We have recently secured our first overseas contract for Pinnacle in South Africa.
We now have a development team of 40 which is actively working on existing and new products.
9 California The California business consists of nine locations in Southern California which operate franchises for Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin and Saab.
A significant difference is the lower proportion of used car gross profit due to a traditional emphasis on new car sales in this market.
m Revenue Gross profit Gross margin% Underlying Underlying% Total units Gross %% operating operating% sold profit per profit margin %% 000 unit Existing 201.8 32.2 16.0 % 7.8 3.9 % 6.2 2,513 Disposed 13.0 1.4 11.1 % 1.3 9.7 % 0.4 890 Total 2006 214.8 33.6 15.7 % 6.5 3.0 % 6.6 2,417 Total 2005 217.6 33.6 15.4 % 7.0 3.2 % 7.4 2,123 Excluding the impact of the change in the dollar sterling exchange rate, revenues in the USA were marginally ahead of 2005.
Sales of Range Rover Sport were very strong throughout the year which contrasted with sales of Jaguar which were poor.
The same was true in aftersales where Land Rover had a good year whereas Jaguar was down year on year.
Overall operating margins are similar to last year although they should improve going forward as, towards the end of the year, we sold our Lincoln Mercury dealership and closed our Saab operation in South Bay.
Both businesses were loss making.
We were pleased to open our custom built Jaguar and Land Rover dealership in Mission Viejo in December and this year we are redeveloping our Land Rover site in Newport Beach to take Land Rover, Jaguar and Aston Martin franchises.
We look forward to completing that development later this year.
Mission Viejo USA Jaguar 10 OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED Germany Our German dealerships remain a relatively small part of the Group, contributing just 1% of revenues.
In 2006 their performance improved at operating profit level by 1.5 million to a small loss of 0.3 million.
We reduced the number of sites during the year which leaves five remaining around Frankfurt and Munich.
IT roll out and central services Our scale allows us to invest in information technology solutions and to use a shared services business model.
Over the last year we have implemented 83 new Pinnacle systems in our own dealership group and it is planned to have all our locations on the new operating platform by the end of 2007.
Our shared service centre now has a team of 425 providing a range of services to around half of our Group including call centre and accounting.
The financial benefits for the Group are accounted for in the divisions for which they perform the services.
Acquisitions and Disposals We acquired the entire share capital of Reg Vardy plc in February 2006.
We paid 504.2 million and acquired a business with 97 motor car franchises which enhanced our geographic coverage in the UK.
Vardy held franchises which were complementary to those held by Pendragon and furthered our strategic growth plans.
The process of integrating Vardy with Pendragon was prolonged due to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading to determine whether there were any areas where competition was substantially reduced as a consequence of the takeover.
As a result of the investigation we agreed to sell four dealerships out of our portfolio.
The delay to the integration and consequent disruption of having to manage the Vardy businesses separately until November is now behind us.
The Vardy and Pendragon businesses have been integrated as part of the overall restructure of the Group last year.
In March 2006 we purchased the business of Speeds Motor Group which consists of nine Volvo and three Chrysler Jeep dealerships.
The dealerships are predominantly located in the East Midlands.
We also acquired five Peugeot and one Citroen dealership to add to our Evans Halshaw division.
Property Our strategy is to ensure the maximum utilisation of property assets by maximising throughput: that surplus properties are disposed of so as to maximise proceeds, which may involve a change of use: and to utilise our property joint venture structure where appropriate in order to release cash to be invested in higher yielding business assets.
As planned we completed a major sale and leaseback transaction in December 2006 with our property joint venture.
We sold 79 properties with a net book value of 191 million for a total consideration of 250 million.
As a consequence of the interest we have retained in the properties through the joint venture structure, we are not able to recognise the entire disposal profits in the income statements in our accounts although all the cash has been received.
The profit we are able to recognise on the transaction in our income statement is 17.7 million.
The joint venture structure gives us operational flexibility mainly through being able to substitute properties.
In addition to the joint venture transaction we disposed of a further eleven properties which were operationally surplus to requirements.
Included was the property at Solihull Business Park on which we made a profit of 10 million.
Cash flow Our borrowings as at 31 December 2006 were 369.7 million compared to 177.0 million at the end of 2005.
At the time of the Vardy acquisition, in early 2006, we said our target would be to reduce our borrowings to more normal levels by the end of 2007.
We are well on course to achieve this target with reductions from a combination of good cash flow from operations and property and business disposals.
11 The cash flows of the business may be summarised as follows: m 2006 2005 Cash generated from operations 219.4 130.4 Net interest paid 67.2 43.2 Tax 24.2 16.6 Replacement capital expenditure 43.8 45.2 Free cash flow 84.2 25.4 Acquisitions 570.2 60.8 Disposals 312.9 119.7 Dividend 17.4 15.6 Other 2.2 1.1 Increase reduction in net debt 192.7 69.8 Cash flow generated from operations was 219.4 million, which compares with 130.4 million generated in 2005.
This is made up of two key components, operating profit and working capital movements.
The operating profit element after adding back depreciation, intangible charges and property profits was 206.2 million, up 61.3 million on the 144.9 million in 2005.
In respect of working capital we made a net reduction of 13.2 million which is after 23.1 million of final salary pension schemes funding.
In 2005 we had a net increase in working capital of 14.5 million.
Net interest paid has increased year on year.
This reflects the higher borrowings during the year following the acquisitions and increased interest rates in the second half.
Replacement capital expenditure was 43.8 million which includes plant and machinery, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles 2005: 45.2 million.
Expenditure on plant and machinery and fixtures and fittings was 11.5 million, up slightly on the 9.1 million in 2005.
The balance of the expenditure of 32.3 million 2005: 36.1 million is in respect of motor vehicles used either for our contract hire fleet or for service loan cars for our customers.
Acquisitions consist of businesses purchased during the year and property developments.
In 2006 we have spent 540.9 million which includes the cost of acquiring Reg Vardy and its associated borrowings, our 15.1 million investment in the property joint venture plus the acquisition of 18 other dealerships.
Dealership property developments totalled 28.3 million 2005: 19.2 million.
Business disposals raised 23.1 million in 2006 2005: 16.2 million, which related to the sale of six dealerships.
Property disposals raised 289.8 million 2005: 103.5 million.
This includes the disposal of properties in December to our property joint venture company.
Financing costs The total net interest charge for the year of 67.6 million includes bank interest, vehicle stocking charges and finance charges of 38.8 million, 25.5 million and 3.3 million respectively.
Cover for bank interest was 2.9 times compared with 4.5 times in 2005.
Tax The overall effective tax rate for the year was 30.0 per cent 2005: 32.4 per cent.
The reduction in tax rate in 2006 was due to certain one off tax credits.
12 OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED Treasury Information regarding treasury policy and procedures together with details of financial risk management are set out in the notes to the financial statements.
Pension Funds In 1999 we stopped accepting new members into our final salary schemes.
During 2006 we took the difficult decision to cease future accruals in all the final salary schemes that were in operation due to the unpredictable nature of the cost of operating these arrangements.
The final salary schemes deficit before tax now stands at 65.1 million, a reduction of 25.2 million.
All members of the final salary schemes are now either deferred or pensioner members.
In the 2005 financial statements the Group applied the corridor method to recognise actuarial gains and losses and spread them over the expected working lives of employees in the plans.
We have changed this policy to recognise all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans directly in equity each year.
This change in accounting policy was due to the closure of the schemes to future accruals, and as employees no longer participate in the plan the service period over which the corridor movements are spread is nil.
As a consequence the directors consider it is no longer appropriate to spread the gains and losses over the service period and the comparative balance sheet has been restated in line with the new policy.
Share capital During the year a five for one share split was implemented, increasing the number of shares in issue to 656,027,350 including 18,750 shares issued during the year through the share option scheme.
Comparative data in the report and accounts which is calculated based on the number of shares in issue, such as earnings per share and dividends per share, have been restated to reflect the share split.
Outlook The outlook remains positive for the Group with Pendragon the clear leader in a highly fragmented market.
The Vardy acquisition has given us greater scale and more of our businesses have adopted the Pinnacle IT platform and shared service model.
The new divisional structure now in place has been designed to enable the Group to continue to expand and to optimise scale economies.
We have a positive view on the used car market and believe that the Group is well placed to expand its business in this market in 2007 and grow its like for like unit sales volumes.
Profits from new car sales have become less important for the Group as we have expanded our used car revenues and continue to derive a significant proportion of profits from aftersales.
As far as aftersales is concerned we see the market continuing to be stable and through some initiatives we have taken this year will see our revenues grow.
Pinewood now has a strong foothold in the dealer management systems market in the UK and we expect to increase third party sales this year.
We may see some reduction in profits in our leasing business in 2007 due to fewer cars being returned for disposal and we expect Quickco, our parts wholesale business, to have a good year in 2007.
We have put new operating structures in place during 2006 which are now settled and each division has its sights set firmly on achieving their objectives in 2007.
We have set a number of objectives at Group level this year which include reducing the gearing as planned, implementing the Pinnacle system in all our dealerships and driving forward total shareholder returns.
Our strategy has delivered superior returns for shareholders over the years and we look forward to continuing that into 2007.
