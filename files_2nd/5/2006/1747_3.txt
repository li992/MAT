share refer to results from continuing operations, before amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.
We believe that these adjusted results provide a better comparison of underlying performance.
An analysis of amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items and discontinued businesses is presented in separate sections of the review.
The financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards and comparative numbers for financial year 2005 have been restated accordingly.
Details of how the 2005 prior year results were adjusted are included in the notes to the group financial statements.
The 2005 06 Financial Year continued the successful trend set in previous years with turnover growing by a further 15% and operating profits before amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items by 20%.
Earnings per share increased to 17.18p, an increase of 19% compared to last year.
The improvement in operating profit is particularly pleasing given the previously forecast fall off in contribution from Technical Services 9.0 million compared to 14.3 million in 2005.
Operating profit growth across our other divisions including a full year contribution from the Peterhouse businesses was 13.7 million or 50%.
Contract wins in Eastern Regional Prime, Network Rail High Output and the extension to the contract for the management of HM Naval Base Clyde give us confidence that growth will be sustained.
The contract for the Royal School of Military Engineering is now in the final stages of its approval process within the Military of Defence and we expect to move to financial close in mid 2007.
We continue in the high quality bid submitted for the Defence Training Review where a decision on the preferred bidder is expected in October 2006.
These two contracts would add an estimated 100 million to turnover in a full year.
During 2005 06, and shortly after year end, we disposed of the remaining non-core businesses acquired with the Peterhouse Group, and subsequent to the year end, we acquired the Alstec business, which is addressed within Acquisitions in this Business review.
Each of the businesses, which we now operate, is highly rated in its respective market and is therefore well placed to take a substantial share of the growth opportunities available to it.
Babcock International Group PLC 08 Annual report and accounts 2006 Business review continued On target Babcock International Group PLC 09 Annual report and accounts 2006 2005 06 was an excellent year for Defence Defence Services Services, with turnover increasing by 11% and operating profit by 30%.
Turnover Operating profit Looking forward, the securing of the Regional Prime East Contract where delivery 271.7m 21.8m of service began only in March 2006 and the 2005: 245.1m 2005: 16.8m extension to the contract for HM Naval Base Clyde, give us confidence that growth will continue in 2006 07.
Revenues from these two contracts are in excess of 120 million a year.
Contribution to group turnover We are also confident that an extension will be granted for the Single Living Accommodation 32% Modernisation SLAM programme which will further strengthen Babcocks position as the leading supplier of built infrastructure support to the Ministry of Defence.
We continue to obtain additional revenue from Prime Contracts and are in active negotiation with Defence Estates on a number of additional projects, which we expect will increase revenue and profits on each of the South-West and Eastern Prime Contracts.
Babcock International Group PLC 10 Annual report and accounts 2006 Business review continued We have continued to manage the expected Technical Services temporary decline in warship refit activity at Rosyth and have succeeded in retaining Turnover Operating profit a profitable business.
The Design and Technology businesses, Supply Chain Services 130.5m 9.0m and the Nuclear Decommissioning businesses 2005: 159.0m 2005: 14.3m each made excellent profit contributions during the year and are well placed to deliver future growth.
In the current year only 40% of revenue is expected to be provided by the Contribution to group turnover warship refit business.
Recent allocations of ship refit work will 16% provide a greater volume of work than had been previously anticipated for the current financial year and as an expression of its confidence in the Rosyth business, the Ministry of Defence has agreed to extend its responsibility for redundancy costs at Rosyth until March 2007.
The Secretary of State for Defence has confirmed Rosyth as the site for the final assembly and integration of the CVF future aircraft carrier and we are participating fully in the Aircraft Carrier Alliance.
We have already been awarded an initial contract for the early production design and planning stages of the project.
Whilst the Ministry of Defence has not yet indicated a start date for construction, we would expect this to be in 2008 09.
The moves by the Ministry of Defence away from direct competition in the warship refit market in favour of establishing an industry alliance are also expected to bring benefits to Rosyth in terms of workload and margin predictability.

Margins in the rail business continue to be lower than in our other businesses but we Contribution to group turnover are addressing this through the replacement of the outdated IT systems inherited with the 26% Peterhouse acquisition.
The replacement of these systems is now largely complete and we expect to make significant savings in overheads in the Rail business over the next twelve months.
Network Rail continues to improve the performance of the infrastructure and has secured funding over the next three years and the probability is that the regulator will be prepared to continue funding at current levels for a significant period.
We continue to work with Network Rail to improve efficiencies and productivity.
