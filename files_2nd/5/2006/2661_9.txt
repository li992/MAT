Administrative expenses fell from $373.1 million to $350.5 million, the prior year having been impacted by skin-related settlement costs of $145.8 million and IPO-related expenses of $22.6 million.
Excluding these non-recurring expenses, administration expenses increased by 71%.
This reflected a $47.6 million increase in sharebased payments driven by new issues of nil-cost options to management following the passing of the UIGEA, and a share-based payment charge arising from payments made by the Bonita Trust to past and present employees of the Group.
