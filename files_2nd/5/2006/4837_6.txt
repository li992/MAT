In total, the Group repurchased and cancelled 127.15 million shares at an average price of 156.35 pence, representing 6.52 per cent of the issued share capital at the start of the programme.
Cost savings In the period, the Group delivered 32 million of cost savings.
Further savings of 25 million are being targeted for 2006 07.
Pensions As part of the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS during the period, the Group has applied IAS 19 Employee benefits.
IAS 19 is similar to the equivalent UK accounting standard FRS 17 and accordingly, the figures shown for the comparative period 30 April 2005 are the same as those disclosed under UK GAAP last year.
The principal pension scheme is the UK defined benefit scheme and under IAS 19, the net deficit is brought onto the balance sheet.
At 29 April 2006, excluding deferred tax benefits, this deficit amounted to 141.7 million 30 April 2005 186.5 million.
Including deferred tax benefits the deficit amounted to 99.8 million 30 April 2005 130.5 million.
The charge to operating profit for this scheme was 18.3 million 2004 05 21.4 million and represents the cost of additional benefits accruing to employees in the period together with the cost of benefits relating to past service.
Also included in the income statement is a net financing cost of 0.6 million 2004 05 income of 2.1 million which represents the expected return on assets of the scheme, based on market conditions prevailing at the start of the financial period, offset by the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the scheme.
The Group has been implementing a programme of changes to pension arrangements in order to address the deficit over the longer term, including the gradual increase in the Company contribution rate which is currently 11.9 per cent, and is set to rise to 12.9 per cent in August 2006.
The final salary section of the UK pension scheme was closed to new members on 1 September 2002.
Going concern After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections and borrowing facilities available, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
