04 70252 2 REPORT 1 3 07 12:36 Page 7 Contract related risks The Group undertakes several hundred contracts each year and the commercial risk we take on each contract will depend on the nature and complexity of the works, the duration of the contract and the contractual terms under which the work is carried out.
In order to manage this risk we have a rigorous approach to contract selection to ensure that the works we undertake match our capabilities and resources, that the contractual terms are acceptable and that the contracts are scrutinised and approved by the appropriate level of management.
Market related risks The market sectors in which the Group operates are impacted by general macro economic conditions and Government spending priorities.
As a result the condition of each sector will change over time and it is important that the Group responds to these changes by modifying the level of resources deployed in each division.
This risk is managed by monitoring the order book and pipeline of opportunities and by gathering formal and informal market intelligence.
Regulatory environment The regulatory environment is constantly changing and the Group needs to ensure that it remains compliant with relevant legislation so as to avoid reputational damage and any financial impact of non-conformance.
This risk is managed through briefings by our advisors to our employees on relevant topics and legislative changes as they occur and through regular updating of the Groups policies and procedures.

It is a national business operating in both the public and private sectors.

Bluestone enters 2007 with a forward order book of 491m 2005: 504m.
The division also has a number of potential contracts driven by investment led projects in the health and emergency services sectors which we expect will underpin modest growth of this division in 2007.

In 2006 the division delivered an operating profit of 5.1m 2005: 6.0m on revenue of 324m 2005: 248m.
The margin was impacted by a restructuring of the business during the year and also by mobilisation costs on a number of recently won contracts.
In March the division acquired from M J Gleeson plc its non-track rail business for 22.8m.
This business, which specialises in station refurbishment and underground works, has performed well and contributed an operating profit of 1.0m on revenue of 21m.

This forward order book includes key projects such as the A876 Upper 248 Forth Crossing at Kincardine, Belfast sewer tunnels, M1 widening at junctions 25 to 28, as well as frameworks with United Utilities, which runs the gas mains system on behalf of Northern Gas Networks, and E. ON UKs power distribution business Central Networks, which have helped to lengthen the order book.
Overall the market outlook for infrastructure projects is much improved.
The recently secured contracts are continuing to mobilise and we anticipate strong growth for this division in 2007.

During the year the division secured major new schemes at Beswick and Garston-under-Bridge and was appointed preferred bidder for a 200m PFI housing scheme in Manchester, which is expected to commence in mid-2007.
The Decent Homes programme also continues to account for a significant proportion of the divisions workload.
The margin increased to 5.9% 2005: 4.8% as a result of a more favourable work mix.
Lovell starts 2007 with an order book of 1.4bn 2005: 1.3bn.
While the Decent Homes programme is expected to continue through to at least 2012, the division anticipates growth in the medium term to be primarily driven by larger, more complex urban regeneration schemes.
Lovells work mix is therefore expected to move towards these larger schemes over the coming years.

The Groups approach is to develop a culture of good corporate citizenship as seen in its actions and activities.
The Groups CSR strategy remains focussed on those areas which are significantly impacted by its day to day operations and on issues that affect the long term competitiveness of its operations.
The four key areas of impact were identified as: social: developing the well being and health of employees, improving skill levels and promoting equal opportunities.
In addition, through the activities of the divisions, the Group is able to exert a positive influence on the wider communities in which it operates health & safety: seeking to develop safe working conditions in which the risk of potential accidents is identified and actions are taken to manage those risks environment: developing an understanding of the Groups carbon footprint and striving to reduce any aspects of environmental degradation associated with its activities.
In particular the management and control of waste and energy consumption is important with the Groups supply chain partners playing a key part in this process commercial: the Group recognises that it has a key role to play in being a successful and growing business from which employment and training opportunities flow Given the diversity of the Groups activities, each division is developing its own CSR response to these areas consistent with the Groups values.
The Group has however identified a number of key performance indicators specific to each area against which each divisions progress will be monitored.
The Groups CSR Forum comprises representatives from each of the Groups divisions, together with Paul Whitmore, who is the executive director responsible for CSR on behalf of the Board, the Groups head of procurement and the deputy company secretary, who chairs the Forum.
