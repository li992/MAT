Higher demand from Asia, in particular China, strong demand from Europe, and large inflows of investment fund capital into base metals drove up metal prices.
The strength of copper prices in 2006 has led to previously uneconomic projects becoming viable, leading to expectations of a worldwide increase in supply capacity.
To this end, a number of new sources of copper supply are expected to come on-stream in 2007.
The likelihood of strikes at major producers has also been reduced.
Another factor determining the direction of copper prices going forward will be the behaviour of investment fund capital.
Historically, Kazakhmys has been flexible as to where it sells its copper.
The proximity to China and good infrastructure links to Western Europe gives access to both markets, with demand in both areas expected to be robust in 2007.
The majority of copper sales are made under annual supply contracts at a fixed premium, with the remainder sold on the spot market.
During 2006, Kazakhmys saw attractive commercial terms with customers in Europe which led to the majority of copper cathode production being sold to that region, with growing volumes directed to the top OUR LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS TAKE ADVANTAGE Mediterranean markets.

China is the worlds main growth driver for copper consumption whose refined production for 2006 was estimated to be 3,050 kt and consumption at 3,967 kt, resulting in an import requirement of 917 kt.
In 2007, the forecast import requirement is expected to reduce slightly.
The continued lack of clarity concerning the Chinese governments policy towards re-exports and tax rebates, and a possible move to global oversupply in 2007, has prompted Chinese customers to put downward pressure on supplier premiums under annual contracts.
