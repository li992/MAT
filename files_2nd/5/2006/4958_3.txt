For example, during 2006 we committed 17 million 40%, representing a 5% improvement on our current to condenser and feed system plant improvements to baseload efficiency of 38%, and deliver annual savings enhance efficiency and reliability.
The work will be undertaken of one million tonnes of CO. 2 during planned outages in 2007 and 2008 with an expected payback of four to five years.
In December 2006, we announced that we had decided to proceed with a 100 million investment project to upgrade the high pressure and low pressure turbine modules on all six generating units to improve efficiency.
Using proven technology we expect to achieve an overall baseload efficiency that is, the ratio of energy out to energy in when operating at full capacity approaching 40%.
This represents a 5% improvement on current baseload efficiency of 38%.
Installation, which will be undertaken during the planned outage programme, is expected to take place between 2008 and 2011 although some work may be undertaken in 2007.
Total costs of 100 million are expected to be incurred on this project over the next five years.
When complete the project is expected to deliver annual savings of one million tonnes of CO emissions allowances and approximately half 2 a million tonnes of coal.
The 2006 Energy Review and the expected changes in the co-firing regime have allowed us to formalise our target to produce 10% of our output from burning biomass by the end of 2009.
Achievement of this target is expected to result Reducing emissions in savings of over two million tonnes of CO2 emissions allowances, the displacement of approximately one million CO2 savings of over tonnes of coal and the generation of in excess of two and a half million ROCs per annum.
To achieve the target will two million tonnes require additional investment in people and infrastructure.
The 2006 Energy Review and the expected changes Specifically the Board has recently approved the investment in the co-firing regime have allowed us to formalise of up to 47 million over the next three years to extend our our target to produce 10% of our output from burning direct injection capability from one generating unit to all six biomass by the end of 2009.
Achievement of this target generating units and to install the necessary processing and is expected to result in annual savings of over two million handling infrastructure to ensure we are able to handle up tonnes of CO2 emissions allowances.
to 1.5 million tonnes of biomass material per annum.
Biomass material can be provided in various forms, from untreated to pre-processed.
Drax will evaluate the make-or-buy economics of alternative sources and forms of biomass material and where appropriate will consider additional investment where this produces added value.
For example, the Board has recently approved in principle an investment of up to 20 million to build a rape seed crusher plant to produce rape meal and rape oil and which will also provide a valuable insight into rape seed market dynamics.
