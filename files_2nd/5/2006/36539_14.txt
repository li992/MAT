During 2006 we agreed over 140 rent reviews in the UK.
We agreed rent reviews in respect of leases with passing rents of 15.6 million, giving rise to an increase in rents of 4.5 million per annum.
We anticipate that reviews remaining to be settled from 2006 could increase annual rents by a further 5.4 million.

The increase in rental income in 2007 of 25.2 million to 44.1 million for those assets shown in the table above, should result in an increase in profit before tax of approximately 10 million after taking account of the associated cost of finance.
There are six major developments underway at present.
The income contracted in respect of these projects included in the table above for 2009 is 10 million.
On full letting we estimate that passing rents on these schemes will be 71 million, as shown in the table overleaf.
