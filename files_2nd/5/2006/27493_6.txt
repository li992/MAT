OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS Northern Rock is a specialised lender whose core business is the provision of secured residential lending, secured commercial lending and unsecured personal finance in the UK.
Funding is obtained from both on-shore and off-shore personal savings, wholesale money markets, from the securitisation of loans and from covered bonds.
Income is also generated from the sale of third party insurance products.
Residential mortgage and retail savings products are distributed to retail customers through a diversified distribution network with an emphasis on cost efficiency.
The network consists of 72 branches and mortgage centres, postal, telephone and internet operations.
A large proportion of our residential mortgage business is sourced indirectly via independent financial advisers and the introducer market.
All lending activities are carried out in the UK, whereas funding, particularly non-retail funding, is attracted globally.
NORTHERN ROCKS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES Efficiency is paramount to the Northern Rock business strategy.
Cost efficiency enables competitive pricing for both savings and lending products, leading to volume and income growth supporting further improvements in cost ratios.
Capital efficiency is achieved by optimising the use of debt and equity capital as well as by the securitisation of loans.
Northern Rock has well established strategic targets against which its financial performance is monitored.
These targets, which were all achieved on an underlying basis in 2006, are set out in the following table: Strategic 2006 Performance 2005 Performance Targets Reported Underlying Reported Underlying Growth in total assets 20% 5% 22.1% 23.9% 27.5% 24.9% Growth in profits attributable to all shareholders 20% 5% 31.2% 19.1% 2.8% 13.6% Return on equity 20% 25% 23.5% 21.9% 19.3% 20.8% Following the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the balance sheet and income statement are subject to a certain amount of volatility.
This particularly arises from accounting for hedges which although economically effective are deemed under IFRS rules to be ineffective.
In addition, volatility arises from fair value movements on derivatives taken out to minimise risk in respect of certain financial liabilities and instruments included in non shareholders equity which themselves are not subject to fair value treatment.
Where appropriate, such volatility is separately identified in the review of financial and operating results to enable underlying performance to be separately identified.
Underlying total assets also exclude the fair value of derivative instruments due to volatility in such values.
Further detail is given on page 45.
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK Northern Rock distributes products through multiple channels, with all channels focused on sales activity and the administration of mortgages and savings products delivered though efficient centralised units.
The distribution network is targeted to achieve volume growth, principally in residential mortgage lending and insurance sales, and to support the Groups retail funding objectives.
Developments in the network have focused on delivering the needs of both introducers and direct customers in a cost efficient manner.
Key features of our distribution network for the Groups products are set out below: Intermediaries Distribution through intermediaries accounted for approximately 89% of new mortgage lending in 2006 as compared with 90% in 2005.
Northern Rock has developed excellent relationships with both large firms of introducers and groups of smaller intermediaries, giving wide access to national mortgage distribution.
Depending on the arrangements in place between Northern Rock and a particular intermediary, they are compensated for introducing mortgage business in line with general market practice.
Management expects that strong relationships with intermediaries will continue to be an important element of Northern Rocks distribution strategy.
Northern Rock Online 90% of intermediary business is routed via the Northern Rock Online system.
The system allows intermediaries to input their clients details and obtain instant online decisions before proceeding through to full application.
Intermediaries are then updated on the progress of each of their cases via automatic e-mail updates.
Branches Traditionally branches were a major source of mortgage lending and retail funding for retail banks.
In recent years Northern Rock achieved volume growth and geographical spread in its core markets through alternative and more cost efficient distribution means which resulted in a reduction in its branch network, which was located mainly in the North of England.
However, there are opportunities to increase sales through branches and Northern Rock will open a small number of new outlets in selected geographic locations to take advantage of this potential.
34 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued Northern Rock has 72 branches which offer core residential mortgage and retail savings products excluding postal and telemarketing products, personal lending and third party insurance.
Telemarketing Telemarketing plays an increasingly important role in generating retail funding and new residential mortgage lending.
Northern Rock Direct is a telephone-based direct marketing and selling operation.
It sells mortgages and associated third party insurance products through telephone contact with customers initiated by advertising and inclusion of products in best buy tables featured in most national and regional newspapers.
Northern Rock also operates a standalone mortgage retention unit which is key in retaining existing customers.
Postal Retail Funding Postal accounts play an important role in generating new retail funding.
Postal funding incorporates ISA products for those that look for tax efficient savings, Fixed Rate Bonds for those looking to obtain a longer term guaranteed rate, and Northern Rocks Silver Savings range for savers over the age of 50.
Offshore Retail Funding Since 1996 Northern Rock has enhanced its retail funding franchise by extending distribution geographically into new markets where there are opportunities to grow new business.
Northern Rock now operates a branch in Ireland, with an office in Dublin and a subsidiary company, Northern Rock Guernsey which is located in the Channel Islands.
More recently, Northern Rock extended its retail funding distribution into Continental Europe, opening Northern Rock Savings Bank in Denmark on 7 February 2007.
Regional Commercial Lending Centres Northern Rock operates a specialist team of Development Managers and support staff for its Commercial Lending business and these are based from 7 Regional Commercial Lending Centres.
This team interacts both directly with customers and specialist intermediaries.
FINANCIAL HISTORY Northern Rock aims to maintain high and profitable growth whilst retaining a low risk profile.
This is evident in Northern Rocks demonstrable record of high asset and profit growth.

Total assets for 2001 to 2003 represent assets under management, which comprised total balance sheet assets plus non-recourse finance.
There is no difference between total assets and assets under management in 2004 to 2006 following the introduction of IFRS.

These assets are funded through a well diversified range of funding sources, comprising on-shore and off-shore retail funding, wholesale funding, securitisation and covered bonds.
All of our funding arms performed well during 2006, with improvements in pricing for issues from both our securitisation and covered bond programmes.
At 31 December 2006, total assets on a statutory and an underlying basis excluding fair value adjustments exceeded 100 billion for the first time.
On an underlying basis, total assets were 23.9% higher than at the previous year end and on a statutory basis increased by 22.1%.

For 2001 to 2003 attributable profit was prepared under UK GAAP.
For the periods after 2003, statutory attributable profit is stated under IFRS.
For 2004 underlying results, attributable profit is based on unaudited proforma 2004 results.
Proforma results incorporate the impact of IFRS, where it was possible to determine what the impact would have been if the accounting changes had been effective in 2004.
The proforma results shown for 2004 include the impacts of changes to accounting rules relating to effective interest rate and the reclassification of certain financial instruments from debt to equity, but exclude the effects of hedge accounting under IFRS which differs from that applied under UK GAAP.
During 2006, the strategic target range for annual growth in underlying profits attributable to all shareholders was increased to 20% 5%, on a like for like basis from 15% 5% recognising that it is likely to take a couple of years to achieve the centre of this range.
In addition, the return on equity target range increased to 20% 25%.
This increase reflects the robustness of Northern Rocks business model.
36 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued 2006 OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE LENDING During 2006, Northern Rock achieved record levels of total lending.
Total gross lending was 32,989 million, an increase of 22.7% 2005 26,879 million, with total net lending of 16,621 million, an increase of 14.2% 2005 14,555 million.
Prospects for 2007 are good, with a total opening pipeline of 6,230 million 1 January 2006 5,300 million including a residential lending pipeline of 5,815 million 1 January 2006 4,779 million, an increase of 21.7%.
An analysis of new lending by portfolio is set out in the following table: Residential Commercial Unsecured Total m m m m 2006 Gross 28,972 423 3,594 32,989 Net 15,090 40 1,491 16,621 Closing balances 77,292 1,560 7,277 86,129 2005 Gross 23,618 408 2,853 26,879 Net 13,350 5 1,200 14,555 Closing balances 62,257 1,523 5,789 69,569 Note: Gross and net lending represents net cashflows excluding fair value adjustments.
Closing balances are stated including fair value adjustments.
The composition of our lending portfolios has continued to be low risk.
At 31 December 2006, 90% of our loans to customers were residential secured loans 31 December 2005 90%, 2% commercial secured loans 31 December 2005 2% and 8% within our personal unsecured portfolios 31 December 2005 8%.
This mix is not expected to change significantly going forward.
RESIDENTIAL UK MARKET The UK residential lending market remained buoyant throughout 2006 resulting in gross lending for the year of 345 billion, an increase of 20% over the 288 billion seen in 2005.
Gross lending associated with house moving represented around 60% of lending with 40% driven by remortgage activity.
Remortgage activity reflects increased market liquidity following the removal of overhanging early repayment charges.
UK residential net lending in 2006 at 111 billion represented an increase of 22% 2005 91.3 billion supported by higher levels of house moving and average house price inflation of around 10%.
The buy to let market continues to be strong, representing approximately 10% of UK gross residential lending.
This market will continue to be supported by demand, particularly from pre first time buyers, for student accommodation and from migrant workers.
We expect gross lending in 2007 to be a little higher than 2006, with house price inflation broadly in line with increases in earnings.
Lending volumes will continue to be supported by favourable economic conditions, healthy volumes of housing transactions, buy to let and continued remortgage business.
These conditions will provide a substantial and robust gross lending market for us to be able to achieve our lending targets.
RESIDENTIAL NORTHERN ROCK PERFORMANCE Residential mortgage lending represents Northern Rocks core activity and accounts for 90% 2005 90% of loans to customers.
Northern Rock consistently achieves high levels of residential lending, which has resulted in a market share of net residential lending at around twice natural share of stock.
37 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued We achieved gross residential lending of 28,972 million 2005 23,618 million and net residential lending of 15,090 million 2005 13,350 million, representing increases of 22.7% and 13.0% respectively.
The following table sets out our market share statistics for each of the last four years: Residential lending 2003 2004 2005 2006 2006 2006 market shares FY FY FY H1 H2 FY Gross lending 5.4% 6.8% 8.1% 7.8% 8.7% 8.3% Redemptions 4.1% 4.5% 5.1% 5.9% 5.9% 5.9% Net lending 7.7% 11.2% 14.5% 12.2% 14.4% 13.4% Closing balances 4.8% 5.5% 6.4% 6.7% 7.1% 7.1% Our residential lending performance shows the success at growing gross market share and containing levels of redemptions through our customer retention process and fair and transparent policy of allowing existing customers, subject to their contractual terms, to transfer their loan to any product available to new borrowers.
Our approach to customer retention, which is unique amongst the major volume mortgage lenders, means that we do not need to significantly grow our gross lending volumes from new customers to achieve our stated asset growth targets.
We intend to improve our retention performance in respect of home movers both for direct business and through intermediaries.
Our distribution network continues to evolve as our business grows.
In 2006, 89% of our mortgage business was sourced via the intermediary market 2005 90% with 90% of this business being conducted on-line by the end of the year, benefiting service levels and operational efficiency.
We will continue to develop our on-line facilities and intend to roll out e-commerce options for direct and product transfer customers during 2007.
We will continue to strengthen our key account relationships with major intermediary groups as well as opening up opportunities with new intermediaries.
At the same time we intend to increase our branch sales network to up to 100 branches over the next 3 to 4 years, with new branches in major centres of population.
We will also continue to invest in our Northern Rock Direct telephone operation to enhance our direct lending activities.
We offer customers a wide range of innovative and attractive products comprising lifestyle products and traditional price-led products with a planned mix of approximately 40% and 60% of new lending respectively.
Most of our products have inbuilt flexibility giving customers the opportunity to overpay, make redraws and, subject to advance agreement and after a qualifying period, take payment holidays, provided that their account is fully up to date.
Our lifestyle products, which are margin enhancing, comprise our together family of products, Lifetime and residential Buy to Let mortgages.
The together products combine a secured and unsecured loan at one interest rate and one monthly payment.
Our Lifetime range is aimed at homeowners aged 60 and over who wish to utilise equity in their homes to enhance their lifestyle.
Residential Buy to Let lending is focussed on lending to small portfolio borrowers rather than single applicant landlords.
An analysis of lifestyle lending is set out in the following table: Lifestylelending  letTotal 2006 % share of new lending 31.4% 0.9% 7.3% 39.6% % share of closing balances 23.4% 2.7% 5.7% 31.8% 2005 % share of new lending 28.7% 1.4% 7.1% 37.2% % share of closing balances 20.6% 3.0% 4.9% 28.5% 38 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued The following analysis of mortgage lending is based on total gross lending in each year.

The increased demand for short term fixed rate products reflected customer demand for protection against anticipated increases in interest rates.
Overall, the profile of our new lending has remained low risk despite strong growth in volumes.
Lending to first time buyers remained stable as a proportion of new lending at 24% 2005 24%, a reduction from the first half at 27%, as we adjusted our risk appetite.
76% 2005 76% of new customers continued to have a proven mortgage payment track record.
Consistent with this trend, the average Loan to Value LTV ratio of new lending in 2006 has remained the same as in 2005 at 78%.
New lending at or below 90% LTV improved to 78% 2005 70% of completions.
The average indexed LTV of our mortgage book at the year end was 60% 31 December 2005 58% which continues to provide strong cover in the event of default.
In line with house price increases, our exposure to large loans has increased with 5.1% of new loans by value over 500,000 2005 3.4%.
The credit risk on this lending remained excellent with such loans attracting an average LTV of only 73%.
New lending continued to be geographically spread across the UK in line with the demographics of the population.
We will be offering mortgage products for the near prime, sub prime and self certified markets on behalf of Lehman Brothers from March 2007.
We will not take any credit risk nor will we administer the loans post completion, but will generate income for their origination.
By offering such products we will complement our existing product portfolio and gain access to mortgage intermediaries with whom we currently have no relationship, thereby expanding our distribution network.
39 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued CUSTOMER SATISFACTION Northern Rock launched an extensive Customer Research Programme towards the end of 2005.
The programme was designed not only to provide evidence of our fair treatment of customers, but also to objectively measure the customer experience across a range of product areas, with a view to identifying potential areas for further improvement.
Over 3,500 customers have been interviewed so far.
The results overall have been very positive, and help us to target key areas for further improvement an important strategy which enables us to continuously develop our customer proposition.
Customer satisfaction levels are shown below, along with an arguably stronger measurement of satisfaction: advocacy.
2006 2005 Satisfaction 92% 89% Likelihood to recommend 96% 94% UNSECURED Our personal unsecured credit portfolios comprise the unsecured element of together lending and standalone unsecured loans not linked to a residential mortgage.
An analysis of lending volumes on the separate elements of our unsecured portfolios is shown in the following table: Standalone Together Unsecured Unsecured Total m m m 2006 Gross 2,332 1,262 3,594 Net 782 709 1,491 Closing balances 4,221 3,056 7,277 2005 Gross 1,970 883 2,853 Net 744 456 1,200 Closing balances 3,408 2,381 5,789 The growth in standalone unsecured gross lending slowed in line with the number of borrowers who satisfy our credit score and our risk appetite.
Net lending stabilised as the portfolio matures and redemptions and repayments naturally increase.
Volumes of new together unsecured lending increased broadly in line with the growth of together mortgage lending with the unsecured element remaining around 13% of combined together advances.
COMMERCIAL Competition in the commercial secured lending market remained strong throughout 2006, with certain lenders being particularly aggressive on price and LTV levels at which they are prepared to lend.
Both gross and net lending within our commercial lending portfolio remained constrained as a result of maintaining our emphasis on quality rather than volume of lending.
Gross lending in the year amounted to 423 million 2005 408 million with net lending of 40 million 2005 5 million.
Included within advances secured on residential property are 1.0 billion 2005 0.8 billion of loans secured on commercial Buy to Let portfolios, which are managed within our commercial lending operation.
FUNDING Northern Rock has four distinct funding arms enabling it to attract funds from a wide range of customers and counterparties on a global basis.
In recognition of our broad and innovative access to a cost effective and diverse capital markets investor base, Northern Rock was awarded the prestigious International Financing Reviews 2006 Financial Institution Group Borrower of the Year award.
40 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued Flows of new funding and closing balances are shown in the following table: Retail Non-Retail Securitisation Covered Bonds 2006 m m m m Net flow 2,527 2,876 10,628 2,733 Closing balances 22,631 24,240 40,226 6,202 2005 Net flow 2,809 2,317 8,831 2,378 Closing balances 20,104 22,253 31,156 3,830 Note: Net flow represents net cashflows excluding fair value adjustments.
RETAIL Retail funding comprised a net inflow of funds of 2.5 billion, including interest credited of 577 million.
This builds on the successful funding in 2005, again demonstrating the strength and diversity of our retail franchise.
Closing balances comprised: 2006 2005 m m Branch accounts 5,573 5,115 Postal accounts 10,201 8,714 Internet accounts 2,225 2,048 Offshore accounts 3,614 2,965 Telephone accounts 527 699 Legal & General branded accounts 491 563 Total retail balances 22,631 20,104 Funding during the year was largely into our Silver Savings accounts, which are available on-line, via post and through our branch network, Fixed Rate bonds and our Irish based accounts.
Balances in our Ireland operation rose to 1,520 million 31 December 2005 1,025 million, with 2,094 million 31 December 2005 1,940 million in our Guernsey based off-shore subsidiary.
In February 2007, we launched our new retail funding operation in Denmark, supplementing our diverse retail franchise.
NON-RETAIL Our non-retail funding provides a balanced mixture of short and medium term funding with increasing diversification of our global investor base.
Following substantial inflows from securitisation during the first half, we repaid net 2.3 billion, mainly short term funds.
In the second half we raised a net 5.2 billion, leading to a full year net funding of 2.9 billion.
During the year, we raised 3.2 billion medium term wholesale funds from a variety of globally spread sources, with specific emphasis on the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.
This included two transactions sold to domestic US investors totalling US$3.5 billion.
In January 2007, we raised a further US$2.0 billion under our US MTN programme.
Key developments during 2006 included the establishment of an Australian debt programme, raising A$1.2 billion from our inaugural issue.
This transaction was the largest debut deal in that market for a single A rated financial institution targeted at both domestic Australian investors and the Far East.
41 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued In August 2006, our long term credit rating with Standard & Poors was increased one notch to A, supported by our 400 million preference share issue and a second Whinstone transaction.
Our current credit ratings are set out in the following table: Standard & Poors Moodys FitchIBCA Short term A1 P-1 F1 Long term A A1 A SECURITISATION Funding through securitisation has remained an important part of Northern Rocks funding strategy.
During 2006, four residential mortgage-backed issues were completed raising 17.8 billion gross 10.5 billion net through our Granite vehicles.
The characteristics of the mortgages securitised, in terms of product type, LTV and geographic distribution remain similar to those of our non-securitised mortgages.
We continue to diversify our investor base aided by comprehensive global investor roadshows.
The Granite issuances continue to price at lower spreads than earlier deals and significantly below maturing older deals.
In 2007 to date, we have completed a 6.1 billion residential mortgage-backed securitisation issue, which was heavily oversubscribed.
At 31 December 2006, securitised notes amounted to 40.2 billion 31 December 2005 31.2 billion, representing 43% 31 December 2005 40% of our total funding portfolios.
This proportion is expected to stay broadly stable going forward.
COVERED BONDS In 2006 we increased the size of our covered bond programme established in 2004 to 20 billion and raised 4 billion 2.7 billion from two benchmark issues.
Covered bonds continue to provide further diversification of our investor base while at the same time lengthening the maturity profile of our funding.
We have issued covered bonds in a range of maturities from 5 to 15 years with a current weighted average maturity of 7.1 years.
The covered bonds are secured by a pool of ring-fenced residential mortgages.
The majority of the credit risks associated with these loans have subsequently been transferred into the capital markets by means of synthetic securitisation transactions providing further capital benefits.

Excluded from underlying results is the impact of hedge accounting ineffectiveness on derivatives and associated hedged items where fair value hedge accounting has been obtained, gains and losses on non-hedging derivatives and translation gains and losses on underlying instruments in economic hedging relationships.
2006 reported statutory profit before taxation for the year increased by 26.8% to 626.7 million with profit attributable to equity shareholders increasing by 31.2% to 394.5 million.
On the same basis return on equity was 23.5% 2005 19.3% and the return on mean risk weighted assets 1.38% 2005 1.22%.

Average balances have been calculated on a monthly basis.
Interest spread represents the difference between interest receivable as a % of average interest earning assets, excluding fair value adjustments, and interest payable as a % of average interest bearing liabilities, excluding fair value adjustments.
For the purpose of calculating interest margin and spread, average balances for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where these have been economically hedged, are based on the contract rate implicit in the associated hedging instrument.
On a statutory basis, total income in 2006 amounted to 1,016.8 million, representing an increase of 23.3% over statutory total income in 2005.
On this basis the ratio of total income to mean total assets at 1.11% compares with the 2005 ratio of 1.12%.
Total income as a proportion of mean risk weighted assets at 3.56% compares with the 2005 ratio of 3.34%.
On an underlying basis total income in 2006 amounted to 975.8 million, representing an increase of 16.8% over underlying total income in 2005.
On this basis, the ratio of total income to underlying mean total assets at 1.08% compares with the 2005 ratio of 1.15%.
Total income as a proportion of mean risk weighted assets at 3.42% compares with the 2005 ratio of 3.41%.
Statutory interest margin at 0.96% and statutory interest spread 0.80% compares with the 2005 ratios of 1.03% and 0.87% respectively.
On an underlying basis net interest margin was 0.93% and net interest spread 0.77%, compared with 0.97% and 0.81% in 2005.
The majority of this reduction was seen in the first half of 2006 when margin and spread were 0.89% and 0.75%.
During 2006, 3 month Libor was on average 21bps higher than Bank Base Rate with the gap 14bps in the first half increasing to 28bps in the second half, which together with the additional costs in 2006 of the Whinstone transactions resulted in a negative drag on net interest income.
These negative effects were partially offset by the benefit of funding received from the issue of Preference Shares in 2006 with no offsetting interest expense and gains realised on available for sale assets.
Excluding these effects, retail spreads on our core business remained relatively stable during 2006.
44 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued Other income primarily comprises commissions and administration fees.
Commissions are generated on sales of third party products such as building and contents and payment protection insurance.
Administration fees are those fees not included within interest margin.
Other income also includes a charge in respect of a provision of 15 million which was absorbed by the additional gains realised on available for sale assets in total income.
This provision has been made in relation to compensation in respect of Mortgage Exit Administration Fees charged over and above original contractual amounts.
These fees have been the subject of an industry wide review by the FSA.
HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS All derivatives entered into by Northern Rock are recorded on the balance sheet at full fair value with any fair value movements being taken to the income statement.
Where effective hedge relationships can be established, the movement in the fair value of the derivative instrument is offset in full or in part by opposite movements in the fair value of the underlying instrument being hedged.
Any ineffectiveness arising from different movements in fair value will offset over time and does not form part of operational performance and is excluded from underlying results in that accounting period.
In addition, Northern Rock enters into certain derivative contracts, which although efficient economically, cannot be included in effective hedge accounting relationships.
Consequently, although the implicit interest cost of the underlying instrument and associated derivative are included in net interest income in the income statement, fair value movements of future cashflows excluding interest flows on such derivatives are recorded in Net hedge ineffectiveness and other unrealised fair value gains and losses on the face of the income statement and are excluded from underlying results as these fair value adjustments are not realised in the current accounting period.
The same treatment also applies to the revaluation at each balance sheet date of economically hedged foreign currency liabilities.
The over-riding objective of the presentation of underlying results is to show the underlying interest income expense of hedged instruments and to exclude future fair value adjustments from current performance measurement.
In 2006, the income statement shows Net hedge ineffectiveness and other unrealised fair value gains and losses as a positive figure of 14.9 million 2005 negative 56.4 million.
This increases to 41.0 million after the cost of interest implicit in forward exchange contracts is transferred to underlying net interest income 2005 negative 10.9 million.
OPERATING EXPENSES excluding the covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 2006 2005 m m Staff costs 162.0 144.5 Other expenses 85.2 81.6 Depreciation and amortisation 30.3 23.3 Total operating expenses 277.5 249.4 Total operating expenses amounted to 277.5 million, representing an increase of 11.3% 2005 249.4 million.
This increase is below the minimum of the target range for cost growth of one half to two thirds of underlying asset growth i. e. 12.0% given the increase in underlying assets of 23.9% over the year and well below the rise in underlying total income of 16.8%.
This resulted in an underlying cost to asset ratio of 0.31% 2005 0.34% and an underlying cost to income ratio of 28.4% 2005 29.8%.
We expect to see continued improvements in cost ratios in 2007 whilst maintaining our investment particularly in premises, to provide capacity and in systems to drive further efficiency gains in our operations.
EMPLOYEES Northern Rock values its reputation as a caring employer and seeks to attract and retain high calibre employees.
Opportunities for training are given a high priority to ensure that all individuals can contribute to their own career development.
This approach extends itself to the fair treatment of people with disabilities in relation to their recruitment, training and development.
Northern Rock has in place a number of share-based plans under which employees may acquire Ordinary shares in the Company.
These plans form an integral part of our strategy to provide appropriate reward and retention strategies for employees, to encourage employees to identify with the interests of shareholders by investing some of their own funds in Northern Rock, and to recruit, motivate and retain employees.
45 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued Details of share schemes which are available to Executive Directors and certain senior executives are included within the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 18 to 29.
In addition to these schemes, the Company operates the following all employee schemes: The Sharesave Scheme a savings related option scheme available to all employees The Employee Share Option Scheme under which options may be granted to substantially all employees The Share Incentive Plan a scheme under which the maximum value of free shares awarded to employees cannot exceed 3,000 per year.
The value of share awards under this scheme is dependent on the Groups profits.
Details of employee involvement in these schemes and the year to which they relate are shown below: Number of shares Number of employees options granted to joining the scheme % of eligible employees employees 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Sharesave Schemes 1,964 1,671 33% 29% 664,833 808,621 Employee Share Option Schemes 5,630 4,463 95% 81% 1,407,500 4,463,000 Share Incentive Plan 3,120 2,504 54% 49% 201,544 223,989 CREDIT QUALITY AND LOAN LOSS IMPAIRMENT The arrears position of each of our main personal lending portfolios based upon numbers of accounts three months or more in arrears is set out in the table below.
Comparison with the half year position is provided to demonstrate the continued strong credit performance of our loans.
Residential Together Standalone Together CML Secured Unsecured Unsecured Residential Average 31 December 2006 0.42% 0.84% 1.09% 0.85% 0.89% 30 June 2006 0.45% 0.95% 1.08% 0.97% 0.96% 31 December 2005 0.39% 0.84% 0.98% 0.84% 0.97% Source: Northern Rock and Council of Mortgage Lenders.
Residential accounts three months or more in arrears at 0.42% remained well below half the CML residential average of 0.89% at 31 December 2006 31 December 2005 0.97% and below the equivalent figure of 0.45% at the half year.
The together secured three months plus arrears have improved during the second half to be 0.84% at the year end from 0.95% at the half year 31 December 2005 0.84% and remain below the CML average for residential lending.
Residential Buy to Let arrears on the same basis were 0.53% 31 December 2005 0.39% compared with the CML residential buy to let average at 31 December 2006 of 0.59%, confirming the quality of this portfolio.
At 31 December 2006, properties in possession totalled 662, representing 0.09% of all accounts compared with 628 0.09% at the half year and 576 0.09% at the end of 2005.
This increase is in line with our policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower is unwilling to maintain payments and where we have higher risk.
Standalone personal unsecured loan arrears remain significantly better than industry average, due to our policy of attracting high quality lending and use of our bespoke scorecard to avoid lower quality lending.
At 31 December 2006, three months plus arrears were 1.09%, reflecting our strong credit arrears management and tightening of our application score cut offs.
This should reduce our exposure to risk of loss from over indebted customers and customers with a propensity to resort to IVA orders and personal bankruptcy.
Together unsecured arrears have improved along with together secured arrears to 0.85% from 0.97% at the half year.
At 31 December 2006, only 7 of our total commercial loans 0.31% of accounts with balances outstanding of 20.5 million were three months or more in arrears compared with 10 accounts 0.42% with outstanding balances of 5.8 million at 31 December 2005.
The 2006 charge for loan loss impairment amounted to 81.2 million 2005 56.6 million representing 0.10% of mean advances to customers 2005 0.09%.
The second half charge of 36.7 million remained below the first half charge of 44.5 million.
46 OPERATING AND BUSINESS REVIEW continued Loan loss impairment provisions and coverage at the year end are set out in the following table: Residential Commercial Unsecured Total 2006 Impairment provision m 26.2 7.4 92.4 126.0 % share of closing balances 0.03% 0.47% 1.25% 0.15% 2005 Impairment provision m 32.5 4.7 87.1 124.3 % share of closing balances 0.05% 0.31% 1.48% 0.18% The combination of high quality lending, low interest rates, low arrears and low average LTV of the portfolio have continued to contain the levels of loan loss impairment provisions required for residential mortgages.
Provisions for the commercial secured lending portfolio are consistent with portfolio performance and economic conditions for this sector.
The growth in loan loss impairment provision balances against our personal unsecured credit portfolios reflects growth in balances and the maturing nature of the portfolios, as well as the quality of the loan books.
As a result, total loan loss impairment provision balances for these portfolios were 92.4 million 31 December 2005 87.1 million with total cover of 1.25% 31 December 2005 1.48%.
TAXATION The effective tax rate in 2006 was 29.3% 2005 29.3%.
We continue to anticipate, with a corporation tax rate of 30%, that the ongoing effective tax rate will trend towards 30.0% in the next few years.
% Standard corporation tax rate for 2006 30.0 Effect of non-deductible items 0.1 Adjustment to prior year tax provisions 0.8 Effective tax rate 29.3 DIVIDENDS For 2006, the total dividend is proposed at 36.2p per share representing an increase of 20.3% compared with the total dividend of 30.1p per share for 2005.
This growth of 20.3% compares with an increase of 19.1% in underlying attributable profits.
The proposed final dividend is 25.3p per share payable on 25 May 2007 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2007.
As the anticipated benefits of Basle II start to become realised our dividend policy will be reviewed, with the expectation that dividend growth will exceed underlying profit growth, increasing returns to shareholders.
CAPITAL At 31 December 2006, total capital amounted to 3,588 million resulting in a total capital ratio of 11.6%, comfortably above regulatory and internal requirements.
Tier 1 capital was 2,610 million and the Tier 1 ratio 8.5%.
The equivalent ratios at 31 December 2005 were 12.3% and 7.7% respectively.
Tier 1 capital and total capital were enhanced by the issue on 29 June 2006 of 400 million 397 million net of issue costs of perpetual non-cumulative callable Preference Shares.
Dividends on these shares are discretionary and subject to Board approval will be first paid on 4 July 2007 and then annually thereafter at a rate of 6.8509%.
The issue supports the future growth of lending as well as improving the mix of our capital base.
We continue to work with the FSA in relation to the adoption of our Basle II systems and are planning for the roll out of our approaches for each of our main credit portfolios during the first half of 2007, following completion of the approval process with the FSA.
This will result in adoption of Basle II ahead of the majority of the banking sector.
As a low risk lender we continue to anticipate significant reductions in risk weighted assets under Basle II.
The regulatory capital savings that will derive from these reductions will be partly offset by Pillar II requirements.
We are currently finalising our capital plans which are to be subject to FSA review early in the second quarter.
We continue to expect Basle II to result in a reduction in our regulatory capital requirement compared with Basle I.

The Board establishes the parameters for risk appetite for the Group through: Setting strategic direction.
Contributing to, and ultimately approving the annual operational plan.
Regularly reviewing and monitoring the Groups performance in relation to risk through monthly Board reports.
The Board delegates the articulation of risk appetite to Management Board Asset and Liability Committee Management Board and ensures that this is in line with the strategy and the desired risk reward trade off for the Group.
Risk appetite is assessed against regular often daily controls and stress testing to ensure that the limits are not compromised in abnormal circumstances.
Risk appetite is usually defined in both quantitative and qualitative terms.
Whilst different techniques are used to ensure that the Groups risk appetite is achieved, they can be classified as follows: Quantitative: encompassing stress testing, risk concentration, credit related metrics, including the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default.
Qualitative: focuses on ensuring that the Group applies the correct principles, policies and procedures.
The annual business planning and performance management process and associated activities ensure the expression of risk appetite remains appropriate.
The Director of Risk works with management to identify and assess the key risk exposures of existing and new business activities, and assists business functions to formulate and implement appropriate risk management policies, methodologies and infrastructure.
Each business area is responsible for the identification and quantification of their particular risk exposures and implementing risk management policies and procedures agreed by the Board.
The principal risks the Group manages are as follows: Credit risk: the risk arising from the possibility that the Group will incur losses from the failure of customers and counterparties to meet their obligations.
Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group is unable to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Operational risk: Operational risk is defined as the risk arising from the Groups people, processes, systems and assets.
Market risk: the risk that changes in the level of interest rates, the rate of exchange between currencies or the price of securities or other financial contracts, including derivatives, will have an adverse impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Group.
The Groups approach to managing each of these is set out below.
CREDIT RISK The objective of credit risk management is to enable the Group to achieve sustainable and superior risk versus reward performance whilst maintaining credit risk exposure in line with approved risk appetite.
Credit risk is the risk of loss if another party fails to meet its financial obligations to the Group, including failing to perform them in a timely manner.
Credit risk occurs mainly in the Groups loans and investment assets, and in derivative contracts.
Good credit risk management is essential to ensure that the Groups cost advantage is not undermined by poor quality loans.
Credit Approval Process Retail Different credit approval processes exist for each customer type in order to ensure appropriate skills and resources are employed in credit assessment and approval whilst following the key principles relating to credit approval.
49 OPERATING & BUSINESS REVIEW continued RISK MANAGEMENT continued The customer loan risk management process incorporates sophisticated credit scoring systems to assess the credit risk associated with residential mortgage loans and unsecured loans, at both individual transaction and portfolio levels, together with the use of operational limits, credit authorisation procedures and credit control and review.
Credit risk is assessed both at the point of granting a loan, and also throughout the life of the loan.
We further control credit risk by reviewing several key factors in managing the portfolio to ensure prudent lending.
This helps to manage the quality of the portfolio as it grows.
These factors include: Emphasis on next time buyers and remortgage customers relative to first time buyers In our experience, customers who have proven mortgage repayment records offer a lower level of risk.
Of gross new residential mortgage lending in 2006, 44% 2005 39% was to next time buyers and 32% 2005 37% was to remortgage customers.
Loan size Our policy matches maximum LTV ratios with permissible property values.
Loans up to 300,000 attract a maximum LTV of 95%, whereas loans over 300,000 attract a maximum of 90%.
In 2006, only 5.1% 2005 3.4% of residential mortgage loans were in excess of 500,000.
Geographical spread Distribution channels for new residential mortgage lending are designed to avoid excessive reliance on any one geographical region.
Size of loan relative to the value of the property Our current policy is for at least 65% of new residential mortgage lending in any one year to have LTVs of 90% or lower.
Probability of Default PD and Loss Given Default LGD PD and LGD limits have been established for our lending portfolios to ensure that the percentage of exposures falling into the highest risk bands is limited.
Treasury Within the Group Treasury function, the overall policy is to minimise credit risk through the use of operational credit limits, credit authorisation and credit control and review.
Credit limits authorised by Executive Management are established for specified counterparties, and are continually monitored to ensure that actual exposures do not exceed authorised levels.
These limits are based on a number of factors including external and internal ratings and capital of Northern Rock.
Group limits have been incorporated to ensure that Northern Rock does not exceed its exposure to either a single counterparty or group of closely-related counterparties.
Country limits have been incorporated to ensure that Northern Rock does not exceed its exposure in a geographical region.
Master netting agreements are in place with all derivative counterparties.
In addition most of the exposures created by derivatives are mitigated through the use of collateral agreements negotiated with derivative counterparties.
Other techniques including margining, credit breaks, compounding, termination and credit derivatives are used periodically to mitigate the credit risk associated with particular transactions or group of transactions.
Credit Risk Models Credit risk models are used throughout the Group to support the analytical elements of the credit risk management framework, in particular the quantitative risk assessment part of the credit approval process, ongoing credit monitoring as well as portfolio level analysis and reporting.
Credit risk models used by the Group can be broadly grouped into two categories.
PD customer credit grade these models assess the probability that a customer will fail to make full and timely repayment of credit obligations over a time horizon.
Each customer is assigned a score which corresponds to probability of default.
There are a number of different credit grading models in use across the Group, each of which considers particular customer characteristics.
The credit grading models use a combination of quantitative inputs, such as recent financial performance, credit bureau data and customer behaviour.
LGD these models estimate the expected loss that may be suffered by the Group on a credit facility in the event of default.
The Groups LGD models take into account the type of borrower and any security held.
Credit Risk Modelling Governance Management Board has delegated the day to day governance of credit models to the Retail Credit Risk Approval Group and Treasury Credit Risk Approval Group.
These Groups are responsible for: Establishing high level standards to which all credit risk models across the Group must adhere.
50 OPERATING OPERATING & & B BUSINESS USINESS REVIEW REVIEW contin continued ued RISK MANAGEMENT continued Approving all credit risk models prior to implementation and reviewing existing models on at least an annual basis.
Developing credit risk models appropriate for the types of borrower and obtaining approval from Management Board for their implementation.
Validating the models on at least an annual basis and submitting documentation of these validations to Management Board with appropriate recommendations on recalibration, where applicable.
Obtaining approval from Management Board for any new methodology or parameter estimates used in existing credit risk models prior to implementation.
LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk arises from the mismatch in the cashflows generated from current and expected assets, liabilities and derivatives.
The Groups liquidity policy is to ensure that it is able to meet retail withdrawals, repay wholesale funds as they fall due, and meet current lending requirements.
It also ensures that it meets FSA liquidity rules, which require the Group to be able to meet its sterling obligations without recourse to the wholesale money markets for a period of at least five business days.
To ensure that it meets these requirements, the Group has approved a Liquidity and Treasury Assets Policy Statement, compliance with which enables it to meet both the requirements of the FSA and internal policy requirements.
This is achieved by managing a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid assets, and a balanced maturity portfolio of wholesale and retail funds.
Longer term funds are raised through the Groups Medium-Term Note programmes.
The Board reviews the Policy Statement annually, and on a more frequent basis if any significant changes are proposed or required.
As well as approving the types of liquid asset that may be bought, the Liquidity and Treasury Assets Policy Statement sets out approved operational limits and establishes operational guidelines for managing the Groups liquidity risk.
The Treasury Director monitors liquidity on a daily basis, using daily cashflow liquidity and sterling stock liquidity reports, together with daily movement reports, portfolio analyses and maturity profiles.
The Board receives monthly liquidity reports analysing the liquid assets and showing the percentages of assets held in each asset type.
OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk is the risk of opportunities foregone, reputational damage or financial losses, resulting from inadequacies or failures in internal processes, people or systems, or from external events.
The three main categories of operational risk losses are direct financial losses, indirect losses due to impairment of the Groups reputation, and potential earnings foregone because of the lack of operational ability to process business.
The key components of operational risk are systems and processes, technology, customers, external events and relationships, people, reconciliation and accounting, new activities and legal and compliance.
To minimise operational risk, the Group has implemented a Risk Policy and an Operational Risk Policy.
Management Board directors and senior line managers are primarily responsible for ensuring effective operational risk management exists within their areas in particular, the setting of tolerances, monitoring and reporting of operational risks.
Where appropriate, Northern Rock establishes suitable cost-effective processes to mitigate or transfer operational risk exposures.
Operational risks are controlled and managed on a decentralised basis, with responsibility and authority to mitigate these risks delegated to the relevant line management.
Northern Rocks support functions provide corporate policies, processes and reporting mechanisms as appropriate to the front line functions for the range of operational risks faced.
MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in the level of interest rates, the rate of exchange between currencies or the price of securities or other financial contracts, including derivatives, will have an adverse impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Group.
The principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and foreign exchange currency risk.
The principal financial instruments that expose us to such risks are loans, deposits, securities and derivatives, none of which are used for trading purposes.
To manage our exposure to market risk, the Board has adopted a Balance Sheet Structural Risk Management and Hedging Policy Statement.
This sets out our policy for managing balance sheet market risk, and the use of derivatives in achieving this.
It enables the Board to assess, monitor and manage the current and expected interest rate risk, credit risk and currency risk in the balance sheet in line with the Groups overall risk policies.
51 OPERATING & BUSINESS REVIEW continued RISK MANAGEMENT continued Interest Rate Risk The Group offers numerous banking, mortgage and savings products with varying interest rate features and maturities which create potential interest rate risk exposures.
Interest rate risk arises as a result of timing differences on the re-pricing of assets and liabilities, unexpected changes in the slope and shape of yield curves and changes in correlation of interest rates between different financial instruments often referred to as basis risk.
In addition to interest rate risk positions managed within controlled risk limits within the Group, structural interest rate risk arises in the Groups consolidated balance sheet as a result of fixed rate, variable rate and non interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group closely monitors interest rate movements, the interest rate and re-pricing maturity structure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and the level of non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
Interest rate sensitivity refers to the relationship between interest rates and net interest income resulting from the periodic re-pricing of assets and liabilities.
Northern Rock also offers fixed rate residential mortgages and savings products on which the interest rate paid by or to the customer is fixed for an agreed period of time at the start of the contract.
Northern Rock matches the expected maturity profiles of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities through the use of derivatives.
The risk of prepayment is additionally reduced by imposing charges if the customers terminate their contracts early.
The Group uses a number of measures to monitor and control interest rate risk and sensitivity.
One such measure evaluates the difference in principal value between assets and liabilities repricing in various gap periods.
Risk weights are assigned to each gap period which reflect potential losses for a given change in rates, and based on these a capital allocation is calculated for each period.
The risk is controlled through setting maximum overall capital allocations, and individual capital allocations for each gap period.
A second control used measures earnings at risk from unmatched positions in fixed rate lending.
The Group imposes a limit on the value of such earnings that may be at risk, based upon various scenarios of adverse interest rate changes.
The sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates is measured by comparing forecast net interest income over a 12 month period under two interest rate scenarios, a 1% parallel increase and decrease in all yield curves.
Forecasts are based on measuring the sensitivity of net interest income for all on-balance sheet and derivative instruments while maintaining a consistent balance sheet size and structure throughout the simulation period.
Forecasts include the effect on net interest income of those instruments which have embedded optionality.
Forecasts also include other simplifying assumptions, such as no management action in response to a change in interest rates.
An immediate hypothetical 1% parallel increase and decrease in all yield curves on 31 December 2006 would result in a decrease of 118.9m 2005 32.4m and an increase of 113.6m 2005 28.4m, respectively, in planned net interest income for the twelve months to 31 December 2007.
Currency Risk Currency risk arises as a result of the Group having assets, liabilities and derivative items that are denominated in currencies other than sterling as a result of normal banking activities, including wholesale funding.
In addition to raising funds through sterling money markets, capital markets and the domestic retail savings market, the Group raises funds through issuing non-sterling denominated commercial paper, certificates of deposit, medium-term debt securities including securitised notes and covered bonds and retail funds.
The most significant currencies in which we have transactions are US dollars and the Euro.
The Groups policy is to mitigate fully any exchange rate exposures by using cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, or to match exposures with assets denominated in the same currency.
Consequently, the sensitivity of income to changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant.
Use of Derivatives The Board has authorised the use of derivative instruments for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities of the Group and reducing the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
All use of derivative instruments within the Group is to hedge economic risk exposure, and the Group takes no trading positions in derivatives.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to reduce interest rate risk and currency risk.
These include interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements, interest rate and bond futures, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The objective, when using any derivative instrument, is to ensure that the risk to reward profile of any transaction is optimised.
Where either a balance sheet derivative instrument or an alternative balance sheet asset or liability could be used for a specific purpose, or where more than one derivative instrument could be used, the Group will select the instrument that optimises the following conditions: minimise capital utilisation: maximise income or minimise cost: maximise liquidity: 52 OPERATING OPERATING & & B BUSINESS USINESS REVIEW REVIEW contin continued ued RISK MANAGEMENT continued minimise administrative and accounting complexity: and minimise the Groups tax liability.
The benefits of using derivative instruments are measured by examining the anticipated consequences of not hedging the perceived risk in terms of revenue or capital loss.
The vast majority of the Groups derivatives activity is contracted with banks and other financial institutions.
Analysis of Activities and Related Derivative Instrument The following table sets out activities undertaken by the Group and the related risks associated with such activities, and provides details of the types of derivatives used in economically managing such risks.

a Fair Value Hedges The Group designates a number of derivatives as fair value hedges.
In particular the Group has three approaches establishing relationships for: i Hedging the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk of non-prepayable, foreign currency denominated fixed rate assets or liabilities on a one-for-one basis with fixed floating or floating fixed cross currency interest rate swaps.
ii Hedging the interest rate risk of a single currency portfolio of sterling, US Dollar and Euro non-prepayable fixed rate assets liabilities on a one-for-one basis with vanilla fixed floating or floating fixed interest rate swaps.
iii Hedging the interest rate risk of a portfolio of prepayable fixed rate assets with interest rate derivatives.
This solution is used to establish a macro fair value hedge for derivatives hedging fixed rate mortgages.
The Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with its policy for hedging fixed rate mortgages on an economic basis.
53 OPERATING & BUSINESS REVIEW continued RISK MANAGEMENT continued The total fair value of derivatives included within fair value hedges at 31 December 2006 was 315.9m.
b Cash Flow Hedges At present the Group does not designate any derivatives as cash flow hedges.
c Net Investment Hedges At present the Group does not designate any derivatives as net investment hedges.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THE NORTHERN ROCK FOUNDATION Northern Rock donates 5% of pre tax profit to The Northern Rock Foundation under a deed of covenant.
Such donations are used to support community and charitable causes in the North East of England and Cumbria.
The covenant from 2006 profits amounts to 31.4million 2005 24.7 million, resulting in approximately 175 million having been donated since its inception in 1997 as an integral part of Northern Rocks conversion to a plc.
OUTLOOK We expect UK gross residential lending in 2007 to be a little higher than 2006 at around 360 billion, underpinned by a stable housing market and sustained remortgage activity.
Economic conditions will remain fundamentally supportive, with interest rates remaining low compared with the long term UK average.
The independence of the Bank of England continues to be a key economic factor.
Mortgage volumes will also be supported by continued demand for buy to let lending and by customers reorganising their finances away from more expensive unsecured debt.
Our focus on customer retention, with planned improvements to retaining home moving customers means that our volume targets can be achieved without significant increases in our share of gross mortgage lending from new customers.
We have been a top three lender by flow of business over the last few years: over the medium term we also aim to be a top three mortgage lender by share of stock.
Credit quality remains key to Northern Rocks business, which will remain dominated by good quality prime residential mortgages.
Where necessary we have tightened our credit risk appetite and improved our assessment of customer affordability which, together with continued focus on arrears management, should result in future credit loss charges moving in line with our growth in lending.
