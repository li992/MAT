Our strategy is to continue to grow the size of our international business in both financial terms and in geographic coverage in order to reduce the Groups exposure or dependence on any one specic economy.
We have also expanded the business into countries where the specialist recruitment markets are less developed and are therefore less dependent on the performance of the countrys underlying economy in the short-term.
Competitive environment In the United Kingdom & Ireland and Australia, the markets for the provision of permanent and temporary recruitment are highly competitive and fragmented.
In these more developed markets, competitor risk manifests itself in increased competition for clients and candidates and in pricing pressures.
During the year, in the United Kingdom we have experienced modest margin pressure within our temporary business in the major specialist activities.
In Continental Europe & Canada and Asia, the markets for the provision of recruitment services are somewhat less developed and the market place is more fragmented.
As these markets are still in a development phase, pricing pressure is less of a risk and our strategy is to rapidly grow our businesses in these territories.
