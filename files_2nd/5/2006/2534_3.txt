16 Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 Critical accounting policies The discussion and analysis of Britvics financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The preparation of these financial statements requires Britvics management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about, among other things, the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of Britvics IFRS consolidated financial statements.
