08 Business review The underlying purpose of all St Modwens activity is to add value to the properties it controls.
Bill Oliver Chief Executive Tim Haywood Steve Burke Finance Director Construction Director The process of recycling brownfield land is becoming steadily more challenging with risk-based environmental assessments requiring a very high level of understanding of the remediation process.
To a considerable extent, the regulatory challenges create an opportunity in which a developer with appropriate skills and determination can build a long-term viable business.
Business model and strategy The underlying purpose of all St. Modwens activity is to add value to the properties it controls.
Even those activities referred to as operating ventures are integral to that core purpose.
The aim is that no property should be acquired or retained unless it is believed that significant value can be added to that property by the companys Our market own efforts asset management, refurbishment or redevelopment The companys core operation is within the UK property in a flat market over a five to fifteen year horizon.
A classic challenge for a company such as yours is how to achieve a The investment property market remains very strong but it will be constant or rising stream of profits from an activity which some see as interesting to see how much further, if at all, yields can fall, inevitably cyclical and the Chairmans statement notes how bringing particularly as interest rates are trending upwards.

years or more: Business review 09 Broadly based St. Modwen is not a sectoral specialist.
We can successfully deliver a wide range of outputs.
St. Modwen can, therefore, adjust the mix of its development programme to match market opportunities: Geographically spread Operating through its regional offices, St. Modwen combines the strength of a local developer with the power of a national company: Focused upon regeneration St. Modwen goes where it is needed, rather than where it is fashionable, undertaking town centre regeneration, partnering industry in its restructuring, brownfield land renewal, and heritage restoration: and Acquired in its rawest state Most added value and more flexibility can be achieved if a developer tackles property and risk from the outset of the regeneration process.

22 Business review 01 The future The companys hopper details of which are set out above on page 10 is an underlying strength which should provide a stream of future profitability.
The key issues determining the companys future performance are: Whether we can continue to acquire sufficient opportunities to top up the hopper: How we marshal projects through land assembly, planning and construction to create annual development programmes: and Whether the occupational market across the various sectors will be sufficiently strong to support those programmes.
We have strategies in place to address each of these issues: Our network of regional offices, and the long-term relationships that they build, gives us a good prospect of identifying and securing the right opportunities: Regular detailed reviews of all live projects mean that issues associated with marshalling schemes can be identified and addressed in a timely manner: and By operating across a wide range of property sectors, we spread the risk of an occupational downturn in any particular sector.
The current view is that, subject only to macro-economic conditions, future prospects are good.
The current year has started well.
The programme for the rest of the year is taking shape.
In the light of this, the Chairman reports in his statement that he is looking forward with confidence to another year of progress for your company.
