The combined businesses of the CGUII group and the NUI group have strong solvency positions.

Economic bases We use a number of measures of risk based capital to assess the capital requirements for our general insurance businesses.
Financial modelling techniques enhance our practice of active capital management, verifying that sufficient capital is available to protect against unforeseen events and adverse scenarios, and to manage risk.
Our aim continues to be an optimal use of capital.
Our traditional risk-based capital methodology for general insurance business assesses insurance, market and credit risks and makes prudent allowance for diversication benets.
The capital assessed under this methodology is that necessary to enable the general insurance business to meet regulatory solvency margins over a five year period with a 99% probability of not requiring further capital.
We consider risks over the five year period, allowing for planned levels of business growth.
Based on the model, our risk-based capital requirement may be expressed as 34% of net written premiums, which is equivalent to 3.5 billion 2004: 3.3 billion of capital.
This compares with a total of 5.6 billion 2004: 5.0 billion of shareholders capital deployed in the general insurance business.

Continuous and extensive service satisfaction research is conducted across all products and elements of our service experience.
In 2005, sales and service satisfaction averaged 92% with claims service averaging 83%.
These scores represent customers explicitly stating satisfaction with our service.
In 2006, in recognition of our customers rating claims as the most significant aspect of our service, we have set ourselves the challenge of achieving 85% extremely and very satisfied customers.
Achieving our target would represent industry-leading performance.
Our focus will also be on the harder challenge of creating customer advocacy: new insight tools are being deployed to assist this journey.
We will implement a Customer Experience Monitor CEM, enabling us to understand, direct from customers, what they see as the key touchpoints with us in any period of interactions and enabling us to address rapidly any areas where we are not creating customer advocates.
This will be based on willingness to recommend, renew or upgrade present products.
