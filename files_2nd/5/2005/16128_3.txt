Financing and interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate swaps, options, caps and forward rate agreements.
Hedging transactions are undertaken after a review of the effect on profit after tax of a range of interest rate assumptions and probabilities, determined by reference to the general economic climate and market forecasts for interest rates.
