Business review Principal activities Ambition to be Premier Foods is a leading supplier of foods and beverages to the UK retail grocery and foodservice markets.
The Group manufactures a range of market leading branded and own-label products in two primary segments Grocery and Fresh Produce.
Within Grocery, the Group is organised around its Convenience Foods, Pickles, Sauces & Meat Free and Spreads, Desserts & Beverages product groupings.
1 Produce business comprises potato and fresh produce packing and marketing operations In the UK retail and supplying the retail, foodservice, food manufacturing and potato growing markets.
Background to the business grocery foodservice In the main, the UK food retail market is comprised of well-known major retailers and market smaller convenience stores.
Whilst the smaller operations offer some additional distribution channels for our branded products the greater volume of sales comes from the major retailers who stock our brands and their own branded products.
The food retail market is highly competitive demanding consistent product quality and reliable supply whilst seeking more competitive pricing and innovative new products.
Suppliers look to generate economies of scale to reduce production costs to support promotional activity, investment in building brand awareness with the consumer and new product development.
We also supply the food service, cash & carry and food manufacturing markets in the UK and a small proportion of our sales are through exports.
In general, supply to the UK food retail market is influenced by macro-economic factors such as consumer confidence, consumer price inflation, commodity and utility prices and sector wage inflation.
A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting our business can be found on pages 33 to 37.
We focus on growing our iconic British brands through product innovation and brand extension supported by efficient manufacture and distribution.
We categorise our brands into Drive, Core and Classic depending on the potential growth of the brand.
This determines the level of consumer marketing, promotional investment and new product development that we put behind each brand.
Over time, it is our aim to increase the share of total sales provided by our branded products to 75% of our Grocery sales.
We offer our customers a detailed insight into our consumers, reflected in our innovation, a focus on service levels to ensure reliable supply and competitive prices from our low cost base.
This mix gives Premier a unique competitive position to manage the categories in which we operate.

In addition, we have strengthened our brand portfolio with the acquisitions of Birds, Quorn and Cauldron and the disposal of our Tea and Jonker Fris businesses.
Our strategy is based upon growing the sales of our branded portfolio, whilst maintaining the benefits derived from also supplying retailer branded products and driving efficiency improvements and cost reductions to improve our operating profit margins.
Overall, continuing operations generated sales growth of 6%, based on a like-for-like growth in Grocery of 2% and the strong contributions from Birds and Quorn, which have been offset by a weaker performance from our Fresh Produce business.
We increased the marketing spend on our existing brand portfolio by 5.0m to 27.7m, of which 3.5m was spent during the fourth quarter of the year launching our new Branston Beans.
This increased marketing spend fuelled strong sales growth for our drive brands: Loyd Grossman grew 22%, Branston 14% excluding Branston Beans, Ambrosia 12% and Hartleys 1%.
In addition, we spent 6.3m marketing the brands acquired in the year which helped to generate pro forma year-on-year growth of 8% for Quorn and 9% for Cauldron.
Overall, we have been delighted by the resilience of the business in withstanding a number of significant trading and one-off events in the last eighteen months.
In October 2004, a fire at our Bury St Edmunds factory disrupted production of our pickles and cooking sauce products.
We were pleased to get the factory back into full production by the Easter of 2005.
In the spring, we were involved in a major product recall resulting from the contamination of raw materials supplied to us, which contained the dye Sudan 1, and which were used in a range of products manufactured by the Group.
We responded to this issue with a number of initiatives to address the concerns that affected the Group and the wider food production industry.
In addition, the business has responded strongly to the challenges of the trading impact of an inventory overhang in January 2005, exceptionally mild autumn weather and significant levels of energy and utility cost inflation.
17 Premier Foods plc Business review As we indicated at the time of our interim announcement, sales for our potato business were significantly lower than in 2004 as a result of lower market prices and volumes and this continued during the second half of the year.
During 2005, we realigned the business with its customer base through the acquisition of the Gedneys fresh produce business and adjusted the business cost base through the closure of two of its four remaining packing 61 % facilities.
This will ensure that we will enter 2006 as an efficient and competitive supplier of Grocery sales from a broad range of fresh produce.
Following the acquisition of Gedneys we have renamed this segment Fresh Produce.
branded products In 2005, we conducted a strategic review of our Tea and Jonker Fris businesses and concluded that the success and future competitiveness of those businesses could be better served by alternative ownership and, accordingly, we disposed of the businesses in October and December 2005 respectively.
The net effect of acquisitions and disposals during the year is an increase in the pro forma share of Grocery sales from branded products of 6% to approximately 61%.
Simultaneously, we have fully integrated Birds into our business during the year and have made excellent progress on the integration of Quorn and Cauldron over the second half.

This product group has seen strong growth in the Branston, excluding Branston Beans, up 14% and Loyd Grossman brands up 22%, offset by lower sales from our smaller, mature brands and own label convenience foods.
This performance has been achieved despite the effect of lower sales in January 2005 due to the high level of inventory on hand after the Christmas 2004 trading period and the effect of a mild autumn which has particularly affected the sales of warming soups and convenience meals.
Like-for-like trading profit was flat at 34.3m after spending an additional 3.5m on marketing for the launch of Branston Beans and after absorbing significant cost inflation particularly in relation to tin-plate and energy related utility costs.
18 Premier Foods plc Business review We have put significant efforts behind our Branston brand during the year.
At the start of the year, following the fire at our Bury St Edmunds factory in October 2004, our primary focus was on the rebuilding of production and distribution of the core Branston sweet and sour pickle ranges.
We launched a new range of Branston relishes in March 2005, which achieved a category-leading position within two months of their launch.
Finally, in October, we launched a new range of Branston Beans and Pasta in anticipation of the expiry of our HP licence, which is due in March 2006.
The launch has been extremely successful with Branston beans gaining a 7% value market share within three months of launch.
In 2005, again following a period of rebuilding production and distribution after the Bury St Edmunds fire, we extended our Loyd Grossman range to include Pesto and Creamy sauces, which helped to consolidate Loyd Grossman as the third largest cooking sauce brand in the UK.
The continued strong growth in 2005 means that the Loyd Grossman brand has now more than trebled in size over the last five years.
19 Premier Foods plc Business review Meat-Free 2005 2004 m m Sales 49.6 Trading profit 6.5 2005 2004 Pro forma 12 months m m Sales 99.8 92.7 7.7% Trading profit 11.2 8.1 38.3% Meat-Free includes Quorn 29 weeks and Cauldron 9 weeks in 2005 Sales from the Meat-Free business have been included for the first time this year following the acquisition of Marlow Foods owner of the Quorn brand in June and Cauldron in October 2005.
The combined business has generated sales of 49.6m and trading profit of 6.5m.
On a pro forma basis, the Meat-Free business generated growth in sales and trading profit of 7.7% to 99.8m 2004: 92.7m and 38.3% to 11.2m 2004: 8.1m, respectively.
This performance is consistent with our growth and profitability assumptions at the time of acquisition and we believe the business is well positioned to capitalise on the growth in its markets, which will result from the shift in consumer trends towards healthier eating and provide a growth platform for the business.
Following these acquisitions, the Groups knowledge of and access to the vegetarian and meat alternative markets is now unique amongst its competitors.
Following the acquisition of Quorn, we increased the marketing spend on the brand, with two additional bursts of TV advertising, and increased the level of new product development to continue driving the brands strong sales growth.
During 2005 household penetration increased from 16.5% to 18.2%, equating to an additional 420,000 households now eating Quorn.
The integration of the Quorn and Cauldron businesses has proceeded well with the sales, marketing and operations functions now fully integrated into Premiers management structures.
Spreads, Desserts and Beverages 2005 2004 m m Sales 286.7 246.9 16.1% Like-for-like sales 256.7 246.9 4.0% Trading profit 67.1 55.4 21.1% Like-for-like trading profit 60.6 55.4 9.4% Our Spreads, Desserts and Beverages product group has performed well.
Total sales grew by 16.1%, with like-for-like sales growth of 4% underpinning the additional sales from the Birds business which was acquired in February 2005.
Like-for-like trading profit grew by 9.4% to 60.6m 2004: 55.4m and total trading profit, including Birds, grew by 21.1% to 67.1m.
The like-for-like growth has been driven by Ambrosia with the introduction of new fruit layer custard and rice, the growth of snacking formats and new own label contracts.
Sales for the acquired brands are in line with our expectations at the time of the acquisition.
The transfer of production of the Birds and Angel Delight brands to our Knighton factory was completed in December 2005.
From the acquisition in February through to the commissioning of the new lines in December, we incurred additional costs as we sourced production from Kraft.
These costs ceased on the transfer of production and have been treated as exceptional because of their non-recurring nature.

1% Like-for-like sales 94.2 150.3 37.3% Growth in sales for Trading profit 0.5 5.7 91.2% Like-for-like trading profit 0.4 5.7 93.0% Spreads, Desserts Sales in our Fresh Produce business have reduced by 29.3% to 106.3m 2004: 150.3m and Beverages and trading profit by 91.2% to 0.5m 2004: 5.7m.
This result is disappointing, having arisen as a result of the poor general trading environment, lower overall market prices and the effect of contracts lost at the end of 2004 as a result of supplier consolidation in this category by the major multiple grocery retailers.
Following on from the initial phase of operational restructuring in 2004, we have further reviewed the cost structure and packing capacity of the business and have reduced its operating cost base through the closure of two of the remaining four packing facilities.
We have also realigned the business with its customers requirements through the acquisition of the Gedneys fresh produce business in September 2005 which has widened the fresh produce offering to our customers.
This ensured that we entered 2006 as an efficient and competitive supplier of a broad range of fresh produce.
Discontinued operations 2005 2004 m m Sales 77.2 152.1 49.2% Trading Profit 8.6 14.6 41.1% On 30 October, the Group disposed of its tea business for 80.2m.
On 7 December, the Group disposed of its Netherlands-based convenience foods business, Jonker Fris, for 4.4m.
The results for these businesses during the period of our ownership in 2005 together with the profit or loss on disposal are presented as the result for 2005, net of tax from discontinued operations.
This total amount is compared with the results for these businesses and our French spreads business Materne, which was disposed of in 2004. Business outlook Overall trading performance for the year to date has been in line with expectations.
The trading environment remains highly competitive and energy related inflationary pressure remains a concern.
However, we are confident that we will continue to develop the business in line with our strategy, focusing on driving our branded sales growth whilst retaining a tight control on our cost base.
