Midlothian is among the largest gas fired plants in the ERCOT market which has total capacity of 78,900 MW, including coal lignite, nuclear, wind, hydro and gas fired plants.
As older, less efficient plants in the ERCOT market have been retired or mothballed, the highly efficient and environmentally clean Midlothian plant has provided an increasing amount of power to the market.
In 2005 the plant operated with a capacity factor of 55%.
Midlothian has received the Environmental Excellence award from the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality in recognition of its low emission combustion technology and its use of air cooling.
This ensures efficient operation and minimises air emissions while using a fraction of the water normally used by similar sized generation units.
With its advanced, environmentally desirable design and operation, Midlothian will be a significant contributor to the ERCOT market for years to come.

Shuweihat S1 commenced operation in 2004 and all of its output is contracted to the Abu Dhabi Water & Electricity Company ADWEC under a long-term agreement.
Fuelled by strong economic growth, the UAE is experiencing robust growth in demand for power and even greater growth in demand for water.
The country relies on desalination removal of salts from seawater to produce fresh water for human consumption, agriculture and industrial use.
At Shuweihat S1, which has the worlds largest desalination units in commercial operation, waste heat from the power generation process is used to produce up to 100 million imperial gallons of fresh water every day.
Integrated power and water projects are standard in the Middle East, because the use of waste steam in the desalination process increases the overall efficiency of the plant.
The excellent performance of Shuweihats desalination units has encouraged the system operator to use these as preferred units for despatch.
Shuweihats plant operation and maintenance is carried out jointly by International Power and CMS.
In 2004 Shuweihat was awarded ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 making it the first plant in the region to have achieved these environmental and operational certifications simultaneously.
