The demand for insulation materials for use in technical and industrial applications are, by implication, not affected by the Building Regulations in any country.
In the USA, France and Benelux, SIG sales of insulation are heavily biased towards technical and industrial applications.
In Germany, the UK and Poland, sales of technical insulation are a smaller proportion to our total insulation sales.
When considering the possible impact of future changes in Building Regulations on SIG, it is important to recognise that within the general description of insulation are the sales of a very wide range of products used alongside the insulation material itself.
