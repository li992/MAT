18 business review business review real estate strategY Our real estate strategy focuses on high quality properties and income growth, and aims to maximise the total returns from the portfolio by: allocating the majority of the portfolio to prime regional shopping centres and retail parks: managing our investment properties so that they continue to be attractive to occupiers, enabling us to increase the Groups rental income and other revenues over time: and generating attractive income and capital returns through development, in both the retail and office sectors.
Our performance in these areas during 2010 is discussed in this Business Review, which also provides information on the potential future growth in the portfolios income and value.
propertY portFolio and alloCation Our portfolio allocation is based on external and internal research which is used to analyse in detail the markets in which we operate.
As part of our annual business planning process, we review the current and projected performance of each of our properties and identify assets for disposal.
This active portfolio management has resulted in 555 million being raised from disposals in 2010, whilst 305 million has been invested in acquisitions, new developments and improving existing properties over the same period.
At 31 December 2010, our property portfolio was valued at 5.3 billion, with the investment portfolio valued at 5.2 billion and developments making up the balance.
Joint ventures accounted for 46% by value of the total portfolio, including eight major shopping centres in the UK and two in France.
Our ten most valuable properties represented 48% of the portfolio value at 31 December 2010, with an average lot size of 253 million.
2 At the end of 2010, Hammersons retail portfolio in the UK and France provided 1.6 million m of space and included 16 major shopping centres 2 and 17 retail parks.
Our office portfolio includes seven prime buildings in central London, providing 157,000m of accommodation.
The retail weighting of the portfolio at 31 December 2010 was unchanged from the end of the previous year at 88%.
However, over the course of 2010 acquisitions, disposals and the effects of exchange rates have combined to change the geographical weighting of the portfolio so that the UK accounted for 74% compared with 66% at the end of 2009.
The value of the portfolio increased by 190 million during 2010, and the movement is analysed in the table below.

Changes to investment yields accounted for virtually all of the increase in value in the UK retail portfolio, with shopping centres and retail parks showing a similar performance.
For the UK office portfolio, nearly three-quarters of the valuation uplift resulted from lower investment yields with the balance reflecting increased rental income.
The valuation uplift from yield movement in the UK was weighted towards the first half of the year, whilst the last six months of 2010 benefited from increased income and rental values.
In France, valuations were broadly static as improved investment yields offset a small reduction in rental values.
The improvement in yields was weighted towards the second half of the year and rental values declined fairly evenly in 2010.
The components of the valuation change in 2010 for the UK and French portfolios are shown in the charts below.

The property true equivalent yields are determined by the Groups external valuers.
3 Further analysis of development properties by segment is provided in note 3B on page 67.
4 The weighted average remaining rent-free period is 1.1 years.
The initial yield calculation in the table Valuation data for investment property, is based on passing rents at 31 December 2010 excluding rents of 20.8 million per annum which will be received after the expiry of rent-free periods.
We have had an active year in 2010, disposing of several properties and reinvesting the proceeds in acquisitions and developments which provide opportunities for income and valuation growth.
At 54-60 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor, Paris 8me, the redevelopment work is being completed and six of the seven stores have been handed over to tenants for fitting out.
The stores, all but one of which are pre-let, will open for trading during the second quarter of 2011.
The total development cost is 31 million and the increase in annual rents as a result of the redevelopment is 3.1 million.
At 31 December 2010 the valuation of the property was 36 million above cost.
In October we completed the sales of interests in the Espace Saint Quentin and OParinor shopping centres near Paris.
Hammerson will continue to manage both schemes and receive management fees.
A 75% interest in Espace Saint Quentin, Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines, was sold to Allianz Real Estate GmbH for net proceeds of 151 million, and a further 2 million is contingent upon the purchasers option to acquire one of the shop units in 2012.
Using the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction, the value of the property at 31December 2009 was 209 million and net income for the year then ended was 11.6 million.
The property is now held in a 25:75 joint venture, and Hammersons annual net income from the arrangement, comprising rental income and management fees, is estimated at 4.0 million.
The sale of a 51% interest in OParinor, Aulnay-sous-Bois, to The National Pension Service of Korea raised net proceeds of 187 million.
We have agreed with the purchaser that it can purchase, and Hammerson can sell, an additional 24% interest in autumn 2011 at a price based on the same valuation for the centre as was used for the initial transaction.
This further sale would raise around 91 million.
The value of the property, using the exchange rate at the date of the initial sale, was 395 million at 31 December 2009 and it contributed 19.0 million of net income during the year then ended.
We estimate that Hammersons income from the 49:51 joint venture, including management fees, will be 10.0 million per annum.
2 Elsewhere in our shopping centre portfolio, Glasgow City Council confirmed in October our application to extend Silverburn by 7,700m.
The extension will provide high quality retail and leisure space and include an upgrade of the promenade leading to the Pollok Civic Realm.
Silverburn, currently Scotlands largest purpose-built shopping centre, is held in a 50:50 joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CPPIB.

The latter will allow us to accommodate Primark in a new 5,500m unit as part of a 20 million upgrade of the scheme.
We have also been active in the retail park sector during the year.
In June, we acquired the remaining 75% interest in Battery Retail Park, Birmingham, from our partner TIAA-CREF, the US pensions group.
The cost of the acquisition was 49 million and Hammerson now wholly 2 owns the 13,000m park which is fully occupied by retailers including B&Q, Currys, Halfords, Homebase, Next and PC World.
We have planning consents to extend this scheme and Abbey Retail Park, Belfast.
2 In November, we acquired Wrekin Retail Park, Telford, for 42 million including costs.
The 13,400m park was built in 1996, adjoins an owner-occupied Tesco Extra store and has open A1 planning consent.
The scheme is fully let to nine retailers including Asda Living, Boots, Homebase and Matalan.
Annual gross rental income is 2.6 million, equivalent to around 18 per square foot, and the leases have an unexpired term of more than ten years.
Wrekin has excellent transport links, located to the west of Telford town centre, beside junction 6 of the M54 and has a primary catchment population of around 270,000.
We have recently agreed terms to acquire our partners 75% interest in Central Retail Park, Falkirk for 69 million including costs.
We continued the theme of asset recycling in our office portfolio.
In September, we sold Exchange Tower in Londons Docklands, for net proceeds of 134 million.
Originally acquired in 1999 for 77 million, the building was valued at 131 million at 31 December 2009 and rents passing were 10.7 million at that time.
Bishops Square, London E1, which was developed by Hammerson, completed in 2005, and in which we held a 25% interest through a joint venture with Oman Investment Fund OIF, was sold in December.
The property was let to Allen & Overy LLP and a number of retailers at a total rent of 35 million per annum.
The sale reflected a property value of 557 million compared with 481 million at 31 December 2009.
The net proceeds due to Hammerson from the sale of our interest, including performance payments from OIF, the repayment of loans and after taking account of the joint ventures debt and interest rate swap, were 80 million.
A long leasehold interest in Leadenhall Court, London EC3, was acquired in July for 65 million including costs.
The property was built in 2 1988 and provides 10,000m of office space in a prime City of London location between Bank and Liverpool Street stations.
The property is fully let until March 2014 to a subsidiary of RSA Insurance Group plc, with rents passing of 7.2 million per annum net of head rents payable.
There is a wide range of opportunities to add value to the property, including the potential for refurbishment or full redevelopment.
In August we entered into a joint venture with CPPIB to acquire a long leasehold interest in 10 Gresham Street, London EC2, for 183 million 2 including costs.
Hammerson will manage the property on behalf of the joint venture, in which we have a 30% interest.
The 23,600m eight-storey building was designed by Foster Partners, was completed in 2003 and comprises high-quality offices, retail and ancillary accommodation.
Lloyds TSB Bank is the principal occupier, with the remainder of the property let to seven other tenants including Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy and JC Flowers.
The average unexpired lease term is over 10 years and Hammersons share of the rents passing, net of head rent payable, is 3.2 million per annum, reflecting average headline rents of 44 per square foot.

22 business review business review continued The net initial yield, based on the net portfolio value, at 31 December 2010 of 5.5% compares with 5.8% at the end of 2009, and the movement reflects the strengthening of the property investment market over the year.

5 The percentage by which the ERV exceeds, or falls short of, rents passing together with the estimated rental value of vacant space, all at 31 December 2010.
Net rental income was 284.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2010, whilst passing rents from the investment portfolio totalled 314.9million at that date.
Further details of net rental income, including a like-for-like analysis, are provided in the Financial Review on pages 28 and 29.
In 2010 we agreed 118 rent reviews in the UK, for which the existing rents receivable were 11.7 million, and secured an uplift of 2.3 million per annum.
Annual rents could increase by a further 2.7 million, assuming that rent reviews outstanding at the end of the year are settled at ERV.
Shopping centre rents in France change annually according to one of two indices: a composite index, partly based on retail prices ILC : or a construction cost index ICC.
Around 72% by value of the retail leases in Hammersons French portfolio will fall by 0.22% from 1 January 2011.
The corresponding movement in the index for 2010 was an increase of 0.84%.
The balance of the leases in France is indexed according to construction costs, for which the index for 2011 is an increase of 1.27%.
oCCupanCY vaCanCY EPRA has issued revised guidance for the calculation of vacancy.
Previously, vacancy was reported as a percentage of the rents passing plus the ERV of vacant space.
The revised definition expresses vacancy as a percentage of the total ERV of a property or portfolio.
We have adopted this new definition and restated our 2009 comparatives for vacancy and occupancy data.
O Ove ver rvi vie ew w b bu us siin ne es ss s an and d fi finan nanc ciial al r re ev viie ew w g gO Ov five er rnan nanc ce e fi finan nanc ciial al s st ta at te em me en nt ts s pr prO Op pe er rt ty y p pO Ort rtf fO Oli liO O HammersOn plc annual report 2010 23 At 31 December 2010, occupancy in the investment portfolio stood at 97.3%, compared with 95.4% at the 2009 year end and our target of 97%.
The increased occupancy over the last 12 months principally reflected lettings at the recently completed shopping centre developments in the UK and at 60 Threadneedle Street, London EC2, although this positive impact was partly offset by slightly increased vacancy at some of our French shopping centres.
inCome seCuritY and qualitY Our investment portfolio has a secure income stream, demonstrated by a weighted average unexpired lease term of nearly nine years at the end of 2010.
At 31 December 2010, 21 UK retail units were let to tenants in administration, and of these, ten were still trading.
In France, the equivalent figures were 15 and 13 units respectively.
Income from tenants in administration for the Group as a whole represents less than 1% of passing rents at 31 December 2010.
Hammersons ten largest retail tenants accounted for 54 million, or 17%, of total passing rents at the end of 2010.
In the office portfolio, the five largest tenants represented 26 million or 8% of total passing rents.
Our largest occupiers by rental income are shown in the table below.

At 31 December 2010, our top ten retail tenants were all rated as low risk.
Tenants with a low or lower-than-average risk indicator comprised 80% by passing rents of the UK retail portfolio and the score in the portfolio averaged 1.6.
We also monitor the risk indicators of our office tenants, although they tend to be of lower risk than retailers.
This is evidenced by the fact that there have been no significant rent payment defaults in our office portfolio in 2010.
At 31 December 2010, four of the top five office tenants had a low or lower-than-average risk indicator.
In the UK office portfolio at 31 December 2010, the average risk score was 1.3 and 83% of passing rents were provided by tenants with a risk rating of one or two.
retailer trends Overall in 2010 retail sales in the UK increased by 2.6%, despite weak consumer confidence.
There was a polarisation in consumer preference between local retailing destinations and the broad merchandise offers at regional shopping centres.
The growth in Multichannel retail continues, with retailers reporting the accelerated growth of Click & Collect and the increased value to retailers of customers that shop using a number of channels.
We have continued to develop our understanding of Multichannel retailing, for example using social media and the content on our shopping centre websites to develop better relationships with consumers.
In France, we are also trialling a flash sales concept, using our OParinor shopping centre website to sell stock on behalf of retailers.
Continually developing our plan and technical capabilities to ensure we are well placed to deal with the challenges and opportunities afforded by Multichannel is a high priority.
retailer performance In the UK, like-for-like turnover at Hammersons shopping centres rose by 3.5% during 2010.
Results were positive throughout the year, except for January when sales were affected by adverse weather conditions.
Highcross shopping centre in Leicester saw like-for-like growth of 7.1% demonstrating the success of the extension which opened in September 2008.
The Bullring in Birmingham and Brent Cross shopping centre in London also showed a good performance.
In the UK portfolio, like-for-like sales in department stores rose by 3.2% in 2010 with nearly all operators in this sector showing some growth.
Unit shops saw selective sales growth with catering specialists performing well.
Within fashion, the MSUs remain the strongest format for sales growth as consumers still favour larger stores which provide a one-stop shop for footwear, lingerie, accessories and clothing.
24 business review business review continued Footfall across the UK portfolio has increased by 1.8% on a like-for-like basis and by 8.0% including Silverburn, Glasgow and Union Square, Aberdeen.
Nearly all centres recorded growth in the number of visitors, with Cabot Circus in Bristol showing the largest increase at 11.2%.
In France, overall spending increased by 1.0% in 2010, marginally ahead of the performance in the previous year.
Nationally, sales at regional shopping centres fell by 0.6% on a like-for-like basis, whilst Hammerson shopping centres showed an increase of 0.7%.
Strasbourg recorded the best performance with sales up 4.7%, reflecting a recovery following the opening of a competing centre in late 2008.
Our other regional shopping centres showed a positive trend with the exception of Bercy 2 -9.5% which suffered from competitor activity.
In the Hammerson France portfolio, turnover at unit shops was positive at 1.5% whilst larger stores saw sales decline by 0.9%: hypermarket sales decreased by 2.2%.
Footfall performances outperformed the national benchmark with an increase of 0.7% year-on-year.
Within the Hammerson portfolio, Espace Saint Quentin and Place des Halles outperformed.
rent to sales ratio Across the UK portfolio, affordability levels, measured as rent as a percentage of sales, have improved as a result of retail sales growth.
Only one centre reported an increase in rent to sales ratio, reflecting recent rent reviews.
In France, the level of rents in relation to turnover is generally lower than in the UK.
The modest movements seen in the indexation of rents compared to turnover growth has meant that rent to sales ratios fell during 2010 at nearly all Hammersons shopping centres.
For the UK it includes tenants break options.
For France, it is based on the date of lease expiry.
2 The ERV at 31 December 2010 for leases that expire or break in each year and ignoring the impact of rental growth and any rent-free periods.
As shown in the table above, during the period from 2011 to 2013 leases with current rents passing of 72.9 million will expire, or are subject to tenants break clauses.
We estimate that additional rents of 3.9 million per annum would be secured, assuming renewals take place at current rental values.
The potential uplifts in the UK and French retail portfolios are partly offset by over-renting at the UK offices, particularly at 99Bishopsgate where there are lease expiries in 2011.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, lease incentives or possible changes in rental values.

2 Projected rents for space that are subject to review in each year, based on the higher of the current rental income and the ERV as at 31 December 2010 and ignoring the impact of changes in rental values before the review date.
At 31 December 2010, the investment portfolio was 2.0% reversionary, compared with 4.1% reversionary at the end of 2009.
The change during the year resulted from an increase in passing rents and lower ERVs reflecting acquisitions and disposals.
Our shopping centre and retail park portfolios were 4.8% and 2.8% reversionary respectively at the end of 2010, whilst the offices were 14.0% over-rented, principally due to Leadenhall Court, 99 Bishopsgate and 125 Old Broad Street in the City of London.
In the UK, leases with passing rents of 100.4 million are subject to review over the next three years.
If reviewed at current rental values, we estimate that rents receivable in respect of these leases would increase by 3.8 million per annum by 2013.
Furthermore, assuming that outstanding rent review negotiations are concluded at current rental values, an additional 2.7 million per annum would be secured.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of potential changes in rental values before the relevant review dates.
In France, the majority of leases are subject to annual indexation.
ContraCted inCome In 2011, our cash flow will increase by around 9 million due to leases and contracts that have been signed at Union Square in Aberdeen, 125Old Broad Street and 60 Threadneedle Street in the City of London and 54-60 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor in Paris.
On an accounting basis, the increase will be approximately 4 million.
Current and Future developments We have three objectives for our development programme: to create assets which generate an attractive initial yield with the potential for future growth in income: to create assets valued at a surplus above cost: and to create prime assets of a type which are difficult to obtain in the open market.
Hammerson has built a reputation as one of the leading developers in the UK and France, managing complex urban regeneration schemes and forging strong links with local authorities and key occupiers.
We currently have one development underway, at Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille.
2 Les Terrasses du Port, at 56,000m, will be one of the largest shopping centre developments in France over the next few years and will comprise 160 shops and 2,600 car parking spaces.
We acquired the site in December 2009 and have since established relationships with key local stakeholders and re-engineered the scheme to optimise the retail layout, reduce costs and target a BREEAM Excellent environmental rating.
By renegotiating the construction contracts to fixed cost and creating comprehensive tenant mix and leasing strategies, we have reduced risk considerably.
Enabling works commenced in August and we expect to start the main construction in spring 2011 with completion forecast in spring 2014.
The projects total development cost is estimated at 370 million and the centre is projected to generate income of 28 million, net of head rents payable and leases representing 49% of the retail income are pre-let or under offer.
26 business review business review continued We have a substantial pipeline of potential future development opportunities and continue to maintain close contact with the local authorities involved with these schemes.
A number of milestones in the progression of these projects have been met during 2010.
2 Planning consent comprising 1.4 million m of mixed-use development was granted in October for the regeneration of Brent Cross Cricklewood as a new town centre.
The judicial review period has expired and the planning consent is free from challenge.
We intend to work 2 up a phased masterplan in 2011, including a 78,000m retail and leisure extension to Brent Cross shopping centre.
On the Cricklewood site, 2 2 2 2 we are planning 33,000m of retail accommodation, office and leisure space of 450,000m and 26,000m respectively, a 61,000m hotel, 7,500 residential units and new schools.
In June, Hammerson assumed control of the Cricklewood project from its former joint venture partner, Brookfield Europe Limited.
The broader regeneration plans are under the control of the Brent Cross Cricklewood Development Partners, comprising Hammerson and Standard Life Investments UK Shopping Centre Trust.
We submitted in November a detailed planning application for our office scheme at London Wall Place, formerly known as the St Alphage House site.
The project involves the creation of two landmark buildings at 121 and 123 London Wall, London EC2, to replace the existing 2 podium and 1950s tower.
The 28,000m headquarter office building to be built at 121 London Wall will encompass extensive multi-level landscaped terraces and offer flexible space ranging from large trading floors to individual office suites.
To the west of the site, 123 London 2 Wall will provide 18,000m of office space in an elegant multi-tenanted building.
More than half the site will comprise publicly accessible open space in the form of a series of gardens.
We anticipate that the application will be determined by the summer of 2011 and are currently seeking to pre-let 121 London Wall.
Subject to planning approval and occupier demand, completion of that building would be in 2014 and, following a fit-out period, it would be ready for occupation by the middle of 2015.
2 We have planning permission for the Bishops Place, London EC2, regeneration project.
Foster Partners have designed a 140,000m scheme encompassing two high-quality office buildings, a 51-storey mixed-use tower providing residential and hotel accommodation, retail space 2 and 50 affordable housing units.
We are proposing to submit a revised application for an office building of 52,000m, with individual floors of 2 3,800m, together with a 51-storey residential tower and ancillary retail.
Our approach is to pre-let a significant portion of the office space and seek a specialist developer to partner the residential element.
Watermark WestQuay is a development project set on a four hectare brownfield site adjacent to our existing WestQuay shopping centre.
2 The planning consent for the mixed-use scheme includes up to 24,000m of retail accommodation, a hotel, a 240-unit apartment building and leisure facilities.
We have a development agreement with Southampton City Council and are working with the council and other stakeholders to bring forward the retail and leisure elements of the scheme.
We also have a development agreement with Sheffield City Council for Sevenstone, a retail-led city centre development, and are in discussion with the council to complete the land acquisition phase of the scheme.
Sevenstone has outline planning consent, some of the buildings within the scheme have detailed consent and we are working closely with principal stakeholders, such as John Lewis, to progress the project.
2 The current scheme comprises 80,000m of retail and leisure accommodation and 2,500 car parking spaces.
Outline planning consent has been renewed for Eastgate Quarters, Leeds, our proposed retail-led regeneration of Leeds city centre.
We have agreements for lease with anchors John Lewis and Marks & Spencer and a development agreement with Leeds City Council.
A new outline planning application for an improved scheme will be submitted early in 2011.
2 In February 2011, we acquired SQY Ouest, a 31,000m shopping centre in Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines, in a 50:50 joint venture with Codic France.
The total consideration for the property was 33 million and Hammersons initial commitment was 17 million, including transaction costs.
SQY Ouest is a modern retail and leisure scheme developed in 2005, and is adjacent to Espace Saint Quentin, in which we have a 25% interest.
SQY Ouest has over 45 retailers on four floors, including international brands such as Bershka, GoSport, Virgin Megastore and Zara.
The top floor is anchored by one of UGCs most successful multiplex cinemas.
SQY Ouest is currently 87% occupied, and there is an opportunity to reconfigure the existing centre by introducing new anchor tenants, improving the catering offer, and creating additional retail space.
Hammerson will manage the centre.
We were appointed in January 2010 as development and asset manager of The Rock, Bury, by the administrators of Thornfield Ventures Limited.
The shopping centre opened on schedule on 16 July and at that time, leases representing 78% of the projected income had been exchanged or were in solicitors hands, meeting the target set on our appointment.
