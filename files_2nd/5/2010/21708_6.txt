class $2.2 billion of net investment return and foreign exchange differences giving an approximate August month end AuM of $37.4 billion.
A continuation of these trends will bode well for BlueBay: with its strong fixed income fund platform and credit capabilities.
In summary, we feel confident of the firms prospects for the coming year.
We believe that we are well placed to deliver further progress on AuM with net inflows for the full financial year estimated at $5 to $8 billion, likely skewed to the second half of the year, revenues, profitability and returns to shareholders as we further develop our business.
Progress will occasionally be punctuated by challenges, as the global equity sell-off of May 2010 reminded us, but we believe the key ingredients of our future success structural asset class growth, good investment performance, a loyal investor base and a good name remain very much in place.
We look forward to working towards another year of strong returns for our fund investors and shareholders alike.
A thank you Finally, I should like to put on record my thanks to all of BlueBays employees for the application and professionalism they have shown during 2010.
Our business is dependent upon our people and the success we have had is a reflection of their quality and determination.
We are indeed fortunate to enjoy the loyalty and dedication of such an outstanding group of professionals.
