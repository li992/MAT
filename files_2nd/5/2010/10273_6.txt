occupancy shows rooms occupied by hotel guests, expressed as a percentage of rooms available for sale.
Average room rate is the revenue from room sales divided by the number of room nights sold.
revenue per Available room revpAr is the average room rate multiplied by the occupancy percentage.
Hotel operating profit is the profit derived from hotel operations, excluding central regional costs, other operating income expense, impairment and results from joint ventures and associates.
The Board regularly monitors operating KPIs against agreed budgets and forecasts.
When comparing year on year, the Group strips out the effect of currency movements by translating all numbers to the current years i. e. 2010 average exchange rates.
ConsoLiDAteD operAtinG perForMAnCe On a consolidated basis, the Group delivered a strong operating performance in 2010, with positive improvements registered on all key performance indicators.
The increase in RevPAR was driven by a concerted effort on the part of management to optimise the economic balance between rate and occupancy, helped by a general recovery in leisure and business travel that gathered pace throughout the year.
RevPAR recovery was more marked in some regions than others, as discussed In the Performance by Region section below: The movement in Hotel Operating Profit reflects RevPAR improvements combined with managements successful control of fixed and variable costs.

uniteD stAtes New York RevpAR increased by 8.8% to 129.53 2009: 119.05 for the full year.
Occupancy and rate both made contributions to this growth in all three hotels.
Occupancy grew by 2.5 percentage points to 85.2% 2009: 82.7%, while rate increased by 5.6% to 152.03 2009: 143.95. the Millenium Hilton achieved double digit growth while Millennium Broadway was close to achieving double digit growth.
By the end of the year, the groups new York properties were still trading at a discount to peak performance levels in 2008. this reflects in part the patchiness of economic recovery in the united states.
through its asset management strategy, the group is examining ways to accelerate recovery to previous performance levels.
initially the groups focus will be on refurbishment of the Millennium un plaza.
the final quarter however saw a slowing down of the growth of the first nine months, due in part to stronger comparatives in 2009.
Occupancy fell in all three hotels by an aggregate of 1.9 percentage points to 84.5% 2009: 86.4%, offset by a 4.7% increase in rate to 177.75 2009: 169.77. the resultant RevpAR was 150.20 2009: 146.68, an increase of 2.4%.
whilst all three hotels experienced lower growth, management issues at the Millennium Broadway produced the lowest growth at this hotel.
these issues have been resolved and the hotel is expected to resume improved trading in 2011.
Regional US Regional us has shown improving growth all year and concluded the full year with a 5.2% increase in RevpAR to 37.22 2009: 35.37. growth was achieved through a 3.6% increase in rate to 65.64 2009: 63.38 and a 0.9 percentage point increase in occupancy to 56.7% 2009: 55.8%.
the region continued to produce a mixed set of results with double digit growth in some parts of the regional estate and decline in others.
the best year-on-year performance was seen at the groups hotels in Los Angeles, Boston and Cincinnati, all of which recorded revenue increases of more than 10% over the previous year.
the Millennium Hotel Raleigh-Durham and Best western Lakeside both suffered double-digit declines.
the fourth quarter was the best quarter of 2010 with an 11.2% RevpAR increase to 34.99 2009: 31.46 primarily driven by a 7.2% increase in rate to 66.91 2009: 62.43 being the primary driver.
Occupancy increased by 1.9 percentage points to 52.3% 2009: 50.4%.
europe London London continued to improve with a 7.9% RevpAR growth to 90.04 2009: 83.45. the growth has all been in rate.
Occupancy fell by 0.4 percentage points to 83.8% 2009: 84.2%.
RevpAR growth ranged from low single digit to low double digit growth.
London produced the second highest RevpAR growth in the group in the fourth quarter.
Rate has been a factor in this growth in all five hotels and occupancy in three.
Rest of Europe Full year RevpAR grew by 4.6% in the rest of europe region to 51.03 2009: 48.80.
During the fourth quarter, RevpAR increased by a stronger 9.5% to 52.35 2009: 47.82.
Regional uK Regional uK performance weakened over the year with RevpAR falling by 1.1% to 44.80 2009: 45.28. the reduction was due to average room rate decreasing by 3.5% to 61.45 2009: 63.69, offset by a 1.8 percentage point increase in occupancy to 72.9% 2009: 71.1%.
pressure on rate was most acute in hotels at Aberdeen, newcastle, Manchester and plymouth, due to a combination of increased supply and contracting government expenditure.

All hotels have seen strong RevpAR growth and the two new integrated resorts in sentosa and Marina Bay have not negatively impacted the regions performance.
the group launched its new studio M brand in the first half of the year.
it has traded very well for a new opening and was eBitDApositive within the first three months of operation.
Due to stronger comparatives, the RevpAR growth in the fourth quarter slowed down to a still impressive 22.4% with a 1.0 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 21.0% increase in rate.
Rest of Asia RevpAR grew by 8.7% to 56.54 2009: 52.03 driven by occupancy which increased by 3.5 percentage points to 73.0% 2009: 69.5% and a 3.4% increase in rate to 77.45 2009: 74.87. the most significant volume increase was in Heritage Manila.

Headline earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation eBitDA is EBITDA adjusted to exclude other operating income and expenses, non-operating income and separately disclosed items of the Group and of joint ventures and associates.
Headline profit before tax is profit before tax adjusted to exclude other operating income and expenses, non-operating income and separately disclosed items of the Group and joint ventures and associates.
Headline profit after tax is profit after tax adjusted to exclude: other operating income and expenses, non-operating income and separately disclosed items of the Group and of joint ventures and associates after tax: tax impact of changes in tax rates on opening deferred tax: and tax impact of changes in tax legislation.
Headline earnings per share is Basic Earnings Per Share adjusted to exclude other operating income and expenses, nonoperating income and separately disclosed items of the Group and joint ventures and associates net of tax and non-controlling interests, tax allowances and tax impact of changes in tax rates on opening deferred taxes.
Free cash flow is defined as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less flows from financing activities and flows from the acquisition disposal of subsidiaries, operations, joint ventures or associates.
Free Cash Flow allows Management and external parties to evaluate the Groups liquidity and cash generated by its operations.
It reflects the cash available to strengthen the balance sheet or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases.
Reconciliation of free cash flow to the closest GAAP measure Net Cash Inflow from Operating Activities is provided on page 37. net debt shows the Groups indebtedness and liquidity position and is calculated as the total of current and non-current interest-bearing loans, bonds and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Management considers that it is useful and necessary to communicate net debt to investors and other interested parties.
It facilitates comparability of Group indebtedness and liquidity with other companies, although the Groups measure of net debt may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
There is no definition of net debt within International Financial Reporting Standards.
Gearing is an Illustration of the Groups indebtedness relative to its equity value and is calculated as net debt as a percentage of total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.

However, the majority of the Companys subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates report their revenue, costs, assets and liabilities in currencies other than sterling.
The Company translates the revenue, costs, assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates into sterling, and this translation of other currencies into sterling could materially affect the amount of these items in the Group Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.

Headline profit before tax rose by 52.6% to 128.5m 2009: 84.2m.
The bigger increase in headline profit before tax was due to reduced net finance cost arising from lower interest rates and lower net debt.
The smaller increase in headline earnings per share - up 48.3% to 30.1p 2009: 20.3p reflects the impact of a higher effective tax rate.

This conversion rate has been adversely impacted by the expensing of 4.3m of sales and marketing expenditure on the Orchid hotel redevelopment into condominiums which will only produce revenue on completion.
If this expenditure is excluded then the conversion rate is 54.1%.
At hotel level the GOP conversion rate is 63.9%.
This conversion rate illustrates the ongoing impact on Group profitability of strong cost management and various restructuring exercises over the last two years.
The difference between the operating profit conversion and the hotel GOP is principally attributable to the aforementioned Orchid expenditure and secondly to variable rentals charged to the four Singapore hotels owned by CDLHT.
These rentals are determined by both revenue and profit streams of the properties.

taxation The Group recorded a tax expense of 30.7m 2009: 7.3m excluding the tax relating to joint ventures and associates, giving rise to an effective rate of 29.6% 2009: 10.8%.
The higher effective rate is due primarily to the impact of a change in tax legislation in New Zealand, which has removed the ability to depreciate buildings for tax purposes, resulting in an increased deferred tax liability.
This is partly offset by the impact of reduced tax rates applied to brought forward net deferred tax liabilities in Taiwan, New Zealand and the UK.
A tax charge of 4.4m 2009: 2.3m relating to joint ventures and associates is included in the reported profit before tax.

Risk identification workshops are facilitated by the Head of Risk and Internal Audit to identify the risks faced by the business.
Risk registers are compiled, and periodically updated, which map the nature of the risks relative to their likelihood of occurrence and severity and associated trends.
Individual management committee members are assigned responsibility for devising risk treatment plans to eliminate, minimise or transfer risks.
The Chief Executive Officer and Executive Management Committee undertake regular reviews of the risk register and progress with risk management plans.
Overall responsibility for the risk management process adopted by the Group lies with the Board.
On behalf of the Board the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Groups risk management processes and other internal controls.
The Head of Risk and Internal Audit provides the Audit Committee with a quarterly update of risk management activity and the risk register.
risk Factors In this section we describe the principal risks that could have a material effect on the Groups business activities.
We provide information on the nature of the risk, actions taken to mitigate risk exposure and an indication of whether the type of risk is increasing, reducing or remains largely unchanged.
Not all potential risks are listed below.
Some risks are excluded because the Board considers them not material to the Group as a whole.
Additionally, there may be risks that are not reasonably foreseeable at the date of this report for the Group to assess fully their potential impact on the business.
The order in which risks are presented below is not indicative of the relative potential impact on the Group.
The potential effect of these risks may be material to the Groups business by having an impact on revenues, profits, net assets and financial resources.
Such risks also have the potential to impact on the Groups reputation.
It is often difficult to assess with accuracy the likely impact of an event on a Groups reputation, as any damage may often be disproportionate to the events actual financial impact.
