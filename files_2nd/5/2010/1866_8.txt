Business Review Our Marketplace BBA Aviation provides aviation support and aftermarket services across three key markets business and general aviation, commercial and military.
Business and General Aviation The Business and General Aviation B&GA market accounts for approximately two thirds of our revenue.
InSignature, we principally focus on business jets but in our Aftermarket Services and Systems business as well as jets we also support turbo prop powered fi xed-wing aircraft and civil helicopters.
Worldwide there are more than 16,000 jets, 12,000 turbo props and some 17,000 civil helicopters in operation.
Following a period of unprecedented growth in deliveries of turbine powered B&GA aircraft and in the utilisation of the B&GA fl eet up to 2008, in 2009 and 2010 there was a sharp reduction in business jet and turboprop deliveries, and in B&GA fl ying hours.
Original equipment manufacturers OEMs saw substantial cancellations of orders for new jets and, at the same time, the inventories of used business jets increased to historically high levels while prices for these jets tumbled.
Since our business model is based on supporting the in-service fl eet of aircraft, for the most part we have not been directly aff ected by the reduction in new aircraft deliveries as even at the current low level of new jet deliveries, the overall fl eet continues to grow.
Whilst we are not aff ected by the reduction in delivery of new aircraft, we were aff ected by the reduction in fl ying hours.
Having reached a peak in 2007, over the course of 2008 and 2009 US fl ight activity fell by more than 30%, reaching a low point in the second quarter of 2009 before showing sequential improvement and eventually returning to growth for the fi first time in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Cyclical recovery continued into 2010 with every month showing growth over the same month in the previous year.
For 2010 as a whole the North American B&GA market grew by 10%.
At the end of 2010 the market remained 21% below the 2007 peak.
Industry forecasters now expect recovery in new aircraft sales to begin in 2012 with a return to pre-recession levels by 2016, with approximately 10,000 new business jets expected to be delivered during 2011-19.
This is one of the indicators that supports our confi dence in the growth of this market over the longterm.
