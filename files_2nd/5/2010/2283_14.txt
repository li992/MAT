energy General industrial gloBal markets aerospace demand in 2010 differed markedly between requirements for new build programmes and for the maintenance and repair market.
new build revenues were robust, being driven by raw material requirements for example major forgings, which tend to increase more than a year ahead of corresponding finished components.
this is, therefore, an encouraging leading indicator for future demands for our ade business.
on the other hand, demand for maintenance and repair was soft, although it showed revenue By geography signs of increasing in quarter four, as passenger miles continued western europe to rise from the depressed levels of 2009. north america power generation demand fell by 28% in 2010 compared to 2009, emerging Markets largely as a result of a severe reduction in industrial gas turbine build.
this sector began to fall in quarter four of 2009, a year later than early cycle businesses felt the impact of the recession, and reflects continuing difficulty in obtaining financing for major capital projects.
the new build weakness has been exacerbated by generally lower electricity demand in the western economies, which has reduced maintenance requirements.
revenues from oil & gas customers increased by 37%.
