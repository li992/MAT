Orthopaedic Reconstruction revenues grew at 3% to $1,537 million, achieving above market growth in the second half of 2010 as our performance improved and grew at the market rate for the year as whole.
The year has been marked in particular by the economic environment and the strength of our knee franchise.
There has continued to be pressure from the challenging environment on higher specification and early intervention knee and hip implant systems.
Despite the market conditions, our knee franchise outperformed the market by growing at 5%, as our LEGION Knee System delivered strong growth.
This was driven by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA clearance to claim that our VERILAST bearing technology for knee replacement provides wear performance sufficient for 30 years of actual use under typical conditions and by our VISIONAIRE Patient Matched Instrumentation sets.
In our hip franchise both our traditional and new products have continued to perform well, led by our R3 Acetabular System.
Sales of our BIRMINGHAM HIP Resurfacing System have been weaker, but we are confident that our programme of reinforcing the superior clinical data with surgeons and patients will be effective.
Overall, our hip franchise delivered flat underlying growth.
In the US, Orthopaedic Reconstruction revenues grew by 3% and in Europe, where we implemented a series of operational improvements during 2009, our business improved and revenues grew by 2%.
In the rest of the world our emerging market business contributed another strong performance.
Orthopaedic Trauma revenues were $435 million, growth of 3%.
Our Trauma business improved consistently throughout the year as the management actions to provide additional support and training to the sales force were successful.
These actions were supported by the introduction of new products, such as TRIGEN SURESHOT Distal Targeting System for screw placement and a new range of foot and ankle treatment products.
