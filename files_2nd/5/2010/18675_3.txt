Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:54 Page 07 Business review Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 07 Mitre Square, London EC3 business review Our goals Our overriding long term strategy is to make excellent returns for our shareholders through a broadly based, diversified property business, which has access to a very wide range of opportunities.
We do this with a small, long serving management team who have a significant proportion of their own wealth invested in a 17% stake in the Company and have no competing interests.
We try to keep execution risk to a minimum, working with first rate joint venture partners when we move into new areas of property business.
Development programme Helical seeks to provide a continuing flow of development profits.
It has good experience across the different sectors of offices, retail, industrial, mixed use and residential retirement village schemes.
These developments are either pre let or speculative and financed either by Helical or by third party funding partners.
Helical tends to develop smaller schemes on its own and works on larger schemes either as development manager, typically being paid a small fee in return for a greater share of profit to incentivise a successful outcome, or with equity invested alongside our partner.
Year to 31 March 2010 Profits from the Groups development programme of 8.7m 2009: 15.6m were again turned into net losses by provisions of 10.0m 2009: 23.3m made against the carrying value of development stock.
The profits generated during the year came from a range of developments including the retail schemes at Opole, Poland and Trinity Square, Nottingham: industrial schemes at Kidlington and Southall and at Aycliffe industrial estate: our office scheme at Riverbank House, London EC1 and at Bramshott Place Retirement Village.
Provisions were made against the carrying value of land held for industrial and change of use potential.
