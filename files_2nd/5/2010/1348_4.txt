business and financial review introduction Right: Geoff Drabble, Chief executive Far right: Ian Robson, Finance director Ashtead is the second largest equipment rental group in the world with our operations split between the US where we operate as Sunbelt Rentals or Sunbelt and in the UK where we trade as A-Plant.
We provide rental equipment in all manner of scenarios and across a wide variety of industries.
We aim to create a highly flexible business model both in terms of the overall speed of responsiveness to market conditions and the variety of markets we serve.
The largest end market for our services continues to be new-build, non-residential construction but we also serve a wide range of other markets such as facilities management, repair and renewal, disaster relief, event management and traffic control, as well as also being involved in residential construction.
This diversification serves to limit our exposure to a downturn in any one market.
However, given the extent of the recent recession, we have still been substantially impacted over the last two years.
We recognise the cyclical nature of the construction markets we serve and have always managed the business accordingly.
In the past year this has enabled us to deliver good operational performance in a difficult climate relative to both our US and UK peers.
Over the next few pages we set out our principal building blocks for growth: our people, our infrastructure, our fleet and our balance sheet strength.
We also demonstrate the strategic management principles in place during each phase of the economic cycle and where we consider ourselves to be within the current cycle.
