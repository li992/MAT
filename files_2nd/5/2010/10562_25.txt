Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Chief Executive Officers review Group results I am pleased to report that Morgan Crucible made encouraging progress in its performance in 2010.
The Groups well-established strategy of focusing on the right growth markets and the right growth countries generated good year-on-year improvement in both revenue and profits.
Group revenue increased by 7.9% relative to 2009 with notably good growth from our businesses in developing world economies such as China, India and Brazil.
This top-line growth allied to tight operational cost management meant that our year-on-year profit growth was strong, with Group profit before taxation up a very healthy 115.6% compared to 2009.
Mark Robertshaw Divisional highlights Chief Executive Officer Our focus has remained on the actions we ourselves can take to improve the quality and performance of our business rather than relying on the vagaries of the Looking to the future, I am economic cycle.
To this end, in July of 2010 I announced the streamlining and confident that Morgan Crucible simplification of the Groups organisational structure by rationalising the existing is well placed in 2011 and beyond business units into two Divisions.
The two new Divisions are Morgan Ceramics, to deliver further improvements comprising the Technical Ceramics and Thermal Ceramics Businesses, and Morgan to our performance.
Engineered Materials, comprising the Morgan AM&T, including NP Aerospace, and MMS Businesses.
My expectation is that the combined Businesses will deliver faster growth at higher margins through their strengthened global presence, deeper and broader end-market coverage and combined management talent.
Over and above the accelerated growth potential, the opportunity to leverage common infrastructures will provide critical mass and operational cost efficiencies.
