The increase in RevPAR was driven by a concerted effort on the part of management to optimise the economic balance between rate and occupancy, helped by a general recovery in leisure and business travel that gathered pace throughout the year.
RevPAR recovery was more marked in some regions than others, as discussed in the Performance by Region section below.
The movement in hotel operating profit reflects RevPAR improvements combined with managements successful control of fixed and variable costs.

UNITED STATES New York RevPAR increased by 6.1% to 132.44 2010: 124.83 for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Room rate was the driver for this growth showing a 5.7% increase to 154.86 2010: 146.51 with occupancy increasing by 0.3 percentage points to 85.5% 2010: 85.2%.
All three hotels saw an upturn in RevPAR with the highest RevPAR growth produced by the Millennium UN Plaza of 7.4%.
Regional US RevPAR growth for the year was 5.7% to 37.91 2010: 35.87.
This growth was mainly driven by an increase in room rate of 4.3% to 66.00 2010: 63.25 while occupancy improved by 0.7 percentage points to 57.4% 2010: 56.7%.
The top RevPAR performers were Minneapolis and Lakeside, Orlando whilst at the bottom end were Anchorage and Durham.
EUROPE London London saw a growth in RevPAR in the year of 8.8% to 97.92 2010: 90.02.
This was a result of a rate-led strategy which succeeded in achieving an 11.8% increase in room rates to 120.10 2010: 107.45.
There was a decrease in occupancy of 2.3 percentage points to 81.5% 2010: 83.8%.
Regional UK RevPAR fell by 5.1% to 42.48 2010: 44.77 with occupancy decreasing 2.0 percentage points to 70.9% 2010: 72.9% and average room rate falling by 2.5% to 59.92 2010: 61.45.
With the exception of one hotel, all Regional UK hotels experienced RevPAR declines and remain a challenge due to increased competition and pressure on room rates and occupancy.
22 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Overview Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review operating continued France & Germany RevPAR grew by 0.9% to 62.34 2010: 61.78.
On a like-for-like basis, excluding Stuttgart where the lease expired on 31 August 2011, RevPAR increased by 0.6% to 65.19 2010: 64.83.
This was due to an increase in occupancy of 3.1 percentage points to 67.7% 2010: 64.6% whilst room rate fell by 4.0% to 96.23 2010: 100.28.
However, the two years are not directly comparable.
Beijing was consolidated on 15 November 2010 following the acquisition of the Groups additional 40% interest, Studio M opened at the end of quarter one in 2010 and the Orchid closed on 1 April 2011.
On a like-for-like basis, which includes Beijing and the latter six months of Studio M and excludes Orchid, RevPAR increased by 5.0% to 72.91 2010: 69.44.
This was mainly driven by a 4.6% increase in average room rate to 94.48 2010: 90.31 whilst occupancy grew by 0.3 percentage points to 77.2% 2010: 76.9%.
Singapore Singapore reported 11.5% increase in RevPAR to 95.20 2010: 85.41.
On a like-for-like basis, including the latter six months of Studio M and excluding Orchid, RevPAR increased by 6.1% to 99.15 2010: 93.41.
This was driven by a 6.7% increase in average room rate to 113.03 2010: 105.94 and occupancy dipped by 0.5 percentage points to 87.7% 2010: 88.2%.
Rest of Asia RevPAR for the year was almost flat with a 0.2% increase to 57.60 2010: 57.47 whereas for 2010, Beijing is only included for six weeks.
On a like-for-like basis, including Beijing for a full year in both periods, RevPAR grew by 3.8% to 57.60 2010: 55.47, whilst the room rate increased by 2.8% to 81.10 2010: 78.89.
Occupancy increased by 0.7 percentage points to 71.0% 2010: 70.3%.
There are two other factors impacting results: firstly, the aforementioned guest room renovations at the Seoul Hilton which overall resulted in a 4.8% fall in its RevPAR and, secondly, new competition opened in Taipei resulting in RevPAR falling by 2.8%.
23 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Overview Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review operating continued AUSTRALASIA RevPAR at 37.56 was 2.1% up on last year 2010: 36.80.
RevPAR excluding the three Christchurch hotels that were closed following an earthquake was up 5.3% from last year at 37.02 2010: 35.17, the main driver being growth of 7.6% in average room rate to 58.05 2010: 53.97.
Occupancy declined by 1.4 percentage points to 63.8% 2010: 65.2%.
The earthquake resulted in three Christchurch hotels namely Millennium Hotel Christchurch leased, Copthorne Hotel Christchurch Central owned and Copthorne Hotel Christchurch City leased being closed down by Civil Defence Emergency Management.
Copthorne Hotel Christchurch City was demolished in late 2011 and, accordingly, the net book value was fully written down.
A settlement was reached with the insurers on the building and assets and the funds were received in the fourth quarter.
In relation to the Millennium Hotel Christchurch and Copthorne Hotel Christchurch Central, management is still awaiting the structural engineering reports as these hotels remain inaccessible.
The impact on the two hotels cannot yet be reasonably quantified and consequently no provision for asset write-off has yet been made.
Both hotels are insured for material damage and business interruption.

The headline operating profit increase of 38.7% to 199.8m 2010: 144.1m was impacted by several factors.
These include the following: The sale of development land in Kuala Lumpur: Closure of the Copthorne Orchid on 1 April 2011, prior to its demolition and redevelopment of the site into a condominium complex: Consolidation of the results of the Grand Millennium Beijing since November 2010 when the Groups stake was increased from 30% to 70% : Closure of the three Christchurch hotels following the New Zealand earthquake: Opening of Studio M towards the end of the first quarter of 2010 and its subsequent sale and leaseback to the REIT in May 2011: and Expiry of the lease in Stuttgart in August 2011 which included a 10.1m year-onyear impact of the release of a dilapidation provision.
Excluding these factors, the headline operating profit increased by 8.0% to 160.0m 2010: 148.2m, which reflects both improved hotel trading performance coupled with tight cost control.
Basic earnings per share increased by 65.0% to 51.0p 2010: 30.9p, reflecting both higher profit and a lower effective tax rate.
The impact of foreign exchange movements is shown below and in constant currency terms the operating profit variance of 53.9m represents a 75.8% profit conversion rate.
The conversion masks the impact of items noted above.
Excluding the revenue and operating results of these factors, the conversion rate is 38.5%.
At the hotel level, the GOP conversion is 77.2% and if similarly adjusted to exclude these factors is 66.1%.
The difference between the operating profit and hotel GOP conversion rates is principally attributable to variable rentals charged to the five Singapore hotels owned by CDLHT.
These rentals are determined by both revenue and profit streams of the properties.

The effective tax rate has been affected by a number of factors which include the following items: Separately disclosed items of the Group: Sale of Kuala Lumpur land: Release of a dilapidation provision for the Stuttgart hotel whose lease expired on 31 August 2011: A change in 2010 of New Zealand tax legislation, which removed the ability to depreciate buildings for tax purposes that resulted in an increased deferred tax liability in that year: Reduced tax rates applied to brought forward net deferred tax liabilities in the UK and additionally for 2010 in Taiwan and New Zealand: and Tax adjustments in respect of previous years.
