During the year, there were forward contracts in place to hedge against the Groups Euro cash inflows and a portion of the Groups US Dollar and Japanese Yen cash inflows for the year.
As a result of changes in the exchange rates of Sterling against these currencies, there was a loss for the year of 1.7m on maturity of these contracts, relative to the exchange rates pertaining at the maturity dates and compared with a loss of 9.1m in the previous year.

rIsKs and uncertaIntIes current trading levels and order book The Group has seen a rapid upturn in its global business over the last two years, particularly in its core metrology business and especially in the Far East.
The continuation of this healthy growth in the Groups revenue, which accelerated from 6% in the 2010 financial year to 59% in 2011 is difficult to predict, especially as orders from customers generally involve short lead-times with the outstanding order book at any time being around one months worth of revenue value.
This limited forward order visibility leaves the annual revenue forecasts uncertain and requires careful management of production and inventory levels.
