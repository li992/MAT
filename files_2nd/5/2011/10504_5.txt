Consequently the Group has recorded additional revenues of 3.2m in the statutory results for the year together with a credit of 0.2m in administrative expenses.
Of these amounts the Group has included a credit of 0.7m to revenue in the year 2010: nil together with a charge of 0.4m to administrative costs 2010: nil in adjusted EBITDA.
Certain share option charges relating to Directors, senior management and other employees of the Group arising from the time the Group listed or when it was privately owned have been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA in 2010.
A charge for awards made under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan is included within the adjusted results for 2010 and 2011.
