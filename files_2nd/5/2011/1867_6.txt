Business Review Business Review Our Markets BBA Aviation is the only quoted, focused provider of global aviation services and aftermarket support to operators of Business and General Aviation, Military and Commercial aircraft.
The Group delivers these services through circa 11,000 employees at over 200 individual locations on five continents.
Business and General Aviation Simon Pryce Business and General Aviation B&GA covers a wide spectrum and large number of aircraft.
Worldwide Group Chief Executive there are more than 17,000 business jets, 12,000 turboprops and 17,000 turbine civil helicopters in operation.
In our Flight Support division we principally focus on the business jet segment of this market, whereas in Aftermarket Services and Systems we support a broader range of jets, turboprops and helicopters.
The service demands of operators is principally driven by the flying hours of the aircraft they operate and manage.
Supplying services to the B&GA market accounts for roughly two-thirds of BBA Aviations revenue.
B&GA is a valued business efficiency tool and is particularly effective in regions of the world with significant industrial and population centres, separated by large geographical distances with limited intermodal alternatives.
The security, privacy, flexibility and convenience of B&GA aircraft make them a time efficient, and increasingly cost effective alternative to commercial aviation with its long delays, security protocols, crowded terminals and limited routing options.
Over the long-term, B&GA flying and the industrys longer-term structural growth is closely correlated to gross domestic product GDP and anticipated corporate earnings, although it does display volatility across an economic cycle.
Medium-term indicators of flying hours are: the number of new aircraft sold, the number of aircraft retired, the proportion of new delivery positions and the fleet particularly the inproduction fleet held for resale and the pricing of those assets.
Long-term projections for GDP continue to be positive.
However, the muted general recovery in North America and Western Europe together with continuing economic uncertainty represent headwinds to short-term growth in B&GA flying.
Whilst 2011 was another year of growth, building on growth in 2010, movements in North America remain 22% below their peak.
It is still difficult to predict when we will see accelerated growth in B&GA flying, however, medium-term indicators continue to improve.
Although Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs suffered a further reduction in deliveries through much of 2011, external commentators forecast that 2011 should prove to be a trough in new aircraft sales with modest recovery in 2012.
Book to bill rates have begun to improve and external forecasters are projecting steadily increasing growth in OE sales from 2013-2017.
Forecasters do not expect the business jet deliveries to reach the peak levels of 2008 until near the end of the decade but still expect around 10,000 new business jets to be delivered between 2011 and 2020.
Excludes airline and regional jets used for business.

By late 2011, however, we saw evidence of stabilisation in the pricing of used jet aircraft which historically has been a pre-cursor of renewed activity in the used market.
The growth of the fleet outside of North America continues with strong demand for aircraft in emerging areas of the world, most notably Asia and Latin America.
Over the next five years some 45% of business jet production is expected to be delivered outside the US.
The greater travel distances involved in the Asia Pacific region and the increasingly global reach of world trade has created a healthy demand for large cabin, long-range business jets.
This sector has continued to perform well even through the current downturn.
Even at these levels of demand, it will take quite some time before the installed fleet of aircraft in the Asia Pacific region becomes sufficiently large to be a meaningful contributor to our results.
We already benefit from this emerging market fleet when it travels into North America and Western Europe, but we also recognise the potential future importance of point-to-point travel in emerging markets and have recently established a regional office in Singapore and opened a regional turbine centre there early in 2012.

Following a 10% increase in North American B&GA movements in 2010, as the pace of economic recovery slowed, so did the growth in movements, reflecting the long-term correlation of movements to GDP and expectations for corporate earnings.
In 2011 operations grew by 2% in North America and by 2% in Europe.
Commercial Aviation In Flight Support, our commercial aviation service business is focused on providing fuelling, ground handling and technical services to commercial aviation providers around the globe.
Demand for these services is driven by commercial aviation movements.
In addition, in Aftermarket Services and Systems we supply some engine and component repair and overhaul services and serviceable spares to commercial regional jet operators who fly the same small thrust capacity engines that are used on the larger end of the B&GA fleet.
We also supply engine components and accessories and component repair services to the legacy commercial fleet.
World airline passenger traffic continued to expand during 2011 and airline flight hours are at an all time high.
The geographic shift in airline capacity continued to move toward areas such as Latin America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
In both North America and Europe there were modest declines in aircraft movements.
We continue to see favourable outsourcing trends as commercial airlines seek means to control costs by shedding non-core services such as into-plane fuelling.
Military Aviation Our military aviation service businesses focus primarily on the support of legacy military platforms and are driven by the amount of flying they do and the missions they execute.
We expect reductions in defence budgets in the US and Europe to continue as governments look for means to reduce deficits.
We expect budgets for some areas of procurement to decline and we anticipate the largest reductions will be for modernisation programmes.
As a consequence, increased flying for older out-of-warranty equipment currently in service is likely to continue with some platforms likely to receive service extensions that will require additional maintenance and overhaul support which we are well placed to provide.
