Input costs increased versus the prior year.
Wood costs were up on average in excess of 10%, although benchmark hardwood pulp costs were down around 4% per tonne on average.
The Syktyvkar modernisation had the effect of reducing overall bre input costs, as increased pulp self-suf ciency meant that higher wood usage was more than offset by the reduction in purchased pulp costs.
Gas and electricity costs increased in both Syktyvkar and Ruomberok.
All of the 2.1 million hectares of our leased forestry assets in TM Russia are FSC certi ed, ensuring that the natural boreal forest, based on a legislated 110-year cycle, is sustainably managed and there is no loss of HCV in the areas where we operate.

Productivity, measured in terms of output per person, improved by approximately 12% during the year, with annual production records in both Syktyvkar and Ruomberok.
The Syktyvkar modernisation project generated a ROCE in excess of 10% through increased volumes, energy sales and lower consumption of purchased pulp, with further bene ts expected in 2012 as full ramp up is achieved.

Despite the weaker trading environment, management actions have ensured that underlying operating pro t remained largely unchanged.
The business bene ted from the mothballing of the 120,000 tonne per annum UFP machine in Merebank and the related restructuring programme which delivered both substantial cost savings and improved margins arising from an increased focus on the domestic market.
The integrated pulp and paper operation at Richards Bay achieved record saleable production in excess of 750,000 tonnes in the calendar year.
The business continues to focus on operational ef ciencies and improvement opportunities with strong emphasis on energy ef ciency and self-generating capacity.
The Group continues to pursue the settlement of land claims in line with its commitments in this regard.
The South Africa Division continues to work closely with the relevant government departments and hopes to settle further claims during the course of 2012.
During 2011, approximately 25,000 hectares were harvested on Mondi plantations in South Africa.
Approximately 26,000 hectares were re-established, of which 20,000 hectares were planted and the balance grown from harvested stumps coppicing.
Approximately 29.5 million trees were planted during the year to ensure sustained or enhanced production.
Additionally, an area of 77,000 hectares 25% of landholding has been set aside for conservation purposes.
The safety performance for the year was marred by the fatality in our forestry operations.
The incident highlighted basic issues in contractor controls, culminating in the implementation of a more rigorous approach to our high risk, manual tree felling operations.
Overall, the number of reported incidents showed an encouraging downward trend.
The focus in 2012 will include a critical review of safe work procedures, safe systems and risk assessments and the full implementation of a one-man onelock plant isolation system at our mills.
