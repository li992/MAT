Business Review INVESTMENT POLICY i Objective and policy The Companys objective is to enable investors to benefit from growth in the markets for cleaner or more efficient delivery of basic services of energy, water and waste.
Investments are made predominantly in quoted companies which provide, utilise, implement or advise upon technologybased systems, products or services in environmental markets, particularly those of alternative energy and energy efficiency, water treatment and pollution control, and waste technology and resource management.

Alternative Energy and Energy efficiency In the alternative energy and energy efficiency sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: wind turbine manufacturing solar panel manufacturing and integration renewable energy developers and independent power producers biofuels meters, utility software and demand side management industrial energy efficiency buildings energy efficiency transport energy efficiency businesses relating to the trading of carbon and other environmental assets fuel cells, ywheels, superconductors, supercapacitors and other new energy technologies As at 31 December 2011, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 151m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 45% of the Companys portfolio at that time.

Water Treatment and Pollution Control In the water treatment and pollution control sector, the Company may invest in businesses that are principally, but not exclusively, exposed to the following areas: water treatment technologies involved in ltration, purication and separation water infrastructure including pumps, valves and actuators environmental sensing, testing and monitoring air pollution control technologies As at 31 December 2011, the Company had investments totalling in aggregate 81m by value invested in this sub-sector representing 23% of the Companys portfolio at that time.
iii Risk diversication The Company has the following maximum exposures in place in order to ensure that there is a reasonable diversication of risk in the Companys portfolio: a Not more than 10% of the Companys Net Asset Value will be invested in any one company at the time of investment.
b The Company will not make an investment if as a consequence of that investment individual holdings of five per cent or more would in aggregate represent more than 40% of NAV.
The Company did not exceed either of the above maximum exposures during the year ended 31 December 2011.
The Company held investments in 76 quoted companies as at 31 December 2011, the largest one being Nibe Industrier which represented 3.6% of net assets at that time.
The Company does not have prescriptive limits on the maximum amounts that can be invested in the sub-sectors listed above.
The directors believe that the imposition of such limits could impact on efficient portfolio management.
To a limited extent, the Company invests in participatory notes providing economic exposure to underlying shares or securities when it is impracticable or not in the best interests of the Company to invest directly in those shares or securities.
Participatory notes are equity linked notes issued by a third party broker providing long only exposure to underlying shares or securities.
The Board has set a current maximum limit for investment into participatory notes at 5% of net assets, subject to a further limit of 2% of net assets per broker both limits at time of investment.
iv Gearing The Board has authorised the Manager to utilise short-term borrowings of up to 10% of net assets in order to provide liquidity for efficient portfolio management where the Manager sees t. While there is no current intention to utilise long-term borrowings, the Company retains the exibility to do so in appropriate circumstances.
Any long-term borrowings and any borrowings in excess of 10% of net assets would require the separate authorisation of the Board.
The borrowings of the Company shall not at any time, without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution of the Company, exceed an amount equal to one third of the aggregate of: 14 IMPAX ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS PLC Job No.

The directors expect the Company normally to generate returns in the form of capital gains rather than revenue.
In order to meet the investment trust qualifying requirements, the directors are proposing that the Company will pay a final dividend of 0.9p per Ordinary Share 2010: 0.75p per ordinary share absorbing 2,614,185 2010: 2,369,613 based on the Ordinary Shares in issue excluding shares held in Treasury at the date of this report.
It should not be assumed that this level of revenue return or dividend will be repeated in future years.
If approved at the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 24 May 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 27 April 2012.
Therefore the total loss after tax for the Company was 82,104,000 2010: 50,747,000, gain.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Board considers that the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Company fall into the following main categories.
i Market risks Price movements of the Companys investments are highly correlated to performance of global equities in general and small and mid-cap equities in particular.
Consequently falls in stock markets are likely to negatively affect the performance of the Companys investments.
The Company invests in companies with small market capitalisations, which are likely to be subject to higher valuation uncertainties and liquidity risks than larger capitalisation securities.
The Company also invests in unquoted securities which generally have higher valuation uncertainties and liquidity risks than securities listed or traded on a regulated market.
The Company invests in securities which are not denominated or quoted in sterling.
Movements of exchange rates between sterling and other currencies in which the Companys investments are denominated may have an unfavourable effect on the return in the investments made by the Company.
There are inherent risks involved in stock selection.
The Investment Manager is experienced and employs its expertise in selecting the stocks in which the Company invests.
The Manager spreads the investment risk over a wide portfolio of investments in three main sectors and at the year end the Company held investments in 76 quoted companies plus 6 unquoted companies.
The Company will not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but the Manager takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
Further detail on the financial implications of market risk is provided in note 14 to the accounts.
ii Environmental Markets The Company invests in companies in Environmental Markets.
Such companies carry risks that government liberalisation may not occur as expected, costs of technology may not fall, capital spending by their customers is reduced or deferred and their products or services are not adopted.
