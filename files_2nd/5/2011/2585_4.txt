Outlook We have made excellent progress over the past year with our key strategic objectives.
We set up our sales force in the US, agreed the accelerated transition back to BTG of marketing rights to CroFab and DigiFab, invested in PEM and purchased the land in Australia to secure our supply chain.
We were able to make these investments from a fundamentally strong financial position.
Looking ahead, we will receive the full benefits of selling CroFab and DigiFab this year, with significant growth in sales revenues.
We also look forward to a new, potentially significant, royalty stream from ZYTIGA abiraterone acetate, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer that was approved in April 2011 in the US, which will partially offset the loss of royalty revenues from BeneFIX following patent expiry.
On 13 May 2011 we announced that AstraZeneca had terminated the development and option agreement relating to CM-3, under development by CellMed for type 2 diabetes and other indications.
As a result, we will incur a non-cash accounting charge of approximately 8m in the current financial year.
We will continue to invest in a number of areas including the PEM Phase III trials and clinical studies exploring additional uses of 24 Business review BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
