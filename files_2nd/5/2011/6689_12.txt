The uK rail market Public transport is becoming a bigger part of peoples daily lives in the UK.
Millions of people each year rely on the UKs comprehensive rail network to travel for business and leisure.
Latest industry figures show that in 2010 around 1.3 billion train 1 journeys were made on the UK rail network.
The UK rail industry is regulated by the Department for Transport DfT and rail services are operated within franchises run by individual train operating companies TOCs.
There are currently 19 franchises, operated by nine transport providers.
The market is competitive and, with an increasing number of operators entering the market margins remain low.
Profit margins below 5% are not untypical in the current market.
The rail industry is driven by GDP and employment and, as such, the testing economic conditions have presented challenges.
TOCs Our key achievements for 2011 have seen volatility of earnings due to the nature of the current Passenger number and passenger franchising model requiring franchise bids to be submitted on the revenue growth across all three basis of economic forecasts years into the future.

The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 44 Tracks & Trains Under the current structure TOCs are not responsible for rail infrastructure or rolling stock.
Infrastructure is owned and managed by Network Rail and TOCs pay for the right to use it, such as track access fees.
Rolling stock is typically leased from leasing companies for the duration of a franchise.
Ticketing & Fares The DfT regulates peak-time weekday fares i. e commuter based fares, determining the annual January movement in fares through a standard formula.

Regulated passenger revenue increases are factored into bid assumptions, effectively these increases form part of the subsidy reduction or premium increase built into the franchise contract with DfT and generally do not benefit the operators directly.
