The improvement in investment yields was weighted to the first six months of 2011, whereas the rental income effect accumulated more evenly over the year.
The valuation movement in the UK shopping centre portfolio was almost entirely driven by changes to investment yields whilst for retail parks it was income-led.
The picture for UK offices was broadly balanced between yield and income effects.
The valuation uplift in the French portfolio was derived fairly equally from movements in investment yields and income and development surpluses.
However, the positive effects of changes to investment yields were weighted towards the first half of 2011, whilst the income element was more prominent in the second six months following the release of indices for 2012 rental increases.
