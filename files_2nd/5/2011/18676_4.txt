The tables below describe how we allocate our resources between investment and development, and between the various sectors.
The property portfolio tables on pages 26 to 31 explain which properties sit in each category and give more detail on these properties.
Investment The investment portfolio, which is mainly let and income producing, has two main purposes: 1.
To provide a steady income stream to cover overheads, dividends and interest 2.
To produce above average capital growth over the cycle to contribute to growth in the Groups net asset value.
We seek to achieve these aims through careful, disciplined stock picking, generally of multi-let London ofces, shopping centres, industrial estates and mixed portfolios.
Our key aim is to be confident that there is sustainable demand from occupiers for all of our assets.
We frequently reposition our properties through significant refurbishment or extensions.
We work closely with our tenants to maintain full occupancy and these relationships often lead to opportunities to increase value through re-gearing leases or moving tenants within a building as they expand or contract.
Finally, at certain points in the cycle we may buy entirely vacant buildings such as The Morgans, Cardiff or Shepherds Building, London W14 with a view to carrying out a major refurbishment, where we are confident that the occupational market is strong enough to allow the whole building to be let quickly.

Losses from the Groups development programme of 1.7m 2010: profits of 8.7m were increased by provisions of 14.9m 2010: 10.0m made against the carrying value of development stock.
Of the total provisions, 10.2m were recognised at 30 September 2010.
Although profits were generated at our successful retirement village scheme at Bramshott Place, Liphook, losses were made on the sales of Crawley and Fieldgate Street and our industrial developments at Oxford, Kidlington and Southampton as we greatly reduced our stock of non-income producing ofce and retail developments.
These losses were increased by the overhead costs of our retail development joint ventures in the UK and Poland.
At both the half year and year end we assessed the carrying value of our remaining trading and development stock and this led to total write-downs of 14.9m, of which 4.7m was in the second half of the year primarily against ofce buildings in Crawley and Glasgow and our industrial developments.
