qxd 11 7 07 11:55 am Page 14 14 ASHTEAD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW The Group focuses on equipment rental.
During 2006 7 approximately 94% of our revenue was derived from equipment rental and rental related services with the balance coming from sales of new equipment, parts and associated goods, such as equipment accessories.
We believe that equipment rental offers the opportunity to earn substantially higher returns than those which are earned by equipment dealers whose margins are effectively capped by the equipment manufacturer.
OVERVIEW Ashtead operates in the US principally under the name Sunbelt and in the UK principally under the name A-Plant.
In addition, Ashtead Technology serves the global oil industry and operates both offshore and onshore.
Sunbelt is the second largest equipment rental company in the US and A-Plant is the third largest equipment rental company in the UK, in each case, measured by rental revenue.
We provide a wide range of rental equipment, from small handheld machine tools to extensive pump and power systems used in major disaster situations.
In addition, Ashtead Technology rents mainly electronic IAN ROBSON survey and testing equipment in the UK, the US, Singapore and Canada.
FINANCE DIRECTOR We are a service business and it is our network, people and systems that set us apart in our markets.
At Group level, we are focused on the management of an asset intensive business with the aim of delivering superior financial returns.
In years to come, we expect to continue to develop our existing operations and to consider both adding new higher return product types to our offering and extending the geographical markets in which we operate.
We provide solutions in all manner of situations including: Non-residential construction markets providing all types of construction equipment.
Facilities management again providing all types of equipment but used for maintenance and repair rather than new construction.
Disaster relief providing pumps and power generation equipment in all types of application ranging from assistance at times of ooding due to weather e. g. Hurricane Katrina to a burst water supply.
Major event management providing power generation, lighting and other equipment for events such as the Super Bowl and other sporting events, major music concerts and festivals.
Trafc management providing portable trafc systems to facilitate major engineering projects or clean-up after an accident.

Environment, health and safety Ashtead is committed to ensuring the highest standards of health and safety in our day to day operations.
We are also focused increasingly on expanding efforts to limit the environmental impact of our work.
Health and safety concerns for our customers are a key driver for our business as it is a factor contributing to the decision to rent rather than purchase equipment which then has to be maintained and serviced regularly.
Further information on our environment, health and safety policies and procedures can be found in the section on corporate responsibility within the Directors Report.
Risks and uncertainties Seasonality and cyclicality Our revenue and operating results depend signicantly on activity in the commercial construction industry in the US and the UK.
Commercial construction activity tends to decrease in the winter and during extended periods of inclement weather and increase in the summer and during extended periods of mild weather.
Furthermore, due to the incidence of public holidays in the US and the UK, there are more billing days in the first half of our financial year than the second half.
This results in changes in demand for our rental equipment.
In addition, the commercial construction industries in the US and the UK are cyclical industries with activity levels that tend to increase in line with GDP growth and decline during an economic downturn.
The seasonality and cyclicality of the equipment rental industry results in variable demand and therefore, our revenue and operating results will uctuate from period to period.
The Groups exible business model allows it to modify the use of free cash ow according to the economic cycle, as described elsewhere in this review.
Currency translation Our reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, a majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs are denominated in US dollars.
We have arranged our nancing such that approximately 98% of our debt is denominated in US dollars so that we have a natural partial offset between our dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and our dollardenominated debt and interest expense.
Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar with respect to the pound therefore have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reported in pounds.
This impact is greatest on our revenue AS6554 Ashtead front V4.

Environmental and safety matters Our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental The main components of our revenue are: protection and occupational health and safety matters.
These laws regulate revenue from equipment rentals, including related revenues such as the such issues as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous wastes and fees we charge for equipment delivery, erection and dismantling services materials, and air quality.
Under these laws, we may be liable for, among for our scaffolding rentals, fuel provided with the equipment we rent to other things, the cost of investigating and remediating contamination at customers, and loss damage waiver fees: and our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal revenue from sales of new merchandise, including sales of parts and or treatment regardless of fault, and also fines and penalties for nonrevenues from a limited number of sales of new equipment.
