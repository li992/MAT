The developer and co-investing asset manager business model allows the Group to maximise its return on equity by focusing capital on higher value-add activities, principally development, and increasing returns on investment in stabilised assets through performance and management fees.
The establishment of USAF has been pivotal in allowing the Group to pursue its strategy of reducing its exposure to completed, stabilised assets and increasing its commitment to development, particularly in London and other high quality markets in the UK that have the best prospects for growth.
