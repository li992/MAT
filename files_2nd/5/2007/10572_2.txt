Chairman and chief executives statement We are pleased to report a year of significant progress and another set of record results.

Operating cash flow was particularly strong in 2007 with year end net cash of 219m 2006: 95m driven by the increased profitability of the Group and an improvement in working capital management.
Acquisition and performance Our strategy is to develop leading positions in each of our chosen sectors within the construction and regeneration markets.
The acquisition in July of two businesses from Amec plc, Amec Developments renamed Muse Developments and Amecs Design and Project Services business DPS, was driven by this objective.
DPS construction and civil engineering activities have been integrated into our existing Construction and Infrastructure Services divisions.
The acquisition has been significant in strengthening the market positions of both these divisions.
In addition, the acquisition of Muse Developments has created a fifth division of the Group, Urban Regeneration.

We believe that the measure of a market leading position is the quality of the margin rather than the absolute level of revenue.
This better reflects the value premium that clients place on the services that our businesses provide.
The Groups net margin is a blend of each of the divisions margins.
This year operating margins before the impact of integration costs have improved at Affordable Housing, Infrastructure Services and at Construction whilst those at Fit Out have remained consistent with the prior year.
Urban Regeneration made a margin of 16% on its five month contribution to the Groups performance.
Overall the net margin has fallen slightly, principally as a result of integration costs absorbed during the year.
Further comments on divisional margins are made below.
The forward order book includes the value of work still to be undertaken on projects that are legally committed to by clients as well as a conservative assessment of the expected level of activity under framework arrangements.
This is an important measure of future activity levels within the Groups market sectors, which allows the divisions to plan and adapt accordingly.
In addition, Urban Regeneration has interests in a number of regeneration projects.
At this point in time individual elements within projects may not be legally committed but the diagram above shows the value of the divisions forward development pipeline.
The net cash balance is monitored on a daily basis and is important for generating the financial resources to develop and grow the Groups businesses and to fund acquisitions.
The accident incident rate is a key measure of the safe operation of our businesses and is one of a suite of health and safety measures the Group uses to monitor its activities.
The Group does not have any standard measures of client satisfaction and employee satisfaction as each division tailors measures to its individual needs, consistent with the Groups decentralised structure.

Whilst the impact of the credit crunch on the housing sector has been widely reported, the effect on Lovell has been limited as open market sales represent only 30% of the divisions revenues and only around 5% of the Groups revenue.
The division experienced a modest fall in demand for open market sales during the last quarter of 2007, but this was compensated for by resilient refurbishment and new build social housing work.
The priority for the division will be to continue to develop its mixed tenure capabilities and secure larger scale regeneration schemes including those with commercial, retail and leisure components, which we believe to be an increasingly important part of the market moving forward.

The division is a leading mixed use property development and urban regeneration business.
2007 was a success for Muse Developments.
For the five months to December 2007 the division achieved an operating profit of 4.2m on revenue of 26m.
In addition, in 2007 the division was appointed as preferred bidder for four large urban regeneration schemes in Swindon, Doncaster, Manchester and Blackpool with a combined development value of 1.1bn.
The division also successfully completed schemes at Wakefield, Bromley and Durham.
The division starts 2008 with interests in 30 projects with a projected future value of 2.6bn, of which the divisions share is 1.2bn.
In addition, the division will be seeking to finalise and sign development agreements for the four projects referred to above, which are currently being negotiated, and the opportunities for the division remain encouraging.
With its focus on long-term strategic partnership arrangements the division is well placed with a secure forward development pipeline and limited exposure to the revaluation issues currently affecting the property sector.

The overdraft facility is reviewed annually.
Banking facilities are subject to normal financial covenants, all of which have been met in the year.
The agreements for these facilities, and also the Groups facilities for surety bonding, provide for early repayment of drawings upon a change of control of the Company.
The Group has established treasury policies which set out clear guidelines as to the use of counterparties and the maximum period of borrowings and deposits.
Deposits are for periods of no longer than three months and are at rates prevailing on the day of the transaction.
The Group has very limited exposure to foreign exchange risk because its operations are based almost entirely in the UK, where non-UK suppliers are used only occasionally.
Although the Group does not use derivatives, some of its joint venture businesses use interest rate swaps to hedge floating interest rate exposures and a Retail Price Index swap to hedge inflation exposure.
The Group considers that its exposure to interest rate and inflation movements is appropriately managed.
Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
