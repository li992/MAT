Business review Introduction The Group now has significant The past year has been another successful one for the Group.
Many markets touched record highs, with consequent gains to scale across asset classes and we our revenues, our new business wins were at record levels and we continued to develop a more balanced and global client base see excellent opportunities to across a wider range of products.
A significant proportion of inflows came from clients based in Europe, the Middle East and the US.
In January, we opened an office in Frankfurt which has already registered a number of wins.
Our Amsterdam office proved very successful in attracting funds from Dutch pension schemes.
In the Middle East, we widened our existing client base in addition to receiving extra funding.
In the US we continued to attract new business from our strong fixed income teams there.
Overall, we were helped by market developments, with the trend for institutional clients increasingly looking to separate sources of excess returns or alpha from market returns or beta.
For the asset management industry such shifts have magnified business choices.
In one camp, simplistically, are big passive managers, for whom scale is all-important.
In the other are active managers such as ourselves.
The convergence of long-only strategies with those of hedge funds complicates the picture further whilst specialist areas such as commodities are becoming more mainstream.
All participants face similar operational challenges, however.
These include rising overheads, especially for risk management and compliance, tighter regulation and a more crowded market altogether, as barriers to cross-border selling fall, in the funds arena.
We have thought hard about competitive advantage, and which core competencies differentiate us.
Our key strengths are the focus, experience and longevity of our investment teams: longstanding senior management: clearly described investment processes: and sufficient reach to service and prospect for new clients, using both our own resources and those of third parties.
Although we operate globally, our overall size is a secondary consideration.

Outlook An extended period of loose credit in recent years has supported a rising risk appetite which has led to a general narrowing of credit spreads, rising stock markets and commodities.
But as Augusts sub-prime collapse showed, shocks can then transmit quickly across asset classes, which have turned out to be more correlated than previously thought.
While cuts in US interest rates provided relief to financial markets, there remains a danger that underlying global economic growth will falter, led by US housing.
The attraction of alpha could then fade as sentiment deteriorates and investors re-evaluate overall portfolio risk.
With this in mind, we look ahead to 2008 with some caution.
Having said that, we believe the Group is in better balance in terms of structure and client mix than at any time before.
