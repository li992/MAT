BUsiness Review ReAl esTATe sTRATegY Our real estate strategy, which is aimed at maximising the total returns from the portfolio, has three strands: the allocation of our portfolio between the markets and sectors in which we operate by appropriate investment and disposal decisions: management of our properties so that they remain attractive to occupiers, enabling us to increase the groups rental income and other revenues: and the development of properties that will generate attractive income and capital returns.
This Business Review provides more detail on how we performed in these areas during 2007 and the potential future growth in income and value in the portfolio.
pRopeRTY poRTfolio AnD AllocATion We base our decisions on the overall portfolio allocation by detailed analysis of the markets in which we are represented, using both internal and external research.
We review and project the performance of each of our existing properties as part of our annual business planning process, enabling us to identify assets for disposal.
In the last five years we have raised 2.3 billion from disposals and invested 2.4 billion in acquisitions and new developments.
Hammerson owns and manages 14 major shopping centres and 19 retail parks, principally in the UK and France, 2 which provide 1.3 million m of retail space.
Our office portfolio includes nine prime buildings, most of which 2 of accommodation.
are located in and around the City of London and in central Paris, which provide 255,000m Our property portfolio was valued at 7.3 billion at the end of 2007, with investments totalling 6.3 billion and developments 1.0 billion.
Joint ventures accounted for 35% of the portfolio value, including seven major shopping centres in the UK.
During 2007, the weighting of the UK portfolio decreased slightly to 71% of the total, whilst the retail and office weightings were unchanged at 72% and 28% respectively.
Data prepared by IPD shows that, in the UK, shopping centres and London offices have produced average annual total returns of 10.9% and 11.6% respectively over the last ten years.
However, the volatility of the latter is around twice that of the former.
These statistics support Hammersons strategy of investing the majority of the portfolio in dominant shopping centres and retail parks which demonstrate sound performance over the longer term.
The volatility in the office sector, which comprises the balance of the portfolio, provides opportunities to generate high returns by exploiting market cycles.
The value of the portfolio increased by 0.6 billion during 2007 and the components of the movement are analysed in the table below.

However, following an increase in value of 407 million in the first half of 2007, there was a decline of 337 million in the second half.

Income growth, resulting from increased rental values, development surpluses and asset management initiatives, both in the UK and France, generated a further 158 million increase.
By contrast, in the second half of the year, and reflecting weaker general market conditions, investment yields increased in the UK.
France saw a further modest reduction in yields.
The net effect was a fall in values of 457 million.
However, income growth and improved rental values in both countries offset 183 million of this reduction.
Exchange and other items, including properties sold in the year, accounted for the other movements in valuation.

inVesTmenT poRTfolio Our strategy of recycling assets continued in 2007 with some 537 million raised from the disposal of mature assets during the year.
In July, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in 9 place Vendme, Paris 1er, the major office building developed jointly with AXA REIM France.
Hammersons net proceeds from the sale were 207 million, realising a profit of 117 million on our total development costs of 90 million.
Also in July, we sold a 50% interest in WestQuay Shopping Centre, Southampton, for 299 million.
WestQuay was opened in 2000, following its development in a 50:50 joint venture with Barclays, and we purchased their 50% interest in December 2004 for 203 million.
The scheme is anchored by John Lewis 2 and Marks & Spencer and provides 76,200m of high quality retail space.
Hammerson and its new partner, GIC Real Estate, each hold their respective 50% interests in WestQuay in a joint venture partnership, with Hammerson retained as asset manager.
Since the year end, we have sold our interest in One London Wall for net proceeds of 67 million.
2 The 18,500m office building in the City of London was completed in 2003 as a 50:50 joint venture with Kajima.
The book value of Hammersons interest in the property at 31 December 2007 was 69 million.
During 2007, the group invested a total of 824 million of which 407 million was accounted for by expenditure on the current development programme.
In March, we acquired Ravenhead Retail Park, located 2 near St Helens town centre, for 120 million.
It provides 27,500m of retail accommodation with a current passing rent of 4.6 million.
Plans are well advanced for a 12 million extension to the park.
The freehold of Stockley House, London SW1 was acquired in May for a total of 71 million.
Built in 1985, 2 the 6,500m eight-storey office building generates annual net rental income of 3.1 million from leases expiring in 2010 and 2011.
The building is adjacent to Victoria Station where we have existing ownerships.
Hammerson has been selected as preferred development partner by Network Rail for the regeneration 2 of the station, to include a major mixed-use development of up to 100,000m.
The proposals for Stockley House would be incorporated into our broader masterplan for the area.
Annual Report 2007 037 Section BUsiness Review continued In November we agreed final terms for the acquisition of the City of Londons 25% long leasehold interest in Bishops Square, London E1.
Hammerson entered into a joint venture agreement with the City in 2002 to develop the scheme, with the final payment to be made following completion of the building and the confirmation of all costs.
The payment of 130 million has been accrued in the accounts and will be paid in May 2008.
The City retains the freehold interest in the scheme, with Hammerson holding an effective 95% economic interest.
Bishops Square is fully let, principally to Allen & Overy, the international law firm, and the total passing rent from the scheme is 34.6 million.
We expanded our French retail portfolio in 2007 with the acquisition of two retail park developments and The Grand Maine shopping mall, Angers, Maine et Loire.
The latter was purchased in October for 46 million, including costs.
The centre is anchored by a Carrefour hypermarket and produces an annual rental income of 2.2 million.
There are opportunities to extend and enhance the scheme.

038 Annual Report 2007 RenTAl income Net rental income totalled 276 million in 2007, whilst passing rents from the investment portfolio were 308 million at 31 December 2007.
Following expiries in 2007, 119 leases with rents passing of 10.0 million were relet, securing additional annual income of 1.4 million.
The leasing of vacant units secured a further 8.3 million of annual income.
In the UK, we agreed 114 rent reviews in 2007, resulting in increased annual rents of 2.3 million in respect of leases which had passing rents of 15.9 million.
Reviews remaining to be settled from 2007 could increase annual rents by a further 3.5 million.
In France, shopping centre rents are indexed annually according to a construction cost index.
The index applicable for most leases in 2007 was 7.1% and the comparable figure from 1 January 2008 is 5.05%.
The basis of indexation for retail leases is expected to change in 2008 to a new index partly based on retail prices.
occupAncY The occupancy rate in the investment portfolio at 31 December 2007 was 98.2%, compared with 96.6% at the end of 2006.
The increase principally reflected progress in letting space in the London office portfolio where the occupancy rate now stands at 99.7%.
income secuRiTY AnD quAliTY Our investment portfolio generates a secure income stream with good growth potential.
We have a large number of occupiers, generally of good financial standing, with diverse businesses, so the risk to Hammerson of individual tenant default is low.
The weighted average unexpired lease term is 10.5 years.
At 31 December 2007, the groups five largest retail tenants by rental income represented 10.6% of total rents passing from the investment portfolio: B&Q 3.2%: Pinault Printemps Redoute 2.3%: Arcadia 2.0%: H&M 1.8%: and DSG Retail 1.3%.
In the office portfolio, the three largest tenants accounted for 15.9% of total rents passing from the investment portfolio: Allen & Overy 11.2%: Deutsche Bank 3.3%: and Barclays 1.4%.
For the UK it includes tenants break options.
For France and Germany, it is based on the earliest date of lease expiry.

Robin Dobson project Delivery Director for cabot circus, Bristol 040 Annual Report 2007 leAse eXpiRies AnD BReAks Leases with current rents passing of 50 million will expire, or are subject to tenants break clauses, during the period from 2008 to 2010, as shown in the table on page 39.
These expiries and break options are spread throughout the portfolio and there are no properties where the current rent is significantly above the market rent.
We estimate that, assuming renewals take place at current rental values, additional rents of 6 million would be secured, principally in the retail portfolio.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, lease incentives or possible changes in rental values.
RenT ReViews The investment portfolio was 6.6% reversionary overall at the end of 2007, compared with 5.2% at the end of the previous year.
The UK shopping centres and retail parks were 7.4% and 15.5% reversionary respectively at the year end.
The office portfolio in the UK was 3.1% reversionary.
In France, the retail and office portfolios were 5.6% reversionary and 4.0% over-rented respectively.
In the UK, leases with current rents passing of 144 million are subject to rent review in the period to 2010 as shown in the table below.
On review, we estimate that rents receivable in respect of these leases would increase by 14 million by 2010, if reviewed at current rental values.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of changes in rental values before the relevant review dates.

fuTuRe DeVelopmenTs Hammerson has built up a very attractive pipeline of future development opportunities.
In total the pipeline could involve investment of some 6 billion over the next decade in retail and office schemes both in the UK and France.
These projects, which are listed in the table below, include: major retail-led city centre regeneration schemes: extensions to existing retail centres: retail park schemes: and office developments.
We continued to make good progress in 2007 in advancing many of these schemes through the various feasibility, site assembly and planning stages.
