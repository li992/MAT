Luminar plc 19 Business Review Annual Report 2007 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is managed through swapping between floating rate debt and fixed rate debt.
This had previously been achieved through the purchase of two 35.0m five year swaps and two 32.5m five year swaps callable by the counter-party after three years.
These swaps matured in April 2006: however, the Group took out 60.0m of floating to fixed rate swaps to maintain the fixed to floating ratio.
These matured in July 2006 but due to the low level of debt and relative stability in UK interest rates, further hedging instruments have not been implemented.
Currency risk The Group operates wholly within the UK and substantially all transactions are denominated in sterling, therefore the Group does not suffer from a significant concentration of currency risk.
Credit risk The Group does not suffer from a significant concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups revenues are cash based, with low levels of receivables relating to property transactions.
A vendor loan note of 19.3m with The 3D Entertainment Group Limited is receivable on the earliest of a subsequent sale of the business, refinancing or 2013.
At the year end, the recoverability of the loan note is not perceived to be a high credit risk.
Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for qualifying employees.
The Group has no exposure to defined benefit pension schemes.
