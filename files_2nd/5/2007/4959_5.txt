15 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Business review continued Business and financial review continued The Group recognises unrealised gains and losses on forward contracts which meet the denition of derivatives under IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, the International Accounting Standards in respect of derivatives and financial instruments.
The unrealised gains and losses principally relate to the mark-to-market of our forward contracts for power yet to be delivered.
Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recorded in the income statements were 3 million for the year ended 31 December 2007 compared to 91 million in 2006.
The unrealised gains primarily represent the unwinding of unrealised losses originally reected in the income statement in 2005, prior to the Group implementing hedge accounting under IAS 39, as power was delivered in accordance with underlying derivative contracts.
Mark-to-market movements on a large proportion of our commodity contracts, considered to be effective hedges under IAS 39, have been recognised through the hedge reserve, a component of shareholders equity in the balance sheet.
The unrealised losses recognised through the hedge reserve in the year ended 31 December 2007 were 584 million compared to unrealised gains of 468 million in 2006.
Operating expenses reflect higher outage costs, as a result of a double outage year, increased insurance costs, significant expenditure on site security, higher transmission system charges and a payment to employees to secure a two-year pay agreement in recognition of the value of retaining a skilled workforce.
