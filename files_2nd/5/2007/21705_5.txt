We intend, therefore, to provide financing to our primary Employee Benefit Trust in order to enable it to purchase BlueBays shares in the market that can provide the basis for direct and indirect equity awards to employees over the coming years.
We also believe it is important for the Group to retain the flexibility to provide seed capital to new funds, if necessary.
