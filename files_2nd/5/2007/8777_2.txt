JJB Sports plc Business and financial review Review of operating results The operating results for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 and the comparative figures for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 are summarised below.
Included in these figures is the increase in total revenue from the Leisure Division of 38.5 per cent which reflects in part the increase in the number of operating units within this Division from 32 at 29 January 2006 to 39 at 28 January 2007.
The principal increase in revenue from our retail stores was from replica kit products which increased by 35.3 million when compared to the last accounting period.
This increase resulted partly from the FIFA World Cup in the summer of 2006 but also from new kits introduced by all the leading FA Premiership clubs at the start of the 2006 7 season and from our acquisition of the Glasgow Rangers franchise in June 2006.
The increase in like-for-like revenue of locations which have traded for over 52 weeks is 7.5 per cent.
Gross profit The total gross margin achieved by the Group including that from the Leisure Division for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 was 47.5 per cent, which is a slight increase over the 47.3 per cent achieved in the previous accounting period.
The strong competitive stance that we adopted in the second half of the previous accounting period continued into the accounting period to 28 January 2007 although this pressure has begun to ease as we have sought to further differentiate our product ranges from those of our major competitors as part of our Serious about sport strategy.
Particularly strong competition was experienced on the England replica shirts although the impact was offset by the high gross margin achieved on health club revenue.
Net operating expenses Net operating expenses increased by 28.1 million or 8.9 per cent to 346.0 million during the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007.
The increase in net operating expenses was partly a result of the higher number of Leisure Division sites in operation during the accounting period just ended, but was also the result of the following two operating expenses: A charge of 4.1 million 2006: 1.9 million in respect of a further increase in the provision made for the penalty in the action brought against the Company by the Office of Fair Trading, together with interest thereon, and A charge of 3.3 million 2006: nil in respect of the closure of the Icon stores.
Operating profit The operating profit before the two operating charges referred to above, increased by 28.1 per cent to 46.4 million from 36.2 million and after the deduction of those operating items gave an increase in operating profit of 13.6 per cent to 39.0 million from 34.3 million in the comparative period.
JJB Sports Retail stores Health clubs Serious about sport JJB Sports Retail stores Health clubs 4 JJB Sports plc Business and financial review continued Interest Net finance costs of 528,000 for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 were slightly lower than the 602,000 of costs in the previous period as a result of a lower average level of borrowings following an increase in the net cash inflow from operating activities.
This was assisted by part of the 2005 6 final dividend being paid in scrip form.
Net profit before taxation The net profit before taxation and the two operating expenses referred to on page 4 of this Business and financial review, increased by 28.8 per cent to 45.9 million from 35.6 million and net profit before taxation and after deducting those two operating expenses increased by 14.1 per cent to 38.5 million from 33.7 million.
Taxation The effective rate of taxation on the Group profit is 32.9 per cent compared to 10.4 per cent in the previous accounting period.
The low effective rate of taxation in the previous accounting period arose from the finalisation of a number of years corporation tax liabilities with the Inland Revenue which resulted in a release of corporation tax provisions and the consequential recalculation of the deferred tax liability.
The effective rate of 32.9 per cent is higher than the current corporation tax rate because the increase in provisions relating to the legal penalty and interest thereon is disallowable for tax purposes.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per ordinary share for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 are 11.07 pence compared to 13.10 pence in the previous accounting period.
This reduction is despite the increased operating profit and is largely attributable to the low effective rate of taxation in the comparative accounting period, referred to in the previous paragraph.
Operational review JJB product and brand development Revenue generated from retail store products for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 was 51.2 million or 7.3 per cent higher than in the previous accounting period: this increase included higher revenue from replica products of 35.3 million and from 10.4 million for equipment and accessories.
The increase in revenue from replica products came from England products boosted by the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a number of new kits launched by the major FA Premiership clubs which had changed either their kit manufacturer or their sponsor and also from the revenue from Glasgow Rangers products, the licence for which was acquired in June 2006.
We continue to be focused on our Serious about sport strategy, by providing a wide range of branded sports products to our customers.
This includes ranges from the premium brands of adidas and Nike, supplemented with more competitively priced products from secondary brands and sports brands such as Under Armour where JJB is the principal retailer in the UK.
This focused approach has led to agreements with adidas and Nike to create in-store areas for these brands within our superstores.
The programme to create the in-store areas was piloted towards the close of the accounting period just ended and is being rapidly implemented.
As at 3 June 2007, 83 adidas and 53 Nike in-store areas were in operation.
It is anticipated that by the end of this accounting period we shall have installed over 200 adidas areas and approximately 100 Nike areas.
The trading results from those stores that have had the benefit of the new in-store areas are encouraging both in terms of the increase in revenue and of gross margin.
The strong competitive stance that we took in the second half of the accounting period to January 2006 has eased slightly during the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 as we seek to further differentiate our product ranges from those of our major competitors as part of our Serious about sport strategy.
This differentiation policy is clearly shown by the creation of the in-store areas referred to above, the successful introduction of the Under Armour brand from the United States and the wide range of accessories, golf and cycling products which are on sale in our stores.
Our Professional Teamwear Division has fully integrated the sourcing, supply and distribution of the product ranges of the Glasgow Rangers franchise which we acquired during the summer of 2006 and is now responsible for the product ranges of Everton, Wigan Athletic, Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos and the Northern Ireland Football Association.
Approaches are being made to a number of other clubs, but new contracts will only be signed if JJB can achieve a satisfactory rate of profit on the product ranges.
JJB Sports Retail stores Health clubs Serious about sport JJB Sports Retail stores Health clubs 5 JJB Sports plc Business and financial review continued Operational review continued Our transactional website www.
com has successfully completed its first 18 months of trade.
Revenue in the 4 weeks to Christmas 2006 was 150 per cent higher than in the same period last year.
During the last 6 months, we have taken in-house the operations of both the Glasgow Rangers and Everton websites and these have been joined in-house with the JJB website in May 2007.
We will then be fully responsible for all the operational aspects of the three websites.
The acquisition in May 2006 of the whole of the share capital of the companies which operate The Golf Channel and The Golf TV Pro-Shop Channel extends our multi-channel offering.
We are now beginning to retail a wider range of golf and fitness products on the Golf TV Pro-Shop Channel which will shortly be re-branded as JJB Sports TV.
These products are also available for sale in our superstores.
The results of Golf TV from the date of acquisition have been consolidated within our Group accounts and include revenue of 3.8 million and an operating loss of 623,000.
The chain of small high street stores, which traded under the Icon fascia, was closed during the 26 weeks to 28 January 2007.
The resulting loss from the disposal of the fixtures and the provision for forward rental costs, which we believe will be incurred before the relevant leases are disposed of, have been expensed in the Consolidated income statement during the period at a total cost of 3.3 million.
JJB stores and store development During the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007, we opened 13 sites and closed 35 sites.
The openings included 7 combined health clubs superstores, 3 standalone superstores and 3 football stores acquired from Glasgow Rangers and Everton.
The closures included 21 stores which formerly traded as Icon stores and 6 superstores which closed as a result of relocations to newly opened sites.
At 28 January 2007 we operated from 416 stores which contained 4,295,000 square feet of retail selling space including the stores forming part of the combined units in the Leisure division.
This compares to a total of 438 stores comprising 4,398,000 square feet at 29 January 2006.
Our plans for store openings during the current accounting period are to open 8 combined health clubs superstores 3 of which have already been opened before 6 June 2007, and 10 standalone superstores.
We have already identified 17 sites for potential openings of combined units during the accounting period commencing February 2008. Leisure Division During the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 we opened 7 combined health clubs superstores.
The total combined units in operation at the end of the accounting period was 39 and these sites include 6 indoor soccer centres.
Membership levels at the health clubs continue to be very satisfactory with a total of 174,700 members at the 39 health clubs at 28 January 2007, compared to 136,800 at 29 January 2006 from the 32 health clubs in operation at that date.
This represents a total increase of 27.7 per cent and includes a like-for-like increase of 10.0 per cent in the number of members in the 32 health clubs that have been open throughout the accounting period.
Our success in achieving the high levels of membership in our clubs results from the strong value-for-money offering of first-class facilities at very competitive subscription rates.
Total revenue for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 in the Leisure Division including the associated retail stores increased by 38.5 per cent to 123.5 million and included an increase in revenue from the health clubs of 32.8 per cent to 55.8 million.
The operating profit of the Leisure Division, before any allocation for head office distribution centre costs, increased by 42.0 per cent to 21.4 million and after deducting the Divisions share of these costs their operating profit increased by 43.3 per cent to 15.9 million.
The profitability of the Division is adversely affected by the maturity profile of the combined units which take longer to reach maturity than stand-alone superstores, partly because of their higher pre-opening costs as a result of the treatment of rent-free periods under IFRS.
The operating loss of every newly opened combined unit in its first year of trading averages 250,000.
The continuing success of the concept of combined units underpins the Boards decision to maintain the significant opening programme, referred to in the previous section.
JJB Sports Retail stores Health clubs Serious about sport JJB Sports Retail stores Health clubs 6 JJB Sports plc Business and financial review continued Review of Balance sheet Capital expenditure Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 was 33.1 million compared to 47.4 million in the previous accounting period.
The majority of this capital expenditure was expended on the combined health club superstore sites.
A total of 7 sites were opened during the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007, compared to 11 in the previous accounting period which drove the overall reduction in capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure on intangible assets included 18.1 million incurred in the acquisition of a 10 year product licensing agreement with Glasgow Rangers Football Club.
Inventories The value of inventories at 28 January 2007 was 128.1 million, 6.5 per cent higher than at 29 January 2006 and was the result of the stock intake of England replica kit products prior to the end of the accounting period.
The launch date of this years kit was 6 February 2007, whilst in the previous year the products were received in February 2006 ahead of a launch date later in February.
Net debt Although a new bank loan of 18.0 million was used to finance the Glasgow Rangers deal, the Groups strong cash flow enabled the Group to reduce its net debt at 28 January 2007 by 15.8 million to 9.2 million from a net debt of 25.0 million at 29 January 2006.
Financial review Share buy-backs At the 2006 Annual General Meeting AGM held on 27 July 2006, the Company was granted authority by its shareholders to make market purchases of up to 5.0 per cent of its ordinary shares.
No such market purchases have yet been made because the Board has made the decision to use the Groups net cash flow to finance the continuing expansion of our combined health club superstores chain.
The authority will expire at the date of the 2007 AGM and it is not our intention to seek a renewal of the authority to make market purchases.
Dividend The Board is conscious that the maintenance of dividends is of major importance to all shareholders and has proposed to maintain the rate of the final dividend at 7.0 pence net per ordinary share.
The final dividend will be paid on 3 August 2007 to shareholders on the share register at the close of business on 18 May 2007 and the shares will trade ex-dividend from 16 May 2007.
Taking the interim dividend for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007, paid on 5 January 2007, together with the proposed final dividend, gives a dividend cover of 1.1 times calculated upon basic earnings per ordinary share.
The dividend yield, based on the share price of 248.5 pence at 26 January 2007, was 4.0 per cent.
The Board proposes to offer a scrip dividend alternative to shareholders in respect of the final dividend, giving them the opportunity of taking their final dividend in the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Details of the terms and conditions applicable to this scrip dividend alternative, and the resolutions which will require to be approved at this years AGM for its implementation, will be given in the Circular which accompanies this Annual report and Financial statements.
Share capital Details of the share capital and recent movements are described in note 27 in the Notes to the Financial statements on page 57.
The share price of the ordinary shares at the close of business on 26 January 2007 was 248.5 pence, representing an equity market capitalisation of approximately 591 million.
This represents an increase of 44.5 per cent from the price of 172.0 pence at 29 January 2006.
Following the announcement of the Preliminary results on 12 April 2007, the closing share price was 266.0 pence.
On 1 June 2007, the date on which declarable interests have been disclosed in the Directors report, the share price was 275.25 pence.
