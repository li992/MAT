Diageo Annual Report 2007 19 Business review Introduction Information presented Diageo is the worlds leading premium drinks business and operates on an international scale selling all types of beverage alcohol.
It is one of a small number of premium drinks companies that operate across beer, wine and spirits.
Diageos brands have broad consumer appeal across geographies: as a result, the business is organised under the business areas of North America, Europe, International and Asia Pacific and the business analysis is presented on this basis.
The following discussion is based on Diageos IFRS results for the year ended 30 June 2007 compared with the year ended 30 June 2006, and the year ended 30 June 2006 compared with the year ended 30 June 2005.
There are a number of accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP.
A reconciliation of net income from IFRS to US GAAP and an explanation of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP are set out in the US GAAP information in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
In the discussion of the performance of the business, net sales, which is defined as sales after deducting excise duties, are presented in addition to sales, since sales reflect significant components of excise duties which are set by external regulators and over which Diageo has no control.
Diageo incurs excise duties throughout the world.
In some countries, excise duties are based on sales and are separately identified on the face of the invoice to the external customer.
In others, it is effectively a production tax, which is incurred when the spirit is removed from bonded warehouses.
In these countries it is part of the cost of goods sold and is not separately identified on the sales invoice.
Changes in the level of excise duties can significantly affect the level of reported sales and cost of sales, without directly reflecting changes in volume, mix or profitability that are the variables which impact on the element of sales retained by the group.
The underlying performance on a constant currency basis and excluding exceptional items and the impact of acquisitions and disposals is referred to as organic performance, and further information on the calculation of organic measures as used in the discussion of the business is included in the organic movements calculation and in the notes to that calculation.
Presentation of information in relation to the business In addition to describing the significant factors impacting on the income statement compared to the prior year for both of the years ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006, additional information is also presented on the operating performance and cash flows of the group.
There are eight principal key performance indicators some of which are non-GAAP measures used by the groups management to assess the performance of the group in addition to income statement measures of performance.
These are volume, the organic movements in volume, sales, net sales and operating profit, return on average total invested capital, economic profit and free cash flow.
These key performance indicators are described below: Volume has been measured on an equivalent units basis to nine litre cases of spirits.
An equivalent unit represents one nine litre case of spirits, which is approximately 272 servings.
A serving comprises 33ml of spirits, 165ml of wine, or 330ml of ready to drink or beer.
Therefore, to convert volume of products, other than spirits, to equivalent units, the following guide has been used: beer in hectolitres divide by 0.9, wine in nine litre cases divide by five, and ready to drink in nine litre cases divide by 10, with certain pre-mixed products that are classified as ready to drink divided by five.
Organic movements in volume, sales, net sales and operating profit are measures not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements themselves non-GAAP measures.
The performance of the group is discussed using these measures.
In the discussion of the performance of the business, organic information is presented using pounds sterling amounts on a constant currency basis.
This strips out the effect of exchange rate movements and enables an understanding of the underlying performance of the market that is most closely influenced by the actions of that markets management.
The risk from exchange rate movements is managed centrally and is not a factor over which local managers have any control.
Exceptional items, acquisitions and disposals also impact on the reported performance and therefore the reported movement in any period in which they arise.
Management adjusts for the impact of such transactions in assessing the performance of the underlying business.
Diageos strategic planning and budgeting process is based on organic movements in volume, sales, net sales and operating profit, and these measures closely reflect the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by the groups management.
These measures are chosen for planning, budgeting, reporting and incentive purposes since they represent those measures which local managers are most directly able to influence and they enable consideration of the underlying business performance without the distortion caused by fluctuating exchange rates, exceptional items and acquisitions and disposals.
The groups management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the groups performance since they provide information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence and they focus on that element of the core brand portfolio which is common to both periods.
They should be viewed as complementary to, and not replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures.
Return on average total invested capital is a non-GAAP measure that is used by management to assess the return obtained from the groups asset base.
This measure is not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements, but is calculated to aid comparison of the performance of the business.
The profit used in assessing the return on total invested capital reflects the operating performance of the business after applying the underlying effective tax rate for the period stated before exceptional items and interest.
Average total invested capital is calculated using the average derived from the consolidated balance sheets at the beginning, middle and the end of the period.
Capital employed comprises net assets for the period, excluding post employment benefit liabilities net of deferred tax and net borrowings.
This average capital employed is then aggregated with the average restructuring and integration costs net of tax, and goodwill written off to reserves at 1 July 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, to obtain the average total invested capital.
Economic profit is a non-GAAP measure that is used by management to assess the groups return from its asset base compared to a standard cost of capital charge.
The measure is not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements, but is calculated to aid comparison of the performance of the business.
The profit used in assessing the return from the groups asset base and the asset base itself are the same as those used in the calculation for the return on average total invested capital see above.
The standard capital charge applied to the average total invested capital is currently 9%, being managements assessment of a constant minimum level of return that the group expects to generate from its asset base.
Economic profit is calculated as the difference between the standard capital charge on the average invested assets and the actual return achieved by the group on those assets.
20 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that comprises the net cash flow from operating activities as well as the net purchase and disposal of investments and property, plant and equipment that form part of net cash flow from investing activities.
The groups management believes the measure assists users of the financial statements in understanding the groups cash generating performance as it comprises items which arise from the running of the ongoing business.
The remaining components of net cash flow from investing activities that do not form part of free cash flow, as defined by the groups management, are in respect of the purchase and disposal of subsidiaries, associates and businesses.
The groups management regards the purchase and disposal of property, plant and equipment as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant and machinery is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and disposals of businesses are discretionary.
However, free cash flow does not necessarily reflect all amounts which the group either has a constructive or legal obligation to incur.
Where appropriate, separate discussion is given for the impacts of acquisitions and disposals of businesses, equity dividends paid and the purchase of own shares each of which arises from decisions that are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
The free cash flow measure is also used by management for their own planning, budgeting, reporting and incentive purposes since it provides information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence.
Operating results 2007 compared with 2006 Year ended 30 June 2007 2006 Summary consolidated income statement million million Sales 9,917 9,704 Excise duties 2,436 2,444 Net sales 7,481 7,260 Operating costs 5,322 5,216 Operating profit 2,159 2,044 Disposal of investments and businesses 1 157 Net finance charges 212 186 Associates profits 149 131 Profit before taxation 2,095 2,146 Taxation 678 181 Profit from continuing operations 1,417 1,965 Discontinued operations 139 Profit for the year 1,556 1,965 Attributable to: Equity shareholders 1,489 1,908 Minority interests 67 57 1,556 1,965 Sales and net sales On a reported basis, sales increased by 213 million from 9,704 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 to 9,917 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
On a reported basis, net sales increased by 221 million from 7,260 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 to 7,481 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
Exchange rate movements decreased reported sales by 358 million and reported net sales by 280 million, principally arising from the weakening of the US dollar.
Acquisitions and disposals resulted in a net decrease in reported sales and reported net sales of 24 million and 10 million, respectively for the year.
Operating costs On a reported basis operating costs increased by 106 million in the year ended 30 June 2007 due to an increase in marketing costs of 35 million, from 1,127 million to 1,162 million, an increase in cost of sales of 82 million, from 2,921 million to 3,003 million, and a decrease in other operating expenses of 11 million, from 1,168 million to 1,157 million.
Offset within other operating expenses in the year ended 30 June 2007 are profits on disposal of property, plant and equipment, including an exceptional gain of 40 million on the disposal of land at Park Royal in the United Kingdom.
There were no exceptional items in operating costs in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Excluding exceptional items, operating costs increased by 146 million from 5,216 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 to 5,362 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
Post employment plans Post employment costs for the year ended 30 June 2007 of 56 million 2006 87 million included amounts charged to operating profit of 104 million 2006 106 million partly offset by finance income of 48 million 2006 19 million.
At 30 June 2007, Diageos deficit before taxation for all post employment plans was 419 million 2006 801 million.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 21 Operating profit Reported operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2007 increased by 115 million to 2,159 million from 2,044 million in the prior year.
Exceptional operating gains of 40 million were generated in the year ended 30 June 2007.
There were no comparable exceptional operating gains or costs in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Excluding the exceptional gain relating to Park Royal, operating profit for the year increased by 75 million from 2,044 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 to 2,119 million in the current year.
Exchange rate movements reduced operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2007 by 91 million.
Disposal of investments and businesses In the year ended 30 June 2007 a loss before taxation of 1 million arose from the disposal of businesses.
In the year ended 30 June 2006 gains before taxation on the disposal of businesses were 157 million, representing a gain of 151 million on the sale of the groups remaining 25 million shares of common stock of General Mills and a gain on the sale of other businesses of 6 million.
Net finance charges Net finance charges increased by 26 million from 186 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 to 212 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
The net interest charge increased by 58 million from 193 million in the prior year to 251 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
This increase principally resulted from the increase in net borrowings in the year and the increase in US dollar and euro interest rates.
Exchange rate movements reduced net interest by 11 million.
Other net finance income of 39 million 2006 7 million included income of 48 million 2006 19 million in respect of the groups post employment plans.
This movement principally reflects the increase in the value of the assets held by the post employment plans between 1 July 2005 and 30 June 2006.
Other finance income for the year ended 30 June 2007 of 7 million 2006 charge of 2 million includes income of 6 million 2006 charge of 2 million in respect of exchange rate translation differences on intercompany funding arrangements that do not meet the accounting criteria for recognition in equity.
Other finance charges of 16 million 2006 15 million in respect of the unwinding of the discount on discounted provisions were recognised during the year.
Other finance income in the year ended 30 June 2006 also included 5 million dividend income in respect of the groups interest in General Mills.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates after interest and tax was 149 million for the year ended 30 June 2007 compared to 131 million in the prior year.
Diageos 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 136 million to share of profits of associates after interest and tax 2006 122 million.
Profit before taxation Profit before taxation decreased by 51 million from 2,146 million to 2,095 million in the year ended 30 June 2007, primarily as a result of increased operating profit in the year which was more than offset by the 151 million gain on disposal of General Mills shares in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Taxation The reported effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2007 is 32.4% compared with 8.4% for the year ended 30 June 2006.
Factors that increased the reported effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2007 were a provision for the settlement of tax liabilities relating to the Guinness GrandMet merger, lower carrying value of deferred tax assets primarily following a reduction in tax rates and the tax impact of an intragroup reorganisation of certain brand businesses.
The effective tax rate in the prior year was reduced following the agreement of certain brand values with tax fiscal authorities that resulted in recognising an increase in the groups deferred tax assets of 313 million.
Discontinued operations In the year ended 30 June 2007 profit after tax in respect of the disposal of businesses was 139 million.
This profit represents a tax credit of 82 million in respect of the recognition of capital losses that arose on the disposal of Pillsbury and Burger King and a tax credit of 57 million following resolution with the tax authorities of various audit issues including prior year disposals.
There was no profit or loss from discontinued operations in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Exchange rates For the year ending 30 June 2008 the impact of exchange rate movements based on current exchange rates excluding the exchange impact of retranslating trading and short term loan intercompany balances under IAS 21 is projected to have an adverse impact of 65 million on operating profit and a positive impact of approximately 5 million on interest.
Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 20.15 pence per share, an increase of 5.2% on last years final dividend.
The full dividend will therefore be 32.7 pence per share, an increase of 5.1% from the year ended 30 June 2006.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 22 October 2007 to shareholders on the register on 14 September 2007.
Payment to US ADR holders will be made on 26 October 2007.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend and the plan notice date is 1 October 2007.
22 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Exceptional items before taxation Exceptional items are those items that in managements judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.

Adjusting the reported tax rate for the provision for the settlement of tax liabilities relating to the GrandMet Guinness merger of 64 million, and a lower carrying value of deferred tax assets, primarily following a reduction in tax rates, of 74 million, and the tax impact of an intragroup reorganisation of certain brand businesses of 24 million, the group has an underlying effective tax rate of 25.1% on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2007.
Adjusting the reported tax rate for tax exceptional items, the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2006 was 24.9% on profit before exceptional items.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 23 Operating results 2007 compared with 2006 analysis by brand and business area In order to assist the reader of the financial statements, the following comparison of 2007 with 2006 includes tables which present the exceptional items, exchange, acquisitions and disposals and organic components of the year on year movement for each of volume, sales, net sales and operating profit.
Organic movements in the tables below are calculated as follows: a The organic movement percentage is the amount in the column headed Organic movement in the tables below expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the column headed 2006 Reported, the column headed Exchange and the amounts in respect of transfers see note 2 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations and disposals see note 4 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations included in the column headed Transfers, acquisitions and disposals.
The inclusion of the column headed Exchange in the organic movement calculation reflects the adjustment to exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the current periods exchange rates.
Organic movement percentages are calculated as the organic movement amount in million, expressed as the percentage of the prior period results at current year exchange rates and after adjusting for transfers, disposals and exceptional items.
The basis of calculation means that the results used to measure organic movement for a given period will be adjusted when used to measure organic movement in the subsequent period.
b Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the current period, the group, in organic movement calculations, adjusts the results for the comparable prior period to exclude the amount the group earned in that period that it could not have earned in the current period i. e. the period between the date in the prior period, equivalent to the date of the disposal in the current period, and the end of the prior period.
As a result, the organic movement numbers reflect only comparable performance.
Similarly, if a business was disposed of part way through the equivalent prior period then its contribution would be completely excluded from that prior periods performance in the organic movement calculation, since the group recognised no contribution from that business in the current period.
In the calculation of operating profit the overheads included in disposals were only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.
For acquisitions, a similar adjustment is made in the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions subsequent to the end of the equivalent prior period, the post acquisition results in the current period are excluded from the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the prior period, post acquisition results are included in full in the prior period but are only included from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period.
c Organic movement in operating margin is the difference between the 2007 operating margin operating profit adjusted for exceptional items expressed as a percentage of sales and an operating margin where the amounts for each of sales and operating profit are the aggregate of those captions in the columns headed 2006 Reported, the column headed Exchange and the amounts in respect of transfers see note 2 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations and disposals see note 4 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations included in the column headed Transfers, acquisitions and disposals.
Organic movement in operating margin is calculated as the movement amount in margin percentage, expressed in basis points between the operating margin for the prior period results at current year exchange rates and after adjusting for transfers, disposals and exceptional items and the operating margin for the current period results adjusted for current period exceptional items.
The organic movement calculations for volume, sales, net sales and operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2007 were as follows: Acquisitions 2006 and Organic 2007 Reported disposals movement Reported Organic units units units units movement million million million million % Volume North America 48.8 1.4 50.2 3 Europe 41.4 0.1 0.6 40.9 2 International 32.1 0.2 5.0 37.3 16 Asia Pacific 11.5 1.4 12.9 12 Total 133.8 0.3 7.2 141.3 5 24 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Transfers, acquisitions 2006 and Organic 2007 Organic Reported Exchange disposals movement Reported movement million million million million million % Sales North America 2,968 225 2 170 2,915 6 Europe 3,834 32 26 11 3,765 International 1,784 73 320 2,031 19 Asia Pacific 1,042 28 117 1,131 12 Corporate 76 1 75 1 Total 9,704 358 24 595 9,917 6 Net sales North America 2,510 190 1 151 2,472 7 Europe 2,455 23 11 6 2,427 International 1,456 46 257 1,667 18 Asia Pacific 763 21 98 840 13 Corporate 76 1 75 1 Total net sales 7,260 280 10 511 7,481 7 Excise duties 2,444 2,436 Sales 9,704 9,917 Transfers, acquisitions 2006 Exceptional and Organic 2007 Organic Reported items Exchange disposals movement Reported movement million million million million million million % Operating profit North America 829 69 3 93 850 12 Europe 737 10 3 1 723 International 445 20 5 79 499 19 Asia Pacific 199 6 9 12 196 7 Corporate 166 40 14 17 14 109 9 Total 2,044 40 91 3 169 2,159 9 Notes 1 Differences between the reported volume movements and organic volume movements are due to acquisitions and disposals.
2 Transfers represent the movement between operating units of certain activities, the most significant of which were the reallocation of certain supply and other overheads from corporate to the regions and the reallocation of certain prior year transaction exchange differences into Corporate.
Transfers reduced restated prior year operating profit for North America, International and Asia Pacific profits by 3 million, 5 million and 9 million, respectively and reduced costs in Corporate by 17 million.
3 The exchange adjustments for sales, net sales and operating profit are principally in respect of the US dollar.
4 The only acquisition in the year ended 30 June 2007 that affected sales, net sales and operating profit was the acquisition of the Smirnov brand in Russia which was reported in Europe.
The other acquisition impacting the calculation of organic growth in the period was the acquisition of The Old Bushmills Distillery Company Limited in August 2005.
Disposals affecting the period were the disposal of United Beverages Limited and Three Barrels both Europe and contributed volume, sales, net sales and operating profit of 213k equivalent units, 35 million, 17 million and 2 million, respectively, in the year ended 30 June 2006.
5 Exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2007 represents a gain on the disposal of land at the Park Royal site.
There were no operating exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2006.

Smirnoff vodka had another strong year with volume up 5% and net sales up 10% as price increases have been implemented.
Smirnoff continued to benefit from the Clearly Smirnoff campaign and gained 0.2 percentage points of value share.
Johnnie Walker volume was up 5% and stronger growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label together with price increases on Johnnie Walker Black Label led to net sales growth of 7%.
Share was up 2.0 percentage points on a value basis with gains on both Johnnie Walker Red Label and Johnnie Walker Black Label.
New television advertising campaigns and successful on trade marketing programmes increased brand awareness and recruited new consumers to Captain Morgan resulting in share gains of 1.5 percentage points on a value basis.
Volume was up 6% and price increases on Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum were implemented, driving net sales growth of 9%.
Baileys had an outstanding year with volume up 20% and net sales up 22%.
This was driven by the national launch of Baileys flavours and by continued growth of the core brand.
Jos Cuervo delivered 1% volume growth and 3% net sales growth.
Investment has been focused around the super premium labels as this is the segment that is driving category growth.
As a result these grew by 20%, albeit off a small base.
Tanqueray grew volume 6% and net sales 9%, gaining 0.9 percentage points of value share in a declining category.
This was driven by increased media investment behind the Are You Ready to Tanqueray campaign and the introduction of Tanqueray Rangpur which was launched nationally in the second half.
Local priority brand volume increased 3% and net sales increased 8%.
Growth of Crown Royal and US wines were partially offset by a small decline in Seagrams VO.
US wines grew net sales 8% driven by strong growth of the Chalone wines.
Crown Royal volume increased 5% as the NASCAR team sponsorship was up-weighted for the 2006 season and the brand returned to being advertised on television in December following two years of limited presence.
Price increases were implemented on approximately 40% of volume and this, combined with the positive performance of the luxury Crown Royal Extra Rare, drove net sales growth of 9%.
Volume in the category brands declined 2%.
Growth of beer and reserve brands led to mix improvement and net sales grew 5%.
Guinness volume grew 4%, with net sales up 7% as a result of a national price increase on the brand.
Increased marketing activity was focused on Guinness Draught in Bottles leading to distribution gains and increased levels of visibility in retail.
Additionally, marketing spend on TV media was up.
Ready to drink volume declined 6% whilst net sales were down 1% as a result of price increases and mix improvement.
While Smirnoff ready to drink volume declined, innovation delivered mix improvements with the introduction of new Smirnoff Ice flavours and Smirnoff Raw Tea.
The continued growth of Parrot Bay Tropical Malt Beverages and Jos Cuervo Golden Margaritas also contributed to this.

Performance in the global priority brands significantly improved during the second half with volume up 3% and net sales up 4%.
Smirnoff vodka volume increased 2% while net sales increased 4% following price increases in Ireland and benefiting from the premiumisation strategy in Continental Europe which focused on building the brand credentials of Smirnoff Red and Smirnoff Black.
With significant improvement in Great Britain, volume in the second half grew 6% and net sales grew 8%.
Johnnie Walker volume was up 4% and net sales increased 12%.
Volume growth was driven largely from Johnnie Walker Black Label in Greece and Poland and Johnnie Walker Red Label in Russia, Poland, Bulgaria and the Balkans.
Net sales growth was the result of price increases, up-weighted investment and a premiumisation strategy in Russia, Greece and Iberia.
Volume and net sales further improved in the second half, with growth of 11% and 24% respectively.
While Baileys volume declined 2%, net sales increased 2%.
This was driven by action taken in Great Britain in the first half to increase net sales per case and higher net sales per case in Russia as a result of the move to an in market company.
Strong volume performance in Continental Europe and Russia and the launch of Baileys flavours partially offset the decline in Great Britain.
Both volume and net sales growth across Europe improved during the second half as volume increased 13% and net sales increased 17%.
J&B volume declined 4% and net sales declined 2%, primarily driven by the continued decline of the scotch category in Spain.
This was partially offset by growth in France and Eastern Europe.
Guinness volume declined 6% driven by the continued trend from on to off trade.
Price increases were taken during the year and net sales declined 4%.
Total ready to drink volume and net sales declined 12%, primarily driven by Smirnoff Ice in Great Britain, Germany and France.
Local priority brand performance was impacted by the decline of Gordons and Bells in Great Britain, as a result of the Christmas pricing strategy to increase net sales value to the trade and by a decline in Cacique in Spain.
This led to volume down 6% and net sales down 2%.
Category brand volume increased 1% and net sales increased 2%, driven by gains in Pimms and Blossom Hill.
28 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Great Britain In the full year volume and net sales both declined 5%.
This reflects decline in the first half partially offset by growth in the second half.
As a result of a more focused strategy on core spirits during the second half, spirits accounted for a greater proportion of total net sales and the proportion of ready to drink and beer fell.
This resulted in second half volume growth of 6% ahead of net sales growth of 1%.
Smirnoff vodka volume declined 1% but net sales increased 1% as a result of price increases.
In the second half, a combination of focus on sales execution and brand building initiatives resulted in volume up 10% and net sales up 11%.
Baileys volume declined 25% and net sales declined 21% as a result of the Christmas pricing strategy to increase net sales per case to the off trade.
In the second half net sales were up 12% as a result of increased promotions.
Guinness volume declined 5% while a price increase in February 2007 moderated the net sales decline to 3%.
This was broadly in line with the performance of the beer market in the United Kingdom.
However, positive consumer reaction to a new advertising campaign meant that Guinness gained share in the on trade and is now the number four beer in Great Britain.
Local priority brand volume declined 9% and net sales declined 8%, driven by Gordons and Bells.
Performance significantly improved during the second half with a 10% volume and 6% net sales increase.
Category brand volume increased 4% while net sales were flat as growth in Pimms and Blossom Hill offset declines in Piat dOr.
Smirnoff ready to drink net sales declined 14% in line with the segment.
Ireland The key driver in Ireland continues to be the trend from the on to the off trade.
For the full year, volume was down 2% and net sales were down 1%.
While net sales of beer declined 2%, spirits and wines outperformed in both the on and off trade with 4% and 7% net sales growth respectively.
Smirnoff vodka grew net sales 7% and Baileys net sales increased 2%.
In wine, Blossom Hill increased net sales by 37%, albeit off a small base.
Guinness volume declined 9% and net sales declined 7%.
The second half performance improved following increased marketing and net sales declined by 5%.
Net sales of the lager brands grew 3% driven by Budweiser with the support of the successful launch of Bud Light.
Iberia Volume declined 7% and net sales declined 2%.
This was primarily driven by Spain, where performance was impacted by a declining scotch category combined with changes in consumer behaviour following new legislation that increased drink driving penalties.
Price increases across both Spain and Portugal partially offset the impact of the volume decline.
J&B volume declined 8% and net sales declined 3%.
In the second half, volume and share performance improved as a result of investment in the off trade and price increases were implemented.
This combined with growth in J&B Reserve led to price mix improvement.
Price increases contributed to Johnnie Walker net sales growth of 4% while stock level reduction led to a volume decline of 2%.
The brand outperformed the scotch category in Spain with Johnnie Walker Red Label the only whisky brand growing within the standard segment.
Johnnie Walker Black Label became the number one deluxe whisky in Spain with share growth of 4.2 percentage points.
Local priority brand volume declined 10%, primarily driven by lower volume in Cacique down 8%.
Growth in premium variants and Cacique 500 and Cacique Origen, which both gained share, combined with price increases, did improve mix and net sales were down 3%.
Category brand volume was down 9% primarily because of the decline in low priced scotch brands.
Mix improvement was delivered as Diageos malt whisky brands grew strongly, albeit off a small base and net sales declined 3%.
Rest of Europe In Continental Europe focus on premiumisation with the relaunch of Smirnoff Black, reallocation of spending toward key brands and innovation with Baileys flavours drove volume up 4% and net sales up 5%.
In France volume increased 6% and net sales increased 2%.
In a competitive market, promotional activity for priority brands such as Baileys, Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker increased.
In Greece total industry spirit sales declined 2%, driven by a decline in the off trade of 5%.
In addition, the port strike during the first half and a decline in Ursus caused volume to decline 4%.
Net sales were flat however as a result of a premiumisation strategy and price increases across all categories.
Diageo continues to be the leader in whisky, with Johnnie Walker Red Label leading both the on and off trade.
Net sales performance in Johnnie Walker Black Label, Tanqueray and Cardhu were also strong, with increases of 25%, 39% and 14% respectively.
In Eastern Europe total volume increased 13% driven by Johnnie Walker Red Label, Johnnie Walker Black Label, J&B and Baileys.
Net sales grew 16% as a result of premiumisation, in particular the strong growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label and new routes to market.
In Russia volume grew 25% and net sales grew 63%.
The move from a distributor to a newly created in-market company in July 2006 drove an increase in net sales per case.
Following this move Diageos regional presence increased to cover 74 cities in Russia and marketing spend increased behind Johnnie Walker Red Label, Baileys and Captain Morgan.
The newly acquired Smirnov brand has shown a promising start.

In South Africa net sales were up 23% on volume growth of 15%.

Johnnie Walker which is Diageos largest brand in Asia Pacific, representing nearly a third of net sales, drove approximately 50% of the net sales growth in the region.
Smirnoff volume grew 23% responding well to increased marketing investment.
Price increases were also implemented in a number of markets and as a result net sales grew 31%.
Growth was driven by India and Australia as Smirnoff Experience events, promotions and in the case of Australia, the Clearly Smirnoff media campaign, increased brand awareness.
Johnnie Walker growth accelerated over last year as a result of brand building marketing, aligned to Johnnie Walkers Grand Prix team sponsorship, mentoring and PR events.
Johnnie Walker Red Label grew net sales over 50% in Thailand and in China net sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label continued to grow strongly.
Guinness performance was the result of a strategy to drive value.
Net sales increased 5% as price increases and the repatriation of Guinness from a third party distributor in Korea offset a volume decline of 5%.
Local priority brands grew volume 4% and net sales 6% primarily as a result of growth in Windsor in Korea.
Significant mix improvement was delivered in category brands with volume up 4% and net sales up 14%.
This was primarily driven by the growth of Benmore in Thailand offsetting declines in the lower priced Spey Royal and Golden Knight.
Ready to drink volume increased 3% and net sales increased 5%, driven by Smirnoff Ice in Japan which was relaunched in fiscal 2006.
In Australia, a decline in Bundaberg ready to drink was offset by new brand launches.
Marketing spend in Asia Pacific increased 22%.
This growth was driven by investments made in the high growth potential markets such as India and China, although the rate of growth in marketing spend in China has now moderated following the significant upweight in fiscal 2005 and 2006.
The growth in marketing was targeted behind priority brands such as Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff vodka and behind the launch of new brands in India.
In Australia volume increased 3% and net sales grew 4%.
In ready to drink net sales grew 1% as a net sales decline in Bundaberg of 4% was offset by growth in both Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff ready to drink variants, with net sales up 12% and 5% respectively.
Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff net sales growth was driven by new line extensions and formats.
In spirits Diageo outperformed the spirits category.
Smirnoff vodka grew volume 15% as a result of media investment behind the Clearly Smirnoff campaign and price increases led to net sales growth of 22%.
Johnnie Walkers cricket sponsorship and a new advertising campaign led to volume up 8%.
Net sales were up 11% as a price increase was implemented on Johnnie Walker Red Label.
In Korea volume increased 8% and net sales were up 13%.
Windsor continued to perform strongly, driving overall performance as net sales grew 15%.
Diageo has outperformed the growing whisky category and therefore extended its leadership position with Windsor now the number one scotch brand in Korea.
Positive brand mix was delivered as the growth of Windsor more than offset the decline of Dimple and this, combined with price increases and the repatriation of Guinness from a third party distributor, drove net sales growth ahead of volume growth.
During the year Diageo Korea and several employees were subject to investigations regarding various regulatory and control matters, some of which are continuing.
Since the year end, Diageo Koreas import licence has been cancelled by the National Tax Service after one of these investigations found a number of Diageo salesmen were involved in sales to unlicensed wholesalers.
Therefore, from the end of July 2007 Diageo has operated through a third party distributor.
In Japan volume declined 1%, while net sales grew 8%.
Volume performance continued to be impacted by the decline in the scotch category while the growth of Smirnoff Ice following the relaunch drove mix improvement.
Although share has been lost in the standard and deluxe segments, Diageo has focused investment on the super deluxe brands and delivered growth significantly ahead of the segment.
In Thailand while the whisky category declined, Diageo continued to outperform.
Volume was up 4% and net sales were significantly ahead, up 21%, driven by Diageos strategy to drive mix improvement and a reduction in excise duties on certain brands.
Diageo leads across premium, deluxe and super deluxe scotch segments and has increased its value share of the overall category by 5.4 percentage points.
Johnnie Walker Black Label gained further share in the deluxe segment whilst Johnnie Walker Red Label drove the growth in the premium whisky segment, with net sales up 54%.
In the standard segment, mix improvement has been achieved through focus on Benmore in preference to the lower priced Spey Royal.
Volume of Spey Royal therefore declined as did volume of Golden Knight in the economy segment.
32 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued In China volume grew 41% and net sales grew 61% as Johnnie Walker Black Label continued to take share.
In January 2007 Diageo made its first investment in the Chinese white spirits category through a minority stake in Sichuan Chengdu Quanxing Group Co Ltd.
In Taiwan while the overall scotch category is in decline, the deluxe segments are in growth.
Diageos focus on the Johnnie Walker deluxe labels has resulted in volume up 1% and net sales up 4%.
In India Johnnie Walker is the leading scotch and continued to lead the growth of the category with volume up 30%, led by Johnnie Walker Black Label, up 41%.
In the year Diageo took steps to widen its participation both within and across categories, launching a number of new brands.
Haig was introduced to compete in the premium whisky segment and the joint venture with Radico Khaitan launched its first new whisky brand, Masterstroke, into the Indian made foreign liquor segment.
In the vodka category Smirnoff continued to gain share with volume up 37%, whilst Shark Tooth vodka was introduced into the prestige vodka segment and performed well on launch.
The introduction of these new brands resulted in a dilution of mix, however net sales still grew 36% on volume growth of 44%.
Corporate revenue and costs Net sales were 75 million in the year ended 30 June 2007, down by 1 million from 76 million in the prior year.
Net operating costs were 109 million, down from 166 million in the prior year.
40 million of this decrease relates to the exceptional gain on the sale of the Park Royal land in the United Kingdom.

Acquisitions and disposals contributed a net increase to reported sales and net sales of 46 million and 27 million respectively in the year and foreign exchange rate movements also beneficially impacted reported sales by 186 million and reported net sales by 140 million, principally arising from strengthening of the US dollar.
Operating costs On a reported basis operating costs increased by 270 million, principally due to an increase in cost of goods sold of 289 million, an increase in marketing costs of 11% from 1,013 million to 1,127 million and a decrease in other operating costs of 133 million from 1,301 million to 1,168 million.
Included in operating costs in the year ended 30 June 2005 were exceptional items totalling 201 million.
This comprised a charge of 149 million in respect of contributions to be made to the Thalidomide Trust, 29 million of accelerated depreciation in relation to the closure of Park Royal brewery and 30 million of Seagram integration costs, less 7 million in respect of the disposal of property, plant and equipment.
There were no equivalent exceptional items in operating costs in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Excluding exceptional items, operating costs increased by 471 million from 4,745 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 to 5,216 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.

Excluding exceptional items, operating profit for the year increased by 112 million to 2,044 million from 1,932 million in the prior year.
Exchange rate movements reduced, operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2006 by 25 million.
Disposal of investments and businesses Gains before taxation from the disposal of businesses were 157 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 compared with a gain of 214 million in the year ended 30 June 2005.
The gain in the year to 30 June 2006 represents a gain of 151 million on sale of the groups remaining 25 million shares of common stock of General Mills and a gain on sale of other businesses of 6 million.
In the year ended 30 June 2005, the gains from disposal of businesses included a gain of 221 million on the disposal of 54 million shares of common stock of General Mills and a net charge of 7 million in respect of the disposal of other businesses.
Net finance charges Net finance charges increased by 45 million from 141 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 to 186 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
The net interest charge increased by 43 million from 150 million in the prior year to 193 million in the year ended 30 June 2006: 23 million of this increase resulted from higher debt and higher interest rates year on year, 13 million resulted from the loss of interest income on the Burger King subordinated debt repaid in July 2005 and 10 million from the termination of certain financing arrangements.
In addition, the interest charge increased by 6 million as a result of exchange rate movements.
Partly offsetting these increases, net interest also includes an interest credit of 9 million related to derivative instruments arising on the application of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Other net finance income of 7 million 2005 income of 9 million included income in respect of the groups post employment plans of 19 million 2005 income of 9 million which year on year improvement principally results from lower interest costs in the pension plans from the unwinding of discounted liabilities.
In addition, other net finance charges include a charge of 15 million 2005 7 million in respect of the unwinding of discounted liabilities, a 2 million charge 2005 charge of 8 million in respect of foreign exchange translation differences on intercompany funding arrangements that do not meet the accounting criteria for recognition in equity, and investment income of 5 million 2005 17 million in respect of dividends on General Mills shares.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates after interest and tax was 131 million for the year compared to 121 million last year.
Diageos 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 122 million to share of profits of associates after interest and tax 2005 113 million.
Profit before taxation After exceptional items, profit before taxation increased by 221 million from 1,925 million to 2,146 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Taxation The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended 30 June 2006 is 8.4% compared with 31.1% for the year ended 30 June 2005.
The higher effective tax rate in the year ended 30 June 2005 mainly resulted from the reduction in the carrying value of deferred tax assets following a change in tax rate in the relevant territory.
The effective tax rate in the current year has been reduced following the agreement of certain brand values with fiscal authorities that resulted in recognising an increase in the groups deferred tax assets of 313 million.
The profit arising on the sale of General Mills shares in the year and the comparative year is not subject to tax.
Discontinued operations Profit after tax from the disposal of businesses in the prior year of 73 million is in respect of the release of provisions established on the disposal of Burger King and Pillsbury.
Exchange rates Diageo does not hedge the translation of its foreign currency results into sterling.
Transactional exchange rate risk is hedged for those currencies in which there is an active market.
The group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in equity to the extent the hedge is effective and subsequently recognised in the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.

The global priority brands again led the growth with volume up 7% and net sales up 8%.
The spirits brands, excluding ready to drink, delivered 8% growth in net sales reflecting strong performances from Smirnoff, Captain Morgan and Jos Cuervo.
Smirnoff benefited from targeted profile raising activity.
In the off trade, volume was driven by concentrated activity on high visibility feature and display initiatives across Smirnoff vodka, as well as innovation in flavours.
These activities and the focus on proven growth drivers, such as quality account management, delivered strong growth for Smirnoff vodka with volume up 9% and net sales up 11%.
Johnnie Walker continued to outperform the scotch category with volume up 1% and net sales up 5%.
Both Johnnie Walker Red Label and Johnnie Walker Black Label grew share.
Higher marketing and public relations investment behind the successful Mentor programme and increased relationship marketing underpinned these strong results.
Captain Morgan had a good year.
Excluding ready to drink, volume was up 9% and net sales were up 14%, benefiting from increased media spending, particularly in television to drive awareness and trial, strong display executions and the launch of Tattoo.
Baileys continued its turnaround from last year with volume and net sales both up 7%.
The Jos Cuervo Tradicional and Reserva variants delivered double-digit growth benefiting from the trend towards premium tequila.
Product innovation also made a strong contribution to growth as the super premium range was further extended with the introduction of Black Medallion in February.
A range of flavours was also introduced during the year.
Excluding ready to drink, Jos Cuervo volume increased 9% and net sales rose 11%.
A strong second half performance from Crown Royal resulted in full year volume up 6% and net sales up 8% as the investment behind NASCAR was increased.
The second half also saw the launch of an ultra premium offering, Crown Royal Extra Rare.
The Tony Sinclair Ready to Tanqueray campaign has reinvigorated the Tanqueray brand with volume up 5%.
Price increases, taken over the year in certain markets, have led to an increase in net sales of 7%.
In line with the trend towards premium beers, Guinness continued to show strong performance with volume up 7%.
A price increase across all variants in October 2005 meant that net sales grew 9%.
In wine, Beaulieu Vineyard volume was flat, but net sales increased 1%.
Sterling Wines volume was up 3% with net sales up 10% as price increases were taken across a variety of labels.
The Chalone wine brands are delivering ahead of expectations, as a result of a strong contribution from innovation with the introduction of new varietals.
Total ready to drink volume was up 2% led by the continued growth of Jos Cuervos pre-mixed margarita offerings and the launch of the Captain Morgans Parrot Bay ready to drink product.
The introduction of new Smirnoff Twisted V flavours, strong growth of Smirnoff Ice in Canada and the regional launch of Smirnoff Raw Tea partially offset declines in the Smirnoff Ice brand in the US.
In category brands, volume decreased by 1% but net sales were up 7%.
This reflected the decision to shift operational focus toward the more profitable reserve brands such as Croc and Don Julio and away from the high volume standard brands such as Popov and Gordons vodka.
Marketing spend for the year was up 6% and excluding ready to drink, up 9%.
This reflects an accelerated investment in spirits, offset by a reduction in spend on ready to drink.
38 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Europe Summary: Net sales were unchanged year on year as growth in core spirits offset tough market conditions in beer and ready to drink Spirits demonstrated healthy volume growth at 3% Innovation is increasing brand visibility with new and existing customers Marketing spend was reduced by 4% and prioritised against specific opportunities such as Johnnie Walker throughout Europe and J&B in France Reported Organic 2006 2005 movement movement Key measures: million million %% Volume 2 1 Net sales 2,455 2,499 2 Marketing 389 403 4 4 Operating profit 737 676 9 6 Reported performance Net sales were 2,455 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 down by 44 million from the prior year.

The shift from the on to the off trade in Ireland again negatively impacted overall beer performance.
Wine volume grew 7% driven by Blossom Hills robust growth in Great Britain and Ireland.
Smirnoff vodka, excluding ready to drink, continued to grow strongly, delivering volume growth of 8% and growth of net sales of 7%.
A pan-European advertising campaign, focusing on the quality credentials of Smirnoff, continued to build the distinctiveness of the brand, although marketing spend was reduced by 9%.
Johnnie Walker Red Label volume grew 1% while net sales were flat.
However, very strong volume growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label, up 14% and Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe, up 21%, delivered overall growth in Johnnie Walker, with volume up 3%, and had a positive mix impact as net sales increased 6%.
Growth was driven mainly by increased demand in Southern Europe, Russia and Eastern Europe and the favourable impact of advertising, especially the grand prix team sponsorship.
Marketing spend was up 19% as a result of increased activities in sports sponsorship.
Europe accounts for over half of Baileys volume worldwide and brand volume was up a further 1% year on year, driven by growth in France, Italy, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe.
Excluding ready to drink, both volume and net sales grew by 1%.
The majority of J&Bs volume in Europe is sold in Spain, where the decline of the scotch category led to a 3% decrease in overall volume of J&B.
However, elsewhere in Europe, especially in France and Eastern Europe, J&B performed well.
Guinness volume declined 3% although pricing offset weak volumes and net sales were flat year on year.
Guinness sales progressed well in Russia during the year following Diageos agreement in July 2005 with Heineken NV for the production and distribution of Guinness in Russia.
Despite a year on year decline in ready to drink, Diageo has managed costs and increased the margin on ready to drink, even though contribution in absolute terms was down.
Total local priority brand performance was negatively impacted by the decline of Diageos beer volume in Ireland.
Marketing spend was reduced by 4% driven by a 23% reduction in spending on ready to drink.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 39 Great Britain Volume was flat and net sales were down 1% as the decline in ready to drink continued to cause a negative mix impact.
The total spirits market in Great Britain was broadly flat as growth in the off trade offset declines in the on trade.
Diageo maintained leadership across all key categories and excluding ready to drink, grew spirits volume by 2%.
Growth in spirits was attributable to Smirnoff vodka in particular, which continued to gain share as volume grew 6% and net sales grew 8%.
Smirnoff performance was driven by marketing programmes focused on quality and on trade activity around signature cocktails.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume declined 19%, a rate similar to the prior year.
Total Baileys volume declined 2% and net sales declined by 4%.
Excluding Baileys Glide, Baileys volume declined 1% whilst net sales grew 1%.
The majority of Baileys is sold in the off trade where there has been increased competition from value brands, however while volume declined, the brand maintained its value share.
Baileys grew in the on trade driven by distribution gains and price increases.
Total Guinness volume declined 1% whilst net sales grew 1% driven by a price increase on Guinness Draught.
While volume in the on trade beer market in Great Britain declined 3% as consumers shifted to consumption at home, Guinness Draught gained share in the on trade, growing volume 1% and net sales by 4%.
Media activities were focused on quality attributes and Dublin brewed Guinness, as well as the first year of a four-year sponsorship of the rugby premiership.
This helped to generate growth in the second half and increase share.
Local priority brand volume declined 2% and net sales fell 6%, mainly due to the decline in Archers ready to drink.
Gordons volume grew 1% and net sales were up 4%.
Bells Extra Special volume grew 2% although net sales were down.
Category brand volume grew 4% and net sales increased 2% driven by Blossom Hill, which continued to grow strongly with volume up 13%, and the launch in May 2006 of a new product, Quinns, an alcoholic fruit ferment blended drink, into the on and off trade.
Ireland The performance in Ireland reflects the continuing change in market dynamics from on to off trade, high levels of competitor investment, and consumer migration to value brands.
While the total beverage alcohol market grew 2%, the on trade was down 3% and the off trade was up 7%.
The on trade now represents 51% of the total market.
Volume declined 3% and net sales were down 1%.
This was due to weak performance in beer, where volumes were down 6%, partly offset by growth in wine and spirits, where volume grew 18% and 7% respectively.
The impact on net sales of declining beer volume was partly offset by price increases.
Guinness volume declined 8% whilst net sales declined 3% as a result of price increases introduced in June 2005 and May 2006.
Guinness was impacted by increased levels of competitor investment and the movement to the off trade where Guinness share is lower.
In the year there was innovation on the Guinness brand with positive consumer response to the launch of the limited edition Brewhouse Series.
In the second half, Guinness Mid-Strength, a lower alcohol by volume format, began consumer trials in 80 outlets.
The introduction of new packaging on Harp, new marketing executions on Carlsberg and Harp and increased distribution have helped reinvigorate both brands.
As a result both Carlsberg and Harp have maintained volume year on year and net sales have increased 7% and 2% respectively.
Smirnoff continued to be the number one vodka in Ireland and outperformed the vodka category in both the on and off trade.
Baileys volume declined 2% and net sales fell 8% due to increased competition from lower value brands.
Iberia In Iberia, volume and net sales both declined 3%.
In Spain, spirits penetration is declining in all age groups versus other leisure categories and this has negatively impacted the Spanish business, whilst in Portugal trading conditions continued to be tough as a result of tightening consumer expenditure.
J&B faced increased pressure as the standard whisky segment in Spain continued to decline as consumers continued to switch to dark rums.
Therefore, while J&B gained share in the Spanish on trade, overall Iberian volume declined 7% and net sales fell 10%.
Marketing spend increased 3% behind J&B driven by investment in Spain.
Johnnie Walker volume declined 2%, however net sales were up 2% driven by the growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label, Super Deluxe and price increases throughout Iberia.
Johnnie Walker Black Label and Super Deluxe combined grew volume by 4% and net sales by 11%.
Johnnie Walker Red Label volume declined 3% despite a good performance in Spain, where it is the only standard whisky brand growing volume and share in the on trade.
Total Diageo share in the standard scotch segment in Spain increased by 0.3 percentage points.
Across Iberia, Baileys volume was down 6% and net sales declined 5% driven by contraction in the on trade.
Jos Cuervo volume grew 13% and net sales were up 15% due to continued consumer interest in the tequila category.
Local priority brand volume grew 5% and net sales were up 7%.
Dark rums grew robustly in the on and off trade with Cacique volume up 6% and net sales up 9% as a result of repositioning the brand.

Pampero volume declined 14% with net sales down 12% as marketing spend was focused on Cacique.
In total, Diageos rum brands grew volume 2% and net sales grew 5%.

J&B performed well in France, its second largest market, with volume up 9% benefiting from effective on trade advertising and promotion.
Baileys enjoyed strong sales in France and Italy.
Ready to drink volume in the rest of Europe declined by 27%, as a result of the continued decline in the segment in France.
Russia continued its momentum with robust volume growth of 25% and net sales up 26% driven by Johnnie Walker, as the trend towards premium products in Russia continued.
Johnnie Walker is the number one scotch in Russia and Baileys holds the same position in the imported liqueur category.

Smirnoff vodka grew net sales by 10% led by strong growth in Brazil.

Performance was held back as a result of a decline in Cameroon, although this was partly offset by strong performances in Nigeria and Ghana where price increases accelerated the growth of net sales ahead of volume.
Baileys grew volume by 8% driven by growth in Global Duty Free.
Promotional activity in Global Duty Free has, however, resulted in net sales growing by 6%.
Local priority brand performance was led by the growth of Buchanans in Venezuela.
Growth of Bells in South Africa was offset by declines in Tusker and Pilsner in Kenya.
The performance of category brands has been driven by the growth of scotch in Latin America, and our beer brands in Africa.
Investment behind Diageos scotch brands has enabled the International region to capitalise on market opportunities.
Amongst the successes was Old Parr, which grew significantly across Latin America with volume and net sales up nearly 60%.

In Nigeria volume grew 20% and net sales grew 13%.
Harp was relaunched in 2005 and as a result share has increased by 3.7 percentage points.
This growth has, however, led to adverse mix.
Guinness delivered volume growth of 4% and net sales grew 9% as a result of a price increase in October 2004.
In East Africa, difficult economic conditions due to drought and rising fuel prices together with a duty increase, saw consumers trade down to lower value brands.
Volume grew 20% and net sales grew 11% with Senator, a low priced beer introduced in 2005, having performed well.
South Africa saw significant mix improvement as volume grew 6% and net sales grew 19%.
This mix improvement was the result of a strong performance by Diageos scotch brands as Johnnie Walker volume increased by 36% and Bells grew volume by 15%.
The switch in consumer preference towards dark spirits resulted in Smirnoff vodka volume declining by 7%, although Smirnoff ready to drink grew by 48%, driven by the launch of Smirnoff Storm.

Global Duty Free The focus on sales execution and innovation within Global Duty Free has driven strong volume growth of 16% and growth in net sales of 18%.
Packaging innovation such as the Johnnie Walker Blue Label Magnum and marketing activity around the grand prix team sponsorship has led to a 21% growth in net sales for Johnnie Walker.
Baileys delivered growth of 29% in net sales as major sampling activities were carried out in Europe and Asia associated with the launch of the new flavour innovations.

Smirnoff vodka grew net sales by 20% with particularly strong growth in India and continued growth in Australia.
Johnnie Walker experienced strong growth on the back of upweighted investment, which has been focused around the sponsorship of Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One.
This has been particularly successful in driving growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label and Super Deluxe variants, where net sales grew 22%.
The sponsorship has also provided a strong platform for Diageos responsible drinking programmes.
Guinness volume grew by 6% whilst net sales were up 9% with both South East Asia and Japan experiencing good growth.
Local priority brand performance was led by the return to growth of Windsor in Korea, driven in particular by new packaging on the 12 and 17 year-old variants.
This more than offset the decline of Dimple in Korea.
Bundaberg continued to grow in Australia, with net sales up 5%.
Growth in category brands was driven by the newly launched whisky brands in Thailand.
Ready to drink grew volume by 10% and net sales by 9%.
This was led by Australia where the Smirnoff, Bundaberg and Johnnie Walker ready to drink brands all grew volume and net sales in the year.
In Australia, ready to drink has driven growth of 6% in net sales with Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Bundaberg all showing good growth.
Smirnoff ready to drink delivered share gains of 3.4 percentage points, boosted by the successful launch of Smirnoff Twist ready to drink.
In spirits, whilst Baileys has declined in volume and lost share, Johnnie Walker Red Label, Johnnie Walker Black Label, Bundaberg and Smirnoff have all gained share in a spirits market that was up 6% in the year.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 43 In Korea, the trading environment for spirits has stabilised as a result of improved economic conditions, however Diageos strong performance was the result of gaining share, most notably on Windsor.
The brand has been revitalised with new packaging and the introduction of a 21-year-old variant and net sales grew 9%.
Johnnie Walker volume grew 36% and net sales grew 52%.
Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe grew volume 58% and net sales by 82%, albeit off a small base, as it gained from the new focus on modern on trade outlets and marketing activities to build brand equity.
Dimple volume declined by 22% in the year, as renovations on the brand failed to turn around performance.
In Japan, volume grew 3% and net sales grew by 1%.
Strong performances from Baileys, which grew volume by 65% and Guinness, up 14%, offset a 45% volume decline in Smirnoff ready to drink as a result of a temporary withdrawal in the first half.
The brand performed well following the relaunch in the second half.
In Thailand, Diageo clearly outperformed the market and the competition, with growth in each of its brands despite the decline in the imported whisky segment.
Benmore and Golden Knight together account for over 450,000 cases and have made significant share gains in the standard and economy whisky segments respectively, although this strong growth has resulted in an adverse mix.
Johnnie Walker recorded volume growth of 32% and growth in net sales of 20% driven by Johnnie Walker Red Label.
Performance in Taiwan improved as volume and net sales both grew 11%.
Johnnie Walker Green Label in particular has performed well, benefiting from a new campaign and a market where malt whisky is growing strongly.
Performance in China has continued strongly with volume up 57% and net sales up 81%, albeit from a small base.
Johnnie Walker Black Label represents a significant proportion of Diageos business in China, and has driven this growth with volume up 89% and net sales up 124%, supported by a significant upweight in investment.
This investment included activities surrounding the sponsorship of Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One at the Shanghai Grand Prix, as well as three new local advertising executions.
The Indian business benefited from activities surrounding Johnnie Walkers sponsorship of the cricket Super Series in Australia, and the Smirnoff Life is Calling campaign.
Volume grew 29% and net sales grew 37%.
While there is increasing evidence of consumers upgrading to premium and branded products, competitive activity is becoming more intense, with evidence of increased consolidation in the sector, and an increasing number of new brand launches.
Corporate revenue and costs Reported performance Net sales were 76 million in the year ended 30 June 2006, up by 14 million from 62 million in the prior year.
Net operating costs decreased by 147 million to 166 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Net operating costs for the year ended 30 June 2005 included an exceptional item of 149 million related to the Thalidomide Trust.
Organic performance Transfers between business segments increased prior year net sales by 15 million, and there was an organic decrease in net sales of 1 million.
Net corporate operating costs decreased by 6 million as a result of transfers between business segments and there was a decrease of 1 million as a result of foreign exchange impacts.
An organic increase of 9 million in corporate net operating costs was driven mainly by an increase in investment behind innovation.
Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 30 August 2007: Whilst we watch for any impact the current volatility in financial markets may have on broader trading conditions, the investments we have made in brands and markets this year have created an even stronger platform for the future.
Therefore we currently expect increased organic operating profit growth in 2008 of 9%.
44 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow A summary of the cash flow and reconciliation to movement in net borrowings for the three years ended 30 June 2007 is as follows: Year ended 30 June 2007 2006 2005 million million million Profit for the year 1,556 1,965 1,399 Discontinued operations 139 73 Taxation 678 181 599 Share of associates profits after tax 149 131 121 Net interest and other net finance income 212 186 141 Losses gains on disposal of businesses 1 157 214 Depreciation and amortisation 210 214 241 Movements in working capital 180 192 89 Dividend income and other items 83 133 212 Cash generated from operations 2,272 2,199 2,273 Interest received 42 64 146 Interest paid 279 235 325 Dividends paid to equity minority interests 41 40 49 Taxation paid 368 393 320 Net cash from operating activities 1,626 1,595 1,725 Net investment in property, plant and equipment 205 241 276 Net purchase disposal of other investments 6 7 6 Payment into escrow in respect of the UK pension fund 50 Free cash flow 1,365 1,361 1,443 Disposal of shares in General Mills 651 1,210 Other disposals 4 121 16 Purchase of businesses 70 209 258 Proceeds from issue of share capital 1 3 6 Net purchase of own shares for share schemes 25 32 29 Own shares repurchased 1,405 1,407 710 Net increase decrease in loans 1,226 309 379 Redemption of guaranteed preferred securities 302 Equity dividends paid 858 864 849 Net increase decrease in net cash and cash equivalents 238 67 116 Cash flows from loans excluding overdrafts 1,226 309 379 Exchange differences 211 15 136 Non-cash items 14 18 91 Increase decrease in net borrowings 763 379 450 The primary sources of the groups liquidity over the last three financial years have been cash generated from operations and cash received from disposals.
These funds have generally been used to fund acquisitions, share repurchases, to pay interest, dividends and taxes, and to fund capital expenditure.
Free cash flow increased by 4 million to 1,365 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
Cash generated from operations increased from 2,199 million to 2,272 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
This 73 million increase is primarily a result of higher operating profit of 115 million.
This increase was supplemented by reduced net capital expenditure of 36 million and reduced taxation payments of 25 million, but offset by an increase in net interest payments of 66 million, due to increased net borrowings during the year and higher interest rates and a payment of 50 million into an escrow account as contingency funding in the event that the deficit in the UK pension fund is not covered by future investment returns.
In the year ended 30 June 2007, Diageo invested 70 million in business acquisitions 2006 209 million and purchased 141 million shares as part of the share buyback programme 2006 164 million shares at a cost including fees of 1,405 million 2006 1,407 million.
Net payments to acquire shares for employee share schemes totalled 25 million 2006 32 million.
Equity dividends of 858 million were paid during the year 2006 864 million.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 45 Capital structure and credit rating The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to improve the return on investment and by managing capital structure.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, maximise flexibility and give the appropriate level of access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a range of ratios which are currently broadly consistent with a single A credit rating.
Capital repayments During the year ended 30 June 2007 the company purchased 120 million ordinary shares for cancellation and 21 million ordinary shares to be held as treasury shares 2006 164 million to be held as treasury shares only: 2005 8 million for cancellation and 86 million to be held as treasury shares as part of its share buyback programme, for a total consideration of 1,405 million including expenses 2006 1,407 million: 2005 710 million.
In addition, the company purchased 9 million ordinary shares to be held as treasury shares for hedging share scheme grants provided to employees during the year 2006 2 million: 2005 nil for a total consideration of 82 million 2006 21 million: 2005 nil.
The group regularly assesses its debt and equity capital levels against its stated policy for capital structure and will continue to repurchase shares when appropriate.
In the period from the balance sheet date to 29 August 2007 the company acquired and cancelled 24 million shares for a total consideration of 249 million including expenses.
101 b Authorisation was given by shareholders on 18 October 2005 to purchase a maximum of 305,041,222 shares.
Under the authority granted, the minimum price which may be paid is 28 108 pence and the maximum price is equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share for the five preceding business days.
The expiration date for the programme was 17 October 2006.
101 c Authorisation was given by shareholders on 17 October 2006 to purchase a maximum of 278,571,000 shares.
The expiration date for the programme is 16 October 2007.
46 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Borrowings The group policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings of group financing companies is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, it is group policy to maintain backstop facility terms from relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
The groups net borrowings and gross borrowings in the tables below are measured at amortised cost with the exception, in relation to the years ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006, of borrowings designated in a fair value hedge, interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards which are measured at fair value.
From 1 July 2005, the group has applied IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
The comparative figures for the year ended 30 June 2005 have not been restated for compliance with IAS 39 under the exemptions permitted under IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Net borrowings, reported on this basis, comprise the following: As at 30 June 2007 2006 2005 million million million Overdrafts 46 48 58 Other borrowings due within one year 1,489 711 811 Borrowings due within one year 1,535 759 869 Borrowings due between one and three years 1,209 1,790 1,744 Borrowings due between three and five years 1,206 831 974 Borrowings due after five years 1,717 1,380 959 Fair value of interest rate hedging instruments 20 44 Fair value of foreign currency swaps and forwards 29 17 Finance leases 14 9 9 Gross borrowings 5,730 4,830 4,555 Offset by: Cash and cash equivalents 885 699 787 Other liquid resources 49 30 Foreign currency swaps and forwards 32 Net borrowings 4,845 4,082 3,706 The effective interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2007, based on average monthly net borrowings and interest charge, excluding finance charges unrelated to net borrowings, was 5.5% 2006 4.8%: 2005 4.1%.
Borrowings due within one year including foreign currency swaps and forwards as at 30 June 2007 were 1,564 million 2006 776 million: 2005 837 million.
The groups gross borrowings were denominated in the following currencies: Total US dollar Sterling Euro Other million % % % % Gross borrowings 2007 5,730 48 5 33 14 2006 4,830 47 8 30 15 2005 4,555 84 1 12 3 Cash and cash equivalents and other liquid resources were denominated in the following currencies: Total US dollar Sterling Euro Other million % % % % Cash and cash equivalents and other liquid resources 2007 885 23 15 13 49 2006 748 21 20 12 47 2005 817 31 37 2 30 During the year ended 30 June 2007, the group borrowed $600 million 298 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2012, $600 million 298 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2016, $600 million 298 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2036 and a750 million 507 million in the form of a floating rate euro bond that matures in 2012.
During the year ended 30 June 2006, the group borrowed $250 million 135 million in the form of a medium term note that matures in 2008, $400 million 216 million in the form of a medium term note that matures in 2009, $600 million 324 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2013 and $750 million 405 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2015.
During the year ended 30 June 2005, the group borrowed $750 million 418 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2010.
The proceeds of all issuances have been used in the ongoing cash management and funding activities of the group.
At 30 June 2007, the group had available undrawn US$ denominated committed bank facilities of 1,607 million 2006 1,746 million: 2005 1,788 million.
Of the facilities, 498 million expire in May 2008, 448 million expire in May 2010, 537 million expire in May 2011 and 124 million expire in May 2012.
Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates Diageo Annual Report 2007 47 dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being a minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items aggregated with share of associates profits to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with all of its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.
Capital commitments not provided for at 30 June 2007 were estimated at 86 million 2006 56 million: 2005 53 million.
Diageo management believes that it has sufficient funding for its working capital requirements.
Contractual obligations Payments due by period Less than More than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total million million million million million At 30 June 2007 Long term debt obligations 1,195 1,213 1,218 1,734 5,360 Interest obligations 281 423 325 1,135 2,164 Operating leases 72 124 91 280 567 Purchase obligations 805 781 465 249 2,300 Provisions and other non-current payables 44 71 39 107 261 2,397 2,612 2,138 3,505 10,652 Long term debt obligations comprise the principal amount of borrowings excluding foreign currency swaps with an original maturity of greater than one year.
Interest obligations comprise interest payable on these borrowings.
Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of the year ended 30 June 2007 until maturity of the instruments.
Purchase obligations include various long term purchase contracts entered into for the supply of certain raw materials, principally bulk whisky, grapes, cans and glass bottles.
The contracts are used to guarantee supply of raw materials over the long term and to enable more accurate predictions of future costs.
Provisions and other non-current payables exclude 24 million in respect of vacant properties and 87 million for onerous contracts, which are included in operating leases and purchase obligations, respectively.
Deferred tax and post employment benefit liabilities are not included in the table above.
The group makes service-based cash contributions to the Diageo pension scheme in the United Kingdom.
In the year ending 30 June 2008, the contribution is expected to be 50 million.
In addition, the group has agreed a deficit funding plan with the trustees of the UK Diageo Pension Scheme, which provides for the group to make further payments of 50 million in each of the three years to 30 June 2010 into escrow accounts.
Off-balance sheet arrangements In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in October 2001, Diageo has guaranteed debt of International Multifoods Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The JM Smucker Company as from 18 June 2004, to the amount of $200 million 100 million, until November 2009.
The directors are not aware of any instances of default by the borrower at present, but the ability of the borrower to continue to be in compliance with the guaranteed debt instrument, and in particular remaining current on payments of interest and repayments of principal, is significantly dependent on the current and future operations of the borrower and its affiliates.
This guarantee is unrelated to the ongoing operations of the groups business.
Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo plc nor any member of the Diageo group, has any off-balance sheet financing arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on the groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
Risk management The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the groups treasury department.
The treasury department uses a combination of derivative and conventional financial instruments to manage these underlying risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the finance committee.
This committee is described in the corporate governance report.
These include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover and overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal application of the board-approved strategies.
Transactions giving rise to exposures away from the defined benchmark levels arising on the application of this flexibility are separately monitored on a daily basis using value at risk analysis.
These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and gains or losses are taken to the income statement as they arise.
At 30 June 2007 gains and losses on these transactions were not material.
The finance committee receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury department, including any exposures away from the defined benchmarks.
48 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
The groups policy where a liquid foreign exchange market exists is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net investment in foreign operations before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net investment in foreign operations before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
Diageo introduced from 1 July 2005 additional processes to determine, monitor and document the effectiveness of these hedges in the context of the underlying exposure under IAS 39.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of relevant foreign currency borrowings including foreign exchange swaps and forwards, to the extent that they are in an effective hedge relationship, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, in accordance with IAS 39.
Transaction exposure hedging For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is effective and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Under IFRS, the degree of confidence in forecast future cash flows required to achieve hedge accounting has increased.
This has led to a reduction in the coverage levels initially placed up to 21 months in advance, but with coverage levels being increased nearer to the forecast transaction date.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Diageo expects hedges entered into to continue to be effective and therefore does not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the income statement to be material.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated bonds.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing fixed and floating rate term debt and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the groups reported financial performance.
In June 2007, the board reviewed the groups interest rate risk management policy and approved the following revised policy, which will be implemented during the year ending 30 June 2008.
Fixed rate borrowings will be maintained within a band of 40% to 60% of projected net borrowings, for a time period specified by a board approved template, and the overall net borrowings portfolio will be managed according to a duration measure.
The board approved template specifies different duration guidelines and fixed float amortisation periods time taken for the fixed element of debt to reduce to zero depending on different interest rate environments.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, the profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings was targeted according to a duration measure that was equivalent to an approximate 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
The number of years within the amortising profile depended on the template approved by the board.
Following the implementation of IAS 39 from 1 July 2005 the majority of Diageos existing interest rate hedges are designated as hedges under IAS 39.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective, and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on the income statement is not expected to be material.
Liquidity risk The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of group financing companies borrowings is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
Credit risk The group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The counterparties to the financial instruments transacted by the group are major international financial institutions.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long term credit rating of A or better.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Commodity price risk The group uses commodity futures to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity futures contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value.
To the extent that they are considered an effective hedge under IAS 39, the fair value movements are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Realised net gains recognised in the income statement in the year ended 30 June 2007 were 2 million.
Unrealised net gains on the balance sheet at 30 June 2007 were 1 million.
Insurance The group purchases insurance for commercial or, where required, for legal or contractual reasons.
In addition, the group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 49 Market risk sensitivity analysis The group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the fair value of the groups financial instruments, to the income statement and to equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2007, for each class of financial instrument with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Fair values of quoted borrowings at the balance sheet date are based on year end quoted asking prices.
Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments.
Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair value.
Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective.
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
All net investment and foreign currency cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
As at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006, hypothetical changes in other risk variables would not significantly affect the fair value of financial instruments at those dates.

50 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued Critical accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Diageos accounting policies are set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
In applying these policies the directors are required to make estimates and subjective judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit for the year.
The directors base these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The actual outcome could differ from those estimates.
Of Diageos accounting policies, the directors consider that policies in relation to the following areas are of greater complexity and or particularly subject to the exercise of judgement.
Brands, goodwill and other intangibles Acquired brands are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
Where brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Assessment of the useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite life, requires considerable management judgement.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
In particular, the group performs a discounted cash flow analysis annually to compare discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of each acquired brand.
The analysis is based on forecast cash flows with terminal values being calculated using the long term growth rate the real GDP growth rate of the country plus its inflation rate of the principal countries in which the majority of the profits of each brand are generated.
The estimated cash flows are discounted at the groups weighted average cost of capital in the relevant country.
Any impairment write downs identified are charged to the income statement.
In assessing whether goodwill is carried at above its recoverable amount, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed annually to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows of cash generating units of the group to the net assets attributable to the cash generating units including goodwill.
The discounted cash flow review is consistent with the brand review in its use of estimated future operating cash flows, weighted average cost of capital for the cash generating unit concerned and long term growth rates.
The tests are dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, long term growth rates and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
Post employment benefits Diageo accounts for post employment benefits in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits.
Application of IAS 19 requires the exercise of judgement in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises in excess of inflation, employee and pensioner demographics and the future expected returns on assets.
Diageo determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to be in line with UK practice generally, but the application of different assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reflected in the income statement, statement of recognised income and expense and balance sheet in respect of post employment benefits.
The assumptions vary among the countries in which the group operates, and there may be an interdependency between some of the assumptions.
A list of the major assumptions used by the group for the three years ended 30 June 2007 are set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
It would be impracticable to give the impact of the effect of changes in all of the assumptions used to calculate the post employment charges in the income statement, statement of recognised income and expense and balance sheet, but the following disclosures are provided to assist the reader in assessing the impact of changes in the more critical assumptions.
The finance income and charges included in the income statement for post employment benefits are partly calculated by assuming an estimated rate of return on the assets held by the post employment plans.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, this was based on the assumption that equities would outperform fixed interest government bonds by three and a quarter percentage points.
A one percentage point decrease in this assumption would have reduced profit before taxation by approximately 45 million.
The rates used to discount the liabilities of the post employment plans are determined by using rates of return on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the income statement charge in the year ended 30 June 2007 would have reduced profit before taxation by approximately 7 million.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the post employment liability at 30 June 2007 would have increased the liabilities before tax by approximately 407 million.
The net liability for post employment benefits is partly determined by the fair value at the end of the year of the assets owned by the post employment plans.
A 10% movement in worldwide equity values would increase decrease the net pension liability before tax at 30 June 2007 by approximately 276 million.
The mortality assumptions used in the UK plan were reassessed in 2006 and are based on the recent mortality experience of the plan and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
For example, it is assumed that members who retire in 2027 at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater, the charge to profit before taxation would have increased by approximately 11 million and the net post employment liability before tax would have increased by approximately 173 million.
Exceptional items These are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
The determination of which items are separately disclosed as exceptional items requires a significant degree of judgement.
Exceptional items, as reported, do not represent extraordinary items under US GAAP.
Taxation The group is required to estimate the corporate tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included within the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realised in the future.
This evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast of future taxable income.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 51 Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
The group operates in many countries in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.
As a consequence the group is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Management judgement is required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts accrued are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
However the actual tax liabilities could differ from the provision and in such event the group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period which could have a material impact on the groups profit and loss and or cash position.
Adoption of IFRS The financial statements for the years ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 were prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Prior to this the financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2005 have been restated under IFRS.
IFRS differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
Reconciliations between IFRS and US GAAP, and details of the impact of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP, are set out in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards permits certain optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies and the options adopted by Diageo at 1 July 2004 are summarised below together with an indication as to their impact.
Business combinations Business combinations prior to date of transition have not been restated on an IFRS basis.
There are two main impacts of this approach.
The merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group in the groups primary financial statements has been accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests, where the results, cash flows and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under purchase accounting, the merger would have been accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet.
Under this scenario, the group would have recognised additional intangible assets relating mainly to the fair value on acquisition of acquired brands and an adjustment upwards to the fair value of inventories.
These adjustments would have been offset by the recognition of related deferred tax liabilities.
Goodwill would have arisen on the acquisition.
The recognition of intangible assets and higher inventory values would have resulted in increased amortisation and an increase in the charge to cost of sales as the inventories are sold, net of effects of taxation.
Under US GAAP, the merger has been accounted for as a purchase accounting acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet.
The group has written off goodwill and other intangible assets acquired up to 30 June 1998, direct to reserves in the period when acquired.
Under IFRS 3 all separately identifiable intangible assets are required to be capitalised in the balance sheet, with subsequent annual impairment test.
Under this scenario, net assets would increase in respect of goodwill capitalised with no change to net income in the year ended 30 June 2007 or the two previous years.
Under US GAAP, the goodwill was capitalised and further information in this respect can be found in the US GAAP information in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cumulative translation differences The cumulative translation difference arising on consolidation has been deemed to be zero at the date of transition.
Share based payments Full retrospective application has been adopted.
This option is available to the group because the fair value of applicable equity instruments granted was previously disclosed.
As a result, all years presented have a charge in respect of share-based payment on the basis of full retrospective application.
Financial instruments The group has adopted the provisions of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement from 1 July 2005.
Financial instruments in the year ended 30 June 2005 remain recorded in accordance with previous UK GAAP accounting policies and the adjustment to IAS 39 is reflected in the balance sheet at 1 July 2005.
Under IFRS, prior to the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 July 2005, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecasted transactions were not recognised until realised.
Since 1 July 2005, all such derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, prior to 1 July 2005, for derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations in respect of foreign exchange differences arising on translation to closing rates, changes in their fair value were taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
The impact on net income for the year ended 30 June 2005 cannot be estimated reliably.
The impact on net assets at 1 July 2005 was to increase net assets by 164 million.
New accounting standards A number of IFRS standards and interpretations have been issued by the IASB or IFRIC.
Those that are of relevance to the group are discussed below: IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements In August 2005, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 1 which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
The amendment requires additional disclosures on the objectives, policies and processes for managing capital.
Appropriate additional disclosures will be included in the 2008 Annual Report.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs In April 2007, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 23 which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendment generally eliminates the option to expense borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as incurred, and instead requires the capitalisation of such borrowing costs as part of the cost of specific assets.
The group is currently assessing the impact of the amendment on the results and net assets of the group.
IFRS 8 Operating segments In November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard contains requirements for the disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments and also about the entitys products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers.
The standard is concerned only with disclosure and replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting.
The group is currently assessing the impact this standard would have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
52 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Business review continued IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment In July 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 10 which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
The interpretation addresses the interaction between the requirements of IAS 34 Interim reporting and the recognition of impairment losses on goodwill in IAS 36 and certain financial assets in IAS 39, and the effect of that interaction on subsequent interim and annual financial statements.
IFRIC 11 Group and treasury share transactions In November 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 11, which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
The interpretation addresses whether certain share-based payments transactions involving group entities should be accounted for as equity settled or cash settled under IFRS 2.
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes In June 2007, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 13, which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
The interpretation clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive, the transaction should be treated as a multiple element arrangement under IAS 18, with the consideration receivable allocated to each component relative to their fair values.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction In July 2007, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 14, which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
The interpretation provides guidance on the amount of any surplus that can be recognised as an asset and how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contracted minimum funding requirement.
The following US GAAP standards and pronouncements have recently been issued: SFAS No.
155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements Nos.
133 and 140 In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
This statement provides a fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation, and requires that beneficial interests in securitised financial assets be analysed to determine whether they are free standing derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation.
155 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 September 2006.
155 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
157 Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
157 addresses standardising the measurement of fair value for companies that are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes.
The FASB defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
157 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 November 2007, and interim periods within those financial years.
157 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
158, an amendment of FASB Statements Nos.
158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer benefit plans to: 1 recognise the funded status of the benefit plan in its statement of financial position: 2 recognise as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognised as components of net periodic benefit cost: 3 measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers financial year end statement of financial position: and 4 disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next financial year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations.
The group adopted SFAS No.
As a result, under US GAAP, the group recognised a decrease of 281 million in total assets, an increase of 132 million in total liabilities, and an additional charge of 413 million to accumulated other comprehensive income.
159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.
This statement expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
159 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 November 2007.
The group has not designated any non-derivative financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition under IFRS, and therefore does not expect to measure any financial instruments at fair value under the provisions of SFAS No.
FIN 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
109 In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognised in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No.
FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
FIN 48 is effective for the groups financial year ending 30 June 2008.
The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
SAB 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
108 SAB 108, which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify misstatements when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors.
SAB 108 also provides transition accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which there existed an error in prior period financial statements, the correction of which could be considered material in the current year, by allowing companies to restate prior period financial statements or recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108 through an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption.
SAB 108 is effective for financial years ending after 15 November 2006.
The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on the groups financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB including the Emerging Issues Task Force, the AICPA and the SEC are not believed by management to have a material impact on the groups present or future consolidated financial statements.
