04 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2007 Our key financial and performance indicators for 2007 compared with those for 2006 are summarised in the tables below.
Change Constant exchange m 2007 2006 Reported rates Revenue H1 371.6 348.0 7% 12% H2 382.2 306.1 25% 29% Full year 753.8 654.1 15% 20% Operating Profit H1 64.8 62.5 4% 8% H2 67.0 52.3 28% 31% Full year 131.8 114.8 15% 19% Operating Margin H1 17.4% 18.0% 0.6% points H2 17.5% 17.1% 0.4% points Full year 17.5% 17.6% -0.1% points calculated by translating the 2006 results for non-UK operations at the exchange rates used for 2007 Our performance in 2007 reflects the impact of the acquisition of Chapdelaine, the investments we have made in new broker hires and the generally favourable market conditions.
As expected, our performance in the second half reflects the benefit of the investments we have made in broker hires starting to be realised, together with the helpful market conditions.
Unlike most financial services businesses, the inter-dealer broker business thrives on volatility in financial markets.
During the first half of 2007 levels of activity were variable, with periods of relatively subdued trading interspersed with periods of high volatility, particularly in June.
This high volatility continued throughout the summer and into autumn, only slowing during December, in line with the usual seasonal trend.
Our second half performance was very strong, with revenues up 29% at constant exchange rates, resulting in revenue in the second half exceeding that in the first half, the reverse of the usual seasonal trend.
Operating margin of 17.5% for 2007 is slightly lower than the 17.6% for 2006 reflecting the increased investment in the development of our electronic broking capability.
The investment in 2007 is equivalent to 1.9 percentage points of margin 2006: 0.7 percentage points.
Adjusting for this, underlying operating margin is more than one percentage point higher than for 2006 reflecting the reduction in broker employment costs as a percentage of revenue and improved support cost efficiencies as we benefit from increased scale.
2007 2006 Change Broker headcount period end 1,636 1,512 8% Average revenue per broker 000 463 398 16% Broker employment costs: broking revenue 56.4% 57.8% -1.4% points Broking revenue per support staff head 000 1,136 964 18% at constant exchange rates Broker headcount increased by 124 8% during the year to 1,636 at the year end.
This increase reflects the new hires, the acquisition of Chapdelaine and the inclusion of all of the headcount of the enlarged Tokyo joint venture, net of ongoing reductions in headcount in some parts of the business.
As a result of the management of headcount, average revenue per broker, a measure of front office efficiency, has increased by 16% at constant exchange rates.
The most significant cost in the business is broker employment costs, and in 2007 these costs were equal to 56.4% of broking revenue compared to 57.8% in 2006.
Revenue per support staff head, a measure of back office efficiency, increased by 18% at constant exchange rates.
Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2007 05 Business Review continued Operating Review The tables below analyse revenue and operating profit for 2007 compared with 2006.
A significant proportion of the Groups activity is conducted outside the UK and the reported results are therefore impacted by the movement in the foreign exchange rates used to translate the results of non-UK operations.
In order to give a more meaningful analysis of performance, the results for 2006 shown below are stated using translation exchange rates consistent with those used for 2007, with revenue and operating profit growth rates calculated on the same basis.
Revenue by product group 2007 2006 Change m m Treasury Products 204.0 185.0 10% Interest Rate Derivatives 180.1 160.3 12% Fixed Income 210.8 173.6 21% Equities 81.0 39.8 104% Energy 63.2 57.2 10% Information Sales 14.7 13.2 11% At constant exchange rates 753.8 629.1 20% Translation 25.0 Reported 753.8 654.1 15% Revenues in all product groups increased by at least 10% in 2007 compared with 2006.
There was a significant pick up in the growth rate in Treasury Products in the second half as we benefited from our strong position in FX across all three regions during a period of high market volatility.
Interest Rate Derivatives also benefited from the increased volatility in the second half and the strong underlying growth in emerging market interest rate derivatives and interest rate options.
The growth in Fixed Income includes the impact of Chapdelaine.
The Fixed Income desks of Chapdelaine have been fully integrated into our existing business and it is not possible to isolate the specific impact of the acquisition.
The government and agency Fixed Income markets in North America remain challenging, but having declined in the first half, revenues from these products increased by 5% in the second half.
Fixed Income revenues in Europe also grew strongly in the second half after a flat first six months.
Our Equities businesses in equity derivatives and equity arbitrage have seen outstanding growth due to the sustained volatility in equity markets, with revenues nearly doubling in the second half compared to 2006.
The overall growth rate is boosted by the inclusion of the cash equities business acquired with Chapdelaine.
Adjusting for the acquisition, revenue growth in Equities was 58%.
Our Energy business continues to benefit from ongoing volatility in Energy markets, the increasing use of derivatives, and the extension of our product coverage.
Revenue growth in Information Sales reflects the broadening of the data we provide to our largest customer and an increase in the number of direct customers to whom we provide data feeds.
Revenue by region 2007 2006 Change m m Europe 377.6 334.5 13% North America 300.5 231.8 30% Asia Pacific 75.7 62.8 21% At constant exchange rates 753.8 629.1 20% Translation 25.0 Reported 753.8 654.1 15% In Europe revenue increased by 13% despite a relatively subdued first half, with the strong second half growth of 25% reflecting the combination of the benefit of broker hires and the favourable market conditions.
The business continues to benefit from the focus on volatility products as an asset class with particularly good progress in 2007 in building our activities in equity derivatives and interest rate options.
We have recently strengthened our position in credit through a significant number of hires who have now joined the business.
In Energy products we broadened the business into a number of new products such as coal, emissions, biofuels and soft commodities.
Although the vast majority of our revenues in Europe are generated in London we also service clients from the other financial centres in Europe and after a disappointing first half we appointed a new managing director for those centres providing new focus and resulting in a much improved performance in the second half.
06 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2007 In North America revenue increased by 30%, with growth in the second half of 34%.
Our activities in North America have benefited from the successful integration of Chapdelaine, new broker hires in structured credit and FX products, and a strong market for most product areas, particularly in the second half.
Corporate bonds and credit derivatives now represent over half of our revenue in Fixed Income in the region as a result of the acquisition of Chapdelaine and investment in broker hires.
Our enlarged credit activities performed well during the year with revenue and contribution in line with the original acquisition and integration plans.
Our Equities activities now include the cash equities business acquired with Chapdelaine but excluding this, our revenues from equity arbitrage and equity derivatives increased by nearly 50%.
Our strong position in the growing markets in Asia Pacific was reflected in revenue growth in the region of 21%, with growth in the second half of 28%.
The three largest centres in the region, Singapore, Hong Kong and our joint venture in Tokyo, together account for over 75% of the revenue in the region, and all increased revenue by at least 25% in the year.
We continued to build our presence in the region through broker hires and broadening product coverage.
Our equity derivatives business in Hong Kong more than doubled in size.
Chinas economic progress continues to stimulate the other economies in the region, and our pioneering joint venture in Shanghai, which started operations at the end of 2005, has well established market shares and is benefiting from the development of the onshore market.
We have a smaller presence in Fixed Income in the region, but we hired a new credit derivatives team who started in Singapore in October.
Operating profit by region 2007 2006 Change m m Europe 75.5 65.9 15% North America 46.8 40.6 15% Asia Pacific 9.5 4.3 121% At constant exchange rates 131.8 110.8 19% Translation 4.0 Reported 131.8 114.8 15% Operating margin by region 2007 2006 %% Europe 20.0 19.7 North America 15.6 17.5 Asia Pacific 12.5 6.9 17.5 17.6 The improvement in operating margin in Europe in 2007 reflects an underlying increase in the voice broking margin of 1%, offset by the costs of the development of electronic broking that have been incurred in the region.
In 2006 all the costs of the development of electronic broking were incurred in North America.
The underlying increase in margin reflects the benefit of increased revenue on an unchanged support cost base.
The operating margin decline in North America in 2007 is due to the increased investment in the development of electronic broking compared with 2006.
Adjusting for this, operating margin in North America in 2007 is 19.3%, similar to the margin for 2006.
The margin has not increased over 2006 primarily due to the slight dilution effect from the integration of Chapdelaine offsetting the benefit of increased scale.
In Asia Pacific the operating margin in 2007 has increased to 12.5% as the growth in revenue has been delivered at the same time as reducing broker compensation as a percentage of revenue, and with minimal increases in support costs.
Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2007 07 Business Review continued Financial Review The results for the continuing operations for 2007 compared with those for 2006 are shown in the table below.

The non-cash finance income expense represents amounts relating to the mark to market of derivative financial instruments, amortisation of discounted deferred consideration and the expected return and interest on pension scheme assets and liabilities.
The non-cash finance income expense in 2006 includes a 13.4m mark to market gain on the equity swap taken out by the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trust in 2004 to hedge market risk on the future purchase of own shares to satisfy the vesting of awards under share option schemes.
In 2007 the movement in the mark to market value of the equity swap was a loss of 0.7m.
The equity swap settled in December 2007.
Tax The effective rate of tax on adjusted profit before tax is 38.0% 2006: 39.6%.
The reduction in the effective rate compared with 2006 results primarily from the benefit of a restructuring of intra-group financing arrangements.
The effective rate is higher than the standard UK rate of 30% reflecting the profits earned in the US, where the statutory rate is 46%, and the extent of disallowable items.
Prior year tax items in both 2007 and 2006 reflect the reduction in tax provisions made in previous years as tax matters are settled, and do not relate to current period trading.
The capital tax charge of 1.6m in 2007 relates to potential charges arising from the crystallisation of value for tax purposes due to the restructuring of our joint venture in Tokyo.
Adjusted Basic EPS Adjusted Basic EPS is calculated using adjusted earnings shown in the table above and the undiluted weighted average number of shares in issue of 211.3m 2006: 210.7m.
Exchange and Hedging The income statements of the Groups non-UK operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates.
The most significant exchange rates for the Group are the US dollar and the Euro.
The Groups current policy is not to hedge income statement translation exposure.
The balance sheets of the Groups non-UK operations are translated into sterling using year 08 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2007 end exchange rates.
The major balance sheet translation exposure is to the US dollar.
The gross exposure at 31 December 2007 amounted to US$187m, represented by US and Hong Kong net assets.
The Group has a cross currency interest rate swap designated as a net investment hedge of US$117m of US dollar denominated net assets, giving a net exposure of US$70m.
Average and year end exchange rates for the US dollar and the Euro are shown below.
Average Year end 2007 2006 2007 2006 US dollar $ 2.00 1.83 1.99 1.96 Euro 1.47 1.46 1.36 1.48 Cash flow and financing Net cash flow from continuing operations is summarised in the table below.

The net working capital inflow in 2007 of 5.0m reflects the increase in payables, largely due to increased broker bonus accruals, partly offset by increased receivable balances and net settlement balances due to the higher level of activity compared with a year ago, and increased sign on prepayments due to broker hires during the year.
The increase in interest payments reflects the interest paid on the 300m term loan drawn down to finance the return of capital to shareholders.
The share option related cash flow reflects the cost of acquiring shares to satisfy share options.
Transaction costs represent amounts paid relating to the demerger of the Collins Stewart stockbroking business and the return of capital.
Dividends paid in 2007 represent the Tullett Prebon plc 2006 final dividend of 6p per share plus the 2007 interim dividend of 4p per share.
The 2006 payment reflects the Collins Stewart Tullett plc 2005 final and 2006 interim dividends totalling 16p per share.
Acquisition expenditure in 2007 includes the 29.7m initial payment for Chapdelaine including associated transaction costs, the 0.9m cash cost of acquiring equity in the restructured Tokyo joint venture company, less 0.7m received from a claim made relating to the acquisition of Prebon.
