20 Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust plc Corporate Governance Directors Statement of Compliance with the new Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council the Code in July 2003 and the Association of Investment Trust Companies Code of Corporate Governance the AITC Code The Principles The Directors are accountable to Shareholders for the governance of the Companys affairs.
This Statement describes how the principles of the Code have been applied in the affairs of the Company.
The Directors are committed to maintaining the highest standards of Corporate Governance.
In applying the principles of the Code, the Directors have also taken account of the recommendations of the AITC Code, which establishes a framework of best practice specifically for the boards of investment trust companies.
There is some overlap in the principles laid down by the two Codes and there are some areas where the AITC Code is more flexible for investment trust companies.
Where the Directors have relied on the AITC Code, the variance with the Code has been highlighted in this Statement.
During the year under review, a comprehensive review of the Companys corporate governance procedures was carried out.
The main outcomes of this review comprised: new schedule of matters for the Board: updated terms of reference for the Audit Committee and Management Engagement Committee: new appointment policy and revised appointment letters for non-executive directors: new tenure policy for the Board: new policy for the remuneration of the Board: new Directors induction and training procedure: new policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Company: and updated Directors share dealing policy.
The Directors believe that throughout the period under review they have complied with the provisions of the Code, insofar as they are relevant to the Companys business, and with the provisions of the AITC Code, save in respect of those matters discussed below as being in course of implementation and except as explained under the relevant sections.
Directors Independence The Board comprises five non executive Directors, three of whom are considered wholly independent.
Sir Martyn Arbib was founder and Chairman of Perpetual plc, which was acquired by AMVESCAP plc in December 2000.

The prime medium by which the Company communicates with shareholders is through the interim and annual reports and accounts which aim to provide shareholders with a full understanding of the Companys activities and their results.
This information is supplemented by the daily calculation of the net asset value of the Companys ordinary shares which is published via the Stock Exchange and by a monthly factsheet.
Both the Manager and the Companys brokers are also in regular contact with shareholders and regularly report to the Directors on their views.
A presentation is made by the Manager following the business of the AGM each year.
Shareholders have the opportunity to address questions to the Chairman at the AGM and all shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM.
It is the intention of the Board that reports and accounts be issued to shareholders so as to provide twenty working days notice of the AGM.
Shareholders wishing to lodge questions in advance of the AGM are invited to do so, either on the reverse of the proxy card or in writing to the Company Secretary at the address given on page 11.
At other times the Company responds to letters from shareholders on a range of issues.
There is a regular dialogue with individual major shareholders and general presentations to both institutional shareholders and analysts follow publication of the annual results.
All meetings between the Manager and institutional shareholders are reported to the Board.
Institutional Voting The Board considers that the Company has a responsibility as a shareholder towards ensuring that high standards of Corporate Governance are maintained in the companies in which it invests.
To achieve this, the Board does not seek to intervene in daily management decisions, but aims to support high standards of governance and, where necessary, will take the initiative to ensure those standards are met.
The principal means of putting shareholder responsibility into practice is through the exercise of voting rights.
Your Companys voting rights are exercised on an informed and independent basis and are not simply passed back to the company concerned for discretionary voting by its chairman.
Socially Responsible Investing Your Manager considers many factors when evaluating potential investments.
Some are financial ratios and measures, for example, free cash flow, earnings per share, price to book and more.
Others are more subjective indicators, which rely more on first hand research, such as quality of management, innovation and product strength.
While a companys policy towards the environment and social responsibility is considered as part of the overall assessment of risks and the suitability of the company for the portfolio, the Manager does not necessarily preclude an investment being made in that company on these grounds alone.
Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
