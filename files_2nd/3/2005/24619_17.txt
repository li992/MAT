309467 1-100 14 3 06 15:37 Page 74 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder I am again delighted to introduce this, our fourth, HBOS Remuneration Committee Report for which we will be seeking approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
We introduced our current remuneration policy for our most senior colleagues about 200 in all from the start of 2002.
It has therefore been in place for four full calendar years and I am pleased to report that: during that period, and following regular reviews by the Committee, we have maintained the policys key characteristics and not seen the need for fundamental change: we have gained strong support for our policy and practice from shareholders generally, as most recently evidenced by support from almost 99% of shareholders who voted on the 2004 report one year ago: we have maintained proactive dialogue with our major shareholders and their representative bodies and enjoyed welcome support and advice from them on remuneration matters: and we have examined how well incentive awards made in previous years have aligned with the Groups performance and concluded that alignment is strong.
On that latter point we have looked back over the first four full calendar years of HBOS 2002-2005 in order to assess the correlation between corporate performance and incentive outcomes.
Under the short term incentive arrangements, we have used consistent metrics - profitability, earnings per share and return on equity - and over the four year period these have risen, on average, by about 17% p. a. about 18.5% p. a. and about 4% p. a. respectively.
Even though we have delivered double digit profit growth each year, our short term incentive payments each year have only been slightly above target levels.
Our consistent delivery of operational performance shows through in our strong relative total shareholder return performance see Section 10.4 and in the rewards which our colleagues - and also our shareholders - enjoy as a result.
Specifically, under the long term incentive arrangements, we have again used a consistent metric - total shareholder return - and over the four year period, we have, on average, outperformed our competitors by almost 7% p. a.
- HBOS total shareholder return over that period has been almost 40%.
In terms of incentive outcomes, we have made payments at almost maximum levels.
Overall, over this period, shareholders have enjoyed 10bn of added value over and above the average growth delivered by our comparator group.
All Executive Directors have chosen to take all incentive outcomes in HBOS shares over each of the first four years of HBOSs existence.
In 2005, our review of remuneration policy for our most senior colleagues focused on five areas: the legislative pension changes being introduced from 6 April 2006 and, specifically, the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance: the long term incentive scheme for our most senior colleagues where we had, in 2002, given undertakings to our major investors that we would review the scheme after three full calendar years to evaluate its effectiveness: the need to reinforce, for our most senior colleagues, performance focus and accountability: and then to design appropriate up to date remuneration structures - in terms of their links to divisional operating, Group operating and Group shareholder performance: the parallel need to re-assess competitive remuneration positioning in our market so that we are well placed in terms of recruitment and retention - as well as motivation - particularly as our business breadth and share of markets expand: and the need to ensure that our colleagues, including those in the top team, have sufficient appreciation and understanding of our remuneration offering, particularly during the run up to the introduction of the legislative pension changes.
These are complex and interdependent issues.
So far, HBOSs remuneration offering to its top team has been a straightforward and transparent one and the Committee has sought to maintain those characteristics following the 2005 review - as well as to get the remuneration structure right for all stakeholders.
We have therefore decided to: cease, from April 2006, service-related pension accrual for those whose pension pots then exceed the 1.5m Lifetime Allowance.
We will replace that remuneration element with a simple annual taxable cash allowance of 25% of salary which will not count as salary for the purposes of the incentive schemes : maintain the long term incentive scheme for our most senior colleagues, in its current form.
It pays nothing for average performance and linearly increasing amounts as we add more value for shareholders relative to that created by our competitors - on the basis of about 1.5% of that relative added value going to participants with 98.5% going to shareholders generally: and maintain the structure of the existing short term incentive scheme and introduce, from January 2006, a second element to the short term incentive scheme for our 50 or so most senior colleagues who are collectively the principal drivers of not only divisional operating but also Group operating and Group shareholder performance.
The second element is therefore based on two year performance periods and will reward sustained and consistent operating performance at Group level.
The introduction of this reward component is important for three reasons.
Firstly, we want to place more emphasis on sustained consistent delivery of operational performance - because we believe that it is a key driver of the creation of longer term shareholder value.
Secondly, we want to continue with our emphasis on performance related reward - because it works.
Thirdly, as our performance over the last four years shows, we have an outstanding top team which we must retain and reward competitively.
This will mean that our suite of incentive schemes for these colleagues will be: Core Short Term Incentive 1 year with Deferred Share Enhancement Purpose: To motivate achievement of annual divisional operating objectives and to provide incentive to co-invest and deliver absolute total shareholder returns.
Performance measures and drivers: Will vary by level of seniority and function.
May include divisional sales, costs, profitability, risk management delivery and or customer service delivery.
In addition, share price and dividends in respect of the deferred element.
HBOSplc Annual Report and 74 Accounts 2005 309467 1-100 14 3 06 2:46 am Page 75 Extended Short Term Incentive 2 years with Deferred Share Enhancement Purpose: To motivate consistent achievement of Group operating objectives over more than one year and to provide incentive to co-invest and deliver absolute total shareholder returns.
Performance measures and drivers: Group profitability, EPS and ROE.
Long Term Incentive 3 Years Purpose: To incentivise relative and absolute overall share performance.
To align shareholder and senior colleague interests.
Performance measures and drivers: Relative total shareholder return with secondary absolute total shareholder return.
These schemes, collectively, are positioned not only to be market competitive but also to sustain and improve focus on our key business issues.
Fuller detail on these incentive schemes appears within the main body of this report.
In the full report which follows, we have produced transparent and extensive technical details, as we have done for the past three years.
We welcome questions and feedback from all shareholders on both the report content and the report transparency.
We believe our remuneration policy is right for our colleagues and right for our shareholders - and we encourage all shareholders to support this Report at the Companys forthcoming 2006 Annual General Meeting.

Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is a committee of the Board.
Your Board believes that a properly constituted and effective Committee is key to ensuring that Executive Directors and other colleagues remuneration is aligned with shareholders interests and that it motivates Executive Directors and other colleagues to enhance the absolute performance and the relative competitiveness of the Group.
The Committees terms of reference are summarised in Appendix 1.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee during 2005 were all independent Non-executive Directors, as shown below: Brian Ivory Chairman Sir Ronald Garrick Coline McConville At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Groups Chairman and the Chief Executive attend Committee meetings to provide background and context on matters relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Directors and other colleagues in the Group, but do not attend when their own remuneration or contractual terms are discussed.
No Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration or contractual terms.
During 2005, the Committee met on eight occasions and the attendance of Committee members is as shown below: Brian Ivory Chairman - eight meetings Sir Ronald Garrick - eight meetings Coline McConville - eight meetings This frequency of meetings enables the Committee regularly to review, for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues, overall reward and the components thereof, in relation to the absolute performance and the relative competitiveness of the Group.
The performance of the Committee is evaluated as part of the overall evaluation of the performance of each Non-executive Director, as set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 68-72.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee During 2005, David Fisher, Director, Group HR, acted as Secretary to the Committee and provided advice to it.
Harry Baines, the Company Secretary, also provided advice to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee sought independent external advice on remuneration matters.
The Committee does not retain advisors but uses organisations best suited to undertake specific projects from time to time.
During 2005, the Committee took advice, directly or indirectly, from: Watson Wyatt Limited, in relation to pension issues: this organisation also advises the trustees of various Group pension plans on a range of pension issues: Mercer Human Resource Consulting, in relation to pension issues: this organisation also advises the Group on a range of pension issues through its role as Corporate Actuary.
It also advises the trustees of one small group pension plan: Hay Group, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt Limited, in relation to remuneration issues: these organisations also advise the Group on a range of remuneration issues: New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report: this organisation also provides general advice to the Group on remuneration issues and independent performance measurement results for grants under the long term incentive plan which applies to our most senior colleagues: and Linklaters, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report: this organisation also provides legal advice to the Group on remuneration and other issues.
In the opinion of the Committee, there were no conflicts of interest during 2005 in relation to these organisations advising the Group, certain pension scheme trustees and the Committee.
Compliance with the Combined Code Full details of the Groups approach to Corporate Governance, including compliance with original and revised versions of the Combined Code, are included in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 68-72.
The Board has followed and complied with the Combined Code as well as the Regulations in preparing this Report and in designing performance-related incentive plans for senior colleagues.
Service contracts The arrangements relating to the provision of the services of the Chairman of the Group are covered by a contract which extends to 30 June 2008.
If the contract is terminated by the Group prior to the expiry of the term, contractual compensation equivalent to the balance of the fees payable during the balance of the term subject to a maximum compensation equivalent to one years fees may, in certain circumstances, be payable.
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which can be terminated by the Group on one years notice or by the Director on six months notice.
If any contract is terminated by the Group prior to the expiry of the term, contractual compensation up to the equivalent of one years basic salary may, in certain circumstances, be payable.
There is no contractual compensation entitlement for any of the Directors beyond this.
Executive Directors are expected to make reasonable efforts to mitigate for any loss arising from early termination of their contracts.
There are no provisions in service contracts which provide for enhanced terms on a change of control of the Group.
It is the Committees policy to design service contracts for any newly recruited Executive Directors in a comparable form to the contracts of existing Executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors are appointed by letter for an initial term of three years with an expectation that in most cases, and subject to satisfactory performance, they will be invited to serve a second three-year term.
Where the Board is satisfied that it is in the interests of the Group and its shareholders, a Non-executive Director may be asked to serve a third three-year term.
Notwithstanding these three yearly terms, appointments of Non-executive Directors can be terminated on one months written notice given either by the individual Director or by the Group.
External appointments The Group recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Group.
Provided that it does not impact materially on their executive duties, Executive Directors are generally encouraged to accept one such appointment.
They may retain any resulting fee.
In certain circumstances, two such appointments may be permitted.
The fees payable in respect of any second appointments will be donated to charity.
Share ownership The Group believes that share ownership by colleagues throughout the Group enhances their alignment with shareholders interests.
Therefore colleagues in the Group are able to acquire shares as a result of: the free share plan up to 3,000 p. a. : the sharesave plan based on contributions of up to 3,000 p. a. : short term incentive plans.
All colleagues can opt to take the whole or part of their incentive in shares rather than in cash.
Those who take their incentive in shares, retain them for three years and remain with the Group for that period or rank as qualifying leavers receive a 50% enhancement of such shareholding this facility is termed sharekicker : long term incentive plans.
Share grants of varying percentages of salaries were made to senior colleagues about 190 in all effective from the start of 2005: and personal purchase using the Groups, or other, sharedealing facilities.
These arrangements assist colleagues throughout the Group to acquire shares.
They form a key element of the Groups commitment to creating a competitive, flexible and performance-oriented reward structure.
The Group requires all of its Directors including the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors, together with other senior colleagues, to acquire and retain significant numbers of shares relative to base salaries or fees.
In the case of each Director the value of the shareholding is required to be at least 100% of base salary or base fee, based on average personal shareholdings, within three years of appointment or by 2006, whichever is the later.
It is anticipated that all such colleagues will satisfy these requirements during 2006.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues To deliver its objective of creating real increases in shareholder value relative to the finance sector, the Group needs to attract and retain the most capable and committed people and create the right employment conditions and reward opportunities for them.
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their most senior colleagues is aligned with this objective.
Accordingly, the focus of remuneration policy is not simply on salary but is on incentive plans that are aligned with the delivery of both operating plans and increases in shareholder value.
Therefore, for 2006 and for 2007 subject to review, as was the case for 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005: salary policy is set at around market median for the financial services sector: the short term incentive plan is based on the delivery of operating plans: and the long term incentive plan is focused on the creation of relative additional shareholder value.
Participants do not receive any shares unless the Groups relative total shareholder return is above that of the finance sector as measured using the weighted average total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies.
The long term plan is highly geared so that average performance or worse generates no reward but outstanding performance generates a high level of reward.
The Committee has appropriate procedures in place to ensure that these policies are followed in practice.
The changes we are making to our remuneration structures are set out in Section 10.3.
There are no further plans at present to make any changes to this remuneration policy for 2006 and beyond.
In broad terms, for 2006 and beyond, for every 100 of target reward for Executive Directors, about 42 is fixed and 58 is performance contingent.
Sustained exceptional performance can result in a further 66 of reward.
Of the performance element of reward, between 20% and 29% is based solely on annual performance with the rest based on longer term performance or retention.
For remuneration purposes, roles in HBOS fall into one of ten Levels, 1-8, the HBOS Executive and the Executive Directors.
This report covers colleagues who fall into Level 8 and above, about 50 colleagues in all, but with emphasis on Directors.
Appendix 2 gives broad details of remuneration arrangements for those in Levels 1-7.
Annual Report and HBOSplc Accounts 2005 77 309467 1-100 9 3 06 9:12 pm Page 78 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued 10.1 Salary Salary benchmarks are reviewed annually, taking account of information from independent sources on salary rates for comparable jobs in the finance sector and in other selected major listed companies.
Actual salaries are normally reviewed annually in May but can be reviewed at any time.
There is no automatic annual salary increase.
The benchmarking process is both extensive and rigorous.
It is designed to ensure that the median salary policy adopted by the Committee demonstrably applies in practice.
Specifically, the Committee considers data sourced from Hay Group, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt Limited: as well as data sourced from annual reports and accounts of other relevant companies.
These include the FTSE15 - seven companies bigger than and seven companies smaller than HBOS - together with other major banks, insurance companies and retailers.
Base salaries of the Executive Directors after the most recent review with effect from 1 May 2005, and at 31 December 2005, were: James Crosby 875,000, Phil Hodkinson 575,000 from 1 April 2005, Andy Hornby 685,000, Colin Matthew 550,000 and George Mitchell 610,000 retired 31 December 2005.
Until the date of his leaving on 7 May 2005, Mark Tuckers base salary was 560,000.
There were some substantial individual salary increases during 2005.
Three Executive Directors Phil Hodkinson, Andy Hornby and Colin Matthew were promoted to significantly larger roles during the year and had large salary increases as a result.
However, the aggregate salaries of the Executive Directors in force at the end of 2005 were about 4% lower than the aggregate in force at the end of 2004.
At 31 December 2005, the average salary for those in the HBOS Executive was 321,000: the upper quartile was 356,000 and the lower quartile was 271,000: and for those in Level 8 the average was 213,000: the upper quartile was 240,000 and the lower quartile was 180,000.
10.2 Incentive plan philosophy The purpose of the incentive plans is to provide a direct link between each individuals remuneration and three components of performance, namely their own, that of the business they work in and that of the total Group, both annually and over the longer term.
All Executive Directors and a substantial majority of other senior colleagues participate in incentive plans which are Group-wide.
Performance targets and levels of participation differ in order to align overall individual remuneration with the Groups policy objectives outlined earlier.
Different, market specific, arrangements exist for a small number of senior colleagues within the Group.
Payment of incentives, for Executive Directors and certain other individuals, is subject to the approval of the Committee.
Except in certain exceptional circumstances in respect of initial periods of employment, it is the Committees policy that no Executive Director should have a contractual right to an incentive.
Incentive arrangements to apply during 2006 are set out below.
10.3 Short Term Incentive Plans The levels of the incentive payments are dependent on the extent to which operating plan objectives are achieved.
The short term incentive plans, for Executive Directors, the HBOS Executive and colleagues in Level 8, have two key elements.
The first element, operated annually, rewards the achievement of annual line of sight operating plan objectives - those for which the individual has prime or material contributory accountability.
It is an annual scheme based on annual performance.
Benchmark payment levels which apply for 2006 are as follows: Category Incentive as a % of salary for 2006 Target Maximum Executive Directors 75 112.5 HBOS Executive 75 112.5 Level 8 60 90 Any incentive outcome from the 2006 scheme is crystallised for participants in March 2007 but then invested in shares for three years until March 2010.
For Executive Directors, payment of target incentive will require the achievement of targets which include earnings per share EPS and return on equity ROE and the attainment of a certain level of profitability.
For others, payment of target incentive will require the achievement of divisional or functional operating plan targets which might include sales, costs, profitability, risk management and or customer service components.
The second element, operated annually, which will be implemented subject to shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting rewards the sustained achievement of Group operating plan objectives - for which Executive Directors, the HBOS Executive and colleagues in Level 8 have aggregate contributory responsibility through a combination of annual and biennial performance.
Group performance is again measured against EPS, ROE and profitability.
Benchmark payment levels which apply for the 2006-2007 cycle of the scheme are as follows: Category Incentive as a % of salary for 2006-2007 Target Maximum 2006 2007 2006-2007 Total 2006 2007 2006-2007 Total All 11.25% 11.25% 15% 37.5% 16.875% 16.875% 22.5% 56.25% Payable only if 2006 and 2007 targets maxima are attained.
HBOSplc Annual Report and 78 Accounts 2005 309467 1-100 13 3 06 7:12 pm Page 79 Any incentive outcome from the 2006-2007 scheme is crystallised for participants in March 2008 but then invested in shares for three years until March 2011.
The levels of incentives shown in the two tables on page 78 require participants to take their incentives in shares the sharekicker facility referred to in Section 9 rather than in cash: to retain these shares for three years: and to remain in Group employment or to rank as a qualifying leaver during the three year period.
The Committee believes that this feature clearly aligns the interests of participants and shareholders by encouraging participants to be both long term colleagues and long term shareholders, having first achieved stretching performance targets in relation to operating plans.
Participants may take their incentive in cash in which case the incentive is released at two thirds of the level which would normally apply were incentive taken in shares.
The incentive levels for the first element of the scheme are the same as those which applied in 2005.
The incentive levels for the second element of the scheme are new for 2006.
The Committee is proposing to increase the overall incentive levels for this scheme to address a clear shortfall in HBOSs competitive remuneration position in the financial services sector.
Introducing the deferred element to the scheme to close this shortfall is considered to be the most appropriate way to help attract and retain the most capable and committed Executive Directors and their most senior colleagues.
There is a separate additional core short term incentive plan for one Executive Director, Peter Cummings, to recognise and respond to market practice in his divisional specialism.
The level of the incentive payments under this additional plan are dependent on the extent to which Peter Cummings achieves his divisional operating plans.
The additional incentive opportunities are at two thirds of the levels of the annual incentive plan applying to Executive Directors generally, payable in cash.
James Crosby will participate in the first element of the short term incentive plan until he leaves on 31 July 2006.
He will not participate in the second element of the short term incentive plan.
10.4 Long Term Incentive Plans Participants are granted conditional shares shortly after the start of the financial year equal to the number of shares secured by a percentage of the participants salary and based on the price of the Groups shares, using the average market price in the last ten business days of the previous financial year.
For awards in 2006, grant levels will be as follows: Category Conditional share grant as a % of salary Executive Directors 100 HBOS Executive 66.67 Level 8 66.67 James Crosby will not participate in the long term incentive plan in respect of awards in 2006.
The number of shares ultimately released to participants under the plan is dependent on the Groups annualised Total Shareholder Return TSR defined as the gross overall return on ordinary shares of HBOS after all adjustments for capital actions and re-investment of dividends or other income over three year periods, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies Alliance & Leicester: Aviva: Barclays: Bradford & Bingley: Legal & General: Lloyds TSB: Northern Rock: Prudential: Royal Bank of Scotland: and Royal & Sun Alliance over equivalent periods.
For awards in 2006, any releases early in 2009 will be as follows: Groups relative Amount released as TSR performance a % of share grant 0% p. a. or below 0 3% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 Intermediate positions will be determined by interpolation.
If the relative TSR performance does not exceed 0% p. a. after three years, the conditional share grant lapses.
There is no retest in this or any other circumstance.
The Committee believes that TSR is an appropriate performance measure because it is a robust and transparent measure of the creation of shareholder value: that a relative measure is more competitively appropriate than an absolute one: and that a weighted average group made up of the biggest domestic banking and insurance companies is the most valid comparator and gives a more effective performance test than a traditional ranking-based league table.
Calculations of TSR performance are performed independently of the Group by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
Provided that the weighted average TSR of the comparator companies is at least 0% p. a. HBOS shareholders will have to enjoy an additional return equivalent to at least 7.25bn over 2006-2008 for share grant participants in 2006 to enjoy maximum releases early in 2009.
The estimated face value of conditional share grants for 2006 is about 16.5m in respect of about 200 participants.
Maximum releases would amount to about 33m plus share growth plus dividends.
Executive Directors and colleagues in the HBOS Executive and Level 8 have never been granted executive share options by HBOS and will not be granted executive share options in 2006.
There are no plans to grant executive share options to these individuals in future years.
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues may participate in the free share plan introduced for all eligible UK colleagues in 2005.
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues may also participate in the sharesave plan.
These are both standard tax-approved schemes available to all colleagues, with no performance conditions.
Annual Report and HBOSplc Accounts 2005 79 309467 1-100 9 3 06 9:12 pm Page 80 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued These overall long term incentive levels are broadly the same as those which applied in 2005.
In relation to 2003-2005, the outcome for TSR was 5.49% p. a. ahead of that of the comparator group and long term incentive outcomes will, therefore, be at 183% of share grant levels.
10.5 Benefits Each senior colleague is provided with benefits, which principally comprise a company car or cash in lieu, pension arrangements, paid leave, healthcare cover and preferential terms for some Group products.
Individuals are generally included in membership of tax-approved final salary pension arrangements and, for certain individuals who joined the Group after 1989, for membership of separate final salary pension arrangements.
These arrangements, taken together, provide a personal pension benefit based on salary only, with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary in broad terms, the last 12 months salary at normal retirement age age 60, subject to the necessary pensionable service.
The arrangements also provide a lump sum life assurance benefit of four times salary and pension benefits for spouses dependants and qualifying children.
Recent recruits have been, and future recruits will be, included in tax-approved money purchase pension arrangements or separate arrangements of equivalent value.
These arrangements also provide a lump sum life assurance benefit of four times salary.
All tax-approved benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Pension entitlement is based on salary only.
In April 2006, service related pension accrual under final salary pension arrangements will cease for those whose pension interest exceeds the Lifetime Allowance of 1.5m.
Similar cessations will apply under money purchase pension arrangements.
Affected colleagues will receive an annual non-pensionable cash allowance of 25% of salary, payable monthly, in lieu of such service related pension accrual or money purchase pension contributions.
This cash allowance will not count as salary for the purposes of the incentive schemes.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman The remuneration policy for the Chairman recognises that, whilst the Chairman was independent of the organisation when he joined it, he is not now regarded as independent.
The Chairman plays an active role in influencing the strategic direction of the Group and ensuring performance delivery.
It is therefore appropriate that the Chairmans reward arrangements are based on a mixture of a base fee and performance-related long term incentive.
The base fee of the Chairman after the most recent review with effect from 1 July 2005, and at 31 December 2005, was 575,000.
In addition, as has been the case in HBOS since 2002, the Chairman is included in a long term incentive plan equivalent to that described in Section 10.4 and therefore receives an annual conditional grant based on 100% of his fee and subject to the same performance conditions as apply to Executive Directors.
The Committee established the long term incentive plan for the Chairman through a separately constituted scheme, for two reasons.
Firstly, so that shareholders could vote on this scheme quite separately from any vote on the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
Secondly, for legal reasons, because the Chairman is not an employee of the Group and cannot therefore be included in the share-based long term incentive plan described in Section 10.4 as that plan is available to employees only.
In practice, however, the scheme which applies for the Chairman is a mirror image of the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
There is no short term incentive plan and there are no benefits car, pension, paid leave, healthcare for the Chairman.
The Chairman is reimbursed for a proportion of his office expenses.
The Committee does not slavishly cross-reference the Chairmans reward to a particular time commitment: in practice the Chairman has always been available as required by the Group and, in broad terms, spends about half his working time on HBOS business.
Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors Remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists solely of fees.
There are no short term incentive plans or long term incentive plans or benefits car, pension, paid leave, healthcare for Non-executive Directors.
The current base Board membership fee for each Non-executive Director after the most recent review, effective from 1 May 2005, is 50,000.
In addition, fees are paid for services on committees and for directorships of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Fees are set based on comparisons with other non-executive director fees and time commitments in comparable companies.

Note 4: From 1 May 2004 the basic Board membership fee payable to Non-executive Directors was at a rate of 45,000 p. a. and from 1 May 2005 it was increased to a rate of 50,000 p. a.
The basic Board membership fee covers the range of duties and responsibilities associated with Non-executive Directorship, including attending Board meetings and the Annual General Meeting.
The figures shown in the table above also include fees for services on committees of the Board, details of which are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 68 to 72.
The levels of fees for some Non-executive Directors reflect the significant time spent by them on such committee duties.

HBOSplc Annual Report and 82 Accounts 2005 309467 1-100 13 3 06 11:06 pm Page 83 13.2 Pension benefits Details of each Executive Directors pension and lump sum life assurance entitlement, and the annual contributions as percentages of pensionable salaries required to meet the costs of providing those benefits, are as follows: Table 2 Normal Pension as Lump sum Cost of retirement a % of life benefits age final salary assurance as a % of as a multiple salary of salary James Crosby 60 66.7 4 52 Phil Hodkinson 60 55.3 4 52 Andy Hornby 60 66.7 4 45 Colin Matthew 60 66.7 4 29 George Mitchell 60 66.7 4 30 Notes to Table 2 Note 1: Pension is generally based on retirement from service at normal retirement age age 60 and is based on final salary disregarding, where relevant, the earnings cap as defined in the Finance Act 1989.
Pension and lump sum life assurance is provided from the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme the Scheme, for Colin Matthew and George Mitchell, and from the Halifax Retirement Fund the Fund, for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby, to the extent permitted by legislation, and otherwise from separate arrangements with the Group.
The overall pensions shown generally accrue at rates of one sixtieth of salary for each year of service for members of the Scheme and one thirtieth of salary for each year of service for members of the Fund.
Note 2: Costs are based on estimates, by the actuaries to the Scheme and to the Fund, from Watson Wyatt Limited, of the costs to the Group over the future service periods of the Executive Directors using attained age rates.
Costs are calculated on funding assumptions adopted for actuarial valuations of the Scheme and the Fund and do not distinguish between the costs of providing benefits from the Scheme and the Fund and the costs of providing benefits from separate arrangements.
The costs exclude those covered by personal contributions from Executive Directors but include allowance for the current cost of self-insuring the risk benefits for death in service and ill-health retirement.
Note 3: On death after retirement or after leaving service, a spouses pension equal to 50% of the members pension for the Scheme and 66.7% of the members pension for the Fund may be payable.
Childrens benefits may also be payable.
Under the Scheme and the Fund, Executive Directors who have 5 years service as an Executive Director have a contractual right to retire at age 55 or above with a non-reduced pension and at age 50 or above but below age 55 with a reduced pension.
During the year, the discretionary practice which had previously operated under the Scheme, in like manner to the contractual policy under the Fund, was made contractual.
This formalised arrangements which had previously always applied in Bank of Scotland to put them on the same contractual basis as had previously been applied in Halifax.
Pension increases after retirement are a mixture of guaranteed and discretionary.
Scheme pensions in respect of service before 6 April 1997 are not guaranteed to increase.
Scheme pensions in respect of service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Price Index, subject to a maximum of 5% p. a.
The Fund guarantees to increase pensions in line with the Retail Price Index, subject to a maximum of 5% p. a. and a minimum of 3% p. a. no minimum for pensionable service after 31 March 2004.
There is an established policy of reviewing pensions on a discretionary basis taking account of increases in the Retail Price Index.
Allowance is made in transfer values on leaving in respect of the guaranteed and discretionary increases outlined above.
Note 4: There were no pension arrangements for Mark Tucker.
He received a pension allowance, which is included in Table 1a.
He was also covered for lump sum life assurance of four times salary.
The pension entitlements of the Executive Directors included in final salary defined benefit schemes are set out in the table below: Table 3 Name Age Accrued Increase in Transfer value at Increase in pension accrued 31.12.04 31.12.05 transfer at pension value less 31.12.05 during Directors 2005 contributions 000 p. a.

Note 2: The increase in accrued pension is the accrued pension at 31 December 2005 less the accrued pension at 31 December 2004.
The amount shown in square brackets is calculated on the basis of the disclosure methodology under the Listing Requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Annual Report and HBOSplc Accounts 2005 83 309467 1-100 9 3 06 9:12 pm Page 84 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Note 3: The transfer values are based on the accrued pensions at 31 December 2004 and at 31 December 2005 and are calculated as at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 respectively based on factors supplied by the actuaries, Watson Wyatt Limited, of the relevant pension schemes.
The transfer values are the notional lump sums which would have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the Director had he left service at the respective dates.
It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the Director personally.
Note 4: The Directors contribution is the personal contribution required under the terms of the Fund.
No personal contribution is required under the terms of the Scheme.
The contributions for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are aggregates of the personal contributions required under the terms of the Fund, subject to the statutory limit, together with the amounts of salary they gave up as additional pension contributions as outlined in Note 5 to Table 1a.
Members of the Groups pension schemes have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in Table 3.
Note 5: There were no contributions by the Group to any money purchase pension arrangements in respect of any Director during 2005.
1 Shares The beneficial interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the ordinary shares of the Group are set out below: Table 4 Number Number of shares of shares at 31.12.05 at 31.12.04 01.01.05 Chairman Dennis Stevenson 301,006 221,726 Executive Directors James Crosby 284,758 279,407 Phil Hodkinson 207,648 112,919 Andy Hornby 496,780 252,640 Colin Matthew 213,445 88,032 George Mitchell 202,233 90,562 Non-executive Directors Charles Dunstone 100,000 100,000 Sir Ronald Garrick 23,268 19,611 Anthony Hobson 6,500 6,500 Brian Ivory 7,000 7,000 Coline McConville 5,320 2,070 Kate Nealon 12,879 8,198 David Shearer 10,000 10,000 Notes to Table 4 Note 1: James Crosby, George Mitchell and Brian Ivory now have no interest as at 31 December 2005 over ordinary shares of the Group 2004 - 2,217,507 as Trustees of the Bank of Scotland Profit Sharing Stock Ownership Scheme.
Brian Ivory has a non-beneficial interest over 4,500 ordinary shares 2004 - 4,500.
Note 2: Certain Executive Directors will receive further interests in the ordinary shares of the Group arising out of the short term incentive plans and, in certain situations potentially, the long term incentive plans as set out in Tables 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Note 3: No Director had any interest in the preference shares of the Group or in the loan or share capital of any Group undertaking at the beginning or during or at the end of the financial year.
No options to subscribe for shares in other Group companies are granted to Directors of the Group.
Neither James Crosby nor Phil Hodkinson, who were both Non-executive Directors of St. Jamess Place Capital plc during 2005, nor their immediate families had any interest in the ordinary shares of that company throughout 2005.
Phil Hodkinson resigned as a Non-executive Director with effect from 22 July 2005.
Note 4: There has been no change in the share interests as set out in the table between the end of the financial year and 28 February 2006, the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts.
2 Short Term Incentive Plan - HBOS Directors Certain Executive Directors have conditional entitlements to shares arising from the annual incentive sharekicker.
Where the annual incentive for 2002 and or 2003 and or 2004 and or 2005 was is taken in shares and these shares are retained in trust for three years, additional shares may also be transferred to the Directors.
The basic shares shown below which vested in 2005 are also included in Table 4.
Note 3: Because the basic shares are shown net of each participants original income tax and National Insurance liability, the additional incentive shares are shown in a like manner.
In practice, the value of the grossed-up equivalent additional shares inclusive of associated income tax and National Insurance will be shown in Table 1a at the time of release, as is the case with those released in the year on 23 March 2005.
Those released in 2005 represented the basic shares purchased by the Directors own annual cash incentive in March 2002 plus the additional shares, as shown in Table 1a, arising as a result of sharekicker.
The closing market price of the Groups ordinary shares on the date of release was 8.615.
Note 4: Following his retirement on 31 December 2003, Gordon McQueen retains interests under the short term incentive plan through grants of basic and additional shares of 18,406 and 9,203, respectively effective from March 2003 and 17,128 and 8,564, respectively effective from March 2004.
These remain subject to the same plan rules as apply to existing Executive Directors.
Following his retirement on 31 December 2004, Mike Ellis retains interests under the short term incentive plan through grants of basic and additional shares of 23,889 and 11,944, respectively, effective from March 2003, 17,315 and 8,657, respectively, effective from March 2004 and 34,069 and 17,034, respectively, effective from March 2005.

3 Long Term Incentive Plan and Special Long Term Bonus Plan - HBOS Directors Details of the shares which have been conditionally awarded to Executive Directors and the Chairman under the plans are set out below.
The performance conditions relating to these conditional awards are set out in the notes below the table.
The normal grant level would have been 100% of salary.
Following his leaving on 7 May 2005, all Mark Tuckers interests under the plan lapsed.
Following his retirement on 31 December 2003, Gordon McQueen retains interests under the plan through a grant of 61,718 shares effective from January 2003.
HBOSplc Annual Report and 86 Accounts 2005 309467 1-100 13 3 06 11:05 pm Page 87 Following his retirement on 31 December 2004, Mike Ellis retains interests under the plan through grants of 76,562 and 75,313 shares effective from January 2003 and January 2004, respectively.
Note 3: Awards are not pensionable.
Note 4: The performance period for the January 2002 grant ended on 31 December 2004.
HBOSs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 7.44% p. a. so a maximum 200% of share grants have been released to grant recipients.
Without a maximum payout limit of 200%, the plan would have released 248% of share grants.
The shares granted in January 2002 vested on 3 March 2005.
The closing market price of the Groups ordinary shares on that date was 8.3175.
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares have been released to grant recipients as set out in the table and as provided for under the rules of the plans.
The dividend reinvestment shares are the additional shares which would have accrued on the overall share grants actually released had dividends due during the performance period been reinvested in shares.
Note 5: Subject to performance, the shares granted under the long term plan effective from January 2003 will be released to most individuals shortly after the three year anniversary of the grant date.
Note 6: As explained in last years report, for the 2002 and 2003 grants, all participants could or can choose to take any shares released after three years based on the three year performance outcome or could or can continue to participate in the plan for a further two years and take shares at that point based on the better of the three year and the five year performance outcomes.
This design feature seeks to motivate participants continually to sustain strong performance or to improve lesser performance for their benefit and the benefit of shareholders.
This feature does not apply for the 2004 grants and does not apply for any grants in subsequent years, to reflect the preference on retesting expressed by most major institutional investors.
As the outcome for the 2002 grant was at the 200% maximum level, all Executive Directors chose to take their 2002 grants in 2005 based on that three year performance outcome.
Note 7: In the case of the Chairman, it is not possible to include him in the standard Long Term Incentive Plan.
Nor is it possible to include him in such an arrangement where the grant is denominated in shares.
He is therefore included as the sole participant in the Special Long Term Bonus Plan where the grants are awards of notional shares.
He will become entitled to the cash value of any notional shares on vesting but has agreed that this value will, subject to any withholdings for income tax or National Insurance, be applied in acquiring HBOS shares on his behalf.
Note 8: The number of shares to be released to participants is dependent on the Groups TSR over a three year period, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies over an equivalent period.
For the grants effective from January 2002 and January 2003, a five year period could or can also apply.
This basket of companies comprises: for the January 2002, 2003 and 2004 grants: Abbey National, Aviva, Barclays, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland, but with Abbey National replaced by Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock with effect from 1 July 2004.
The Committee decided to remove Abbey National from the comparator group, in respect of the January 2002, 2003 and 2004 grants, effective from the end of June 2004 immediately before bid activity started : and replace it with Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock effective from the start of July 2004: for the January 2005 and subsequent grants: Alliance & Leicester, Aviva, Barclays, Bradford & Bingley, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland.
Shares have been or will be released as follows: Groups relative Amount released as a TSR performance % of share grant 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 grants 0% p. a. or below 0 3% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 Intermediate positions are determined by interpolation.
Shown as granted in the table.
Note 9: The performance period for the January 2003 grant ended on 31 December 2005.
HBOSs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 5.49% p. a. as illustrated in Chart 1, so 183% of share grants will be released to grant recipients, subject to Note 6 above.
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares will be released to grant recipients as provided for under the rules of the plans.
Full details concerning these shares, which will be released to the Chairman and the Executive Directors in March 2006, will be set out in the 2006 Annual Report and Accounts.
The performance periods for the January 2004 and January 2005 grants do not end until 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007, respectively.
So far, HBOSs TSR over the two year and one year elapsed periods exceeds the weighted average of the comparator group by 15.13% and 8.08%, respectively.

The performance criteria under the arrangement were satisfied and 240,384 shares were released to Andy Hornby at a market price of 8.32 in April 2005.
In accordance with the rules of the special incentive arrangement, Andy Hornby has elected to invest the net amount of shares after tax and National Insurance deductions 141,826 shares in sharekicker as set out in Table 5.
The 50% sharekicker enhancement will be released if Andy Hornby retains the shares and remains in the service of the Group until 31 March 2008 or ranks as a qualifying leaver before that date.
4 Long Term Incentive Plan - Former Bank of Scotland Directors All share options under Bank of Scotlands plans are exercisable in accordance with the rules of the plans, all performance targets having been satisfied, as set out in last years report.

5 Sharesave Plan The sharesave plan is available to all UK based Group colleagues.
The plan allows colleagues to save a fixed amount of money on a monthly basis.
At the end of a pre-determined period, of three, five or seven years, colleagues have the right, if they so choose, to use the funds accumulated to purchase shares in the Group at a fixed price, based on a market price or an average market price determined shortly before the effective grant date and discounted by up to 20%.
There are no performance conditions.

6 Free Share Plan The free share plan is available to most Group colleagues.
The plan grants colleagues free shares on an annual basis.
At the end of three years, shares are transferrable to colleagues, subject to the participants still being in the Groups employment at that time or earlier if they are a qualifying leaver.
Shares must be held in trust for five years to qualify for full tax and National Insurance benefits.
All Executive Directors have taken up membership of the plan and the projected number of shares which they would be entitled to at the end of the relevant period are set out below: Table 9 Grant At Granted G Dividend At Grant effective 31.12.04 Released R Reinvestment 31.12.05 releasable from 01.01.05 or Shares Lapsed L acquired in year in year James Crosby Aug-05 329 G 4 333 Aug-08 Andy Hornby Aug-05 329 G 4 333 Aug-08 Phil Hodkinson Aug-05 329 G 4 333 Aug-08 Colin Matthew Aug-05 329 G 4 333 Aug-08 George Mitchell Aug-05 329 G 4 333 Feb-06 Notes to Table 9 Note 1: Shares were awarded at 9.10, the middle market price of the Groups ordinary shares on the day preceding the date of award.

Each role in HBOS is positioned in one of ten levels, 1-8, the HBOS Executive and the Executive Directors.
The level of a role is determined by the knowledge required to do it, the challenge of delivering the required job outputs and the accountability which the role carries.
The level then, in broad terms, determines the salary range which can apply for the role: the short term and long term incentive structures: and the range of benefit and product offerings available.
Details of the remuneration arrangements which apply to those in Level 8 and the HBOS Executive and Executive Directors are given in the main body of the report.
The table below sets out the number of colleagues and full-time equivalents FTE in other levels and the typical inter-quartile full-time equivalent salary range applying to colleagues in each such level.
Different ranges apply to different groups of colleagues depending on role specialism and geographic location.
Remuneration is, for all colleagues, generally made up of four elements, namely salary, short term schemes, long term schemes and benefits.
HBOS adopts a total reward approach so that colleagues appreciate the totality, the flexibility and the performance drivers of their reward package.
Salary HBOS salary policy is to manage salaries in aggregate, by Level, around the appropriate market median.
Whilst finance sector generic medians establish baseline positions, businesses benchmark according to role specialism and to geographic location.
The alignment of practice with policy is one we aspire to deliver by matching average salaries with the market median position, whilst managing actual salaries generally within an 80%-120% window of the median, reflecting personal skills, experience, performance and business vulnerability.
Short term incentives HBOS has annual incentives which are operating plan aligned, generally team based and built around line of sight issues.
Participants know that these incentives give a real chance of a zero outcome and, equally, a real chance of a maximum outcome which, in cash terms, may be equivalent to 20% of salary or more.
The cash incentive levels for 2006 are generally as follows: Level Incentive as percentage of salary Minimum Target Maximum 1-4 0% 10%-12% 20%-30% 5 0% 17.5% 35% 6 0% 25% 50% 7 0% 32.5% 48.75% Long term incentives Almost every colleague in HBOS enjoys three for Level 7, four long term incentive propositions, each share-based.
Colleagues who choose to buy shares with their net cash incentive get 50% more shares after three years provided they remain in the service of the Group or rank as a qualifying leaver.
Colleagues who choose to save up to 3,000 p. a. by monthly instalments, are given the option, at the end of three, five or seven years, to buy shares based on the share price at the start of the savings period, discounted by up to 20%.
Thirdly, share options free shares.
In 2002, 2003 and 2004, colleagues were given share options over 20% of salary: and these can be crystallised after a minimum of three and a maximum of six years.
In 2005, colleagues were given free shares based on 5% of salary maximum 3,000 p. a. : and these will crystallise after a minimum of three years.
Colleagues in Level 7 were given share grants over 33.33% of salary in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The same arrangements will apply in 2006.
The level of grant released is conditional on relative TSR performance against a weighted finance sector basket, generally over a three year period with no grant released for performance which matches or is worse than the average and with twice the grant released for outperformance of 6% p. a. or more intermediate positions being determined by interpolation.
Benefits Our key benefits are pensions, holidays, cars, healthcare and mortgage arrangements.
We increasingly seek to package them as an overall flexible benefits proposition and a comprehensive product offering.
Many existing colleagues have defined benefit pension arrangements.
Some existing and all new colleagues are eligible for defined contribution pension arrangements.
Both include death and ill health benefits.
