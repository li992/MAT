Interest rate risk Since 2002, the Group has held an interest rate swap with a notional value of US$30m.
The swap is a designated fair value hedge of $30m of the US$ fixed rate debt above and results in the Company receiving or paying interest on a six monthly basis based on the differential between US LIBOR plus margin and the fixed rate at the commencement of each six month period.
As at 31 December 2005, with the exception of the portion of the Groups fixed rate US$ debt not covered by the interest rate swap, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2005, the Groups only significant fixed rate debt was at a rate of 7.37% 2004: 7.37%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.

Explanation of transition from UK GAAP to IFRS continued Explanation of reconciling items Parent company financial statements a Under UK GAAP the Group accounted for pension obligations under SSAP 24 and made disclosure only of the impact of FRS 17, the UK standard for retirement benefits that is similar in many respects to the international standard IAS 19.
Pages 70 to 76 represent the separate financial statements of Croda International Both IAS 19 and FRS 17 are significantly different from SSAP 24, most noticeably from a balance sheet perspective with international accounting requiring the Group to recognise a net fair value deficit on its balance sheet, being the excess Plc as required by the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
These financial statements of the present value of the actuarially valued pension liabilities over the fair value of the assets held to fund these have been prepared in accordance with the Act and UK accounting standards and liabilities.
As IAS 19 adopts this balance sheet perspective, the move to IFRS will also potentially lead to greater volatility in the statement of recognised income and expense.
are thus presented separately to the Group financial statements which have been b Under UK GAAP there was no charge against profits in respect of share based payment arrangements such as the prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.
option schemes operated by the Group.
IFRS 2 requires the Group to recognise such a charge, equating to the fair value of the options granted spread over the relevant vesting period.
c Under UK GAAP the Group was entitled to amortise purchased goodwill over its useful life.
This policy is not allowed under IFRS 3, which instead requires goodwill to be carried at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Accordingly, the amortisation charge of 0.4m under UK GAAP is removed and the carrying value of goodwill, as allowed under IFRS 1, is frozen at its UK GAAP book value at 1 January 2004.
In addition IFRS 3 prohibits the Group from recognising goodwill previously written off to reserves in the income statement upon disposal of the relevant business, thus the UK GAAP exceptional charge of 3.4m in 2004 is removed.
d IAS 12 requires that deferred tax be provided in respect of revaluation gains on fixed assets, no such provision is required under UK GAAP.
In addition the rules with regard to provision of deferred tax on intercompany profit in inventory and unremitted overseas earnings are subtly different under IFRS and give rise to increased deferred tax provisioning.
It should also be noted that the inclusion of the pension deficit on the balance sheet gives rise to a significant deferred tax asset and that, under IFRS, deferred tax assets and liabilities cannot usually be netted off, hence there is a degree of balance sheet grossing up in respect of deferred tax.
e The rules on accounting for post balance sheet events under IFRS are such that dividends can only be recognised when the liability to pay becomes irrevocable.
Accordingly, as the Groups final dividends are not approved until the AGM, usually held in April, then the liability cannot be recognised in the period to which the dividend relates.
Furthermore, as interim dividends have no such prior approval, they can only be recognised when paid.
In addition to the above, a number of presentational changes and additional disclosures are required to comply with IFRS, these are discussed in detail in the transition statement.
The Group has also taken the opportunity to review the basis of its segmental reporting in the light of IFRS requirements and the previous segments of Oleochemicals and Other have been replaced by Consumer Care and Industrial Specialities, segments which better reflect the Groups risk and return profiles in the long-term.
The Groups cash flow is unchanged as a result of the transition to IFRS, however the categorisation of flows on the cash flow statement is somewhat different.
