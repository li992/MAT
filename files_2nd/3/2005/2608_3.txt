Consequently, an Extraordinary General Meeting was convened and held on 20 December 2004 which obtained Shareholder approval for the Company to enter into an agreement with GUS the Share Repurchase Agreement, which allowed the Company to purchase Shares off-market from GUS at the same time as making on-market repurchases.
