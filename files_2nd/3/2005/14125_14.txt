SEVERN TRENT PLC 40 DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 The Directors are required by the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for the financial year.
The Directors consider that in preparing the financial statements, the company and the group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all United Kingdom Accounting Standards which they consider applicable have been followed, any material departures being disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the company and the group keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Severn Trent Plc website is the responsibility of the Directors: the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
