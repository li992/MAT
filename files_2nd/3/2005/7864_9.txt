corporate governance Statement of Compliance The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and confirms that throughout the year ended 31 December 2005 the Company has applied the principles of good governance contained in the Combined Code and complied with its best practice provisions as set out below in the Boards report on corporate governance and in its remuneration report on pages 38 to 46.
The Board is able to report compliance with the Combined Code throughout 2005 save that the balance of the Board and its committees was affected by vacancies for two independent non-executive directors.
Following the retirement of Mr G J Allen as Chairman on 31 December 2004, Mr J W Leng chaired the Board.
Until 4 April 2005 Mr Leng retained the chair of the Remuneration Committee and also continued to serve on the Audit Committee until his retirement from the Board.
These arrangements were considered appropriate pending the appointment of a new Chairman and additions to the non-executive team.
As anticipated, the appointment of a new Chairman was announced before the annual general meeting in May 2005, after which Mr Leng stood down from the Board and Mr N B M Askew became Chairman.
In addition, two non-executive directors joined the Board during the year, which brought the balance and composition of the Board and all of its committees close to full compliance with the Combined Code.
An additional independent non-executive director, Ms A Frew, was appointed on 2 March 2006 and brought the non-executive presence on the Board up to four in accordance with the Combined Code.
The Board At the end of the year the Board comprised eight directors: the Chairman: Chief Executive: three independent non-executive directors increased to four on 2 March 2006 : the Finance Director and two other executive directors.
Changes in the composition of the Board are noted in the Directors' Report.
The non-executive directors are all free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
All of them meet the criteria for independence under the new Combined Code and are regarded by the Board as independent of the Group's executive management.
The Chairman, Mr N B M Askew, was also regarded as independent at the date of his appointment in May 2005.
The independent non-executive directors are from varied backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of skills and experience of senior management in commerce and industry.
Biographical details of the current directors are shown on page 30.
Each new appointee to the Board is required to stand for re-election at the next annual general meeting following their appointment.
In addition, one third of the Board retire by rotation at each annual general meeting and each director stands for re-election at least once every three years.
The Board provides leadership, direction and control for the business and corporate affairs of the Group and oversees business and management performance.
During the year the Board reviewed and adopted a restatement of matters reserved to it and powers delegated to its committees and the executive directors.
Board reserved matters include strategy and key areas of policy, major investment decisions and changes in the composition of the Group.
The Board reviews budgets, forecasts and plans for the businesses of the Group on an annual basis.
Quarterly meetings of the Board consider detailed financial and management reports on the operational and strategic progress of the Group.
Senior executives from around the Group are invited by the Board to attend certain meetings to make presentations and join in discussion.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman and Chief Executive, which is reflected in a written statement approved by the Board.
In summary, the Chairman is responsible for the leadership and running of the Board but does not have any executive powers or responsibilities.
The Chief Executive leads the executive management team in running the businesses and implementing operating and strategic plans under authority delegated by the Board.
The executive team includes: the Chief Executive, Mr M J Lamb: Finance Director, Mr T J Slack: and two operational executives, Mr D C Nicholas, responsible for Fluid Controls, and Mr W R Whitney, responsible for Retail Dispense.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to become familiar with the businesses and there is regular communication between management and non-executive directors.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board meetings operate to an appropriate agenda, and that adequate information is provided sufficiently in advance of meetings to allow proper consideration.
He is supported by the Company Secretary, who also assists in ensuring that the Board operates in accordance with good corporate governance under the Combined Code and relevant regulatory requirements.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of the committees of the Board.
The Board has a recognised procedure for any director to obtain independent professional advice at the Companys expense and all directors have access to the Company Secretary who is a solicitor.
The Board met on nine occasions during the year including four quarterly reviews, strategy days and visits to operations and meetings convened for special purposes as the need arose.
All members of the Board were in attendance at each meeting held during their tenure save that Mr K S Beeston missed two meetings in the year and each of Mr L Browne, Mr M J Lamb and Mr W R Whitney missed one meeting.
Pursuant to the Combined Code, and in accordance with best practice, the non-executive directors met as a group with the Chairman on a number of occasions during the year and the senior independent director convened one such a meeting in the absence of the Chairman.

Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and confirms that the system of internal control accords with the relevant guidance issued in September 1999 and revised in October 2005 by the Financial Reporting Council the Turnbull Committee Guidance.
36 Corporate governance corporate governance Consistent with the Turnbull Committee Guidance, the Board has assigned responsibility for the continuous review of risk management and controls to the Executive Committee.
During the year the Board received reports on risk issues from the Executive Committee and reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control in relation to financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
In addition, the Audit Committee considered and reported to the Board on the financial aspects of internal control including the nature and scope of external audit.
The committee also reviews the internal audit work carried out by the IMI Assurance Department.
Each operating unit is required to undertake a continuous process of business risk assessment and reporting.
This is reviewed by the most senior executive within the relevant business and any major risk issues are referred to the Executive Committee at least quarterly.
The Executive Committee makes regular reports to the Board on major business risks faced by individual operations and by the Group and how it is proposed that those risks be managed.
Through this process business risks are identified, assessed and ranked according to their nature and urgency and the Board considers what measures would be appropriate in order to manage such risks.
The Board has clearly defined in writing those matters which are reserved to it and the respective delegated authorities of its committees and the executive directors.
The Group has a clear organisational structure and well established reporting and control disciplines.
Managers of operating units assume responsibility for and exercise a high degree of autonomy in running day-to-day trading activities.
They do this within a framework of clear rules and policies regarding business conduct, approval of proposals for investment and material changes in operations which were refreshed by the Board and reissued to senior management during the year.
All operating units prepare forward plans annually which make projections for a period of three years.
These plans are reviewed in detail by executive directors and consolidated for review by the Board.
Performance against forecast is continuously monitored by the executive directors, reviewed at monthly meetings of the Executive Committee and on a quarterly basis by the Board.
Minimum standards for accounting systems and controls, which are documented and monitored, are promulgated throughout the Group.
Certified quarterly reports are required from senior executives of operating units, confirming compliance with Group standards.
There is also a central internal audit function, IMI Assurance Department, which operates a rolling programme of internal assurance reporting and reviews.
These include on site reviews of selected operating units which are carried out by the IMI Assurance Department and co-ordinated with the divisional financial management review processes and external audit.
Additionally, visits to operations are carried out by senior Group finance personnel in conjunction with the external auditor.
Control processes are dynamic and continuous improvements are made to adapt them to the changing risk profile of operations and whenever weakness in the internal control system is identified appropriate remedial action is taken.
Capital investments are subject to a clear process for investment appraisal, authorisation and post-investment review, with major investment proposals referred for consideration by the Executive Committee or the Board, as appropriate, according to their materiality.
In addition, the Executive Committee regularly reviews the operation of corporate policies and controls in relation to treasury activities, environmental issues, health and safety, human resources, ethical trading, taxation, insurance, legal and regulatory compliance.
Reports are made to the Board at least annually and more often, as appropriate, to keep the Board informed and enable it to consider internal control issues and developments.
Through the procedures outlined above the Board has considered all significant aspects of internal control for the year 2005 and up to the date of this Annual Report.
The Board believes that the Groups system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk, provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
