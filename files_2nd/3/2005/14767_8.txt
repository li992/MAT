S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 C ORPORATE G OVERNANCE Compliance statement In the opinion of the board the Company has, with the exception of Provision A.
4.1 formation of Nomination Committee, throughout the year complied with the Provisions of the Combined Code on corporate governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 the Code.
The board has not formed a Nomination Committee and applies an alternative process for the selection of new directors to the board.
The full board initially settles in each instance on a candidate prole.
The full board then forms a panel of directors, made up of those directors the board decides are best suited to the circumstances.
This panel first selects a recruitment consultant and then agrees on a long listing of applicants, conducting initial interviews and agreeing a short list of prospective directors for further interview.
All directors then participate in interviewing prospective directors, whether executive or non-executive, prior to selecting the preferred candidate.
The following section describes how the board has applied the other Principles and Supporting Principles contained in the Code and, where appropriate, has adopted elements of corporate governance good practice.
Board of directors The board comprises an executive chairman, four non-executive directors and four executive directors.
Excluding ad hoc meetings to deal with procedural matters, the board met eight times during the year and all directors attended all these meetings apart from those held on 30 September 2004 and on 31 March 2005.
Dame Sue Tinson was unable to be present at either meeting and Lorraine Baldry was absent from the latter meeting.
It is the opinion of the board that, throughout the year, each of the Companys non-executive directors was independent for corporate governance purposes and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of his or her judgement.
In reaching this opinion the board has carefully considered the balance between applying good practice and what it believes is in the shareholders best interests.
David Wilbraham has served on the board for more than nine years.
The boards view, however, is that he displays every quality of independence in carrying out his responsibilities as a non-executive director.
He is prepared to challenge others assumptions and viewpoints, questions intelligently, debates constructively and has developed a sound understanding of the Groups business which, allied to his independence of judgement, serves shareholders interests well.
The board has concluded that, notwithstanding his length of tenure, David Wilbraham continues to be independent.
The non-executive directors each have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, which are appropriately documented.
The non-executive directors met during the year, without the Chairman being present, and appraised the Chairmans performance.
The non-executive directors also met separately with the auditors.
David Wilbraham fullled the role of Senior Independent Director throughout the year.
The board meets at regular intervals and is responsible to the shareholders for overall Group strategy, acquisitions and divestments, major capital projects and financial matters.
During the year the board carried out a review of matters reserved to it for decision.
These matters include the approval of annual budgets of individual trading subsidiaries, major individual items of capital expenditure, acquisitions and major procurement and supply contracts: the management of risks likely to disrupt the ability of the Group or any subsidiary to carry on business or which might damage the reputation of the Group as a whole in the eyes of its shareholders or the general public: and the management of matters which might result in a substantial unplanned financial risk to any subsidiary.
The directors consider themselves collectively responsible for ensuring that risks arising from social, environmental and ethical factors and the health and safety of the Groups employees are suitably managed and are referred to the board, as necessary.
The board has identied and assessed those financial, social, environmental and ethical issues which may present a significant risk to the business.
19 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 C ORPORATE G OVERNANCE continuedD IRECT Board of directors continued The board has established a process, led by the Chairman, for the evaluation of the board, its committees and individual directors.
This evaluation was carried out during the year and resultant recommendations were considered by the board in September 2004 and implemented.
After conducting a review of the membership of the board and its principal committees the board decided that the make up of each was appropriate to the business of the Group and the responsibilities and duties of each forum.
The roles of Chairman and Managing Director are separate and distinct and have been so since the Company first obtained a Listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1985.
An appropriate division of responsibilities has been set out in writing and agreed by the board.
During the year the board considered succession planning.
Miles Emley holds an external non-executive directorship with Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries plc and his fee for providing his services has been paid to the Company, in accordance with the boards policy.
The Companys Articles of Association require all directors to retire and offer themselves for re-appointment by shareholders at least once every three years.
All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information needed to enable them properly to discharge their responsibilities.
The procedure for directors to seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties and to be reimbursed their reasonable legal fees was reconrmed during the year, as was the right of each to have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
All directors also have unrestricted access to other executives within the business to discuss any matter of concern to them.
On appointment, each director receives an induction appropriate to their previous experience as a director and their knowledge of the industry.
Board committees Separate Audit and Remuneration Committees of the board exist, each with written terms of reference which were reviewed and revised during the year.
Copies of these terms of reference can be obtained from the Secretary and are made available on the Groups corporate web site.
The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the committees.
Audit Committee Throughout the year the Companys four independent non-executive directors, David Wilbraham chairman of the Committee, Lorraine Baldry, Simon Marquis and Dame Sue Tinson each served on the Audit Committee.
The board is of the opinion that the Audit Committee includes sufficient relevant financial experience and that the number of meetings held three during the year was sufficient for it to properly discharge its business.
The Audit Committee met twice during year with the Groups external auditors: to agree the scope of the audit and review the independence of the auditors, including the level of fees for audit and non-audit services: and to review the results of the audit prior to the approval by the board of the Groups financial statements.
The Group Chairman and the Finance Director were also invited to attend each meeting to ensure that committee members were fully informed and supported in carrying out their duties.
During the year the Audit Committee evaluated its performance, reviewed the Groups Whistle-blowing policy and made a recommendation to the board that no circumstances had arisen to warrant the establishment of an internal audit function.
In addition, the Committee also reviewed the annual internal control reviews performed by the operating sites and the controls over key business risks.
The members of the Audit Committee have been given specic approval by the board to meet with the Groups auditors whenever they, or the auditors, consider it appropriate.
20 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 ORS R EPORT continued Remuneration Committee Throughout the year the Remuneration Committee has been made up solely of independent non-executive directors: David Wilbraham chairman of the Committee, Lorraine Baldry, Simon Marquis and Dame Sue Tinson.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year which, in the opinion of the board, was sufficient to discharge its business.
At the end of the year the Remuneration Committee formally evaluated its performance.
Internal control The board is responsible for the Groups system of internal control, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, and for reviewing its effectiveness.
A workable and realistic system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, therefore, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
During the year the directors reviewed the need for an internal audit function and accepted the view of the Audit Committee that the existing control environment, financial controls and the annual external audit of all trading subsidiaries are sufficient.
The board believes that its internal control procedures, outlined below, have enabled the directors to report in full compliance with the Turnbull guidance on internal controls.
The board exercises these controls via monthly meetings of each divisions senior management with the Groups Chairman, Managing Director and Finance Director present.
All attendees receive agendas and papers in advance of each meeting: detailed minutes are recorded and actions followed up.
Regular items for discussion encompass any areas of significant risk to the businesses, which are then raised at the next meeting of the board when appropriate.
In addition, throughout the year the executive directors met at regular intervals with divisional managing directors, the Company Secretary, the Groups director of personnel and the Groups technical director, as an executive committee, to review the Groups businesses world-wide as an integral part of the Groups internal control mechanism.
Annual internal control reviews are performed by all operating sites and any inconsistencies with the Groups established corporate governance and authority limits regimes are identied and disclosed to the Audit Committee.
The board has also carried out its annual review of the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control and the identication of and controls over key business risks which covers the year under review and the period up to the date of this annual report.
