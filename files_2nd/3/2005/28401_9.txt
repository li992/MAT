58.22 PF DirectorsR P9 DW 28 3 06 7:47 pm Page 52 Corporate governance report 1 Introduction This section explains how the company has applied the main and supporting principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 the Combined Code.
The statement of compliance is set out on page 56 in paragraph 13.
2 The board Composition 2.1 The board leads and controls the company.
It currently comprises a non-executive Chairman, four executive directors and four non-executive directors.
The composition of the board is thus considered to be well-balanced.
Division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive 2.2 The board has approved a statement of the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman is responsible for chairing the board meetings, and monitoring their effectiveness, and chairing the annual general meeting AGM and the nomination committee.
He is also responsible for ensuring that an effective strategy is approved by the board and that an annual evaluation of the board is carried out.
The Chief Executive is primarily responsible for implementing the companys strategy, as well as being a focal point for communication with shareholders.
All other responsibilities other than those detailed above, those reserved to the board as a whole and the board committees are the responsibility of the Chief Executive, who will delegate appropriately.
Chairman 2.3 The Chairman is also Chairman of Huveaux PLC.
In May 2005, he ceased to be Chairman of Eidos plc: other than this, there has been no material change in his other commitments during the year or since the year end.
Non-executive directors 2.4 Each of the non-executive directors has been formally determined by the board to be independent for the purposes of the Combined Code.
2.5 Non-executive directors are currently appointed for fixed periods of three years, subject to election by shareholders.
The initial three-year period may be extended for one further three-year period and, in exceptional cases, further extended, subject to re-election by shareholders.
Their letters of appointment may be inspected at the companys registered office or can be obtained on request from the Company Secretary.
2.6 Ray Miles has been appointed as the senior independent director.
He is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
2.7 Charles Gregson, the non-executive Deputy Chairman, was first elected to the board on 19 April 1995 and thus, on 19 April 2006, 11 years will have elapsed since his first election.
Notwithstanding this, the board has determined him to be independent in character and judgement.
In coming to this decision the board considered all the relevant circumstances but ultimately concluded that a term of office of 11 years had not changed Charles Gregsons status, given that independence is ultimately determined by state of mind.
He continues to make a distinct and strong contribution to strategy discussions and his experience of international businesses is a particular asset to the group as it continues with international expansion.
In 2005, the nomination committee reviewed the structure and composition of the board.
It took the view that the four current non-executive directors bring an appropriate balance of skills and expertise to the board.
Furthermore, although Charles Gregson has served for 11 years, two of the non-executive directors have served for less than three years: these more recent appointments have ensured that the board has been refreshed and remains appropriately balanced.
Governance framework 2.8 The board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision, including corporate strategy, approval of budgets and financial results, new board appointments, proposals for dividend payments and the approval of all major transactions.
This schedule is reviewed on an annual basis and was last reviewed on 12 December 2005.
The board has appointed five committees.
All committees have written terms of reference which are reviewed on an annual basis and were last updated on 12 December 2005.
The terms of reference can be found on the companys website or are available on request from the Company Secretary, who is secretary to all the committees.
In addition, the group has detailed corporate policies which set out authority levels within the group.
Subsidiary companies are required to report on compliance with policies on an annual basis and have done so in respect of compliance in 2005.
Meetings 2.9 The board normally meets seven times a year, including an annual planning conference.
A pack of board papers including a detailed agenda is sent to each director in the week before the board meeting so that he has sufficient time to review them.
A detailed paper is provided on any issue where the board is to be asked to make a decision.
All directors are, therefore, able to bring independent judgement to bear on issues such as strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct.
Additional meetings are called when required and there is frequent contact between meetings, where necessary, to progress the companys business.
In 2005, the Chairman met with the non-executive directors without any executive director present.
The non-executive directors met without the Chairman present to discuss the Chairmans performance and the senior independent director was responsible for discussing this with the Chairman.

The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the board.
The Company Secretary is secretary to all the board committees.
Independent advice 2.11 There is a formal procedure by which any director may take independent professional advice relating to the performance of his duties at the companys expense.
This was last reviewed and updated by the board in 2004.
Re-election of directors 2.12 Under the companys articles of association, one third of the directors is obliged to retire each year and each director must offer himself for re-election every three years.
After nine years, a director must offer himself for re-election annually.
A director who is initially appointed by the board is subject to election at the AGM following his appointment.
In 2005, biographical details of the directors submitted for re-election at the AGM were supplied to shareholders in the circular dated 18 April 2005.
Policy on other board appointments 2.13 In December 2004, the board updated its policy on other directorships.
This applies to the Chairman and executive directors, and to non-executive directors who are appointed or whose term of office is extended after 1 January 2005.
The policy is set out in paragraphs 2.13.1 to 2.13.3 below.
2.13.1 As was previously the case and as specified in the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors, any proposed appointment to the board of another company will require the prior approval of the board.
2.13.2 An executive director will be permitted to hold one non-executive directorship and to retain the fees from that appointment provided that the board considers that this will not adversely affect his executive responsibilities.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the board would not permit an executive director to take on the chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company.
2.13.3 The companys policy is that a non-executive director should have sufficient time to fulfil his duty as such, including chairing a committee.
The board will consider all requests for permission for other directorships carefully, having regard to the following principles.
A non-executive director would not be expected to hold more than four other material non-executive directorships.
If he holds an executive role in another FTSE 350 company, he would not be expected to hold more than two material non-executive directorships.
Only one FTSE 100 company, or two FTSE 350 companies, should be chaired at any given time.
Performance evaluation 2.14 In December 2005, the board completed the third evaluation of its performance and that of its committees and individual directors.
The Chairman was primarily responsible for this evaluation and submitted a questionnaire to all directors.
This contained questions on different aspects of the operation of the board and its committees and the performance of individual directors.
The senior independent director was responsible for collating comments on the Chairmans performance.
The Chairman appraised the Chief Executive and the Chief Executive appraised the other executive directors.
A summary of the evaluation was presented to the board on 12 December 2005, which included detailed comments made by directors.
The board considered the results of the evaluation and proposals to take account of these were agreed.
Training 2.15 Appropriate training and briefing is provided to all directors on appointment to the board, taking into account their individual qualifications and experience.
Ongoing training is arranged to suit their individual needs including social, environmental and ethical training as appropriate and the Company Secretary, reporting to the Chairman, is responsible for identifying appropriate training courses for directors.
An annual update session is arranged for the board.
3 Report on the audit committee 3.1 Throughout 2005, this committee consisted of John Maxwell and Ray Miles under the chairmanship of Graham Pimlott.
3.2 The committee met five times in 2005.
3.3 The committee makes recommendations to the board, for the board to put to shareholders in general meeting, in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the auditors and approves their remuneration and terms of engagement.
It reviews and monitors the independence and objectivity of the auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements.
It develops and implements policy on the engagement of the auditors to supply non-audit services and reports to the board identifying any matters in respect of which it considers that action or improvement is needed and makes recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
It monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the company and the formal announcements relating to the companys financial performance, reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained in them.
It also reviews the groups whistleblowing policy.
Provident Financial Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 53 58.22 PF DirectorsR P9 DW 24 3 06 11:36 am Page 54 Corporate governance report continued 3 Report on the audit committee continued 3.4 The groups internal audit function is provided by Ernst & Young LLP.
The committee formally agrees the internal audit plan once a year and reviews regular reports on the activity of the internal audit function.
As the internal audit function reports to the committee, this helps to ensure the functions independence from group management and ensures that appropriate action is taken in response to audit findings.
3.5 Meetings are attended by both the internal and external auditors as required and by the Finance Director and the director of group accounting.
Other directors and senior management attend only at the invitation of the committee.
At least twice a year the members of the committee meet with the external and internal auditors without an executive director or member of the companys senior management being present.
3.6 At its March and September meetings the committee had a separate session with the groups auditors  LLP PwC without any executive director or employee of the company or group being present.
This gave members of the committee the opportunity to raise any issues on the final or interim results of the group directly with PwC.
3.7 The committee is conscious of the need to ensure that the auditors are, and are perceived to be, independent and its work relating to this is summarised in paragraphs 3.8 to 3.12 below.
3.8 PwC provide the committee with a letter of independence, which is regularly updated and considered by the committee.
3.9 In 2004, the committee adopted a policy on the appointment of staff from the auditors to positions within the various group finance departments.
It grades appointments into four categories and sets out the approvals required.
Neither a partner of the audit firm who has acted as engagement partner, the quality review partner, other key audit partners or partners in the chain of command, nor a senior member of the audit engagement team, may be employed as group Finance Director or director of group accounting.
3.10 A formal policy on the use of auditors for non-audit work was adopted by the company in 2003.
This policy is formally reviewed once a year.
3.11 The main elements of the policy are as follows.
The award of non-audit work to the auditors is managed in order to ensure that the auditors are able to conduct an independent audit and are perceived to be independent by the groups shareholders and stakeholders.
The performance of non-audit work by the groups auditors should be minimised and work should be awarded only when, by virtue of their knowledge, skills or experience, the auditors are clearly to be preferred over alternative suppliers.
The group should maintain an active relationship with at least two other professional accounting advisers.
The nature and cost of all non-audit work awarded to the groups external auditors for the period since the last meeting and for the year to date will be reported to each meeting of the audit committee, together with an explanation as to why the auditors were the preferred supplier.
No information technology, remuneration, recruitment, valuation or general consultancy work may be awarded to the auditors without the prior approval of the Chairman of the audit committee, such approval to be given only in exceptional circumstances.
The Chairman of the audit committee must approve in advance any single award of non-audit work with an aggregate cost of 250,000 or more.
The auditors may not perform internal audit work.
3.12 In 2005, the committee regularly considered a schedule of non-audit work carried out by PwC.
Work carried out by PwC for the group in 2005 fell broadly into three categories: statutory audit and related services: assurance services including work in connection with regulatory compliance and tax services, comprising compliance and general tax advice.
Fees paid to PwC in 2005 are shown below: 2005 2004 000 000 Statutory audit 569 481 Audit services Audit-related regulatory reporting 82 38 Further assurance services 358 162 Tax services Compliance services 26 232 Advisory services 197 470 Other services 28 56 Total 1,260 1,439 3.13 The committee has formally considered its effectiveness in 2005.
The overall view was that the committee was working effectively.
The committee also discussed the issue of training for its members.
