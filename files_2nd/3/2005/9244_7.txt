The Board The responsibilities and objectives of the Board The Board is appointed by the shareholders who are the owners of the Company.
The Boards principal responsibility is to act in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole within the legal framework of the Companies Act 1985.
The Board establishes the aims and objectives for the Company, approves the strategic direction and plans and the operating budgets proposed by the Chief Executive, and monitors performance against them.

The composition of the Board The composition of the Board is outlined on pages 16 and 17.
The Board comprises an appropriate mix of executive and non-executive directors and is of a size and includes the skills and experience appropriate for the requirements of the business.

Mr McDowall is the senior independent non-executive director, having taken over from Mr Morton who retired on 13 May 2005 at the Annual General Meeting.

All the non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent.

The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available from the Company on request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
At the Annual General Meeting every year at least one third of the directors retire from office.
Such rotation of directors ensures that directors submit themselves for re-election regularly, and at least every three years.

22 The Laird Group PLC Internal control The Laird Group PLC is a holding company registered in the UK with businesses located overseas as well as in the UK.
These activities are organised as subsidiary companies where the directors and managers of these companies are appointed to manage within the framework established by The Laird Group Board, as well as complying with local statutory and regulatory requirements.
Overall responsibility for the Groups systems of internal control and reviewing their effectiveness lies with The Laird Group Board.
Primary responsibility for systems of internal control rests with the directors of the subsidiaries.
The Groups executive directors are responsible for implementing Group policy and for monitoring the businesses and performance of subsidiary companies and reporting to the Board thereon.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group is in place and complies with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control and is regularly reviewed by the Board.
This process has been in place for the full financial year and up to the date the accounts were approved by the Board.
Acquisitions during that period were subject to due diligence prior to their purchase and are required to adopt the Groups procedures thereafter.
The systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives as well as safeguarding the Groups assets.
These systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Group operating rules are issued each year to the directors of subsidiary companies setting out their responsibilities and the procedures to be followed to agree their commercial and financial objectives.
These rules require approval for specific transactions and call for accurate and relevant financial information to be delivered on a timely basis.
The ability to identify risk is enhanced by the timely reporting of management information and the short lines of communication with operating managers.
Subsidiaries submit their budgets annually to the Groups executive directors.
As part of this process they are required to identify the key risks and opportunities that their businesses face and set out the strategies they will employ to manage the risks and exploit the opportunities.
The issues raised by the subsidiaries are reviewed by the Board.
This process is supplemented by papers submitted to the Board by the executive directors throughout the year and by meetings from time to time between the Board and the management of the subsidiaries, some of which take place at the premises of the operating companies.
The Chief Executive presents the Groups business objectives which are approved by the Board, and the Board also addresses those risks which affect The Laird Group as a whole.
The Board instigates further reports and investigations as it considers necessary.
The Laird Risk Management Group RMG, chaired by an executive director, currently Mr Drabble, and with members drawn from the Groups businesses, examines all aspects of operational risk within the Group.
The RMG, which met four times during the year, reports to the Board.
The principal objectives of the RMG are to identify potential risks, physical exposure and business interruption issues associated with each operating companys business and their wider implications for the Group as a whole: to review business continuity planning and emergency response procedures: to develop contingency plans and to oversee the implementation of remedial actions where appropriate: and to continue to develop and ensure the implementation of best risk management practice throughout the Group and review the results of comprehensive self-assessment control reviews by subsidiary management.
The RMG also oversees Health, Safety and Environmental issues using external advisers to assist where appropriate.
Further details on the RMG are set out in the Corporate social responsibility report on pages 24 and 25.
The Audit Committee reviews The Laird Group PLCs financial statements.
It also has responsibility for reviewing the internal financial controls and considers the scope and planning of internal and external audits.
It reviews reports on internal financial control including reports by the Finance Director and the results from internal financial audits.
As part of their audit, the external auditors, to the extent they consider necessary to support their audit opinion, review and test the systems of internal control and the data contained in the accounts, including an independent and objective review of the approach of management to the reporting of the operating results and financial condition.
The auditors have confirmed that, in their opinion, the UK subsidiaries are complying with the Companies Act 1985 requirement to keep proper books and records.
