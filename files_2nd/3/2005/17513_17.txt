Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 91 Corporate Governance Report Introduction The Board is committed to the principle of best practice in corporate governance.
This report addresses the status of the Companys compliance with the principles and provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued on 23 July 2003 the Code, details the key policies, processes and structures that apply within the Group to comply with the Code.
Statement by the Directors on corporate governance policies and compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code The Code establishes 14 main principles of good governance, 21 supporting principles and 48 provisions.
The Listing Rules require every listed company to report on how it applies the principles in the Code, and to confirm that it complies with the Codes provisions or, where it does not, to provide an explanation.
During the year ended 31 December 2005, the Company complied with the best practice governance provisions as set out in Section 1 of the Code, except, as explained below, with regard to membership of the Remuneration Committee as the Chairman of the Committee is not considered independent and save that no individual member of the Audit Committee has been identified as having recent and relevant financial experience.
1 The Board The first main principle requires the Company to have an effective Board which is collectively responsible for its success.
Supporting principles describe the Boards role to provide entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of controls that allow risk to be assessed and managed.
The Board should set strategic aims and the Companys values, ensuring that obligations to shareholders are met.
Non-executive directors have a particular role in overseeing the development of strategy, scrutinising management performance and ensuring the integrity of financial information and systems of risk management.
The Board is satisfied that it has met these requirements.
There were no changes to the membership of the Board during the year.
The Board, chaired by Willy Strothotte, has twelve directors, comprising three executive directors and nine non-executive directors.
The three executive directors are Mick Davis, the Chief Executive, Trevor Reid, Chief Financial officer, and Santiago Zaldumbide, Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc.
David Rough, an independent, non-executive director is the Deputy Chairman.
The non-executive directors possess a range of experience and are of sufficiently high calibre to bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, and resources that are vital to the success of the Group.
The Board is responsible for the governance of the Group on behalf of shareholders within a framework of policies and controls which provide for effective risk assessment and management.
The Board provides leadership and articulates the Companys objectives and strategy for achieving those objectives.
The Board sets standards of conduct, as documented in an approved Statement of Business Principles, which provide an ethical framework for all Xstrata businesses.
While the Board focuses on strategic issues, financial performance, risk management and critical business issues, it also has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision.
These reserved matters which are documented in a comprehensive regime of authorisation levels and prior approval requirements for key corporate decisions and actions are reviewed and updated annually by the Board.
Such matters reserved to the Board include, but are not limited to, approval of budgets and business plans, major capital expenditure, major acquisitions and disposals, and other key commitments.
Certain powers are delegated by the Board to an Executive Committee which is a Committee of the Board of Xstrata Schweiz AG, the main trading subsidiary of Xstrata plc.
This Committee and a description of its powers are described on page 101.
92| Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Corporate Governance Report The Company has a policy based on the Model Code published in the Listing Rules, which covers dealings in securities and applies to directors, persons discharging managerial responsibilities, and employee insiders.
Five scheduled Board meetings were held during the year and two additional meetings were held.
Attendance by directors at Board meetings and committee meetings is shown below.
The Chairman held separate meetings with the non-executive directors several times a year following the full Board meetings without the executive directors being present.
All Board meetings are held in Switzerland.
Attendance at Board meetings and Committees of the Board There are four formally constituted committees of the Board, each of which has formal terms of reference.
These can be seen on the Company website.

2 Chairman and Chief Executive Another main principle states that there should be a clear division of responsibilities between the running of the Board and executive responsibility for running the business, so that no one person should have unfettered powers of decision.
A clear separation is maintained between the responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
This is documented in a statement approved by the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board and creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director effectiveness while the Chief Executive is responsible for overall performance of the Group including the responsibility for arranging the effective day to day management controls over the running of the Group.
3 Board balance and independence The Company complies with the requirement of the Code that there should be a balance of executive and non-executive directors, such that no individual or small group can dominate the Boards decision taking.
Of the nine non-executive directors, six are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement and three, Willy Strothotte and Ivan Glasenberg are directors of Glencore International AG Glencore.
Willy Strothotte is Chairman, Ivan Glasenberg is Chief Executive Officer and David Issroff is Head of the Ferroalloys Division, of Glencore.
The Board has considered these associations and considers the industry expertise and experience of these directors beneficial to the Group.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 93 David Rough is the Deputy Chairman and the Senior Independent Director.
His role and responsibilities as the Senior Independent Director are detailed in and formalised by Board resolution and, in summary, are that he should be available to shareholders to discuss their concerns where the normal channels would not be appropriate for this purpose, to have contact with analysts and major shareholders to obtain a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns, to chair the Nomination Committee and to lead the Board and director appraisal process.
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are fully considered.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all directors receive appropriate and timely information and briefing papers are distributed to all directors.
The Board reviews annually the composition and chairmanship of its standing committees, namely the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and the Health, Safety, Environment & Community Committee.
4 Appointments to the Board The Code requires there to be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which should be made on merit and against objective criteria.
The Nomination Committee fulfils these requirements and its report is set out on page 100.
5 Information and professional development Another main principle requires that information of appropriate quality is supplied to the Board in a timely manner and that, in addition to induction programmes on joining the Company, directors should regularly update their skills and knowledge.
All directors are made aware that they may take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company in the furtherance of their duties.
All directors had access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that all governance matters are complied with and assists with professional development as required.
Arrangements have been approved by the Board to ensure that new directors should receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board.
In addition ongoing support and resources are provided to directors in order to enable them to extend and refresh their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company.
Professional development and training is provided in three complementary ways: regular updating with information on changes and proposed changes in laws and regulations affecting the Group or its businesses: arrangements, including site visits, to ensure directors are familiar with the Groups operations: and, opportunities for professional and skills training.
6 Performance evaluation In accordance with the Code requirement, the Board undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and of its individual directors including the Chairman.
The process was led by the Senior Independent Director.
The evaluation of individual director performance was also employed to identify individual director training requirements.
7 Re-election of directors Under the Code, directors should offer themselves for re-election at regular intervals and there should be a planned and progressive refreshing of the Board.
94| Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Corporate Governance Report One third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each annual general meeting and any director who, at the start of an annual general meeting, has been in office for more than three years since his election must retire.
Retiring directors may offer themselves for re-election.
A succession plan was approved by the Board during the year to ensure there was a balance of skills and experience on the Board and to plan for an orderly refreshing of Board membership.
It is proposed that Messrs Glasenberg, MacDonnell, Roux and Zaldumbide will retire and will offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2006.
Following an appraisal of the non-executive directors, the Board was satisfied that each directors performance continues to be effective and that each director continues to demonstrate commitment to the role, and recommended the re-election of the four directors.
B. Remuneration Remuneration is covered in the Remuneration Report on pages 102 to 115 and, with regard to the Remuneration Committee, on pages 99 and 100.
C. Accountability and Audit C. 1 Financial Reporting The Board is required to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Companys position and prospects.
This responsibility extends to annual and interim reports and other price-sensitive reports and reports to regulators as well as to information required to be presented by statutory requirements.
The Board is mindful of its responsibility to present a balanced and clear assessment of the Companys position and prospects and the Board is satisfied that it has met this obligation.
This assessment is primarily provided in the Chairmans Statement, the Chief Executives Report, and the Operating and Financial Review contained in this Report.
The Statement of Directors Responsibilities in respect of the Financial Statements are set out on page 1 and 121 of the Financial Statements 2005 report.
C. 2 Internal Control The Code requires the Company to maintain a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the Companys assets.
The Board must review, at least annually, the effectiveness of the internal control system and report to shareholders that they have done so.
The review should cover all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
Internal Control The Board of Directors is responsible for the Groups system of internal control.
An ongoing process, in accordance with the Guidance of the Turnbull Committee on Internal Control, has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
This process has been in place throughout the year under review up to the date of approval of the annual report and financial statements.
The Board relies on reviews undertaken by the Audit Committee supported by the Business Unit Audit Committees in relation to the Groups compliance with the Turnbull Guidance throughout the year.
The Audit Committee reviews the process by which risks are identified and assessed and the effectiveness of the system of internal control by considering the regular reports from management on key risks, mitigating actions and internal controls, management representations and assertions and the reports on risk management and internal control from Internal Audit, the external auditors and other assurance providers such as Health Safety and Environmental Management.
The principal aim of the system of internal control is the management of business risks that are significant to the fulfilment of the Groups business objectives with a view to enhancing over time the value of the shareholders investment and safeguarding the assets.
The internal control systems have been designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 95 Control environment The key elements and procedures that have been established to provide an effective system of internal control are as follows: i Organisational Structure There is a well-defined organisational structure with clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority.
The way the Group conducts its business, expectations of management and key accountabilities are embodied in the Groups policies, its Statement of Business Principles and Board Level Authority Limits.
ii Risk Identification and Evaluation The Board considers effective risk management as essential to the achievement of the Groups objectives and has implemented a structured and comprehensive system across the Group.
The Group Risk Management Policy is published on the Xstrata website at www.
com as part of the Governance section.
iii Information and Financial Reporting Systems Financial reporting to the Executive Committee and the Board is continuously modified and enhanced to cater for changing circumstances.
The Groups comprehensive planning and financial reporting procedures include detailed operational budgets for the year ahead and a three-year rolling plan.
The Board reviews and approves the annual budget and plan.
Plans and budgets are prepared on the basis of consistent economic assumptions determined by the Group Finance function.
Performance is monitored and relevant action taken throughout the year through the monthly reporting of key performance indicators, updated forecasts for the year together with information on the key risk areas.
In addition, comprehensive monthly management reports on a divisional and consolidated basis, including updated forecasts for the year, are prepared and presented to the Executive Committee by the Group Controller and form a cornerstone of the system of internal control.
Detailed consolidated management accounts, together with an executive summary from the Chief Executive, are circulated to all Directors on a monthly basis.
iv Investment Appraisal A budgetary process and authorisation levels regulate capital expenditure.
For expenditure beyond specified levels, detailed written proposals are submitted to the Executive Committee in accordance with Board delegated authority limits.
There is a standardised approval procedure for investment appraisal which includes a detailed calculation of return on equity.
Economic assumptions are consistent with those included in management reports and budgets and are agreed with Group Finance.
Reviews are carried out after the project is complete, and for some projects, during the construction period, to monitor progress against plan: major overruns are investigated.
Commercial, legal and financial due diligence work, using outside consultants, is undertaken in respect of acquisitions as appropriate.
v Treasury Committee A Treasury Committee operates as a sub-committee of the Executive Committee.
Its membership consists of the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Treasurer and Group Controller.
All meetings are held outside the UK.
The Committee recommends group policy, which is agreed by the Board, relating to all aspects of funding, management of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and it co-ordinates relationships with banks, rating agencies and other financial institutions.
The Committee monitors all significant treasury activities undertaken by group companies and ensures compliance with group policy.
A monthly report details the Group cash debt position, review of bank covenants, exposures and hedging and is circulated to the Executive Committee.
96| Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Corporate Governance Report vi Internal Audit Internal Audit is an important element of the overall process by which the Executive Committee and the Board obtains the assurance it requires that risks are being properly identified, managed and controlled.
Risk-based internal audit plans, prepared on an annual basis, are approved by the Audit Committee, and timely reports on achievement of the plans and findings are presented to the Audit Committee.
Internal Audit completed a full programme of work in 2005, covering the Business Units and Head Office, focusing in particular on the more significant risks and related internal controls identified in the risk self-assessment process.
Findings and agreed actions were reported to management and the Audit Committee.
The Group-wide internal audit function is supplemented by services provided as required by KPMG LLP as an outsourced service provider.
vii Fraud Management There is a formal Group policy relating to fraud management, including reporting and investigation arrangements and, in line with best practice, this includes whistleblowing procedures.
There are independently operated confidential hotlines in each country in which the Group operates, through which employees or contractors can report any breach of Xstratas Business Principles, including fraud.
The contact details are published in the Statement of Business Principles which can be found on the Xstrata website.
All incidents reported are fully investigated and the results are reported to the Audit Committee.
C. 3 Audit Committee and Auditors A principle of the Code is that the Board should establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply the financial reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
These responsibilities are delegated to and are discharged by the Audit Committee whose work is described on pages 97 to 99.
D. Relations with shareholders D. 1 Dialogue with shareholders The Company is required to have a dialogue with shareholders, based on the mutual understanding of objectives, and it is the responsibility of the Board as a whole to ensure that a satisfactory dialogue does take place.
While the Code recognises that most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, the Chairman and the senior independent director, and other directors as appropriate, should maintain contact with major shareholders in order to understand their issues and concerns.
The Board places considerable importance on effective communication with shareholders.
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, assisted by the Executive General Manager of Corporate Affairs, maintain regular dialogue with and give briefings throughout the year to analysts and institutional investors and are involved in a structured programme of investor, analyst and media site visits.
Presentations are given by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer after the Companys preliminary announcements of the year-end results and at the half year.
Care is taken to ensure that any price-sensitive information is released to all shareholders, institutional and private, at the same time in accordance with London and Swiss Stock Exchange requirements.
Members of the Remuneration Committee had meetings with major institutional investors to explain the background and purpose of the decision to devise an Added Value Incentive Plan for the Chief Executive, before recommending adoption of the Plan at the May 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The Senior Independent Director was available to shareholders for any concern which contact with the Group Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer failed to resolve or for which such contact was inappropriate.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 97 All shareholders can obtain access to the annual report and accounts and other current information about the Company through the Companys website at www.
The Operating and Financial Review on pages 14 to 78 include a detailed report on the business and future developments.
D. 2 Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting AGM All directors normally attend the Companys Annual General Meeting and shareholders are invited to ask questions during the meeting and to meet directors after the formal proceedings have ended.
Shareholders at the meeting are advised as to the level of proxy votes received including percentages for and against and the abstentions in respect of each resolution following each vote on a show of hands.
At the time of the listing in March 2002, shareholders in the old Xstrata AG were informed that the Company would offer shareholders the opportunity to attend general meetings in Switzerland where the head office resides, even though the Company was incorporated and has its registered office in England.
Given this history and the number of shares still held in or through Switzerland, the Board continues to consider it is appropriate for the Annual General Meeting, to be held in Zug, Switzerland and for a satellite meeting to be held concurrently in London.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with institutional and private investors and welcomes their participation.
At the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2005, the Chairman and the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and HSEC Committees were present to answer questions.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2006 can be found in the notice of the meeting.
Board Committees The terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations and HSEC Committees are available on the Company website.
Audit Committee The Audit Committee assists the Companys board of directors in discharging its responsibilities with regard to financial reporting, external and internal audits and controls, including reviewing the annual financial statements, considering the scope of the Companys annual external audit and the extent of non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, approving the internal audit programme, advising on the appointment of external auditors and reviewing the effectiveness of the Companys internal control systems.
The Combined Code recommends that all members of the Audit Committee should be non-executive directors, all of whom are independent in character and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement and that at least one member should have recent and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee comprises four independent non-executive directors.
Sir Steve Robson Chairman of the Committee, David Rough, Fred Roux and Ian Strachan.
The Board considered membership of the Committee during the year and declared its satisfaction that the members of the Committee collectively have sufficient recent and relevant financial experience to discharge its role and responsibilities.
The Board therefore considers that it complies with Combined Code recommendations regarding the composition of the Audit Committee.
The Committee met four times in the year.
Four meetings are scheduled for 2006.
The Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Controller, a representative of the Companys external auditors and the Head of Internal Audit normally attend the meetings.
Other directors of the Company and senior management may also, on invitation by the Committee, attend and speak, but not vote at any meeting of the Committee.
As an outcome of an evaluation of the Audit Committees performance, the Committee decided it would be helpful to invite the Chairmen of the Business Unit Audit Committees and the Chief Executives of the Business Units to attend the Audit Committee meetings on a rotational basis in order to further enhance communication and best practice.
98| Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Corporate Governance Report During the year, the Committee reviewed for submission to the Board, the 2004 annual financial statements, the 2005 interim and, in February 2006, the 2005 annual financial statements and reviewed the external auditors detailed reports thereon.
The 2005 interim and annual financial statements have been prepared for the first time in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards: reviewed the appropriateness of the Groups accounting policies: regularly reviewed the potential impact on the Groups financial statements of a range of matters which involve significant judgement, estimation or uncertainty, and the possible impairment of fixed asset values: reviewed the external auditors plan and scope for the audit of the Group accounts, and approved their remuneration both for audit and non-audit work, and their terms of engagement.
The Committee carefully monitored the nature, range and cost of non-audit services provided by the external auditors particularly in relation to the annual cost of audit fees.
It also concluded that the $100,000 limit for individual non-audit assignments above which prior approval of the Audit Committee was required, is set at an appropriate level: recommended to the Board the re-appointment of the external auditors following an evaluation of their effectiveness and confirmation of auditor objectivity and independence: undertook a review of related party transactions with particular focus on those transactions with Glencore.
The Committee found that transactions with Glencore are at competitive market rates and are deemed to be commercial arms length transactions.
The arrangements with Glencore are seen to be to the commercial advantage of Xstrata: examined the effectiveness of the Companys risk management system including its risk management process and profile and the Companys internal control systems and operations which were examined and tested by the internal auditors.
It also received a report on internal network security: reviewed the structure and limits of Group insurance policies and these were considered to be appropriate: reviewed and approved the Internal Audit plans for 2005, the effectiveness of the internal audit function and, at each meeting, reviewed the reports on findings and on progress against recommendations: monitored the controls which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported to the shareholders: reviewed procurement policies and procedures to ensure they were based on common standards and applied across the Business Units: received quarterly reports on the status of its tax residency: evaluated the performance of the Committee: received a report on succession planning for senior financial and accounting personnel: and reviewed the whistleblowing arrangements within the Group.
Following each Committee meeting, separate meetings were held by the Committee with the external auditors in the absence of executive management, with executive management in the absence of the external auditors and with the internal auditor in the absence of executive management and the external auditors.
The Group has a specific policy governing the conduct of non-audit work by the external auditors which ensures that the Company is in compliance with the requirements of the Combined Code and the Ethical Standards for Auditors published by the Auditing Practices Board.
Under that policy the external auditors are prohibited from performing services which: result in the auditing of their own work: result in the auditors participating in activities normally undertaken by management: puts the auditor in the role of advocate for the Group: or create a mutuality of interest between the auditors and the Group.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 99 The auditors are permitted to provide non-audit services that are not in conflict with auditor independence.
Six-monthly reports are made to the Audit Committee detailing non-audit fees paid to both the external and internal auditors.
However, prior approval of the Committee is required for each specific service provided by the external auditors.
A range of non-audit services have been preapproved in principle by the Audit Committee, however, where the fee is likely to be in excess of $100,000 for such services, specific re-approval is required, while prior approval of the Chief Financial Officer is required for those pre-approved services where the fee is likely to be less than $100,000.
The Audit Committee is supported and assisted in its work by separate Audit Committees for each Commodity Business Unit in line with the decentralised commodity business unit model.
The Business Unit Audit Committees are independent of the executive management of the Business Unit and are chaired by suitably qualified individuals independent of Xstrata.
The terms of reference of these Committees follow those of the Companys Audit Committee.
Meeting dates precede those of the Companys Audit Committee and minutes of their meetings are circulated to the Companys Audit Committee.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Willy Strothotte.
As Chairman of the Company and Chairman of Glencore, he is not considered to be an independent director.
The Board regards Willy Strothottes membership as critical to the work of the Committee due to his extensive knowledge and experience of the global mining resources sector.
David Rough and Paul Hazen, the other members of the Committee, are both non-executive directors and independent.
The Committee met three times during the year.
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but does not participate at a meeting of the Committee or during the relevant part at which any part of his remuneration is being discussed or participate in any recommendation or decision concerning his remuneration.
The principal roles of the Committee are i to consider and determine all elements of the remuneration of the Chief Executive, and Chief Financial Officer and of the Heads of the major operating subsidiaries or business units of the Company the Executive Group as defined by the Chief Executive and ii to determine targets for any performance-related remuneration schemes operated by the Company.
During the year, the Committee: devised an Added Value Incentive Plan in collaboration with the Hay Group, an independent remuneration consultancy, to incentivise the Chief Executive by providing a share of the long term value created for shareholders and to create alignment with shareholders by means of ownership.
This plan was recommended by the Committee to, and subsequently approved by, the Board and by the Shareholders: agreed amendments to the Annual Bonus Plan for key executives which introduce a broader range of bonus performance conditions including health and safety.
The amendments also enable up to 300% of salary to be paid as a bonus for outstanding performance but subject to the condition that the first 100% of salary is paid in cash, the next 100% is paid in shares but restricted for one year and the next 100% is paid in shares but restricted for two years: agreed amendments to the Deferred Bonus Plan to reflect that dividends will accrue on all deferred bonus shares, but will only be paid on vesting: determined the remuneration for the executive directors and reviewed the remuneration arrangements proposed for the members of the Executive Committee: determined the vesting percentage applicable to awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2002 which vested in May 2005 received independent advice on benchmarking and best practice.
100 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Corporate Governance Report The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee conform precisely to the Code.
The setting of non-executive directors remuneration was decided by the Board as a whole.
Details of the Companys remuneration for executive directors, benefits, share options, pensions entitlements, service contracts and compensation payments are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 102 to 115.
A resolution to approve the Remuneration Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Nominations Committee The Nominations Committee comprises three non-executive directors of which two are independent.
It is chaired by David Rough.
The terms of reference provide for a formal and transparent procedure.
The Committee has responsibility to identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for Board vacancies and to make recommendations on Board composition and balance.
Three meetings were held in 2005.
During the year, the Committee: reviewed the plan for the retirement by rotation and re-election of directors and the framework for board succession planning to ensure continuity.
This is designed to take in account matters such as the size of the Company, product diversity and geographical spread, as well as maintaining a balance to the Board in relation to independent non-independent members, their skills and experience: continued its search, initiated at the end of 2004, for a non-executive director based in Australia with a mining background.
Ultimately, and perhaps due to the nature of the market, the search for a non-conflicted mining candidate was unsuccessful: subsequently initiated and continues a new search, in collaboration with an external search consultancy, for a non-executive director with broad international experience: approved arrangements for the annual appraisal of the Board and directors performance.
This was carried out by means of a questionnaire to all directors inviting comments on general and specific aspects of board and director performance and commitment.
Results were reported to the Board by the Senior Independent Director.
Health, Safety, Environment & Community Committee The Board established the Board Health, Safety, Environment & Community HSEC Committee on 24 February 2005 to assist the Board to fulfil its HSEC role and obligations across the global business and provide additional focus and guidance on key HSEC issues.
The Committee comprises Ian Strachan, who chairs the Committee, Mick Davis, David Rough and Fred Roux.
Paul Jones General Manager HSE is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met four times in the year and there was an informal meeting of the members of the Committee in South Africa with operational site visits.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 101 During the year the Committee: appointed Professor Jim Joy as OH&S Adviser to the Committee: monitored and evaluated reports on the implementation and effectiveness of HSEC Policy, HSEC Management Standards, HSEC Strategy and HSEC Governance: monitored and evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of the HSEC assurance and verification programme: monitored and evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of the Coal, Alloys and Copper Commodity Businesses HSEC strategies and plans: monitored and evaluated reports on high potential HSEC incidents and the results of investigations into critical HSEC incidents: reviewed a report from the independent verifiers, URS, on the 2004 Sustainability Report: and monitored and evaluated new developments, issues and or relevant legislation on HSEC matters.
