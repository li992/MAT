The contents of this report are intended to address the subjects required under the Code, as well as providing a description of the Companys governance environment in general terms.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Company is an investment trust managed by its Board of Directors the Board currently comprising ten Directors, two of whom are executive Directors, three of whom are non-independent non-executive Directors and the remaining five are independent nonexecutive Directors as determined by the Board.

In general terms, the executive management of the Company is responsible for the implementation and execution of the Boards strategic directives relating to investment management, the Companys governance and administration.

There are four permanent committees, the composition of which is set out on page 14.
Each such permanent committee has its own Terms of Reference which may be viewed on the Companys website.
The permanent committees are as follows: The Audit Committee The Audit Committee is comprised of four non-executive Directors, all of whom are independent of the Company.
It is chaired by Charles Bailey, a former Senior Partner of Price Waterhouse, a member of the audit committees of three other public companies, and who the Board considers has appropriate financial experience.
The Committee meets at least twice each year to review the Companys interim and annual accounts, to consider reports thereon from the external audit process and to review any issues arising with the Companys management.
It may meet on additional occasions should the need arise.
The Committee also monitors the adequacy of the Groups accounting policies and financial reporting, which are discussed with the external auditors.
The Audit Committee also considers the external auditors independence, objectivity and the cost effectiveness of the audit process.
The Committee monitored the level of non-audit services provided to the Company by the auditors, assessing their objectivity in providing such services and ensuring that the independence of the audit team from the Company was not compromised.
Non-audit services provided by  LLP in the year ended 31 March 2005 were primarily in relation to accounting services and reporting on related party matters.

The remaining matters in the Audit Committees Terms of Reference are considered as and when necessary.

This exercise is conducted in part by reference to other companies of similar size and business objectives.

RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Corporate Governance Report 23 CHAIRMAN WITH EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES Lord Rothschild is both Chairman of the Board and an executive Director.
The Board recognises that this is at variance with the recommendations of the Code, which are concerned with the potential problems of combining the running of the Board with the executive responsibility for the running of the Company.
The Board believes that the current arrangements are appropriate for a self-managed investment trust and are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders on an ongoing basis.
The Company has in place a structure of permanent board committees, described above, designed to devolve responsibility and control of certain key areas of Board responsibility away from the Chairman.
The Audit, Remuneration and Conflicts and Valuation Committees are each comprised entirely of independent non-executive Directors.
Whilst the Nominations Committee is chaired by Lord Rothschild, independent non-executive Directors represent a majority of its number.
The Board is therefore of the view that the Company is not at risk from a concentration of power caused by the Chairman having executive responsibilities and believes that Lord Rothschild is well qualified for both roles.
As Chairman, Lord Rothschild is responsible for the leadership of the Board and its effectiveness in dealing with the matters reserved for its decision.
This includes ensuring that Directors are properly briefed on issues arising at board meetings.
He is also responsible for ensuring effective communication with shareholders and for facilitating the full and effective contribution of the non-executive Directors.
BOARD BALANCE AND INDEPENDENCE As described above, the Board is comprised of ten Directors of whom two are executive, three are non-executive but not independent and five are non-executive and determined by the Board as independent.
This balance is intended to limit the scope for an individual or small group of individuals to dominate the Boards decision-making.
More than half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, is therefore comprised of non-executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent.
The size and composition of the Board is considered to be suitable for the Companys size and business, whilst not being so large as to be unwieldy.
Of the five non-executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent, two do not meet one of the seven independence criteria set out in the Code, in that they have served on the Board more than nine years since the date of their first election.
Both Mr Bailey and Baron Lambert, the long serving Directors concerned, bring relevant experience and knowledge to the Board without which its effectiveness would be reduced.
The Board believes that an in-depth knowledge of the Companys business derived from long service is an advantage, particularly in the circumstances of a selfmanaged investment trust and recommends the re-election of Mr Bailey and Baron Lambert at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD The Nominations Committee is responsible for the process of appointment of new directors to the Board.
The Board, through the Nominations Committee, recognises the need to consider, on an ongoing basis, the appointment of new directors to bring fresh impetus and objectivity.
Such appointments will be made on merit and ability to devote such time as is necessary to the position.
The Committee will also be mindful of succession planning and board balance when recommending future appointments to the Board.
Neither open advertising nor external search consultancies were used in respect of the non-executive director appointments made during the year, as the Board and Nominations Committee identify and assess candidates on the basis of their potential contribution to the Company.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 24 Corporate Governance Report Appropriate training on listed company governance and on the Company is provided to new directors on their first appointment.
INFORMATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information through the Company Secretary, J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
This is effected through regular oral and written communication as well as in the papers provided for each of the Companys scheduled board meetings.
Such communication is intended to update Directors knowledge and familiarity with the Company and its business, to enable them to fulfil their respective roles on the Board or its committees.
The Directors have access to the Company Secretary for advice and services.
The Chairman, the Nominations Committee and the Company Secretary have formulated a full, formal and tailored induction process for new directors on their joining the Board.
All Directors are entitled to take independent professional advice, including legal advice, at the Companys expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors, up to a maximum of 25,000 per annum.
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable rules and regulations are complied with and for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on corporate governance matters.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION The Code requires the Company to report on the means by which performance evaluation of the Board, its committees and its individual Directors has been conducted.
Following the consideration of various alternatives the Board determined that the completion of a confidential questionnaire by each of the Directors covering the processes, efficiency and composition of each of the Board, its committees and the directors, followed by discussion of the summarised responses was the most appropriate for the Companys circumstances.
This exercise was conducted between December 2004 and March 2005.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS The Company has complied with the Code requirements for each Director to stand for re-election at least once every three years and that any director serving more than nine years since first elected should stand for re-election annually.
The Directors retiring by rotation and standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting are as set out in the Notice of Meeting on pages 63 to 64, and the summary of AGM business contained in the Explanatory Notes on pages 66 to 68.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS The Board and executive management maintain a dialogue with both institutional shareholders and analysts and also respond promptly to other shareholders enquiries.
Shareholders are invited to ask questions at the Annual General Meeting and, as far as is practicable, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Valuation Committee will be available to answer any questions from shareholders.
The net asset value of the Company is disclosed on a monthly basis to the London Stock Exchange to enable shareholders and analysts to follow the progress of the Company.
The Company also maintains a website at www.
co. uk where shareholders have access to the latest monthly financial data released by the Company, together with historical information and accounts.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Corporate Governance Report 25 ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT Statement of the Directors responsibilities Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the total return of the Company and the Group for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Internal Control The Board of Directors is responsible for the Groups system of internal control although it has delegated the supervision of the system to the Audit Committee.
Such systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, as such, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against any material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated to executive management the implementation of the systems of internal control within an established framework applicable throughout the Group.
The system of internal control is reviewed annually.
The Board considers that the necessary procedures have been implemented to satisfy the requirements of the Financial Services Authority with respect to the Turnbull guidance Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code issued in September 1999.
The Board has considered the need to establish a separate internal audit function.
However, it was decided that the size and nature of the Groups activities do not currently merit the additional expense and operational complexity that an internal audit function would incur.
This position is reviewed from time to time.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the key systems of internal control in operation during the financial period and until the date of this report through the monitoring processes set out below.
Control Environment The Group has established an organisational structure which allocates defined levels of authority and reporting responsibility in respect of the operational, compliance, financial and taxation affairs of the Group to a small number of senior executives who meet regularly to discuss matters of importance to the Group.
Risk Management The identification of major business risks is carried out by the Board in conjunction with the relevant executives.
The mitigation and monitoring of risks identified is undertaken by the Board or the executive management as appropriate.
Detailed portfolio valuations are undertaken every week and these form the basis for risk control decisions regarding equity exposure, liquidity, market price risk and exchange rate risk.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 26 Corporate Governance Report Social, Environmental and Ethical SEE Responsibility The Board is responsible for investment strategy and related questions of SEE policy.
It has delegated the supervision of SEE related matters to the Audit Committee, and dayto-day responsibility resides with executive management.
As as investment trust, the Board considers that the Companys direct SEE impact is low.
However, SEE risk is considered on a case-by-case basis where management believes that investments made internally, as opposed to those made by external managers, would create an SEE risk exposure.
Potential SEE risk is also considered in the selection of external investment managers.
Financial Reporting and Control Procedures There is a budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the executive management.
Monthly actual results are reviewed and reported against budget and reviewed regularly by the executive management.
The Group maintains guidelines in relation to the key controls exercised over its financial and operating affairs.
Duties are segregated to the extent commensurate with the size of the Groups organisation and business environment.
STATEMENT ON GOING CONCERN The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources, an appropriate financial structure and suitable management arrangements in place to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
