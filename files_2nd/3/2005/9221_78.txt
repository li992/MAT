STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE ACCOUNTS The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the statement of auditors responsibilities set out on page 105 is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and the auditors in relation to the accounts.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Company for the year.
The directors consider that in preparing the accounts on pages 94-103 the Company has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed, subject to any explanations and any material departures disclosed in the notes to the accounts.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the Company and which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps, as are reasonably open to them and which they deem appropriate to safeguard the assets of the Company and to seek to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
