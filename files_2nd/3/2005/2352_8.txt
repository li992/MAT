Report on corporate governance The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and the Board, acknowledging its responsibility to shareholders in this area, has put in place an appropriate framework as described in the corporate governance policy guidelines on page 20 of this Annual Report and Accounts.
This report sets out how the framework is applied and the Companys compliance with the 2003 Combined Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
"The Combined Code is supplemented by a publication entitled ""Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code"" the Turnbull Guidance to enable listed companies to comply with Listing Rule 9.8."
The Turnbull Guidance was recently revised by the Financial Reporting Council and published in October 2005, the updated version to take effect for financial periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
The Company has throughout 2005 applied the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code and complied therewith, as detailed below, with the exceptions that from 14 November 2005, following his appointment as non-executive Chairman, Mr Tim Melville-Ross remained Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and a member of the Audit Committee.
Membership of these Committees then included two, rather than three, independent directors until the appointment of Mr John Warren on 1 March 2006 code provisions B.
With effect from close of business on 10 March 2006, Mr John Warren was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Mr Tim Melville-Ross resigned his membership of the Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee.

Mr Warren was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2006 following a recommendation from the Nomination Committee and an evaluation of the knowledge, skills and experience that the appointment would bring to the Board in the light of the balance already available.
A comprehensive, tailored and formal induction to the Company was provided shortly after appointment.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive, set out in writing and agreed by the Board.
The Chairman provides leadership to and runs the Board, takes a leading role in determining its composition and structure, and sets its agenda.

The Board has determined that non-executive directors, Mr Mark Nicholls, Mrs Lesley MacDonagh and Mr John Warren are independent.
This includes an assessment of their independence in character and judgement and confirmation of their being free from any business or other relationship or circumstances which could affect, or appear to affect, the exercise of their independent judgement on matters under consideration by the Board.
Mr Mark Nicholls was appointed Senior Independent Director with effect from 14 November 2005 and his responsibilities are to lead the annual performance evaluation of the Chairman carried out by the non-executive directors, to meet with the non-executive directors without the Chairman present when appropriate and to provide an additional point of contact for shareholders.
The Board met seven times during 2005 and all the then current directors attended all meetings, with the exception of Mrs Lesley MacDonagh who attended six of seven meetings, missing one by prior arrangement.
The Board receives timely, clear and comprehensive board papers a week in advance of each meeting and other information appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties.
Meetings are conducted in a way which allows open discussion and enables the nonexecutive directors to challenge and test the strategy, policy and proposals put forward by the executive directors.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors also met during the year under review without the executive directors present.

Outputs included the further development of ongoing strategy, business environment and management succession discussions, more frequent presentations from regional operations, and positive focused reviews of various areas of the business.

uk Report on corporate governance continued Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal control and has during the year reviewed the effectiveness thereof.
It is able to report that the Company has complied with provision C. 2.1 of the Combined Code throughout 2005 in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance.
A key part of the system of internal control is the maintenance of a risk register.
The Board regularly reviews this register to ensure that it properly identifies and grades the risks specific to the activities and operating environment of the business.
In this way it is able to reconsider its policies of risk tolerance.
In setting these policies the Board aims to ensure that the Company is neither prevented from taking opportunities nor exposed to unreasonable risk.
The system of internal control is designed to manage risk rather than eliminate it and consequently it can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee reviews the system of internal control and reports to the Board thereon.
It receives reports from the internal and external auditors and management which assess the efficiency of internal control and make recommendations for any improvements.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of committee meetings to the Board and provides minutes of the meetings.
The Group has maintained throughout the year and up to the date of approval of these Annual Report and Accounts a control environment, with policies, procedures, processes and codes of conduct which are designed to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate risk over the range of business activities and improve business efficiency.
This control environment is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance.
As new procedures and working practices are adopted, risk factors are considered and internal controls embedded into the systems wherever possible.
The principal elements of the control environment are as follows: regular main Board meetings: regular Audit Committee meetings: an established management structure of operating regions and Retirement Living, with short lines of communication to the executive directors: regular regional board meetings, with comprehensive agendas dealing with all aspects of the business: defined operating guidelines and procedures with authorisation limits at appropriate levels across the Group: an internal audit department reporting regularly on compliance with procedures and authority limits: a regular self certification process in respect of internal control through the management structure: a comprehensive financial reporting system with actual performance compared with budgets and forecasts on a regular basis, each region and Retirement Living reporting through its regional board: and a regular comparison of the Groups performance against industry statistics and competitors.
Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
