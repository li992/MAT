Dunelm Group plc Dunelm Group plc 32 Annual report and accounts 2012 Annual report and accounts 2012 33 Letter from the Chair of the Audit Committee Dear Shareholder, I was appointed to the Board on 8 February 2012, and became Chair of the Audit Committee on that date.
My thanks go to Geoff Cooper who ably chaired the committee on a temporary basis over the previous 15 months.
Since my appointment, I have held discussions with David Stead, the Finance Director, and members of his team, and with KPMG.
I have also reviewed the controls and systems in place at Dunelm.
I am pleased to say that controls appear to be sound and that management has adopted an appropriate attitude to financial control and risk management.
I look forward to working with the other members of the committee and the Board as a whole to ensure that this is maintained and enhanced.
Yours sincerely, Matt Davies Chair of the Audit Committee 13 September 2012.
