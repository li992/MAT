Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Company is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance in respect of leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relationships with our shareholders as identied by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 the Code.
This section and the Remuneration Report detail how the Company has applied the principles and provisions of the Code.
The Companys business model is explained on pages 12 to 15 of the Annual Report.
It is the Boards view that it has been fully compliant with the Code throughout the 2011 12 financial year.
A copy of the Code is available on the Financial Reporting Councils website www.
THE BOARD Role The Board has a collective responsibility for promoting the long term success of the Company in a safe and sustainable manner in order to create shareholder value.
The Board provides leadership and sets the Companys strategic long-term objectives.
"Its duties are set out in a formal schedule of matters specically reserved for decision by the Board, which include: q""i }iivi ] i} `}iLiVi q vV i q v V i V q }ii V Vi q vi i V q vi i ` i]``i`V ` i`i`L q, ii}i `ivi V q }ii ` `iiiiVii q i i Vi }ii `i `i ` Approval of policies in key areas including Sustainability, Health & Safety and Business Ethics."
Composition and Independence i` ivii `Viii iVi ]wi iVi iV `ii`ii`i Non-executive Directors.
Their biographies are set out on pages 84 and 85.
The Board has evolved over recent years to put in place the succession planning that all successful organisations require and the further appointments made to the Board during this year, including three new independent Non-executive Directors, has further broadened the overall composition of the Board.
The Board considers that all of the current Non-executive Directors were independent throughout the year.
In recognising that Victoria Mitchell was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2002 and as a result has served on the Board for over nine years, she announced in December 2011 her intention to step down from the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 5 September 2012.
The Non-executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director Sir John Armitt have the skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively.
The Group Executive Directors do not hold any Non-executive Director appointments or commitments required to be disclosed under the Code.
Chairman and Managing Director The roles of Group Chairman and Group Managing Director are separately held and there are clear written guidelines to support the division of responsibility between them.
The Group Chairman is responsible for the effective conduct of the Board and shareholder meetings and for ensuring that each Director contributes to effective decision-making.
The Group Managing Director has day-to-day executive responsibility for the running of the Groups businesses.
His role is to develop and deliver the strategy to enable the Group to meet its objectives.
Meetings The Board met seven times during 2011 12, including the April 2011 meeting which was deferred until the first week of May due to the unusually high number of public holidays in April 2011.
There were no absences from any of the meetings.
In addition to the formal meetings of the whole Board, the Non-executive Directors meet with the Group Chairman.
The Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director are invited to attend these meetings in part, to provide an update on the business activities of the Group.
The Non-executive Directors meet at least annually without the Group Chairman present, chaired by the Senior Independent Director.
Board papers and agendas are sent out in the week prior to each meeting, thus allowing sufficient time for detailed review and consideration of the documents beforehand.
In addition, the Board is supplied with comprehensive management information on a regular basis.
Election and re-election of Directors The Articles of Association of the Company include the requirement for Directors to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election every three years.
In addition, all Directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment and thereafter at intervals of no more than three years.
106 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Governance Governance However, in accordance with the requirements of the new Code, all the Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, other than Victoria Mitchell who is standing down from the Board.
Induction and Development On appointment, Non-executive Directors are provided with a detailed induction programme.
This covers an overview of the Groups operations and its policies, corporate responsibility and corporate affairs issues, legal matters, and the opportunity to meet with Directors and key staff and to visit the Groups sites.
No training needs were identied this year, although ongoing training is available to all Directors to meet their individual needs.
Board members also receive guidance on regulatory matters and the corporate governance framework that the Group operates under.
In particular during the year the Board received training on the Bribery Act 2010 in advance of its implementation on 1 July 2011.
Members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees received briengs from our auditors and remuneration advisers respectively to ensure they remain up to date with current regulations and developments.
All Directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary and independent professional advisers, at the Companys expense, where specic expertise is required in the course of their duties.
Board evaluation The Board undertakes an annual formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors.
This year the process was led by the Chairman and covered: U i}V i U `Vi]Vii `ii UVVi } U`V ``iii U iiviiv Viv`` Vii `i U i`iVV The overall conclusion was that individual Board members are satisfied that the Board works well and operates efficiently.
They are also satisfied with the contribution made by their colleagues and that the Board committees operate properly and efficiently.
In line with the best practice recommendations of the Code, which recommends that an externally facilitated evaluation should be conducted at least every three years, the Board has agreed that an external evaluation will be conducted for 2012 13.

The Board consider these procedures to be working effectively.
Insurance The Company has in place an appropriate policy which insures Directors against certain liabilities, including legal costs, which they may incur in carrying out their duties.

com plc until March 2005, is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience.
David Howell was also Chairman of the Audit Committee of Nestor Healthcare Group plc from 2000 to 2003.

At the same time, the Committee recognises that, for businesses such as Berkeley, the impact of one-off transactions can have a material effect on this ratio depending on the nature of such activity.
Any departure from this ratio will only be as a consequence of transactional work, where the Committee considers it is right for the auditors to undertake such work where the reasons for doing so are compelling, such as where i i i iii}i`}i `iiiVi iV`iiiv i iw iii the nature of the transaction is that the Groups auditors are the only practical solution.
Non-audit work carried out by all rms, including the auditors, is formally reported to the Audit Committee at each meeting.
The auditors have open recourse to the Non-executive Directors, should they consider it necessary, and there is open dialogue between the auditors and the Chairman of the Audit Committee before each Audit Committee meeting and, after the meeting, the opportunity to meet without the Executive Directors present.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Companys policy for Executive remuneration and the precise terms of employment and remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The principles and details of Directors remuneration are contained in the Remuneration Report on pages 89 to 105.
The Committee is chaired by Alan Coppin and the other members at 30 April 2012 were Sir John Armitt and David Howell, who are all independent Non-executive Directors.

The process for identifying and recommending new appointments includes a combination of discussions and consultations, in addition to formal interviews, utilising the services of independent recruitment specialists, as appropriate.
KEY RISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL The Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, at least annually.
Internal control procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There are ongoing processes and procedures for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
These processes and procedures were in place from the start of the financial year to the date on which the 2012 Annual Report and Accounts were approved and accord with the Turnbull guidance issued in 2005.
The processes are regularly reviewed by the Board and include an annual review by the Directors of the operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control as part of its year end procedures.
The key features of the system of internal control include: Clear organisational structure The Group operates through autonomous divisions and operating companies, each with its own board.
Operating company boards meet on a weekly basis and divisional boards on a monthly basis, and comprehensive information is prepared for such meetings on a standardised basis to cover all aspects of the business.
Formal reporting lines and delegated levels of authority exist within this structure and the review of risk and performance occurs at multiple levels throughout the operating companies, divisions and at Group.
Risk assessment Risk reporting is embedded within ongoing management reporting throughout the Group.
At operating company and divisional level, Board meeting agendas and packs are structured around the key risks facing the Group.
These risks include health and safety, sales, production build cost and programme, land and planning, economic, regulatory and site specic matters.
In addition, there is a formalised process whereby each division produces quarterly risks and control reports that identify significant risks, the potential impact and the actions being taken to mitigate the risks.
These risk reports are reviewed and updated regularly.
A Group Risk Management Report is presented at each Group Main Board Meeting, setting out the current factors affecting the risk prole of the Group, the mitigation of these risks and the key changes to this risk prole since the last report.
Financial reporting A comprehensive budgeting and real-time forecasting system, covering both profit and cash, operates within the Group.
This enables executive management to view key financial and operating data on a daily basis.
On a weekly and monthly basis more formal reporting up to the Group Executives and the Board is prepared.
The results of all operating units are reported monthly and compared to budget and forecast.
There is a consolidation process in place which ensures that there is an audit trail between the Groups financial reporting system and the Groups statutory financial statements.
Investment and contracting controls The Group has clearly dened guidelines for the purchase and sale of land within the Group, which include detailed environmental, planning and financial appraisal and are subject to executive authorisation.
Rigorous procedures are also followed for the selection of consultants and contractors.
The review and monitoring of all build programmes and budgets are a fundamental element of the Companys financial reporting cycle.

Training to staff is given where necessary.

In addition, the principal treasury-related risks, decisions and control processes are managed by the Group Finance function, under the direction of the Group Finance Director.
Internal audit Internal auditors are in place in each division and at Group to provide assurance on the operation of the Groups control framework.
Whistleblowing The Group has a whistleblowing policy which has been communicated to all staff, where Directors, management and staff can report in confidence any concerns they may have of malpractice, financial irregularity, breaches of any Group procedures, or other matters.
The arrangements in place are reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Bribery Act In advance of the implementation of the Bribery Act on 1 July 2011, the Group undertook a thorough review of the requirements of the Act to ensure that it had adequate policies and procedures in place to prevent bribery.
This included providing training to staff and implementing an Anti Bribery and Corruption policy, which was communicated to all staff.
The Finance Director has the executive responsibility for implementing the Groups policy and reporting to the Audit Committee, who are charged with overseeing the development and implementation of the Groups policies and procedures and monitoring ongoing compliance.

The Group has significant financial resources and the Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and compared this to the level of committed loan facilities and cash resources over the medium term.
