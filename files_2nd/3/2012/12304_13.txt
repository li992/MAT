Overview Business Review Governance Sustainability Accounts Governance Nominations Committee Report The Board is required by the Code to establish a nomination committee which should lead the process for board appointments and make recommendations for appointments to the Board.
A majority of members of the nomination committee should be independent non-executive directors.
The nomination committee is comprised of the non-executive directors and is chaired by Roger Withers.
The committee met twice in 2012: first to consider candidates for the appointment of an additional non-executive director, which led, after a process involving the review, led by the Chairman, of a number of potential candidates, to the appointment of Andrew Thomas: and secondly, to consider the appointment of the Chief Financial Officer following the decision of David Mathewson to step down at the end of the year.
In the light of Ron Hoffmans extensive experience within Playtechs business, his close in involvement with all of the Groups successful acquisitions over the last few years and close working relationship with David Mathewson over the previous couple of years, the committee felt that Ron had the correct balance of skills, industry knowledge and experience to fulfil this important role.
In the future the committee will continue to meet whenever necessary during the year, and not less than twice a year.
The primary responsibilities delegated to, and discharged by, the committee include: t Leading the selection process of candidates and propose to the Board any new Board appointments, whether of executive or non-executive directors: t Considering the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, and in the light of this evaluation, prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment: t Making recommendations to the Board for succession plans for executive management, executive and non-executive directors and, in particular, the CEO: and t Making recommendations to the Board concerning the re-appointment by shareholders of any directors standing for re-election at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
