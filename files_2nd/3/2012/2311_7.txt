this statement, together with the remuneration report set out on pages 18 to 25, describes how the Company has applied the provisions and principles set out in section 1 of the UK Corporate governance Code the Code.
Except as detailed below in relation to provision B.
1.2 of the Code in respect of the balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, the Company complied fully with the Code.
this report also includes the information required by paragraph 7.2 of the Disclosure and transparency rules Dtr to be contained in the Companys corporate governance statement, with the exception of the information required by Dtr 7.2.
6, which is located in the Directors report.
The workings of the Board and its committees The Board the Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors the Board chaired by richard rose.
the Board currently consists of five Executive Directors and five Non-Executive Directors.
the Code requires that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent Non-Executive Directors as determined by the Board.
For operational reasons the Company was not compliant with this provision of the Code during the period ending 30 March 2012. the Board is actively looking to recruit an additional independent Non-Executive Director and an update on progress will be provided in due course.
the Board is content that the independent judgement of the Non-Executive Directors has not been adversely impacted during the period of non-compliance.
the independence of Non-Executive Directors is considered at least annually and is based on the criteria suggested in the Code.
richard rose was an Executive Director and Chairman of Blueheath immediately prior to the reverse acquisition of Blueheath by the Booker group in 2007 and became Non-Executive Chairman of the Company upon completion of the merger.
the groups combined business is signicantly different to and larger than Blueheath and there is a division of responsibilities between richard and the Executive Directors and, in particular, Charles Wilson as Chief Executive, such that his current and former roles can be considered incomparable.
Having regard to all the circumstances, including the independence richard has demonstrated as Chairman, the Board is satisfied and has determined that richard is independent.
Consequently, all the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement in accordance with the Code.
the Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge and bring independence to the Board and its decision making process.
the Board believes that it is appropriate to have a senior independent Non-Executive Director and lord Bilimoria fulls this role.
He is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal channels and for when such contact would be inappropriate.
the Board believes that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it is not so large as to be unwieldy.
the Board contains a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors such that no individual, or group of individuals can dominate the Boards decision making.
No one individual has unfettered powers of decision.
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors biographies on page 10.

Pensions the group operates a closed dened benefit scheme, where judgements are required to determine the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, discount rate, inflation, investment returns and member longevity.
there is a risk of underestimating this liability.
this risk is mitigated by maintaining a relatively strong funding position over time, taking advice from independent qualied actuaries, agreeing appropriate investment policies with the trustees and closely monitoring the funding position with the trustees.
Information technology IT the group is exposed to the risk that the it systems upon which it relies fail.
