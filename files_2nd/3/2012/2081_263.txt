It is our view that governance is not just a matter for the Board a good governance culture must be fostered throughout the organisation.
Governance at BHP Billiton We believe that long-term value creation is supported by high-quality governance.
Given our Australian United Kingdom Dual Listed Company structure and our listing on the New York Stock Exchange, our governance framework reflects the regulatory requirements in those places.
Beyond regulatory requirements, we adopt what we consider to be the highest of governance standards in those jurisdictions.
Underpinning this is our overall approach to governance: We believe governance is not just a matter for the Board and that a good governance culture must be fostered throughout the organisation.
We strive to foster a culture that values and rewards exemplary ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.
We set out in the BHP Billiton Code of Business Conduct our expectations of our employees and those to whom we contract business.
An outline of our governance structure is set out below.
