Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.

Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested For acquisitions prior to 1 July 2009, costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration for impairment at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the payable when calculating goodwill.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
The fair values of grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
The fair values of options granted under all other share option schemes have been determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
