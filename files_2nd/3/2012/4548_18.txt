822,000 of the marketing authorisations relate to the Vetivex range of products.
The Vetivex marketing authorisations are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
Ownership of the marketing authorisations rests with the Group in perpetuity.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit their useful lives.
Vetivex is an established range of products which are relatively simple in nature and there are a limited number of players in the market.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the marketing authorisations are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
