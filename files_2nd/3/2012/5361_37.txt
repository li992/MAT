The principles and values applied to remuneration at 26 February 2013 senior management level also underpin our policies and practices throughout the Group.
We seek to reward all employees fairly, responsibly and by reference to local market practices, by providing an appropriate balance between xed and variable remuneration, the payment of which is linked to the achievement of what are intended to be demanding Group performance measures aligned to our strategic objectives.
ELEMENTIS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 49 Policy report The information in the table below sets out the remuneration policy for the different elements that make up total remuneration applying to the executive directors.
The policy was applied throughout 2012 and will also apply during 2013.
BASIC SALARY Purpose and link to Companys strategy Targeted at a level to attract and retain the world-class executives who are essential to drive the business forward and deliver the Companys strategic goals.
How it operates in practice Annual salary increase broadly in line with the local workforce, subject to Committee approval.
The Committee would take into consideration whether the performance of the business and the executive director merits the award.
Formal salary review every three years, with benchmarking analysis utilised for reference purposes, taking into consideration the following factors: corporate performance: the performance of the executive: market practice: and changes in responsibility, complexity and size of role over the previous three year period.
Salaries are normally reviewed in December and any changes are effective from January following.
Maximum potential value Targeted at median level when compared to companies of a similar size in terms of revenue and market capitalisation that are in our sector or a similar industrial sector.
Description of performance metrics applying N a Changes to policy for 2013 No change to policy.
BENEFITS Purpose and link to Companys strategy To aid retention and to remain competitive in the market place.
Healthcare benets in order to minimise business disruption.
How it operates in practice Life assurance and private medical health insurance are provided.
Benets in the US, where it is standard, include cover for dental costs, accidental death and disablement, and long term disability.
Provision of either a company car for business and personal purposes or a car allowance, in both cases having a value that is consistent and commensurate with the executives status and seniority.

How it operates in practice To ensure that a significant proportion of an executives total remuneration about a third is linked to corporate business financial performance that is tied to the Companys annual operating plan.
The Committee does not incorporate corporate or business performance in environmental, social and governance matters when setting targets in the variable parts of remuneration.
The safety and environmental performance of Group businesses is accorded high importance and the Committee considers that management should aspire to achieving high standards in both safety and environmental performance without the need for incentives.
Governance standards are set by the Board as a whole.
Internal guidelines exist that enable the Committee to claw back bonuses paid from 2012 onwards that are later found to have been based on performance that was mis-stated or incorrect calculations.
Maximum potential value Maximum bonus opportunity of one times basic salary executive directors and business presidents.
Description of performance metrics applying The bonus, which is paid in cash, is based on the achievement of challenging financial targets relative to the annual operating plan, taking into account general GDP factors, consensus brokers forecasts and current and past performance of the businesses, together with any organic or acquisitive growth plans.
Two performance conditions apply: Earnings per share EPS and Group average trade working capital to sales t ratio expressed as a percentage AWC split 75:25.
For the EPS condition, the targets are set at threshold, plan and stretch level, with threshold being previous year actual and the plan and stretch targets set at a level considered to be sufciently challenging.
The AWC condition is structured in a similar way, except that an over-riding condition means the AWC condition would only be operative if the EPS target at plan level has been met.
Bonus accrual as a percentage of basic salary for both conditions is linear t between threshold and stretch, although vesting under the AWC condition only operates above the plan level.
The annual bonus scheme for the business presidents generally operates in the t same way except that the metrics used are business operating profit and AWC.
The EPS, operating profit and AWC conditions were selected because they t are considered to be the most appropriate measures of the Groups strategic, operational and financial performance, and targets are set at levels which the Committee considers to be appropriately challenging.
EPS and operating profit targets are set to ensure that maximum bonuses t are only payable for exceptional performance.
The Committee keeps all three performance metrics under review on an annual basis to ensure they continue to remain appropriate and has the discretion to amend the weighting.
The Committee considers that the current weighting of 75:25 EPS:AWC is appropriate and that it would not be appropriate for the EPS or operating profit measure to be reduced to below 50 per cent.

LONG TERM INCENTIVES Purpose and link to Companys strategy The LTIP is the sole long term incentive mechanism and is intended to align the interests of the executives with the Groups long term performance.
Further, the general policy is to ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is aligned with the long term strategy and the interests of shareholders.
How it operates in practice Nil cost options or conditional shares are awarded annually.
Options are t exercisable three years from, and within ten years of, the date of award, subject to achievement of challenging performance conditions.
Share awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of award and are also subject to the achievement of challenging performance conditions.
Other executives participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
t Maximum potential value The maximum value of any award under the LTIP is one times an individuals base salary, plus up to 50 per cent of the Chief Executives base salary xed at its 2010 level but this base level is revalued annually by the same percentage increase each participant receives on his own base salary in each subsequent year.
In the case of the Chief Executive, the maximum award is limited to 1.5 times his base salary at the time of the award.
Description of performance metrics applying Awards are subject to achievement of the EPS and TSR performance conditions split 50:50, as follows: EPS condition awards vest on a linear scale from 0 per cent to 100 per cent for average annual EPS growth of RPI 4 per cent to RPI 10 per cent, respectively.
The Committee considers that these targets are appropriately challenging after taking into consideration the Companys strategic and operating plans.
The Committee considers the target range each year prior to grant to ensure it remains appropriate.
TSR condition awards vest on a linear scale from 3.85 per cent to 100 per cent for median to upper quartile performance, respectively.
The TSR condition will be measured against the companies comprising the FTSE All Share Index excluding investment trusts.
This index was selected as it provides a better indication of relative performance than the FTSE 250 Index which is heavily weighted towards cyclical sectors.
The performance period for both EPS and TSR conditions will correspond to the three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the award is made.
Changes to policy for 2013 No change in policy.

To provide appropriate retirement benets commensurate with local market practice, seniority of the role and tenure with the Company together with giving the executive an opportunity to contribute to their own retirement.
How it operates in practice Group Chief Executive David Dutro participates in a dened contribution scheme and receives an annual salary supplement of 20 per cent of his basic salary as part of his contractual entitlement.
For US employees including executive directors the Group operates a US 401 k Plan, which is similar to a money purchase scheme, and a Non-Qualied Deferred Compensation Plan the Dened Contribution plans.
The latter plan mirrors the 401 k Plan except it allows for contributions in respect of earnings over an annual compensation limit set by the US Internal Revenue Service 2012: $250,000.
The employer match under these two plans includes a regular match of up to 4 per cent of total pensionable remuneration and a supplemental match of up to 4 per cent, based on age and length of service.
Prior to its closure to future accruals in 2006, David Dutro participated in the Elementis Career Reward Retirement Plan ECRRP, which falls under the category of dened benefit pension plans in the US.
As the plan is closed to future accruals, participants account balances are no longer credited with contributions, however, interest is credited each year at the US Treasury 30 year bond rate.
The normal pensionable retirement age for David Dutro under the ECRRP is 65.
Finance Director Brian Taylorson participates in a dened benefit scheme in the UK DB scheme and receives a salary supplement to compensate him for the restricted pension entitlements under the DB scheme as a result of the former HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap on the amount of salary which may be treated as pensionable see below.
The main benets to Brian Taylorson as a UK salaried executive director who contributes a percentage of his salary to the scheme each year are: An accrual rate of 1 30 for each year of pensionable service.
t Life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary.
t Pensions to spouse and dependent children payable on death.
t The normal pensionable retirement age for Brian Taylorson is 60.
The annual salary supplement that Brian Taylorson receives is an amount gross equal to 44 per cent of his basic salary above the notional earnings cap.

How it operates in practice Non-executive directors fees are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors, having regard to fees paid to non-executive directors in other UK quoted companies, the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.
In the case of the Chairman, the fee level is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
As well as taking into consideration the above factors, the Committee sets the fee at an appropriate level necessary to attract a role holder qualied to effectively lead a board of a company of a similar size and prestige as Elementis.
Fees are reviewed every three years and the next review is in December 2013 to take effect from January 2014.

The same EPS growth and relative TSR performance conditions apply in respect of the awards in 2011 and 2012 as for the proposed awards in 2013, as described in the policy report.
The conditions applying in respect of the 2010 award are described below.
The number of savings-based share options shown as lapsed for David Dutro is the difference between the number granted and exercised, and is attributable to currency movements.
The option pr ice shown is the market price at the date of grant.
Earliest exercise date date of vesting is 36 months from the date of grant.
The market price of ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was 232.5 pence 2011: 137.2 pence and the range during 2012 was 135.1 pence to 240.3 pence 2011: 107.5 pence to 187.4 pence.
