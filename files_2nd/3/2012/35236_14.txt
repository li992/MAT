EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIPS Strong relationships in all parts of our business are an important component of our continued success and assist us in adding value to the portfolio.
Tenants We understand our tenants requirements and maintain communication from the very start of their interest in a property and throughout their occupation, building extremely close relationships.
A reversionary rental profile with low passing rents is a key characteristic of our portfolio, providing prospects for income growth and value enhancement.
We aim to capitalise on these opportunities and work with our tenants to accommodate expansion, contraction and lease regears wherever possible.
During 2012 we regeared leases at 1 Olivers Yard 2 and 8 Fitzroy Street, increasing the rent and, at Olivers Yard, the length of the leases.
This has led to strong increases in the respective value of these properties and greater security of income and tenure for both Derwent London and our tenants.
