Premiers portfolio of crudes traded at a weighted average of US$3.5 bbl premium to Brent, boosted by favourable prices for our Chim So crude in the Asian markets.
Premiers average realisations for the year were US$111.4 bbl 2011: US$111.9 bbl influenced by the timing of actual crude oil liftings.
After taking into account the effect of hedging contracts, this reduced to US$107.5 bbl 2011: US$89.6 bbl.
Average gas prices for the group were US$8.34 per thousand standard cubic feet mscf 2011: US$8.51 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil HSFO pricing and in turn, therefore, linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$18.7 mscf 2011: US$19.5 mscf.
Average prices for Pakistan gas where only a portion of the contract formulae is linked to energy prices was US$4.3 mscf 2011: US$3.8 mscf.
Income statement Production in 2012 averaged 57.7 kboepd 2011: 40.4 kboepd on a working interest basis.
On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices, production was 51.6 kboepd 2011: 37.7 kboepd.
Tony Durrant Working interest gas production averaged 180 mmscfd 2011: 153 mmscfd or Finance Director approximately 54 per cent of total production.
Total sales revenue from all operations reached a new record level of US$1,408.7 million 2011: US$826.8 million, driven by higher production and the sustained high oil prices.
Cost of sales rose to US$742.4 million 2011: US$414.9 million.
Unit operating costs were Profit after US$16.2 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2011: US$15.9 boe and amounted to tax is a record US$342.4 million 2011: US$235.2 million.
The operating costs per boe in Pakistan and Indonesia remained stable, increased marginally in the UK and were significantly US$252.0 million reduced in Vietnam due to one-off production start up costs in the prior year.
Underlying resulting in basic unit amortisation excluding impairment rose to US$16.4 boe 2011: US$13.8 boe earnings per share reflecting increased production from Vietnam, which has a higher amortisation charge of 47.9 cents per boe compared to the group average.
Exploration expense and pre-licence expenditure costs amounted to US$157.7 million 2011: US$187.5 million and US$29.2 million 2011: US$23.0 million respectively.
This includes the write-off of the following exploration wells: a Chim So North West well in Vietnam: Benteng in Indonesia, and the Spaniards, East Fyne, Stingray, Cyclone, Bluebell and Coaster wells in the UK North Sea.
Net administrative costs were US$24.2 million against 2011 of US$25.8 million.
Operating profits were US$455.2 million 2011: US$175.6 million.
Finance costs and other charges, net of interest revenue and other gains, were US$107.6 million 2011: US$68.1 million.
The increase reflects historically low levels of interest rates on cash deposits, increased gross debt levels to fund development projects in Asia and the UK, and in the latter parts of 2012, the US$231.0 million funding for the acquisition of the Sea Lion discovery in the Falkland Islands.
The charge for the unwinding of the discounted decommissioning provision increased to US$33.2 million 2011: US$28.3 million reflecting increased provisions for future decommissioning as industry cost estimates rise.
Pre-tax profits of US$359.9 million 2011: US$141.5 million also show a positive adjustment of US$14.2 million in respect of the groups commodity hedge portfolio 2011: US$34.0 million.
This represents the unwinding of prior year provisions in respect of our embedded oil hedging programme, which finished at the end of 2012.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 25 The group tax charge for 2012 is US$107.9 million, an effective tax rate of 30 per cent of production our profit before tax.
The groups theoretical tax rate is close to 50 per cent, a higher taxation rate in the UK being offset by lower rates in Vietnam and Pakistan.
The 2012 tax kboepd charge is reduced as a result of a deferred tax credit in the UK, arising from the Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement RFES allowance and the small field allowance for the groups Solan field.
The group has an estimated US$1.9 billion of carried forward UK corporation tax allowances, which will be utilised against UK ring fence profits over time, 58 and are therefore reflected in the deferred tax asset position at the year-end.
Profit after tax is a record US$252.0 million 2011: US$171.2 million resulting in basic earnings per share of 47.9 cents 2011: 36.6 cents.

Acquisitions and disposals In January, the company completed the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc EnCore.
resources Shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCores shares elected to take new Premier shares, resulting in the company paying a total of 14.1 million US$21.6 million in cash mmboe to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new Ordinary Shares to those who elected to take the share alternative.
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement to 481 on-sell the 16.6 per cent interest in the Cladhan area, which it acquired via the EnCore acquisition, for an adjusted consideration of US$52.4 million.
This on-sale was completed in March 2012.
26 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL REVIEW continued In May, Premier agreed to acquire a 20 per cent interest in PL407 and a 40 per cent profit after tax interest in the adjacent PL406 licence on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
These interests increased Premiers share of the Bream development project to 40 per cent and million the companys operated interest in PL406 to 80 per cent.
PL406 contains the Mackerel discovery and the Herring prospect, which could form part of the Bream area development in the future.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition was US$10.0 million with contingent payments of US$17.5 million payable upon certain project outcomes.
US$252 The acquisition was completed in July 2012.
Also in July, Premier announced it had agreed to farm-in to 60 per cent of Rockhoppers licence interests in the Falkland Islands, including the Sea Lion development project.
The initial payment was US$231 million in cash.
In addition, Premier will pay an exploration carry of up to US$48 million and, subject to field development plan approval, a development carry of up to US$722 million.
Premier has also agreed to provide additional stand-by funding to complete the project.
In the event that Rockhopper chooses to draw down on this facility, Premier will take an enhanced share of entitlement production and cash flows from the Sea Lion and related fields.
This enhanced share continues until Premier realises a 15 per cent post tax internal rate of return on its investment.
Thereafter cash flows are shared pro-rata to equity interests.
Premiers investment in Sea Lion and related fields will be funded from a combination operating cash flow of Premiers existing cash resources and facilities and future cash flow from operations.
Premier and Rockhopper have also agreed to pursue jointly exploration opportunities in the Falkland Islands and analogous plays in selected areas offshore Southern Africa.
million The transaction, accounted for as an asset purchase, was completed in October 2012.

However these will be redeemed at an average of US$1.397: due to cross currency swap arrangements.
In February 2012, additional bank facilities of US$350.0 million were negotiated and a second issue of senior loan notes was completed.
This second issue, with maturities of seven, 10 and 12 years, amounted to US$202.0 million and 25.0 million.
A US$175.0 million term bank loan was repaid during March 2012.
In October 2012, further to an offer from the company, holders representing 98.13 per cent of the total principal amount of the US$250.0 million guaranteed convertible bonds due in 2014 representing a principal amount of approximately US$245.3 million elected to exchange their existing bonds for guaranteed convertible bonds due in July 2018.
The new bonds have a conversion price of US$7.00 4.34 per share and a coupon of 2.5 per cent.
This compares with the old convertible bonds, which had a conversion price of US$6.69 per share and a coupon of 2.875 per cent.

Cash and undrawn facilities, including letter of credit facilities, were approximately US$1,100 million at 31 December.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 27 Financial risk management capital investment Commodity prices The Boards commodity pricing and hedging policy continues to be to lock in oil and million gas prices for a proportion of expected future production at a level which ensures that investment programmes for sanctioned projects are adequately funded.
Where investment requirements are well covered by cash flows without hedging, it is recognised that there may be an advantage, in periods of strong commodity prices in locking in a US$772 portion of forward production at favourable prices on a rolling forward 12-18 month basis.
At year-end, therefore 3.0 million barrels of Dated Brent oil were hedged through forward sales for 2013 at an average price of US$109.0 bbl.
This volume represents approximately 25 per cent of the groups expected liquids entitlement production in 2013.
48,000 metric tonnes mt of HSFO, which drives our gas contract pricing in Singapore, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-2013 with a cap of US$500 mt equivalent to around US$85 bbl.
An additional 96,000 mt have been sold under monthly forward sales contracts for 2013 at an average price of US$657 mt.
These two hedges cover approximately 32 per cent of our expected Indonesian gas working interest production for 2013.
During 2012, embedded oil price collars and forward oil sales of 3.9 million barrels, cash and undrawn and fuel oil collars and forward sales for 246,000 mt expired at a cost of US$60.7 million facilities 2011: US$119.1 million which has been offset against sales revenue.
million Oil hedge collars are incorporated within the pricing terms of physical off take agreements, avoiding the requirement to revalue them for accounting purposes.
A credit of US$9.6 million 2011: US$28.0 million occurred in respect of past mark-to-market provisions for oil hedges, which have now fully expired.
US$1, 100 Foreign exchange Premiers functional and reporting currency is US dollars.
Exchange rate exposures relate only to local currency receipts, and expenditures within individual business units.
Local currency needs are acquired on a short-term basis.
During the year, the group recorded a gain of US$1.5 million on such short-term hedging 2011: loss of US$0.4 million.
In 2012, the group also issued 25.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been hedged under a cross currency swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.328:.
Interest rates Although the groups borrowing facilities are defined in floating rate terms, a majority of its current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
On average, therefore, the cost of drawn bank funds for the year was 4.6 per cent.
Mark-to-market movements on these interest rate swaps amounted to US$2.5 million 2011: charge of US$6.4 million, which was credited to other comprehensive income.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to spreading counterparty risks.
Insurance The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities.
Business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields for a maximum period of 18 months.
Due to exceptionally bad weather in December 2011, the Banff FPSO which handled Kyle production lost its anchors and the risers were severely damaged, stopping Kyle production for the foreseeable future.
A claim for business interruption insurance and property damage is being negotiated with the underwriters.
