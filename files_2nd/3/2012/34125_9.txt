Mobile With the huge growth in the use of smart phones and web browsing on mobile devices, we launched a dedicated mobile site in October 2011.
This site is optimised for mobile phone use and presents the user with a simpler version of the main website.
The mobile site accounted for 23% of our total web traffic in April 2012.
Online customer reviews Consistent with our strategy of putting the customer at the heart of our business, our online customer reviews continue to generate realtime feedback from customers as well as providing positive word of mouth to prospective customers.
We ask our new customers to rate our product and service.
These reviews are published on the website.
The reviews published indicate we are consistently delivering a very high standard of service: Over 6,400 reviews have been published Over 60% have awarded a score of 5 out of 5 Our average overall rating is 4.6 out of 5 Our average customer service score is 4.7 out of 5 In our view, real time customer reviews which have been independently and externally obtained are much more persuasive to prospects than scripted testimonials.
We also gain real time insight from customers publishing Google reviews and from monitoring mentions of Big Yellow with the social mediums of Twitter and general online forums.
Driving online traffic Search engines continue to be the most important acquisition tool for us, accounting for nearly 70% of all traffic to the website.
We continue to make ongoing investment into search engine optimisation SEO techniques both on and off the site.
This helps us maintain the number one position for the popular and high volume search terms storage and self storage in the organic listings on Google.
We have also been optimising our business pages and now appear high on Googles listings for the most popular business storage related search terms providing a good source of business prospects into the site at low cost.
The sponsored search listings remain the largest source of paid for traffic and we ensure our prominence in these listings is balanced with effective landing pages to maximise site conversion.
This year, we have also continued with online display advertising on websites which are contextually and geographically targeted to our core audience groups.
This activity performs both a direct response and branding role.
Efficiencies in all online spend are continuing into 2012 13, ensuring return on investment is maximised from all our different online traffic sources.
Online marketing budgets will continue to remain fluid and be directed towards the media with the best return on investment.
Social media Social media continues to be complementary to our existing marketing channels.

The Big Yellow YouTube channel is being used to showcase our stores to web prospects through a video store tour.
We use both domestic and business versions to help prospects experience the quality of the product without the need for them to visit the store in person.
Business Review continued We also continue to develop a substantial amount of online blog content.
Advice and tips for packing, storage and fide-cluttering are published weekly on the site and posted through our Facebook and Twitter channels.
This provides useful and engaging content for visitors.
Sales promotion We have continued our sales promotion offer throughout the year of 50% off for up to your first 8 weeks storage across all stores, coupled with a Price Promise for comparable local competition.
We continue to manage pricing dynamically, taking account of customer demand and local competition.
