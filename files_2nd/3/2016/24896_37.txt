Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance Corporate Governance report continued Board meetings Up to eight regular meetings are held each year to review and monitor current and forecast performance.
Regular reports on monthly performance and other matters of importance to the Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with the information necessary to make informed judgements.
In addition, the Board has an annual strategy meeting, also attended by senior operational management, to devise and discuss the Companys medium and long-term strategic focus and management development strategy.
Regular formal and informal presentations are given and meetings held in order to inform Directors of issues of importance affecting the Group.
Occasionally, meetings of the Board are held at the Companys operating sites other than Walsall, in order to afford the Board, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, the opportunity to meet with local management.
During FY16, the annual strategy meeting was held in the USA which provided the Board with an invaluable insight into that business and enabled the Directors to meet the entire senior management team.
Attendance at meetings All Directors are expected to attend all Board and relevant committee meetings.
Details of attendance by Directors at meetings during the year are set out in the table below.
Directors who were unable to attend specific meetings reviewed the relevant papers and provided their comments to the Chairman of the Board or Committee.
Any Director who misses a meeting will, as a matter of course, receive the minutes of that meeting for reference.
