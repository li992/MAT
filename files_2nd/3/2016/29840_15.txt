AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT INTRODUCTION The Audit Committee the Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael Pavia Chairman of the Committee, Julian Schild and Melvin Lawson in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code provision C. 3.1.
Michael Pavia is also identified as having recent and relevant financial experience.
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Attendance at Committee meetings during the current year by Committee members is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 40 of this document.
In accordance with best practice, the Committee has the opportunity, as required, to meet with the external auditor of the Company without the presence of any executive directors and has done so during the current year.
The key responsibilities of the Committee include: reviewing the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and the direction of the external auditor to investigate any matters of particular concern: assessing the effectiveness of the Company s external auditor, including considering the scope and results of the annual audit: reviewing the independence and objectivity of the exter final auditor and assessing any potential impact on objectivity resulting from the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor: monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any for mal announcements relating to the Companys performance: and reviewing the Company s internal financial controls and other internal control and risk management processes.
The senior management team and executive directors periodically review the effectiveness of key internal control and risk management processes within the Company and report any changes in such activities to the Audit Committee and the external auditor for consideration.
The review covers all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls.
THE COMMITTEES ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016 The Committees main activities during the year included a review of the financial statements involving a detailed evaluation of the significant accounting issues therein.

ISSUE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE Operational accuracy of billing system Review of internal analysis and external auditor procedures.
Monitoring of regulator communications Ofgem, BABT and monthly monitoring of detailed call centre statistics which would indicate significant billing issues.
Revenue recognition in relation to energy services Monitoring of key assumptions underlying the recognition of energy revenues based on internal analysis.
Valuation of intangible assets Review of key assumptions underlying the value and recoverability of the intangible asset relating to the energy supply agreement entered into with Npower in December 2013.
Risk of management override of internal controls Review of significant accounting estimates and judgements in relation mainly to receivables balances.
Also, in conjunction with the Companys external auditor, the Audit Committee has considered, amongst other matters, compliance with the provisions of the Code and accounting developments, the Companys financial control environment and its risk management and control processes.
As part of this process the Audit Committee has also considered the need for any special projects or internal investigations and concluded that no such additional projects or investigations have been required.
In accordance with the Code provision C. 3.6, the Audit Committee has also considered the need for an internal audit function at the Company.
In the light of the simplicity of the Group structure, its single country focus, its relatively straightforward financial model, the internal controls in place and the fact that management and the Board conduct regular financial reviews, the Committee has recommended to the Board that an internal audit function is not currently appropriate for the business.
This decision will be kept under regular review and where appropriate extended assurance will also be sought in specific areas of concern.
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Companys half year and annual financial statements.
The Committee has advised the Board that the annual report and accounts taken as a whole provide a fair, balanced and understandable picture of the Companys position and performance, business model and strategy.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS The Companys external auditor, KPMG, presented a detailed audit report to the Audit Committee following a review of the annual financial statements.
Having regard to its review of the work performed by the external auditor during the year and its approach to key audit issues, the Audit Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of KPMG as external auditor.
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee assessed: the efficiency with which the audit team was able to understand the Company and its systems and processes: Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 49 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED the experience and exper tise of the audit team: the scope and eventual fulfilment of the detailed audit plan: the robustness and perceptiveness of the audit team in their handling of key accounting and audit judgements: and the nature and quality of the content of the exter final auditors report.
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board, for approval by shareholders at the AGM, the reappointment of KPMG as the Companys external auditor for the coming year.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE In order to guard against the objectivity and independence of the external auditor being compromised, the provision of any significant additional services remains subject to the prior approval of the Audit Committee.
The Committee would normally be likely to prohibit the provision of the following types of nonaudit related work by the Companys external auditor: book-keeping and work relating to the preparation of accounting records and financial statements that will ultimately be subject to external audit: financial infor mation system design and implementation: appraisal or valuation ser vices in respect of material assets: inter final auditing: investment advice or corporate broking: and any other work where mutual interests exist that could compromise the independence of the exter final auditor.
It is also currently envisaged that in accordance with best practice, tax compliance advice will not be awarded to the external auditor.
REPORTING OF STAFF CONCERNS The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Michael Pavia, is the primary point of contact for staff of the Company to raise, in confidence, concerns they may have over possible improprieties, financial or otherwise.
All employees have been notified of this arrangement in the Staff Handbook and on the Companys intranet website which sets out Michael Pavias contact details Code provision C. 3.5.
No such matters were raised by employees during the current year.
