WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2016 145 How we behave and how were rewarded Compensation Committee Report Statement of share owner voting In 2016, a significant number of share owners voted against the Implementation Report of the Compensation Committee.
The committee understands that the majority of share owners voting against the Implementation Report did so because of the level of the 2015 single figure of the Executive Directors, which was driven largely by the maturity of a legacy five-year long-term incentive plan award under LEAP.
The 2011 LEAP award vested in full, reflecting very strong relative TSR performance and an almost doubling of the Company share price over the five-year investment and performance period.
The committee is content that LEAP has performed as intended and in the manner approved by share owners when the plan was implemented and when the last compensation policy was approved.
The committee would also like to remind share owners that the LEAP program was replaced in 2013 with a new long-term incentive plan, but that the first five-year awards under this plan will not vest until 2018.

2016 was another record year with the Company producing strong net sales and profit growth whilst margins performance was robust.

The weighting of financial objectives 70% and individual strategic objectives 30% will remain unchanged as will the Group financial measures of headline PBT growth, net sales margin improvement and net sales growth.
The committee is of the view that the targets for the STIP are commercially sensitive and it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
To the extent targets are no longer commercially sensitive they will be disclosed at the end of the relevant performance period in that years Annual Report.
WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2016 149 How we behave and how were rewarded Compensation Committee Report Long-term incentives audited 2012 2016 LEAP III awards vesting The 2012 awards were the final awards granted under LEAP III, the long-term incentive plan which in 2013 was replaced by the EPSP.
Vesting of LEAP awards was solely dependent on WPPs relative TSR performance measured in common currency, against a custom group of WPPs comparators Aegis, Arbitron, Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Omnicom, Nielsen and Publicis, weighted by their respective market capitalisation.
Over the five-year investment and performance period, WPP out-performed 95% of the weighted peer group including both Omnicom and Publicis, WPPs largest and most comparable multi-line competitors.
Over the period, WPP delivered TSR of 210% which means that a shareholding of 100 at the start of the period would be worth 310 at the end, including reinvested dividends.
The underlying financial and operational performance was also strong over the five-year period, consistent with the TSR outcome.
Aegis and Arbitron, two of the comparator companies, were taken over during the investment and performance period by Dentsu and Nielsen, respectively.
In line with the guidelines previously established by the committee, the two companies were removed from the comparator group as neither company was listed for more than 40% of the investment and performance period.
WPPs TSR performance relative to the comparator group resulted in a match of 500%, equating to the maximum award.

The 2016 awards are subject to three equally-weighted independent performance conditions, being relative TSR, EPS and ROE.
Performance is measured over the five financial years starting in 2016 as follows: Measure Total Shareholder Return TSR Earnings Per Share EPS Return On Equity ROE Weight One-third One-third One-third Nature Relative to peers WPP growth WPP absolute 1 Performance zone Median to upper decile 7% 14% compound annual growth 15% 18% annual average threshold to maximum Payout Below threshold: 0% of element vests 2 Threshold: 20% of element vests Maximum of above: 100% of element vests Straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum Performance period Five-years ending on 31 December 2020 1 The ROE measure for EPSP awards issued in 2013 and 2014 was a 10% to 14% average return.
2 The Threshold level is proposed to move to 15% from 2017.
As in previous years, WPPs TSR performance is compared to companies representing our most relevant, listed global competitors, weighted by market capitalisation.
In 2016, the comparator group comprised Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis.
TSR performance is calculated on a market  basis in both common and local currency weighted equally.
Using a dual basis ensures that the interests of both local and international investors are reflected in the performance measures.
The following interests were awarded on 28 November 2016 at the preceding five-day average share price of 17.052 ordinary shares or $105.93092 ADRs.

The committee have reviewed both the measures and the targets as part of the review of the Directors Compensation Policy that is being submitted to share owners for approval.
The committee judge that the balance of measures remains appropriate and aligned to the Companys business objectives and that the targets remain challenging and in line with financial forecasts.
WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2016 151 How we behave and how were rewarded Compensation Committee Report Aligning pay and performance As set out in the Directors Compensation Policy, the committees objective is to align variable compensation with the key strategic priorities of WPP, maximising the dynamic between pay and performance.

Relative change in pay for the Group chief executive The following table summarises the change in the Group chief executives base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus, compared to that of full-time employees within the Group.
The higher level of taxable benefits of the chief executive officer is due to the increased cost of insured benefits.
The cost of UK taxable benefits have reduced due to more effective and efficient management of benefit provision.
The benefits received by employees has remained constant.

The annual bonus data for the Group chief executive uses the short-term incentive figures set out on page 146.
2 T aking into account the worldwide structure and size of the Group, and given the need to calculate benefits on the basis that an individual is resident in the UK for tax purposes, collating data on all employees was not practicable.
As a result, the population for the taxable benefits consists of UK employees only.
