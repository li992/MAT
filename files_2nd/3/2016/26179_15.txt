Audit Committee Report continued SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING RISKS The Audit Committee considers the following significant risk in relation to the financial statements: Fair value of investments JLIF is required to determine the fair value of the investments.
Whilst there is an active market for investments of this nature there is not a suitable listed, or other public market in these investments against which their value can benchmarked.
As a result, a valuation is performed based on a discounted cash ow methodology in line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
The calculation of the fair value of the investments carries elements of risk, mainly in relation to the assumptions and judgements made with respect to: the determination of appropriate macroeconomic assumptions underlying the forecast investment cash ows: the impact of project specic matters to the forecast cash ows for each investment: the determination of appropriate discount rates for each investment that is reective of the current market conditions: the determination of appropriate sensitivities to apply to meet the required disclosures: the underlying project financial models may not reect the underlying performance of the investment: the cash ows from the underlying financial models may not take into account current known issues: the updates performed on the underlying financial models may result in errors in forecasting: major maintenance lifecycle is a significant cost in some investments with judgement around timing and quantum.
This can have a significant impact on distributions: and terms and costs of the future renancing of senior debt on certain projects.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Investment Advisers assumptions have been reviewed and challenged for: the macroeconomic assumptions, including comparison of these assumptions to observable market data, actual results and prior year comparatives: and the build-up of the discount rates for consistency and reasonableness, benchmarking against market data and peers and project-specic items.
The Audit Committee is also satisfied that the Portfolio valuation and associated disclosures have been appropriately calculated, ensuring that the investments are brought on balance sheet at fair value and that the independent valuation carried out by an independent rm has been reviewed and challenged by the Audit Committee and that the fair value of the investments is challenged by the Auditor.
INTERNAL AUDIT The Audit Committee shall consider at least once a year whether or not there is a need for an internal audit function.
Currently, the Audit Committee does not consider there to be a need for an internal audit function at the Group level.
However, internal audits of the underlying PPP projects are performed periodically by the Investment Adviser who will report findings to the Audit Committee.
EXTERNAL AUDIT Deloitte LLP has been the Companys external auditor since launch in 2010, and this is its seventh consecutive annual audit.
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference.
The Audit Committee has assessed the quality and the effectiveness of the audit process.
To draw its conclusions, the Audit Committee reviewed: the scope of the audit, the audit fee and the external auditors fullment of the agreed audit plan: the degree of diligence demonstrated by them in the course of their interaction with the Board, the Audit Committee and the Investment Adviser: the external auditors assessment of the Groups financial statement risks: and the report highlighting the matters that arose during the course of the audit and the recommendations made by the external auditor.
The Audit Committee has noted the revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code introduced by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 and the AIC Code of Corporate Governance issued in February 2013 and in particular the recommendation, in each, to put the external audit out to tender every five to ten years.
The Audit Committee has also noted the requirements of The Competition and Markets Authority formerly the UK Competition Commission with respect to external auditor services and retendering.
The Audit Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness and independence of the audit process and as such recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be re-appointed as external auditor for the year ending 31 December 2017.
The Audit Committee also recommended the Audit appointment is retendered every nine years, with the Audit partner changing every five years.
