To assist the Committee with their review, the Committee receives reports and representations from the Manager and the external auditor.
During the year, the Committee considered that the significant issues in relation to the Financial Statements included: Portfolio Valuation The Board receives regular portfolio reports, liquidity information and presentations from the Manager and the Investment Manager.
The Manager employs global pricing policy procedures consistent with current regulations as disclosed in the accounting policies on page 88.

co. uk Conclusion As a result of the work undertaken, the Committee has concluded that the Annual Report for the year ended 31March 2016, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys position and performance, business model and strategy, and has reported on these findings to the Board.
The Boards conclusions in this respect are set out in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities on page 77.
Internal Control The Company does not have an internal audit function of its own because it has no employees.
The Company relies on the internal audit department of Franklin Templeton to report any material failings or weaknesses.
The Board monitors the risk management and system of internal controls on an ongoing basis and the Company also engages Franklin Templetons internal audit function to carry out a review of specific areas that the Audit Committee deems necessary.
The Audit Committee meets representatives of the Manager and Investment Manager, including their internal auditors, risk manager and their compliance officer, who report as to the proper conduct of business in accordance with the regulatory environment in which both the Company and the Manager and Investment Manager operate.
The meeting held with the internal auditors is conducted on a private basis, with no other representation from the Manager or the Investment Manager.
The Committee reviewed the Company risk map.
The risk map explained the key risks identified by the Company in detail, assessing the likelihood of the risk materialising and the impact this would have on the Company.
It also identified the key operational procedures and oversight by the Manager and the Board.
During the year, the Audit Committee additionally reviewed the following significant items: Counterparty Credit Oversight The review considered the risk that the Companys counterparties default on payment or delivery of portfolio and cash transactions.
This included a review of the primary and mitigating controls implemented by the Manager and Investment Manager.
Global Custody Review This annual review evaluated JPMorgan Chase Banks global custody and sub-custody network.
Key Service Providers This review assessed the value and quality of services provided to the Company by third parties.
co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 75 Report of the Audit Committee continued Auditor Assessment and Independence TEMITs external auditor, Deloitte LLP, has been the Companys auditor since 27 August 2009.
The Audit Committee reviewed the services provided by the auditor.
The previous audit tender was conducted within the last ten years, therefore the Company is compliant with the latest corporate governance provisions relating to auditor tenure.
In addition, Deloitte rotated the audit partner responsible for the Company audit in 2013.
It is expected that an audit tender will be held by 2019 to coincide with the 10 year anniversary of Deloittes appointment.
To assess the effectiveness of the external audit process, the auditor is asked, on an annual basis, to set out the steps that they have taken to ensure objectivity and independence.
The auditors performance, behaviour and effectiveness during the exercise of its duties are monitored during the year by the Audit Committee.
The Committee also receives an annual independent Audit Quality Review from the Financial Reporting Council which monitors audit quality of the major audit firms in the UK.
The Committee also reviewed Deloittes independence policies and procedures including quality assurance procedures and concluded they were satisfactory.
Performance of any non-audit services must be approved in advance by the Committee and in consideration of the recommendations of the Accounting Practices Board.
All costs for non-audit services are considered to be appropriate relative to fees paid for audit services.
An engagement letter is issued for all non-audit work and subsequently reviewed by the Committee to ensure that the independence and objectivity of the auditor is safeguarded.
During the year, Deloitte were also engaged to perform a review of the Half-Yearly Report.
The Committee therefore confirms that the non-audit work undertaken by the auditor satisfies and does not compromise the tests of the auditors independence, objectivity, effectiveness, resources and qualification.
The fees in the year were as follows: 2016 2015 Audit Services 29,500 28,750 Non Audit Services: Half-Yearly Review 4,950 4,850 TEMIT is able to rely on the Financial Reporting Act Dual-listed Issuers Exemption Notice, issued on 27 March 2013 which exempts it from requirements in the New Zealand Financial Reporting Act 1993.
This exemption recognises that companies with a primary listing in the United Kingdom prepare Financial Statements and are audited in accordance with UK requirements.
This allows TEMIT to be exempted from the New Zealand requirement that firms be audited by a New Zealand unlimited liability entity.
Based on their review, the Committee recommends that Deloitte LLP is re-appointed as the Companys auditor.
