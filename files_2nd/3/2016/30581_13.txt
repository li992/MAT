The Association of Investment Companies AIC publishes a Code of Corporate Governance AIC Code and a Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies AIC Guide.
In March 2015 the AIC published a revised AIC Code and AIC Guide to reflect changes made to the UK Code in September 2014.
The Financial Reporting Council has confirmed that by following the AIC Code and the AIC Guide, boards of investment companies will meet their obligations in relation to the UK Code and paragraph 9.8.
The AIC Code and AIC Guide address the principles set out in the UK Code as well as additional principles and recommendations on issues that are specific to investment trusts.

The Board considers that reporting against the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code, and by reference to the AIC Guide which incorporates the UK Corporate Governance Code, will provide better information to shareholders.
The Company has complied with the recommendations ofthe AIC Code and the relevant provisions of the UKCorporate Governance Code, except as follows: The UK Corporate Governance Code includes certain provisions relating to: directors tenure the roles of the chief executive executive directors remuneration the need for an internal audit function For the reasons set out in the AIC Guide, and as explained in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board considers these provisions are not relevant to the position of the Company, being an externally managed investment company.
In particular, all of the Companys day-to-day management and administrative functions are outsourced to third parties.
As a result, the Company has no executive directors, employees or internal operations.
Therefore with the exception of Director tenure, which is addressed further on page 30, and the need for an internal audit function which is addressed further on page 37, the Company has not reported further in respect of these provisions.
The Board attaches great importance to the matters contained in the AIC Code and observed the relevant requirements throughout the year under review.
The Board has considered the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code by reference to the AIC Guide and the Board believes that the Companys current practices are consistent in all material respects with the principles of the AIC Code.
Where non-compliance occurs, an explanation has been provided.
The Board will continue to observe the principles and recommendations set out in the AIC Code in future.
The Principles of the AIC Code The AIC Code is made up of twenty-one principles split into three sections covering: - The Board - Board Meetings and relations with the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager - Shareholder Communications Worldwide Healthcare Trust PLC 29 Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016 The Board AIC Code Principle Compliance Statement 1.

The Board subscribes to the view expressed within the AIC Code that long-serving Directors should not be prevented from forming part of an independent majority.
It does not consider that a Directors tenure necessarily reduces their ability to act independently and, following formal performance evaluations, believes that each of the independent Directors is independent in character and judgment and that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect their judgment.
The Boards policy on tenure is that continuity and experience are considered to add significantly to the strength of the Board and, as such, no limit on the overall length of service of any of the Companys Directors, including the Chairman, has been imposed.
In view of its non-executive nature, the Board considers that it is not appropriate for the Directors to be appointed for a specified term, although new Directors are appointed with the expectation that they will serve for a minimum period of three years subject to shareholder approval.
The terms and conditions of the Directors appointments are set out in letters of appointment which are available for inspection on request at the office of the Companys AIFM and at the Annual General Meeting.
