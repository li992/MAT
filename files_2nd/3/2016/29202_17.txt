INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE Year ended Year ended The Group has a 49% interest in Senior Flexonics Technologies Wuhan Limited, a jointly controlled entity incorporated in China, which was set 2016 2015 up in 2012.
Senior Flexonics Technologies Wuhan Limited is a precision manufacturer of automotive components.
m m Aerostructures 164.4 143.4 The results of the joint venture are accounted for using equity accounting.
Fluid Systems 75.8 71.8 The Group's investment of 1.7m represents the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets as at 31 December 2016.
Flexonics 78.6 69.3 Total 318.8 284.5 The following amounts represent the aggregate amounts relating to the revenue and expenses and assets and liabilities of Senior Flexonics Technologies Wuhan Limited for the years ended 31 December 2016 and December 2015.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The 2016 goodwill 2016 2015 impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2016.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations.
The key m m assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to business performance over the next five years, long-term growth rates beyond Revenue 7.8 5.3 2021 and the discount rates applied.
The key judgements are the level of revenue and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating Expenses 6.5 4.5 profit converted into cash flow in each year.
The forecast compound annual growth rate in revenue to 2021 are in the range from 6% to 10%.
Profit 1.3 0.8 Forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets and strategies, as approved by management for the next four years and supplemented by forecasts of performance for a further one year.
These estimates, where appropriate, take account of the current economic environment as set out in Total assets 7.4 5.6 the Strategic Report on page 1 to 35.
Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated long-term growth rates.
For Aerostructures Total liabilities 4.0 3.4 and Fluid Systems, cash flows extrapolated beyond 2021 are based on growth rates of 3.0% per annum which do not exceed the long-term average Net assets 3.4 2.2 growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier.
For Flexonics, cash flows extrapolated beyond 2021 are based on world long-term forecast GDP growth for advanced economies of 1.6% per annum.
Groups share of profit 0.7 0.4 Groups share of net assets 1.7 1.1 The cash flow forecasts have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU group and discounted to present value using the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 9.4% 2015 9.7% which is the measurement used by management in assessing investment At the year-end, the Group had provided loans of 0.9m 2015 1.2m to the joint venture: nil 2015 0.1m is reported as a current asset and appraisals.
The specific risk adjustments to the cash flow forecasts are equivalent to increasing the pre-tax discount rate from the WACC by 0.9m 2015 1.1m as a non-current asset.
0.9percentage points for Aerostructures and Fluid Systems and 1.7 percentage points for Flexonics.
During the year, 0.5m of the loans were repaid 2015 0.1m issued, offset by 0.2m of foreign exchange gains.
Sensitivities have also been considered for each CGU group in relation to the value in use calculations: the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced to 1 percentage point and the discount rate was increased by a 1 percentage point.
This did not result in the carrying amount of the CGU 16.

BANK OVERDRAFTS AND LOANS CONTINUED 20.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: All the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
Internally, the Group aims for this ratio to be between 0.5x and 1.5x.
At 31 December 2016, net debt was 1.7x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2015 1.4x.
Year ended Year ended 2016 2015 In addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover the number of times net interest is covered by the Groups % % EBITDA to be in excess of 3.5x.

Therefore, the Bank loans and overdrafts 1.25 1.00 Group currently has considerable funding headroom.

The cash Bank loans and overdrafts of 49.3m 2015 67.8m are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Other generated by the Group in recent years has led to the gearing ratio being lower than the targeted range.
borrowings are mainly arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
No interest rate swaps were taken out in 2015 or 2016.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

Compliance with policies and exposures limits is reviewed by the 222.2 217.8 Groups Treasury Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The fair value of Other loans has been determined by applying a make-whole calculation using the prevailing treasury bill yields plus the applicable credit spread for the Group.
Foreign exchange risk management The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations trading activities in foreign The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: currencies.
Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, with all Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The effective interest rates on bank overdrafts are determined based on appropriate LIBOR rates plus other variables held constant such as interest rates.

TAX BALANCE SHEET Fair values Current tax The following table presents an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into The current tax receivable of 0.7m 2015 5.1m includes excess tax paid to tax authorities that is expected to be recovered within 12 months Levels 1 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: by way of offset against future tax liabilities orrefund as well as research and development tax credits receivable.
Level 1 those fair values derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: The majority of the Groups taxable profits arise in countries, including the US, where the estimated tax liabilities are paid in on account instalments during the year to which they relate and are largely paid at the balance sheet date.
The current tax liability of 21.5m 2015 20.5m represents Level 2 those fair values derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 1.8m 2015 2.8m tax due on profits of the current and prior years as well as 19.7m 2015 17.7m provisions for tax uncertainties that either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and could by their nature fall due within 12 months.
The provision for tax uncertainties has increased during the year due to the effects of exchange translation.
Level 3 those fair values derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of tax for items which are considered to have a range of possible tax outcomes.
These uncertainties There has not been any transfer of assets or liabilities between levels.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
Level 2 fair values are exist due to a number of factors including differing interpretations of local tax laws, uncertainties arising from the OECDs BEPS project actions and the determination of appropriate arms length pricing in accordance with OECD transfer pricing principles on internal transactions and financing derived from future cash flows of open forward contracts at 31 December, translated by the difference between contractual rates and observable forward exchange rates.
The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the carrying amounts relate to the estimated tax which could be payable as a result of differing interpretations and decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total for tax purposes is uncertain.
