They are David Jeffcoat Chairman, Richard Rae and Julia Le Blan.
The members biographies can be found on page 18.
Key Objective: The objective of the Committee is to provide assurance to the Board as to the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls and the integrity of its financial records and externally published results.
In doing so the Committee operates within terms of reference that have been agreed by the Board.
These terms of reference are reviewed annually and are available upon request.
They will also be available for inspection at the AGM.
Principal Responsibilities: Under its terms of reference the Committee has been given the following key responsibilities: ensuring that all of the Companys principal risks are identified: monitoring the mitigating controls that have been established: monitoring compliance with the relevant statutory, regulatory and taxation requirements for a UK based investment trust: reviewing the Companys financial statements, the accounting policies adopted and the main judgemental areas: ensuring that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable: agreeing the external Auditors terms of appointment, determining the independence and objectivity of the Auditor and assessing the effectiveness of the audit: and considering whether it is appropriate for certain non-audit services to be carried out by the Auditor.
The Chairman reports formally to the Board on the Committees proceedings after each meeting.
To assist with the various duties of the Committee, a meeting Plan has been adopted which is reviewed annually.

An additional meeting was held in December 2016.
Representatives of Aberforth Partners LLP, who provide the Company with Secretarial services, attended all of the meetings.
Deloitte LLP Deloitte, the external auditor, attended the meetings in January and October.
During the last twelve months the Committee has focused on the areas described below.

Therefore the Committees business in July was focussed on a discussion, with supporting documentation from the Secretaries, on the preparation and content of the Half Yearly Report, together with other aspects such as going concern.
In January 2017 the Committee received a report and supporting presentation from the external Auditor on its audit of the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2016.
This included details of the steps it had taken to confirm the valuation and ownership of the investment portfolio.
In addition, the Secretaries reported on the preparation of the financial results and other relevant matters.
The Committee considered these reports in detail and took further comfort from the internal control review discussed below.
The Chairman of the Committee had previously discussed the result of the audit and the Annual Report with the audit partner without representatives of Aberforth Partners being present.
Consequently, the Committee concluded that it was satisfied as to: the ownership and valuation of the investment portfolio as at 31 December 2016: revenue recognition including dividend completeness and the accounting treatment of each special dividend recognised during the period: and the allocation of expenses between revenue and capital.
The Committee read and discussed this Annual Report and concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable.
It provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, objective and strategy.
As a result the Committee agreed that it could recommend to the Board that the financial statements be approved for publication.
Going Concern and Viability The Committee received reports on going concern from the Secretaries in July and January, reflecting the guidance published by the Financial Reporting Council.
The content of the investment portfolio, trading activity, portfolio diversification and the existing debt facility were also discussed.
After due consideration, the Committee concluded it was appropriate to prepare the Companys accounts on a going concern basis and made this recommendation to the Board.
The relatively high level of liquidity of the portfolio was the main factor that led to this conclusion.
The Committee also assessed the viability of the Company.
The Committee agreed that it was appropriate to provide a Viability Statement for a five year period for the reasons set out in the Statement on page 5.
In January 2017, the Committee conducted a series of stress tests that considered the impact of severe market downturn scenarios on Shareholders funds, the debt facility, investment income and also the potential loss of investment trust status.
The outcome of this activity led the Committee to recommend to the Board to make the Statement on page 5.
Internal Control and Risks The Committee carefully considered a Matrix of the Companys principal risks and the mitigating controls at each meeting.
In October the risks and controls were addressed in more detail.
The Committee enhanced the content of the Matrix during the year and believes that it continues to reflect accurately the Companys principal risks.
These risks, which are detailed on page 5 of this Report, have not changed significantly during the year.
Also in October the Committee received the Managers report on internal controls, including the assurance report issued by  LLP PwC on the nature and effectiveness of the control framework that has been established by the Managers.
A representative of PwC attended the meeting.
In addition, the Committee received internal control reports from Northern Trust and Capita Registrars.
The Committee reviewed these reports and concluded that there were no significant control weaknesses or other issues that needed to be brought to the Boards attention.
The Committee continues to closely monitor the increasing risk arising from cyber threats, notwithstanding that the Company outsources all of its activities to external parties.
In July 2016, the Committee received a presentation from Capita Registrars on cyber security and the measures in place to protect shareholder information.
This meeting was also attended by Paul Trickett and Paula Hay-Plumb.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Committee also received reports outlining the key information security controls in place to protect the Managers IT systems and the assurance that has been gained during the year about their effectiveness The Committee concluded that, although cyber attack is becoming an increasing threat to companies and public bodies worldwide, the Company has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate protection measures are in place.
Nevertheless this particular threat will continue to be monitored closely in future.
The Committee also discussed whether there was a need for a dedicated internal audit function.
The Committee concluded that, as the Company has no employees and sub-contracts all of its operations to key third party suppliers, an internal audit function is not necessary.
Governance Report Aberforth Smaller Companies Trust plc 27 143471 ASCOT AR Txt PRINT 143471 ASCOT Txt V9 27 01 2017 14:26 Page 28 Audit Committee Report Investment Trust Status It is essential for the Company to maintain its investment trust status.
The Committee confirms this point at each meeting with reference to a checklist prepared by the Secretaries.
The position is also confirmed by the external auditor as part of the audit process.
External Auditor Deloitte was appointed as the Companys auditor in April 2013 following a formal tender process.
This appointment has been renewed at each subsequent AGM.
Based upon existing legislation, another tender process would not be required until 2023.
Audit Planning and Audit Fees The external audit partner from Deloitte presented the detailed audit plan to the Committee in October in advance of the 2016 audit.
The plan set out the scope of the audit, the principal risks that would be addressed as detailed in the Independent Auditor's Report, the timetable and the proposed fees.
These amounted to 19,500, excluding VAT, for the year 2015: 19,500.
There were no non-audit activities carried out by Deloitte.
Evaluation of the Auditor Following the completion of the audit in January 2017, the Committee reviewed the Auditors effectiveness.
The Committee acknowledged that the audit team comprised staff with appropriate levels of knowledge and experience and that Andrew Partridge, the audit partner, who has significant experience of the investment trust sector, had served for four reporting years.
The audit partner is rotated every five years.
The Committee noted positive feedback from the Secretaries on Deloitte's performance on the audit.
Additionally Deloitte had provided confirmation that it had complied with the relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements on independence.
Taking these factors into account, the Committee is satisfied that the external audit was carried out effectively.
It has therefore recommended the re-appointment of Deloitte as the Company's auditor for the 2017 financial year.
The Board has given its support and a proposal will be put to Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Committee Evaluation A formal external review of the Committees effectiveness, using an evaluation questionnaire, was undertaken during the year.
This was facilitated by Lintstock Limited.
The outcome was positive with no significant concerns expressed.
