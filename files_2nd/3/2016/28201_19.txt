In 2016, Martin Payne had a maximum bonus potential of 100% of annual salary time pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year that he was employed by Polypipe.
The current policy is that Martin Payne will receive an annual LTIP award of shares worth 100% of annual salary.
His first LTIP award was granted in May 2016 shortly after he commenced employment with Polypipe and was time pro-rated to reflect the fact that he will be employed for only part of the three-year period to which the award relates.

The original buy-out award disclosed in our Stock Exchange announcement of 31 May 2016 was over 49,800 shares which was an estimate of the value of the bonus that would be forfeited by Martin Payne.
Following his appointment at Polypipe, Martin Payne received a cash bonus from Norcros plc in relation to the year of his departure although he still forfeited a deferred share bonus.
The original buy-out award was accordingly reduced to 20,898 shares to reflect the value of the cash bonus that was received from Norcros plc.
All of these non-pensionable share awards were granted under a deed in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.
2R 2 of the Listing Rules in order to facilitate the recruitment of Martin Payne as permitted by the Approach to Recruitment Remuneration section of our Policy Report.
Other significant terms of these awards are as follows: { Awards were granted as nil cost options exercisable from their respective vesting dates until the tenth anniversary of grant.
At its discretion, the Committee may permit settlement in cash.
{ The number of shares was calculated using the share price of 3.226 per share being the average closing share price for 25-27 May 2016 the three dealing days prior to grant.
The value of the shares in the above table is based on this share price.
{ With the exception of shares vesting in September 2016, the number of shares under award will be increased to reflect dividends with a record date between the date Martin Payne commenced employment with the Company and the vesting date.
The value of the dividends will be determined as if they had been reinvested into Company shares on such terms as the Committee will determine.
{ In such circumstances as the Committee determines appropriate, including if a material misstatement of Norcros plcs audited financial results in relation to which a buy-out award is being granted subsequently comes to light or if evidence comes to light of material misconduct by the individual, then the Committee has the flexibility to withhold the buy-out awards.
{ Awards will be satisfied by existing shares other than treasury shares.
com Stock Code: PLP STRA OUR GOVERNANCE TEGIC REPORT { Ordinarily unvested buy-out awards would lapse on cessation of employment.
However, if Martin Payne ceases to hold office or employment in good leaver circumstances including death, ill-health, injury or disability or any other reason at the Committees discretion except in circumstances justifying summary dismissal, unvested awards would become exercisable on a time pro-rated basis unless the Committee determines otherwise either at the original vesting date or the date of cessation of employment at the Committees discretion.
{ In the event of a change of control other than an internal reorganisation of the Polypipe Group, unvested awards would become exercisable on a time pro-rated basis unless the Committee determines otherwise.
{ The Committee may allow some or all of the award to vest or adjust the number of shares subject to the award in the event of demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in their opinion, would affect the current or future value of the award.
The number of shares subject to the award may also be adjusted in the event of any variation of share capital.
{ No further awards will be made under the arrangement and no amendments will be made to the advantage of Martin Payne in relation to i the basis for determining his entitlement to, and the terms of, shares to be provided under the award: and ii any adjustment that may be made for any variation of share capital or special dividend without prior shareholder approval in general meeting except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the award, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment.
{ The award is personal to Martin Payne and cannot be transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of by him other than to his personal representative following his death.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors in 2016 was 125% of annual salary for David Hall and 100% of annual salary for both Martin Payne and Peter Shepherd time pro-rated in both cases to their proportion of the year that they were employed by Polypipe.
For David Hall and Martin Payne, 75% of the bonus earned will be paid in cash and 25% will be deferred into shares under the DSBP.
