Although the fair values of the Groups investments in subsidiaries are not included in the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, additional disclosures are provided in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
This is a significant performance metric for the Group.
Financial instruments subsidiary preferred shares Certain of the Groups subsidiaries have outstanding preferred shares which have been classified as subsidiary preferred shares in current liabilities as the subsidiaries have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other assets to the holders under certain future liquidity events, and or a requirement to deliver an uncertain number of common shares upon conversion.
Significant judgement is used in determining the classification of these financial instruments in terms of liability or equity and significant estimates are made when determining the appropriate valuation methodology and deriving the estimated fair value of the subsidiary preferred shares.
