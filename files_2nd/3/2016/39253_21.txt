Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of the changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups longterm debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The Group uses c Market Risk interest rate derivatives to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, as a result of the use of interest rate swaps and caps, the majority of the Groups Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its borrowings were at fixed interest rates.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Groups EPRA earnings have limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations until the repayment dates of the loans for which the interest rate swaps and caps have been arranged.
Please see Note 21 for further details on the Groups interest rate swap and cap agreements.

Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk, primarily with respect to the Euro EUR.
Fair value of financial instruments The Group no longer has exposure to the Australian Dollar AUD and Swiss Franc CHF following the disposal of the assets denominated in these currencies in the year Basis for determining fair values ended 31 August 2015.
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Foreign exchange risk arises from the Groups exposure to monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations recognised in EUR.
The Groups Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument.
investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are not hedged as the currency positions are considered to be longterm in nature.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
This category includes instruments valued using: Foreign exchange risk also arises on the payment of the Groups dividend to its JSE shareholders in South African Rand ZAR bi annually.

Structural risk Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.
This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted The investments in subsidiaries in Germany and historically the Netherlands and Switzerland represent structural currency risk as these investments have functional currencies prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.

Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include riskfree and benchmark interest rates, credit spreads and other premia used in estimating discount 31 August 31 August rates, foreign currency exchange rates and expected price volatilities and correlations.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value determination that 2016 2015 reflects the price of the financial instrument at the reporting date that would have been determined by market participants acting at arms length.
m m Assets The Group uses widely recognised valuation models for determining the fair value of common and more simple financial instruments such as interest rate swaps that use only observable market data and require little management judgement and estimation.
Observable prices and model inputs are usually available in the market for simple over the EUR 291.5 249.7 counter derivatives, e. g. interest rate swaps.
Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and also CHF 23.6 reduces the uncertainty associated with determination of fair values.
Availability of observable market prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and is ZAR 2.2 0.5 prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
