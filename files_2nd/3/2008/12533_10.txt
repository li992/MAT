GOVERNANCE 31 NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Nomination Committee meets as and when required and comprises Sir David John Chairman, Messrs J Darby, S C Lockett, J R W Orange and Professor D G Roberts.
The Board considers the membership of the Nomination Committee to be in compliance with the Combined Code.
The Committee met once in 2008.
Formal meetings are held to consider standing items of business: there is also a significant level of ad hoc discussion between members of the Committee, particularly when a recruitment exercise is taking place.
The role of the Nomination Committee includes: reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and to make recommendations to the Board with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary.
This requires an ongoing assessment of the appropriate skills-mix required at Board level in light of the strategy of the company in the medium-term: responsibility for identifying and nominating candidates, subject to Board approval, to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise and to prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment: and the assessment of time required to fulfil the role of Chairman, senior independent director and non-executive director, ensuring that current members of the Board have devoted sufficient time to their duties and that any candidates have sufficient time to undertake the roles.
The Nomination Committee, together with the Board, addresses the companys succession plans.
The Board also considers succession planning for senior corporate executives, with the Nomination Committee focusing more specifically on succession planning for members of the Board.
The appointment of Messrs D C Lindsell and M Romieu to the Board in January 2008 helped to maintain the balance of the Board ahead of the retirement of Messrs S J Dobbie and R V Emerson in June.
