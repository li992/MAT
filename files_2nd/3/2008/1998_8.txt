Governance corporate Governance report 42 corporate Governance report The Company is committed to attaining high standards of Corporate Governance in accordance with the principles of Corporate Governance contained in the 2006 Combined Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council the Combined Code, and for which the Board is accountable to shareholders.
This report, together with the Directors Remuneration Report, where applicable, describes how the Board has applied the main and supporting principles of the Combined Code.
Statement of compliance The Board considers that it complied throughout the year with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code, except in the following area: Code provision A.
3.2 requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent Non-executive Directors.
Whilst the Company achieved a balanced and independent Board as required by the Code at the start and end of the year, it did not maintain this balance between 5 September and 1 October 2007.
The role of the Board The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board as a whole.
The key task of the Board is to formulate strategy and to monitor the operating and financial performance of the Group in pursuit of the Groups strategic long-term objectives.
In particular these include the annual budget, share capital changes, approval of interim and annual results, treasury policy, dividend policy, shareholder distributions, Corporate Governance matters and the maintenance and review of the Groups system of internal control.
Formal Board meetings were held six times during the year under review.
There were no absences from any Board meetings by any Director except that Mr Mike Tanner did not attend the meetings held on 5 March and 18 April 2008 due to other commitments.
The Board also schedules additional meetings in relation to certain corporate projects and to fulfil legal obligations.
In addition to the formal meetings of the whole Board, the Non-executive Directors meet with the Group Chairman in the months not covered by a Board meeting.
The Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director are invited to attend these meetings in part, to provide an update on the business activities of the Group.
The Non-executive Directors meet at least annually without the Group Chairman present, chaired by the Senior Independent Director, Mr David Howell.
Board papers and agendas are sent out a week prior to each meeting, thus allowing sufficient time for detailed review and consideration of the documents beforehand.
In addition, the Board is supplied with comprehensive management information on a regular basis, including on a monthly basis, a detailed Group management accounts pack that reports the actual and forecast financial performance, in addition to other key performance indicators across the Group.
The Company has in place an appropriate policy which insures Directors against certain liabilities, including legal costs, which they may incur in carrying out their duties.
The Board and Directors At the date of this report the Board comprises of eight Directors: the Chairman, four Executive Directors and three independent Non-executive Directors following the resignation of Mr Mike Tanner on 27 June 2008.
During the year Berkeley moved from having an Executive Chairman to having a Non-executive Chairman.
As a consequence, while the Board does not currently have the balance between Executive and Non-executive Directors envisaged by the Code, Berkeley is of the opinion that the overall balance remains the same and is appropriate for the effective operation of the Board.
Notwithstanding this, the Board is looking for an additional Non-executive Director of the appropriate calibre and with skills that complement the existing Non-executive Directors.
The Board considers that all the Non-executive Directors Messrs. David Howell, Alan Coppin and John Armitt have skills and experience complementary to the Executive Directors, offer independent judgement when required and remain independent.
Brief biographies appear on page 28.
The Group Executive Directors do not hold any Non-executive Director appointments or commitments required to be disclosed under the Combined Code.
Mr Roger Lewis retired from the Board at the end of July 2007 and Mrs Victoria Mitchell, already a Non-executive Director, became Non-executive Chairman with effect from the beginning of August 2007.
Mr David Howell became Senior Independent Director on 5 September 2007, upon the retirement of Mr Tony Palmer from the Board.
Mr John Armitt was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2007.
The roles of Group Chairman and Group Managing Director are separately held and there are clear written guidelines to support the division of responsibility between them.

The Group Managing Director has day-to-day executive responsibility for the running of the Groups businesses.
His role is to develop and deliver the strategy to enable the Group to meet its objectives.

43 An induction programme is provided for new Directors, which includes the provision of a comprehensive set of background information on the Group, one-to-one meetings with all Directors and key staff as well as visits to major sites.

Governance Governance corporate Governance report 44 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED The Committee has a policy on the use of the auditors for non-audit services in order to safeguard auditor independence, with a pre-determined limit above which approval of the Audit Committee is required and identifies certain areas of work from which the auditors are precluded.
Tax and due diligence services are provided by a small number of different firms, including the Groups auditors.
The auditors may be used for such services where their knowledge of the business is such that they are deemed the most appropriate supplier.
Notwithstanding these safeguards, all non-audit work carried out by the auditors is notified to the Audit Committee Chairman on an ongoing basis and formally reported to the Audit Committee at each meeting.
The auditors have open recourse to the Non-executive Directors, should they consider it necessary, and there is open dialogue between the auditors and the Chairman of the Audit Committee before each Audit Committee meeting.

Key risks and internal control The Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for the Companys system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board confirms that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks of the Group has been in place from the start of the year to the date on which the 2008 Annual Report and Accounts were approved.
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board and is in accordance with the revised Turnbull guidance issued in 2005, and includes an annual review by the Directors of the operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control as part of its year end procedures.
Internal control procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In conducting these reviews, the Board has taken into consideration the following established framework of internal controls within the Group: 45 Clear organisational structure The Group operates through autonomous divisions and operating companies, each with its own Board.
Operating company boards meet on a weekly basis and divisional boards on a monthly basis, and comprehensive information is prepared for such meetings on a standardised basis to cover all aspects of the business.
Formal reporting lines and delegated levels of authority exist within this structure and review of risk and performance occurs at multiple levels throughout both the operating companies and divisions, and the Group.
Risk assessment Risk reporting is embedded within ongoing management reporting throughout the Group.
At operating company and divisional level, Board meeting agendas and packs are structured around the key risks facing the Group.
These include sales demand risk, production risk build cost and programme, land and planning risk as well as a review of specific site risks.
In addition, there is a formalised process whereby each division produces quarterly risk and control reports that identify significant risks, the potential impact and the actions being taken to mitigate the risks.
These risk reports are reviewed and updated regularly and reviewed quarterly by the Board.
Berkeley has a variety of systems in place to address the sustainability risks associated with its operations, these include: A Land Acquisition Sustainability Risk Assessment Checklist Sustainability issues are incorporated within Strategic Risk Registers for each project Each division has processes in place to ensure that sustainability is managed during the construction phase, which includes signing all sites up to the Considerate Constructors Scheme Financial reporting A comprehensive budgeting and real-time forecasting system, covering both profit and cash, operates within the Group.
This enables executive management to view key financial and operating data on a daily basis.
On a weekly and monthly basis more formal reporting up to the Group executive and the Board is prepared.
The results of all operating units are reported monthly and compared to budget and forecast.
Policies and procedures Policies and procedures, including operating and financial controls, are detailed in policies and procedures manuals that are refreshed and improved as appropriate.
Training to staff is given where necessary.
Central functions Where appropriate, strong central functions, such as Group Legal, Group Health & Safety and Company Secretarial, provide support and consistency to the rest of the Group.
In addition, the principal treasury-related risks, decisions and control processes are managed by the Group Finance function, under the direction of the Group Finance Director.
Investment and contracting controls The Group has clearly defined guidelines for the purchase and sale of land within the Group, which include detailed environmental, planning and financial appraisal and are subject to executive authorisation.
Rigorous procedures are also followed for the selection of consultants and contractors.
The review and monitoring of all build programmes and budgets are a fundamental element of the Companys financial reporting cycle.
Internal audit Internal auditors are in place in each division and at Group to provide assurance on the operation of the Groups control framework.
Whistleblowing The Group has a whistleblowing policy which has been communicated to all staff, where Directors, management and staff can report in confidence any concerns they may have of malpractice, financial irregularity, breaches of any Group procedures, or other matters.

For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
