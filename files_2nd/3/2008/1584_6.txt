Composition and Operation of the Board The Board comprises four non-executive directors three of whom are independent, and two executive directors.

The executive directors provide the necessary skills in commercial, operational and financial management.

The four non-executive directors provide a blend of experience to enable them to bring strong independent judgement and considerable knowledge and experience to the Board's deliberations.
Mr. McMonigall is the senior independent non-executive director.
The Board has considered the independence of the non-executive directors and believes that all are currently independent of management and free from any material business or other relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement, with the exception of Mr. Gaunt who served as an executive director through the end of 2005.
Mr. McMonigalls service to the Board has been extraordinary since the companys founding and his continued service is of high benefit notwithstanding his tenure of over ten years.
The directors biographies appear on page 8.
These demonstrate that the directors have a range of experience and are of sufficient calibre to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources, finance, controls and standards of conduct.
The Board in recent years has not sat with a permanent chairman, but rather the chair rotated amongst the senior non-executive members present at the meeting, with the meetings chair sitting until the next meeting.
This arrangement has been in place whilst the Board continues to search for an appropriate chairman.
A broad range of candidates were considered during 2008.
A candidate for chairman was to be passed to the committee for approval during year, but fell ill prior to his nomination and his candidacy was withdrawn.
Additional candidates are being considered as of the date of this report, with an appointment announcement expected imminently.
The Board is structured to ensure that there is no undue dominance by the executive directors, with controls over compensation and all other material matters reserved for the Board rather than individual executives, as discussed below.
The Board is satisfied that the appropriate balance has been consistently achieved.
The terms and conditions of employment of the non-executives are available for inspection at any time at the registered office.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the company.
A statement of the directors' responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 23.

Committees The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nominations Committee to deal with specific aspects of the company's affairs: Audit Committee.
The members of the audit committee are Messrs. McMonigall, Ariko and Perle.
Each of Messrs. McMonigall and Ariko have significant financial expertise, and each have served as the chair at times during 2008.
The committees terms of reference include, among other things, monitoring the scope and results of the external audit, the review of interim and annual results, the involvement of the external auditors in those processes, review of whistle blowing procedures, considering compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and for advising the Board on the requirement to maintain an effective system of internal controls.
The committee also keeps under review the independence and objectivity of the group's external auditors, value for money of the audit and the nature, extent and cost-effectiveness of the non-audit services provided by the auditors.
The committee has authority over the appointment, remuneration and resignation or dismissal of the company's auditors.
The committee has discussed with the external auditors their independence, and has received and reviewed written disclosures from the external auditors regarding independence.
Non-audit work is generally put out to tender.
In most cases, the company engages another independent firm of accountants to perform tax consulting work to avoid the possibility that the auditors' objectivity and independence could be compromised: work is only carried out by the auditors in cases where they are best suited to perform the work, for example, tax compliance.
The company does not award general consulting work to the auditors.
However, from time to time, the company will engage the auditors on matters relating to acquisition accounting and due diligence.
In these circumstances, the Chief Financial Officer seeks approval from the committee.
The committee meets at least four times a year, and always prior to the announcement of interim or annual results.
The external auditors and Chief Financial Officer attend all meetings in order to ensure that all the information required by the committee is available for it to operate effectively.
The entire committee also meets each quarter with the external auditors without any executive directors present.
A description of the composition, responsibility and operation of the remuneration committee is set out in the remuneration report beginning on page 16.
The committee currently consists of Messrs. Ariko and Perle, with Mr. Perle in the chair.
The Nominations Committee has responsibility for proposing to the Board new appointments of executive and non-executive directors and makes recommendations to the Board on board composition and balance.
The committee identifies and nominates for approval candidates for new Board positions and to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise.
Nominations are based on the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board.
The committee also reviews the time required from a non-executive director.
The committee strives to consider candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, also taking into account what skills and expertise are needed on the Board in the future.
In conducting its duties the committee may seek external advice.
The Company Secretary is secretary to all committees.
No one other than committee chairmen and members are entitled to be present at a meeting of the nomination, audit or remuneration committees, but others may attend at the invitation of the committee.
Terms of references of the committees of the Board are available from the Company Secretary upon request.
Performance Evaluations The members of the Board evaluate the performance of the Board, its committees and individual members at meetings, at the first meeting following the end of the year.
The non-executive directors, led by the senior independent director, are responsible for the scope of the evaluation, taking into account the views of executive directors.

Significant Risks The company has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the company that has been in place for 2008 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and financial statements.
Principal controls are managed by the executive directors and key employees, including regular review by management and the Board of the operations and the financial statements of the company.
Autonomy Corporation plc 14 Corporate Governance Statement Internal Control The Board is responsible for the companys system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness with regard to achieving the companys business objectives and enhancing shareholder value.
Such a system is designed to manage the risk of failure, and by its nature can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The system has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of these financial statements.
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the companys internal control systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, and believes the system is in accordance with the revised Turnbull guidance.
These reviews are principally based on reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied or indicate a need for more extensive monitoring.
The Board has also performed a specific assessment for purposes of this Annual Report using the standard of care applicable to directors in the exercise of their duties.
The directors consider that its internal controls, particularly given the companys size and the nature of the companys business operations, provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The main elements of internal control currently include: Operating Controls.
The identification and mitigation of major business risks on a daily basis is the responsibility of the executive directors and senior management.
Each business function within the company maintains controls and procedures, as directed by senior management, appropriate to its own business environment while conforming to the companys standards and guidelines.
These include procedures and guidelines to identify, evaluate the likelihood and mitigate all types of risks on an ongoing basis.
The companys operating procedures include a comprehensive system for reporting financial and non-financial information to the directors.
Financial projections, including revenue and profit forecasts, are reported on a regular basis to senior management against corresponding figures for previous periods.
The central process for evaluating and managing non-financial risks is weekly meetings of business functions, each involving at least one director, together with periodic meetings of executive directors and senior management.
The finance department operates within policies approved by the directors and the Chief Financial Officer.
Expenditures are tightly controlled with stringent approvals required based on amount.
Duties such as legal, finance, sales and operations are also strictly segregated to minimize risk.
Insurance cover is provided externally and depends on the scale of the risk in question and the availability of cover in the external market.
Internal Audit As the company has grown during 2008 the Board has discussed matters relating to internal control and the present need to establish an internal audit function.
Given the company's extensive internal reporting functions, extensive internal controls and significant executive director involvement in all aspects of the companys business affairs during 2008, the Board did not consider it necessary for the company to have its own internal audit function although a senior manager is responsible for internal reviews.
No material breaches of internal controls were identified during 2008.
Conflicts Throughout 2008 the company has complied with procedures in place for ensuring that the boards powers to authorize conflict situations have been operated effectively.
During 2008 no conflicts arose which would require the board to exercise authority or discretion in relation to such conflicts.
Key Risks Matters relating to key risks are discussed on page 7.
