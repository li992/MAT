Carbon footprint by emission source and scope tonnes CO2e Tonnes CO2e Scope 1: 17% Natural gas 300 Company cars 19 Scope 2: 58% Electricity 1,074 Scope 3: 25% Flights 265 Non company cars 93 National rail 87 Taxis 5 Total 1,843 The majority of our GHG emissions are derived from scope 2 purchased electricity, followed by scope 1 natural gas.
As is typical of the financial services industry, scope 3 business travel-related emissions are relatively significant.
Scope 1 Natural gas Natural gas consumption amounted to 1,455,655kWh, equivalent to 300 tonnes of CO2e.
Gas data was difficult to obtain 4 and the use of industry benchmarks was necessary to estimate the consumption for most of the ofces.
Company cars The company car eet includes a mixture of both petrol and diesel vehicles.
Total distance travelled during the reported year for business travel purposes amounted to 83,416km, emitting an equivalent of 19 tonnes of CO2e.
To reduce our environmental impact, the Group has continued to phase out the provision of company cars.
The number of cars fell from 35 at the start of the year to 26 at 31 December 2008.
Scope 2 Electricity We have compared our performance against benchmarks Energy efficiency Best Practice Programme for Energy Use in 5 6 Ofces and identied those ofces most in need of improvement.
We are pleased to see that our London ofce shows alignment with the benchmark for good ofces.
This is mostly due to energy efficiency investment over the past two years.
Offices under the reported scope used a total of 1,999,470 kWh, generating emissions equivalent to1,074 tonnes of CO2e.
