At least 20 business days notice of the AGM is given to allow time for proper consideration of the resolutions by shareholders.
Separate resolutions are proposed for each substantially separate issue.
Every effort is made to ensure that all Board members, and in particular committee chairmen, are at the meeting.

Votes are taken on a show of hands unless a poll is requested and full details of proxy voting gures are disclosed after the vote and on the website.
Risk management and internal control The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the Groups systems of internal control.
However, such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The chairman ensures that Board members receive sufficient and timely information regarding corporate and business issues to enable them to discharge their duties and canvasses the views of non-executive directors upon the adequacy of the management information.
The Risk Management Committee reports to the Board and comprises members of the Executive Committee together with the Group heads of personnel, compliance and internal audit.
This committee is an important element in the Groups overall control system and undertakes a review of risk within the Group at its quarterly meetings.
It reports on a regular basis to the Board both on the identication of risks and the steps being taken to control or mitigate such risks.
Risk review procedures have been in place throughout the year and up to 3 March 2009.
The other key elements of the Groups overall control systems include: a formal structure of committees and subsidiary company boards where senior staff oversee the operation of the business on a regular basis: an annual budgeting, regular forecasting and monthly financial reporting system for all Group divisions, which enables trends to be evaluated and variances to be acted upon: an internal capital adequacy assessment process ICAAP required by FSA prudential rules which requires regular assessments of the amounts, types and distribution of capital that the Group considers adequate to cover the nature and level of the risks to which it is or might be exposed: a dened set of policies and procedures for treasury operations with limits set by the Banking Committee: a condential reporting policy, which encourages employees to raise serious concerns about a colleagues or Group companys practice: and the Audit Committee which, on the Boards behalf, examines the effectiveness of the systems of control as explained below.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control in existence in the Group for the year ended 31 December 2008 and has taken account of material developments since the year end.
Necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses identied from that review.
This process meets the requirements of the Guidance on Internal Control The Turnbull Guidance published in September 1999 and revised in October 2005.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 36 Corporate governance report Remuneration report The Board presents the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The aim of the remuneration policy is to provide a competitive remuneration package, having regard to comparable companies in the financial sector, which is sufficient to attract and retain the quality of director needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
The stated policy shall apply in 2009 and, subject to review, in subsequent financial years.
Remuneration packages Remuneration packages are designed to include xed and variable elements, and to provide rewards for both the long and short term as follows: Short term Long term Fixed Basic salary and benets Pension Variable profit share Long Term Incentive Plan The Remuneration Committee the Committee considers that the key objectives of a remuneration package are to motivate directors to generate long-term shareholder value and to increase short-term profitability.
The first objective is met by long-term incentive plan LTIP awards, providing directors with the opportunity to build a meaningful shareholding in the Company, subject to meeting stretching performance targets.
Executive directors are actively encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding to the equivalent value of at least one years salary within five years of their appointment to the Board.
The second objective is met by profit share payments.
The Committee does not specically take into account corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when considering the remuneration of executive directors but it is satisfied that the incentive structure does not increase risks in these areas by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
In the light of current economic circumstances, the Committee has considered remuneration arrangements and the risk reward prole that these present at executive director level, and are comfortable that these arrangements remain appropriate.
Basic salary and benets An executive directors basic salary is determined by the Committee and any change implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector.
In view of the difficult trading conditions experienced towards the end of 2008, directors basic salaries were not increased on 1 January 2009.
Total board salary and fee costs were broadly unchanged in the year.
When setting salary levels, use is made of survey data and information provided by the advisers to the Committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration in respect of other Board positions.
All directors are entitled to take part in the Share Incentive Plan SIP on the same terms as all other employees.
This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company.
Performance related SIP shares are also offered to employees if there is year on year EPS growth over the rate of ination.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benets, the most significant of which is a company car or cash alternative.
From January 2008 the provision of cars is being phased out.
profit share Certain executive directors on the Executive Committee are eligible for a discretionary profit share payment from a pool based on approximately 1% of Group profit before tax.
In 2008, profits for profit sharing purposes were adjusted to exclude the loss recognised on remeasurement of assets of the disposal group of 12.7 million see note 12.
The Committee considered that executive directors profit share should be based on the results of the continuing business and that they should not be penalised by the one-off impact of the implementation of this strategic decision initiated by the Board to create longer term shareholder value.
Directors with direct responsibility for investment management, unit trust or trust and tax departments receive a profit share payment based on the profits of the department concerned.
This may be supplemented by a payment from the pool.
profit share payments are not capped and are not pensionable.
Details of payments for 2008 are shown in Table 1.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 37 Remuneration report Remuneration report continued profit share continued In 2008, the profit share payable to members of the Executive Committee totalled 380,000, 0.89% of continuing Group pre-tax profit 2007: 498,000, 1.05%.
Total profit share for all executive directors was 1,182,000, 2.76 % of continuing Group pre-tax profits 2007: 2,030,500, 4.29%.
From 2009 onwards, payments will also be made to the head of the Investment Management division, Richard Lanyon, from an increased central Executive Committee pool, replacing the payment from the Investment Management division.
The pool will be based on a total of between 1.0% and 2.5% of Group pre-tax profits at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, having regard to the contributions of individual participants and the external circumstances in which the Company has operated.
It is anticipated that in a typical year the payment would normally be 1.75% of Group profits.

No awards from the current plan will be made after November 2010.
Executive directors are provisionally awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares at the start of a three-year plan cycle the provisional award.
The maximum value of a provisional award is 75% of a participants basic salary.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant the actual award.
The performance targets used to date have been a mixture of growth in earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR.
TSR is a measure of the overall return to shareholders.
It reects both the change in the share price and dividends, and any other cash payments made, assuming that they are reinvested.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 38 Remuneration report Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued If a participant ceases to be employed as an executive director by reason of retirement at normal retirement age or earlier with the Companys consent, ill-health, redundancy or death, or any other circumstances which the Committee deems to be appropriate, the Committee may, at its discretion, recommend to the trustee that any distribution be based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but that the actual award be reduced pro rata to reect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
Prior to the 2005 07 plan, absolute measures were used.
The performance targets for the 2005 07 plan onwards were changed, replacing the absolute TSR target with a relative TSR target comparing TSR performance to the FTSE All Share Index.
The use of a peer group rather than a broad index was ruled out due to the small number of similar businesses in the speciality and other finance sector, and the risk that numbers would fall still further due to consolidation.
The Committee consider that the current targets are as demanding as those put in place for earlier cycles were considered to be at the time.
On 31 December 2007, the trustee held 74,794 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares.
On 12 March 2008, 27,601 shares were awarded to 2005 07 Plan participants.
47,193 shares were held as at 31 December 2008. Dividend entitlements in respect of this holding have been waived and voting rights will not be exercised.
2006 08 plan cycle Basic EPS, adjusted to exclude the loss recognised on remeasurement of assets of the disposal group of 12.7 million see note 12, increased from 60.13p in 2005 to 74.11p in 2008, an increase of 23.25% which triggered a 52.5% award for this element of the plan.
The TSR for the three-year period was -7.35%, which ranked the Company at the 68th percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index, triggering a 72.4% award from this element of the Plan.
Details of the actual awards to be made in March 2009 are shown in Table 4.
The Committee may recommend that a proportion of an award may be paid in cash rather than shares, primarily to enable the director to meet the income tax and national insurance payable.
2007 09, 2008 10 and 2009 11 plan cycles Details of the provisional awards for the 2007 09, 2008 10 and 2009 11 plan cycles are also set out in Table 4.
Were the maximum possible provisional awards to be made in shares to current and former directors, 354,142 ordinary shares 2007: 331,245 would be awarded, representing 0.8% 2007: 0.8% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2008.
