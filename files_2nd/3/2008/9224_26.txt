The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the Company and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps, as are reasonably open to them and which they deem appropriate to safeguard the assets of the Company and to seek to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
