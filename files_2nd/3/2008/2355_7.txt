This appointment was made after careful consideration by the Board of the depth of knowledge and experience held by Mr Malcolm Harris, recognised in the shareholder consultation, with the conclusion that shareholders would benefit from his continued contribution and involvement with the Company.
Mr David Ritchie became Chief Executive at the same time and the position of Group Managing Director previously held by Mr David Ritchie ceased to exist.
Mr Alastair Lyons was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2008 following a recommendation from the Nomination Committee and an evaluation of the knowledge, skills and experience that the appointment would bring to the Board in support of the Chairman and in light of the balance already available.

The Chairman also ensures that effective communications are maintained with shareholders.

The Board has determined that non-executive directors Mr Alastair Lyons, Mrs Lesley MacDonagh, Mr John Warren and Mr Colin Holmes are independent.

The Board receives timely, clear and comprehensive board papers a week in advance of each meeting and other information appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties.

Major shareholders attending had an opportunity to put their views and hold discussions with them.
Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal control and has during the year reviewed the effectiveness thereof.
It is able to report that the Company has complied with provision C. 2.1 of the Combined Code throughout 2008 in accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance.
A key part of the system of internal control is the maintenance of a risk analysis.
At the end of 2006 a new risk analysis document was prepared and was reviewed by the Audit Committee and during 2007 this risk analysis was systematically considered and discussed by the Board, with the ongoing objective of keeping key risks and topical areas of concern under review.
The risk analysis was kept under review during 2008 and in this way the Board is able to ensure that it properly identifies and grades the risks specific to the activities and operating environment of the business and reviews the response to operational, financial, compliance and other risks and reconsiders its policies of risk tolerance.
In setting these policies the Board aims to ensure that the Company is neither prevented from taking opportunities nor exposed to unreasonable risk.
The system of internal control is designed to manage risk rather than eliminate it and consequently it can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee reviews the system of internal control and reports to the Board thereon.
It receives reports from the internal and external auditors and management which assess the efficiency of internal control and make recommendations for any improvements.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of committee meetings to the Board and provides minutes of the meetings.
The Group has maintained throughout the year and up to the date of approval of these Annual Report and Accounts a control environment, with policies, procedures, processes and codes of conduct which are designed to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate risk over the range of business activities and improve business efficiency.
This control environment is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Revised Turnbull Guidance.
As new procedures and working practices are adopted, risk factors are considered and internal controls embedded into the systems wherever possible.
The principal elements of the control environment are as follows: regular main Board meetings: regular Audit Committee meetings: regular Group Executive Committee meetings: an established management structure of operating regions with short lines of communication to the executive directors: regular regional board meetings, with comprehensive agendas dealing with all aspects of the business: defined operating controls and procedures with authorisation limits at appropriate levels across the Group: an internal audit department reporting regularly on compliance with controls, procedures and authority limits: a regular self certification process in respect of internal control through the management structure: a comprehensive financial reporting system with actual performance compared with budgets and forecasts on a regular basis, each region reporting through its regional board: and a regular comparison of the Groups performance against industry statistics and competitors.
Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
These enquiries consist of the production and review of up to date detailed financial forecasts covering the period January 2009 - June 2010, taking into account current market trends, and applying reasonable judgements and estimates to generate future cashflow estimates.
Using these estimates the Group has also reviewed the outcome of forecast covenant tests linked to its banking facility and has identified the headroom evident between these forecast outcomes and the performance required to achieve compliance with its covenant tests.
The Group's facility is a committed syndicated facility for 220 million, which steps down to 180 million in February 2010 and to 160 million in September 2010 and which matures in March 2011.
As at 31 December, the Group had 108 million of net debt before issue costs, as against this facility of 220 million plus a 5 million overdraft facility.
Further details are laid out in note 21 together with the quantum of drawings as at 31 December 2008 and details of the Groups approach to financial management risk more widely is laid out in note 26.
The Group regards these facilities as adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its needs, particularly as its syndicated facility was entered into on the 29th December 2008, and its terms are reflective of the requirements posed by current trading conditions.
For these reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
