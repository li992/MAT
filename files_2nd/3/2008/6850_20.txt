Management and governance Corporate governance Governance structure The board The board considers that it is vital to ensure that there is an appropriate range of skills and experience among its members, and that the objectivity and integrity of members should be exemplary.
The board currently comprises a non-executive chairman, five other non-executive directors and five executive directors.
The directors biographies are on pages 24 and 25.
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting after their appointment to the board and to re-election by shareholders every three years thereafter.
In addition, any non-executive director who has served for more than nine years is subject to annual re-election.
The division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the board.
The job descriptions are available on request.
The chairman has primary responsibility for running the board and devotes such time to his role as is necessary to properly discharge his duties.
The chief executive has responsibility for executing the companys strategy and achieving operational and financial goals.
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for its decision, including approval of the long-term objectives and strategy, approval of budgets and financial statements including the report and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to the structure of the group and overall corporate governance issues.
It reviews trading performance and considers major capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities.
Management is delegated the task of the detailed planning and implementation of the companys strategy.
Information and training Full and timely information is provided to the board to enable it to properly discharge its functions.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and are provided with the opportunity to question management as required.
The training needs of the board are regularly reviewed.
Explanations of issues and legislative changes affecting the industry have been provided to the board during the year.
There is an agreed procedure, set out in writing, for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice at the companys expense.
The company has in place directors and ofcers liability insurance.
Newly-appointed directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the board to acquaint them with the company.
This takes the form of meetings with other board members and the provision of an induction pack containing general information on the company, its policies and procedures, financial information and a brieng on directors responsibilities.
Performance evaluation The board believes it is appropriate to undertake a regular performance evaluation of the board, its committees and individual directors.
It has determined that an internal process of evaluation is most appropriate, to enable first hand input from individual directors to be obtained.
An evaluation exercise was undertaken in March 2008 by means of a detailed questionnaire distributed to all board members, covering a wide range of matters including board structure and composition, board processes, communications with shareholders and corporate governance matters.
Once each director had completed the questionnaire, the responses were discussed with the chairman and the chief executive and the results reported to the full board in April.
The board is satisfied that an open dialogue exists between all board members enabling issues to be raised and dealt with as they occur rather than waiting for the next formal evaluation process, and accordingly believes that it and its committees are operating effectively.
The performance of Tim Bridge, chairman, was also reviewed during the financial year.
The process was conducted by the non-executive directors, led by Howard Phillips, the senior non-executive director, taking into account the views of the executive directors.
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee in conjunction with their annual pay review and the payment of bonuses.
Independence of non-executive directors The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are carefully examined and fully discussed.
Their independence and objectivity are of paramount importance.
The board believes that they all have a range of skills and experience which will help the company and that their understanding of the company, its strategy and operations increases over the years.
The board is satisfied that all of the non-executive directors were independent throughout the year, being free from any relationship with the executive management which could result in any conict or affect their independent judgment, and that they all remained independent in character and judgment.
None of the independent non-executive directors participates in the share option schemes or long-term incentive plan operated by the company and none was dependent on the fees received from the company as their primary source of income.
The senior independent non-executive director is currently Howard Phillips, who was appointed to the board in June 1998, has never been employed by the company and has had diverse business interests.
The board considers that he has remained independent from management in both character and judgment, that his performance has continued to be effective and that he has continued to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Howard Phillips has served on the board for 10 years and will be retiring at the forthcoming AGM.
GREENE KING PLC 78 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 The role of senior independent director will be taken on by Norman Murray, who was appointed to the board in 2004.
He is chairman of Cairn Energy PLC and a non-executive director of Robert Wiseman Dairies plc.
He has never been employed by the company and the board is satisfied that he is independent from management in both character and judgment.
A key responsibility for the senior independent director is to be available to shareholders in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay views through the chairman, chief executive or finance director.
Tim Bridge took over as chairman of the board on 2 May 2005 for an initial term of three years.
The board noted that, because of his long tenure as an executive director, he did not meet all of the independence criteria set out in the combined code.
However, the board was, and remains, confident that the strength of character and independent judgment that he exhibited as chief executive would continue in his role as chairman.
The board is satisfied that his performance as chairman is effective and that he demonstrates continued commitment to the role.
He was therefore re-appointed for a further three-year period in May 2008.
Tim Bridge is also a non-executive director of William Ransom & Son plc and Weatherbys Ventures Limited but these are not regarded as significant commitments and do not impact upon his ability to perform his role as chairman effectively.
Meetings and attendance Board meetings are scheduled to be held nine times a year.
There is also a strategy day and a pub away-day for the full board each year.
Between meetings, as required, the board can be in frequent contact to progress the companys business and if necessary, board meetings can be held at short notice.
Where possible, however, ad hoc committees of the board are appointed to deal with matters which it is known will need to be dealt with between scheduled board meetings.
