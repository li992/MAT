Corporate governance Homeserve complied throughout the year with the provisions set out in the Combined Code published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in 2003 as updated in June 2006 the Code except for the balance of the Board between executive and non-executive directors between 1 April and 1 June 2007, when Andrew Sibbald joined the Board as an independent non-executive director.
The manner in which the Company applies the principles of good governance contained in the Code is described in the appropriate parts of this Report and Accounts.
Thus the application by the Company of the Codes principles relating to remuneration matters at pages 42 to 56 should be read in conjunction with the statement below.
A review of the Groups position and prospects is set out in the Chairmans Statement, the Chief Executive's Review and the Financial Review on pages 3 to 21.
The Board The Board of directors leads and controls the Company by holding at least eight meetings a year at which its current and forecast performance is reviewed and monitored.
Regular reports on monthly performance and other matters of importance to the Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with the information necessary to make informed judgements.
In addition, the Board holds regular meetings at least annually, also attended by senior operational management, to devise and discuss the Companys medium and long term strategic focus and management development strategy.
Regular formal and informal presentations are given and meetings held in order to apprise directors of issues of importance affecting the Group.
Occasionally, meetings of the Board are held at the Companys operating sites other than Walsall, in order to afford the Board, particularly the non-executive directors, with the opportunity to meet with local management.
In accordance with the provisions of its Articles of Association and with the Code, each director is subject to election by the Companys shareholders at the Annual General Meeting immediately following his appointment and is subject to re-election at least every three years thereafter.
In 2007, Andrew Sibbald was appointed to the Board on 1 June, in the period between the date on which the Notice of Meeting was sent to shareholders and the Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, it was not possible for him to submit himself for election at the first Annual General Meeting following the date of his appointment but he will offer himself for election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 28 July 2008.
The Board has a Schedule of Matters specifically reserved to it for decision and has approved the written terms of reference of the various committees to which it has delegated its authority in certain matters.
Matters reserved to the Board include the recommendation or approval of dividends, the approval of preliminary and interim financial statements, major financial commitments, the acquisitions of significant companies or businesses, appointments to the Board and its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees, the Companys future strategy and its internal controls.
It also provides that the Board receive regular updates from the chairmen of its committees.
During the year the Board was led by Brian Whitty, the Executive Chairman, who also served as a member of the Boards Nomination Committee.
The Chairmans responsibilities are clearly defined in a written specification agreed by the Board and which makes clear the division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive.
They include the smooth running of the Board, effective communication between executive and non-executive directors and the general progress and long term development of the Group.
His executive responsibilities include major strategic acquisitions, relations with shareholders and those relating to property, legal and governance matters.
The Board has established a formal procedure for directors wishing to seek independent legal and other professional advice and all members of the Board have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.

John Maxwell served as the Companys independent senior non-executive director.
The Board actively encourages all directors to deepen their knowledge of their roles and responsibilities and to gain a clear understanding of the Group and the environment in which it operates: and has adopted a formal policy on the induction and training of directors.
Newly appointed Board members are required to undergo an induction programme, which includes obtaining a thorough understanding of the Groups various operations, and they have the opportunity to receive formal training from external providers if they wish.
During the year, the non-executive directors have met with various members of the Groups management teams and external advisers.
Further training for directors has been provided as appropriate during the year, including training in relation to their duties under the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has implemented a formal process for reviewing its own effectiveness, that of its Remuneration and Audit committees and its individual members.
In addition, it continued to ensure that regular meetings of the non-executive directors were held without the executive directors, and at least once a year, without the Chairman present, in order to evaluate his performance.
The evaluation process, which was conducted by the Chairman and Company Secretary, was concluded in March 2008.
Directors completed evaluation questionnaires, and attended one-to-one meetings with the Chairman and Company Secretary to discuss the existing and future needs of the Board, its composition and the skills of its members.
A formal written report summarising their views and containing recommendations to further improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees was prepared by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the whole Board in March 2008.
The Board concluded that it and the committees reviewed operate effectively, although a number of recommendations for further improvement were approved.
Meetings with the Chairman to discuss feedback relating to the effectiveness of individual directors took place in April 2008.
Committees The Board operates a number of committees to which it has delegated certain specific responsibilities and each of which has formally adopted terms of reference.
These comprise the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The terms of reference of each of the Boards committees can be viewed on the Companys website.
During the year, the Board also established a Risk Committee, comprising certain executive directors and members of the Executive Board, which is chaired by Jonathan Simpson-Dent.
Its terms of reference have been approved by the Board and its purpose is to establish the Groups risk appetite, to evaluate the risk registers compiled by each of its businesses, to monitor the effectiveness of its action plans for the mitigation of those risks, and to report thereon to the Audit Committee and the Board, which retains responsibility for the overall evaluation of the Groups risk management processes.
Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee, which makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of directors, is chaired by Brian Whitty, and Ian Chippendale, Barry Gibson and John Maxwell, independent non-executive directors also all served on the Committee throughout the year.

The external and internal auditors are provided with the opportunity to raise any matters or concerns that they may have, in the absence of the executive directors, whether at Committee meetings or, more informally outside of them.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board for a resolution to be put to the shareholders for their approval in general meeting for the appointment of the external auditors, the approval of their remuneration and their terms of engagement.
The Committee has implemented a policy relating to the use of the external auditors for non-audit services and monitors fees paid in respect of such services.
This policy provides that, excluding certain specialist services, the total fees payable to the auditor for non-audit related work in any financial year should not normally be more than 50% of the total fees payable in respect of audit and compliance services.
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own effectiveness and that of the external audit process: the results of the review were considered by the Board as a whole in March 2008.
Remuneration Committee The Committee is chaired by Barry Gibson and comprises only independent non-executive directors, Ian Chippendale and John Maxwell being its other members.

The Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with institutional investors and analysts to discuss the Companys performance and all shareholders have access to the senior independent non-executive director, who is available to discuss any questions which investors may have in relation to the running of the Company.
The Board encourages shareholders to attend the Annual General Meeting and is always willing to answer questions, either in the meeting itself or, more informally, afterwards.
In addition, shareholders may contact Homeserve direct, either through its website or by telephoning its offices.
The Board also recognises the need to ensure that all directors are fully aware of the views of major shareholders about the Group.
Copies of all analysts research relating to the Company are circulated to all directors upon publication, monthly analyses of the Companys shareholder register are made available to the Board and written feedback from shareholders and analysts, prepared by the Groups brokers and public relations advisers is provided to all directors after every significant corporate event and at least twice a year.
Going concern The directors confirm that, after reviewing the Groups budget and projected cash flows, they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Internal controls As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied throughout the year with the provisions of the Code relating to internal controls, having implemented the procedures necessary to comply with the guidance on internal control published in October 2005 Turnbull Guidance and to report in line with that guidance.
The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There is an established internal control framework in place, which is continually reviewed and updated taking into account the changing nature of the Groups operations.
This process has been in place for the whole of the year and up to the date of approval of this Report and Accounts.
40 Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 78658 Middle.
indd 40 5 6 08 14:54:16 The key elements of the system operated by the Group to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks include the following: The Groups management operates a formal process for identifying, managing and reporting on operational and financial risks faced by each of the Groups businesses, whereby each of the risks identified is reviewed in detail by the executive directors on a regular basis.
Weekly meetings of the Group's UK based Executive Board members monitor its day-to-day performance, and full Executive Board meetings are held on a monthly basis at which the Groups senior managers report on the progress of the companies or discipline for which they are responsible and share best practice.
A clearly defined organisation structure is in place with clear lines of accountability and appropriate division of duties.
The Groups financial regulations specify authorisation limits for individual managers and for local Boards of management, with all material transactions being approved by the Board.
Three year business plans, annual budgets and investment proposals for each business are formally prepared, reviewed and approved by the Board.
The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit function which reports directly to the Audit Committee and a formal audit plan is in place to address the key risks across the Group.
Financial results and cash flows, including a comparison with budgets and forecasts, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis, with variances being identified to initiate action to mitigate them.
Appropriate treasury policies are in place.
The Committee has adopted a formal 'whistleblowing' policy for employees who wish to raise any issues of concern relating to the Companys activities on a confidential basis.
A mechanism exists to extend the Groups formal risk management processes to any significant new business acquired or begun by the Company immediately upon acquisition or start-up.
In this way, the Board is able to confirm that the necessary process has been operated by the Group for the whole of the year.
At least twice a year, the Audit Committee reviews a register summarising the significant risks faced by the businesses or the Group as a whole, the likelihood of those risks occurring and the steps being taken to minimise or otherwise manage those risks.
As required by the Turnbull Guidance, the Board has carried out an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
The processes applied by the Board include: At the end of the year, the executive directors compile a report identifying the key risks faced by the Group.
This report is considered by the Risk and Audit Committees and by the Board before the Report and Accounts is approved.
The Group has an independent Internal Audit function which reviews the overall effectiveness of the risk management process for the key risks and reports independently to the Audit Committee.
At each meeting the Audit Committee reviews reports of the executive directors and the internal and external auditors, on any issues identified as having a potentially substantial impact on the results of the Group, or areas of control weakness.
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Groups system of managing financial risk and refers any risks it considers significant to the Board for its consideration.
The Risk Committee meets at least quarterly to assist the Audit Committee to monitor these risks, as well as to set the Group's risk appetite and to evaluate in detail risk registers compiled by the Group's businesses.
At least twice a year, the Audit Committee reviews the work plans and results of each of the internal and external auditors.
The Audit Committee Chairman reports the outcome of all Audit Committee meetings to the Board, which also receives minutes of all such meetings.
