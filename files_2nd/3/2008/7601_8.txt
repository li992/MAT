Prior to the reappointment of a non executive Director, the Nomination Committee undertakes an evaluation of the Directors contribution and commitment to the Board together with an evaluation of the Boards requirements.
In the case of a non executive Director being reappointed for a term beyond six years, the Code recommends a particularly rigorous evaluation with particular consideration being given to the need to regularly refresh the Board.

34 a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2008 Corporate Governance continued Internal Controls The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The internal control system, which has been in place throughout 2008 and up to the date of approval of these accounts, is an ongoing process designed to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks to which the Company is exposed.
Any such system of internal control can however, only provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss in the financial statements and of meeting internal control objectives.
The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control for the period covered by these financial statements, the key features of which are as follows: Management structure within operational parameters set by the Board, management is delegated to the Chief Executive and the executive Directors.
Subsidiaries operate within clearly defined policies and authorities contained within a Group Manual under a decentralised management structure.
All senior management changes require the prior approval of the Chief Executive.
Reporting all subsidiaries submit detailed management information in accordance with a pre-set reporting timetable.
This includes weekly treasury reports, monthly management accounts, annual budgets and three-year plans together with half year and full year statutory reporting.
This data is subject to review and assessment by management through the monitoring of key performance ratios and comparison to targets and budgets.
The content and format of reporting is subject to change to ensure appropriate information is available.
Strategic planning and budgeting strategic plans and annual budgets containing comprehensive financial projections are formally presented to the Board for adoption and approval and form the basis for monitoring performance.
Clearly defined procedures exist for capital expenditure proposals and authorisation.
Quality assurance most of the business sectors within which the Group operate are highly regulated and subsidiaries are invariably required to be accredited, by the customer or an industry regulator, to national or international quality organisations.
These organisations undertake regular audits and checks on subsidiary operating procedures and practices ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
Monitoring process in addition to reports from external auditors the Audit Committee receives reports from the internal auditors as part of the Groups internal audit and risk assessment programme.
All subsidiaries undertake formal self-assessment reviews a minimum of three times a year on their internal control environment.
These reviews encompass the identification of the key business, financial, compliance and operational risks facing the business together with an assessment of the controls in place for managing and mitigating these risks.
Additionally, risks are evaluated for their potential impact on the business.
The results of these reviews together with a review of risks facing the Group as a whole are reported to the Board.
Risk management is a Board agenda item at every Board meeting.
