The principal purpose of these policies and procedures is to ensure that the independence of the external auditor is not impaired.
The policies, which are in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, prohibit the provision of certain non-audit services to the Group by the external auditor, including: bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Group: design and implementation of financial information systems: appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports: and actuarial or internal audit outsourcing services.
Other types of audit and non-audit services may be performed by the external auditor if the work is either specifically pre-approved by the ACR Committee or the work falls within a schedule of services pre-approved by the ACR Committee in accordance with the pre-approval policy.
The ACR Committees pre-approval policy covers four categories of workaudit services, audit-related services, tax services and other non-audit related services.
If the proposed services to be provided by the external auditor fall within a category of pre-approved services and additionally the fee for those services is below pre-approved annual and transactional limits, such services may be provided without being specifically approved by the ACR Committee, provided that management does not need to exercise any discretion in determining whether a proposed service falls within one of the pre-approved categories.
In all cases, the ACR Committee is notified of any pre-approved service that is provided by the auditor.
Any non-prohibited service proposed to be provided by the auditor which is either not a pre-approved service, or is a pre-approved service for which fees are above the annual or transactional limits, must be approved in advance by the ACR Chairman, who will consider whether the independence, skills and experience of the auditor make it a suitable supplier of the proposed service.
ACR Committee activities During 2008, the business reviewed by the ACR Committee included the following: 1 Financial statements The financial disclosures contained in the Groups full year and quarterly results announcements.
Various accounting matters, including the application of the Groups critical accounting policies and accounting standards in the context of the financial disclosures, the accounting treatment for the replacement through the court-sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement of the Groups holding company, charges recognized on the discontinuation of DYNEPO, the other-than-temporary impairment of the Groups investment in Renovo Group plc and the acquisition of Jerini AG.
Review of questions raised by the SEC concerning the Companys 2007 10-K filing and approval of the Companys responses.
The SEC was satisfied with the Companys responses.
Quarterly reports from the external auditors were received by the ACR Committee and discussed.
The reports addressed the following key areas: auditor responsibility and independence: significant accounting estimates and judgments made by management: and significant accounting policies and one-off transactions.
2 Internal financial control and risk management systems Consideration of the key risks faced by the Group and review of the Groups plan to mitigate such risks.
Review of the Groups annual internal audit plan, compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls over financial reporting.
Review of the policy for treasury management and of any proposed changes to that policy which are being recommended to the Board.
Quarterly reports on treasury investments, foreign exchange hedging.
Annual review of the Groups tax strategy and assessment of fiscal risk.
Quarterly reports on the results of the Groups internal audit program.
Semi-annual review of the Groups corporate risk schedule.
Review of the insurance renewal program for 2008 9.
Monitoring of the Groups whistle-blowing policy.
3 External auditor The ACR Committee reviewed the performance of the external auditor following the completion of the 2007 audit process, which resulted in the ACR Committee resolving to recommend that the Group submit a resolution to the 2008 Annual General Meeting to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the Groups external auditor.
At meetings in 2009, the ACR Committee will conduct a formal review of the performance of the external auditor and the effectiveness of the audit process in connection with the 2008 financial year audit.
Throughout the year, the ACR Committee has kept the objectivity and independence of the external auditor under review and has obtained reports from the Groups external auditor describing all relationships between the auditor and the Group.
The ACR Committee has remained satisfied that neither the level of non-audit services nor the nature of the work performed by the external auditors has in any way impaired their objectivity and independence.
Details of the fees paid to the external auditors are disclosed in Note 36 to the consolidated financial statements.
