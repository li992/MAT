Independence of the Board Sir Brian Williamson, Mr RA Armstrong and Mr JP Williams have served on the Board for more than nine years.
The Board has carefully considered the independence of each Director under the provisions of the Code and has concluded that each Director is wholly independent on the basis that the Board firmly believes that independence is a state of mind and the character and judgement which accompany this are distinct from and are not compromised by length of service.
The Directors including the Chairman who have been in office for more than nine years will submit themselves for annual re-election.
31 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Reports Directors Remuneration Report Corporate Governance Reports The Board carried out a formal appraisal process of its own operations and that of its Committees and its and their performances during the year.
This was implemented by means of questionnaires circulated to the Directors, the results of which were then reviewed by the Board.

The process was considered by the Board to be constructive in identifying areas for improving the functioning and performance of the Board and of its Committees.
The Board concluded that its performance and that of its Committees was satisfactory.
The Chairman carried out a formal appraisal of each of the Directors during the year and the Board, under the leadership of the Senior Independent Director, similarly appraised the Chairman.
Relevant matters considered included the attendance and participation at Board and Committee meetings, commitment to Board activities and the effectiveness of the contribution made by the relevant Director.
As a result of this process, the Chairman has confirmed that the performance of each of the Directors being proposed for re-election continues to be effective and that each of them continues to show commitment to his role.

Re-election of Directors In accordance with the Codes provisions and or the Companys Articles, each of Sir Brian Williamson, Mr RA Armstrong and Mr JP Williams will retire at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2009 and each offers himself for re-election.
Independent Professional Advice Individual Directors may seek independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties at the Companys expense within certain parameters.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee The Board has an Audit Committee established in compliance with the Code.
It comprises all the Directors, other than the Chairman of the Board with Mr RA Armstrong as Chairman of the Committee.
The Board has taken note of the suggestion that at least one member of the Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience and is satisfied that the Committee is properly constituted in this respect.
Its authority and duties are clearly defined in its written terms of reference which are available on the Companys website.
The Committees responsibilities include: monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, the internal financial controls and the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the external auditors: making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external auditors and approving their remuneration and terms of their engagement: developing and implementing the Companys policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors: reviewing the arrangements in place within Electra Partners whereby their staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters insofar as they may affect the Company: and considering annually whether there is a need for the Company to have its own internal audit function.
The Committee has reviewed the provision of non-audit services and believes them to be cost effective and not an impediment to the external auditors objectivity and independence.
The non-audit services include the provision of taxation advice.
It has been agreed that all non-audit work to be carried out by the external auditors must be approved by the Audit Committee and that any special projects must be approved in advance.
32 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Following the review carried out by the Audit Committee as to whether there is a need for the Company to have its own internal audit function, the Board has considered and continues to believe that the internal control systems in place within Electra Partners and the internal control reports provided by it give sufficient assurance that a sound system of internal control, which safeguards shareholders investment and the Companys assets, is maintained.
An internal audit function, specific to the Company, is therefore considered unnecessary.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committees and the Combined Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration Committee, which existed until 30 July 2008, comprised all the Directors of the Company other than the Chairman and was chaired by Mr JP Williams.
The Remuneration Committee met once during the period ended 30 July 2008 to consider the Directors remuneration in the context of the number of Board, Committee and informal meetings of Directors and the results of this review are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.

No meetings of the Nomination Committee were held in the period ended 30 July 2008.
With effect from 31 July 2008 the Board established a combined Remuneration and Nomination Committee to incorporate the duties of the former Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The new Committee, chaired by Mr JP Williams, comprises all non-executive Directors of the Company, the majority of whom will always be independent.
There were no meetings of the new Committee in the period to 30 September 2008.

33 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Reports Corporate Governance Reports Internal Control The Code requires the Directors to review the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal control and report to shareholders that they have done so.
This encompasses a review of all controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
The Board confirms that it has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company.
This process has been in place throughout the year and has continued since the year end.
It is reviewed at regular intervals by the Board and accords with the guidance set out in Internal Controls: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
The Board is responsible for the Companys system of internal control and has reviewed its effectiveness for the year ended 30 September 2008.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk or failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Since investment management, custody of assets and all administrative services are provided or arranged for the Company by Electra Partners, the Companys system of internal control mainly comprises the monitoring of the services provided by Electra Partners, including the operating controls established by them to ensure they meet the Companys business objectives.
The key elements designed to provide effective internal control are as follows: Financial Reporting regular and comprehensive review by the Board of key investment and financial data, including management accounts, revenue projections, analyses of transactions and performance comparisons.
Investment Strategy agreement by the Board of the Companys Objective and Investment Policy.
Management Agreements and Investment Performance the Board regularly monitors the performance of Electra Partners to ensure that the Companys assets and affairs are managed in accordance with the Companys Objective and Investment Policy.
The Board keeps under review the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal control by monitoring the operation of the key controls of Electra Partners as follows: The Board reviews the terms of the management agreements and receives regular reports from Electra Partners executives.
The Board reviews the certificates provided by Electra Partners on a six monthly basis verifying compliance with documented controls.
Voting Policy Under the investment management arrangements Electra Partners has complete discretion in relation to all voting issues in respect of the Companys investments.
Electra Partners policy has adopted and applies the Statement of Principles drawn up by the Institutional Shareholders Committee when it considers these in its reasonable judgement to best serve the financial interests of the Companys shareholders.
Electra Partners policy has been reviewed and endorsed by the Board.
