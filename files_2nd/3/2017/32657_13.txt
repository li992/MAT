The Board considers that M. A. Griths, P. Powell and D. J. Ritchie are independent for the purposes of provision B.
1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 the Code, and that the relationships and circumstances set out in that provision which may appear relevant to the determination of independence do not apply.
The Board considers that, on appointment, the Chairman was independent for the purposes of provision A.

Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups internal control systems and annually reviews their eectiveness, including a review of financial, operational, compliance and risk management controls.
The implementation and maintenance of the risk management and internal control systems are the responsibility of the executive directors and other senior management.
The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has reviewed the eectiveness of the Groups risk management and internal control systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls, in accordance with the Code for the period from 31 January 2016 to the date of approval of this annual report.
No significant failings or weaknesses were identied from this review during the year.
Had any failings or weaknesses been identied then the Board would have taken the action required to remedy them.
At the Audit Committee meeting on 18 January 2017, following a review and evaluation of the Groups risk management and internal control systems in place, the Audit Committee concluded that the Group has a sound system of risk management and internal controls in place.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process, embedded in the Groups integrated internal control systems, allowing for the identication, evaluation and management of significant risks, as well as a reporting process to the Board.
This risk management process has been in place throughout the year ended 28 January 2017 and up to the date of the approval of this annual report.
The Board has carried out a robust, systematic assessment of the principal risks facing the Group during the period, including those which would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Information on the Groups risk management framework is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 31 to 35.
The three main elements of the Groups internal control system are as follows: The Board The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups internal control systems and exercises this through an organisational structure with clearly dened levels of responsibility and authority as well as appropriate reporting procedures.
The Board has a schedule of matters that are brought to it, or its duly authorised committees, for decision, aimed at maintaining eective control over strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues.
This structure includes the Audit Committee which, with the Finance Director, reviews the eectiveness of the internal financial and operating control environment.

Monthly financial information, including trading results, cash ow statement, statement of financial position and indebtedness, is reported.
The Board and the management committee review their business and financial performance against the prior year and against annual plans approved by the Board.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts 47 Audits and reviews The key internal risks identied in the Group are subject to regular audits or reviews by the internal auditors.
This role is fullled by an external professional services rm which is independent from the Board and the Company.
The review of the internal auditors work by the Audit Committee and monitoring procedures in place ensure that the findings of the audits are acted upon and subsequent reviews confirm compliance with any agreed action plans.
The Board confirms that there has been an independent internal audit function in place for the year.
Share capital structure The share capital structure of the Company is set out in the Directors Report.
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Code.
A copy of the Code is available on the Financial Reporting Councils website, www.
Each of the provisions of the Code has been reviewed and, where necessary, steps have been taken to ensure that the Company is in compliance with all of those provisions as at the date of this report.
The directors consider that the Company has complied throughout the year ended 28 January 2017 with the provisions of the Code, except as set out below.
During the year the Board comprised four executive directors, the non-executive Chairman and three independent nonexecutive directors.
In addition, W. R. G. Barr was a non-executive director during the year although he is not considered by the Board to be independent.
Accordingly, during the year to 28 January 2017 the composition of the Board did not, at any time, comply with provision B.
The Board considers that, despite this non-compliance, the Board has an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities eectively.
No concerns regarding the Boards non-independent majority were raised as part of the Board performance evaluation carried out during the year and referred to above.
Provision D. 1.5 of the Code recommends that executive directors contracts contain a maximum notice period of one year.
As disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report, the service contracts with R. A.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott provide for a notice period of 12 months except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company reconstruction.
Under these conditions and certain circumstances the directors are entitled to a liquidated damages payment equal to the directors basic salary at termination plus the value of all contractual benets for a two year period.
Given the size of the Company and the sector dynamics at the time these directors were recruited, the Remuneration Committee considered this provision appropriate in order to attract and retain high calibre executive directors.
As disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report, this provision will continue to be honoured as a contractual commitment made to these directors: however this provision was not included in S. Lorimers service contract and will not be included in service contracts with other new executive directors appointed in future.
A copy of the financial statements has been placed on the Companys website, www.
The maintenance and integrity of this website is the responsibility of the directors.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may dier from legislation in other jurisdictions.
