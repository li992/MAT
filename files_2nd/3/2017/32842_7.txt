We reviewed the Companys accounting policies and practices, including: approval of critical accounting policies: consideration of the appropriateness of significant judgements and estimates: and advising the Board as to its views on whether the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable.
We considered the most significant accounting judgements exercised in preparing the financial statements continued to be: the application of investment entity amendments as required by IFRS 10 Applying the Consolidation Exception : and the basis for determining the fair value of the Companys investments as detailed below.
Investment entity and service entities accounting considerations A company that qualifies as an investment entity in accordance with IFRS 10 is required to prepare financial statements on an investment basis: carry underlying investments including controlled, jointly controlled or entities over which it has significant influence in its accounts at fair value.
58 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2017 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Service entities that provide services in connection with the investment entitys activities but that are not themselves investment entities under IFRS 10 continue to be consolidated within the investment entitys group accounts rather than accounted for at fair value.
We considered reports from the Investment Adviser setting out the basis on which the Company continues to meet the investment entity definition and certain subsidiary entities continue to meet the service entity definition of IFRS 10 but are not themselves investment entities, and agreed this with the Companys auditor.
We accordingly recommended that the Board approve the financial statements on this basis i. e. that investee entities are accounted for at fair value and service entities are consolidated.
Further details on the application of investment entity amendments and service entity considerations are detailed in note 1 to the financial statements.
Fair Value of Investments The Companys investments are typically in unlisted securities, including shares and debt, hence market prices for such investments are not typically readily available.
Instead the Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology and benchmarks to market comparables to derive the Directors valuation of investments.
This methodology requires a series of judgements to be made as explained in note 11 to the financial statements.
The valuation process and methodology were discussed with the Investment Adviser regularly during the year and with the Auditor as part of the year-end audit planning and interim review processes.
We challenged the Investment Adviser on the year-end fair value of investments as part of our consideration of the audited statements.
During the period, we reviewed the Investment Advisers quarterly valuation reports, reports on the performance of the underlying assets and the Investment Advisers assessment of macroeconomic assumptions.
The Investment Adviser confirmed that the valuation methodology has been applied consistently with prior years.
We also reviewed and challenged the valuation assumptions discount rates, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and tax rates.
The external auditor explained the results of its review of the valuations, including its assessment of managements underlying cash flow projections and assumptions: macroeconomic assumptions: and discount rate methodology and output.
On the basis of its audit work the auditor confirmed no material adjustments were proposed.
The Committee concluded that a consistent valuation methodology has been applied throughout the year and any forecast assumptions applied were appropriate.
REVENUE RECOGNITION We have considered the risk of inappropriate accounting recognition of revenue to be a relatively low risk given the nature of the Companys activities.
INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Committee satisfied itself that the system of internal control and compliance over financial reporting was effective, through consideration of regular reports from the Investment Adviser and Administrator.
We also considered the adequacy of resources, qualifications and experience of staff in the finance function and had direct access and independent discussions with the external auditor during the course of the year.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE Following extensive dialogue with management, we reviewed the Companys 2017 Annual Report and financial statements.
We advised the Board that, in our opinion, the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary to assess the Companys performance, operating model and strategy.
CONTROLS REVIEW Asset availability review In the year an external review of the Companys controls and processes relating to asset availability reporting was concluded.
Asset availability reporting was considered an important non-financial KPI for a number of our investments, as there are consequential implications on returns if such assets become unavailable for public use.
The review concluded the Company had sufficient controls in operation for the accurate capture and reporting of such information, with no weaknesses or control deficiencies identified 59 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2017 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Tax compliance and reporting Companies are increasingly required to manage tax risk by integrating greater process and controls to meet new and more stringent reporting requirements, increased regulatory demands, and audit activity.
A critical aspect is the Companys ability to streamline and strategically manage the end-to-end core processes underlying all tax activities with a focus on managing risk.
It was therefore agreed that the next annual controls and process review will focus on the Companys tax policies and procedures.
VIABILITY ASSESSMENT We carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company with a view to identify risks which may impact the Companys viability.
Detailed stress tests, including impact assessment on the Companys forecasted cash flows, showed significant resilience in the Companys ability to remain viable.
The results of the risk assessment process are detailed in the Viability Statement on page 40.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR We recommended to the Board the scope and terms of engagement of the external auditor.
We considered auditor objectivity and independence, audit tenure and audit tendering and auditor effectiveness as detailed below.
Objectivity and independence In assessing the objectivity of the auditor, we considered the terms under which the external auditor may be appointed to perform non-audit services.
Work expected to be completed by an external auditor includes formal reporting for shareholders, regulatory assurance reports and work in connection with new investments.
Under the policy there is a specific list of services for which the external auditor cannot be engaged, as we consider that the provision of such services would impact its independence.
Any potential services to be provided by the external auditor with an expected value of up to 50,000, and which are not prohibited by the policy, must be pre-approved by the Chairman of the Committee: any services above this value require pre-approval by the full Audit and Risk Committee.
Non-audit fees represented 31.3% of total audit fees.
EY undertook its standard independence and objectivity procedures in relation to non-audit engagements and confirmed compliance with these to the Committee.
Further details on the amounts of non-audit fees paid to EY are set out in note 7 to the financial statements.
These were reported to us and were not considered to be a significant risk impacting the objectivity and independence of EY external Auditors.
Audit tendering and tenure The Committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor, including rotation of the audit partner.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five years and the year to 31 December 2017 was the second year for the current lead audit partner.
We continue to challenge EY on its process for transitioning other key current audit team members reaching the end of their rotation terms and continue to be actively engaged in the developments in this area and in ensuring an appropriate level of continuity of the team.
In October 2010, the Company put out to full tender the audits of the Group and its controlled investee entities.
In addition to complying with good practice and satisfying new corporate governance requirements, the tender enabled the Board to benchmark competitiveness and value for money.
Following the tender, EY was appointed auditor of the Company.
In line with the new auditor rotation requirements for listed companies, the next full tender is expected to commence by 2020.
Since 2010, a number of investee level audits have been awarded to alternative audit firms, notably KPMG.
Review of auditor effectiveness As part of our annual review of the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit, the Committee conducted an in-depth review in 2017 of the auditors performance and we were satisfied in this regard.
This was facilitated through the completion of a questionnaire by relevant stakeholders including members of the Committee and senior members of the Investment Advisers finance team, review and challenge of the audit plan for consistency with the Companys financial statement risks, and review of the audit findings report.
There were no significant matters arising which require the service to be immediately retendered.
In accordance with the relevant Corporate Governance Code principles, the Committee will continue to review the effectiveness of the external auditor and seek to retender in line with best practice.
60 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2017 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Review of auditors remuneration The Committee carried out a review of the proposed audit fees for 2017.
There was an increase at Group level, driven by general cost inflation.
We consider that the audit fees for 2017 present good value for money for the Companys shareholders.
REGULATORY AND TAX ENVIRONMENT We received regular reports from the Administrator and Investment Adviser on regulation and regulatory developments.
Taxation We continue to monitor tax regulation and tax policy developments, in particular developments around the OECD-led BEPS initiative, across our geographies.
During the year the U. K. and Belgium enacted substantial pieces of new tax legislation, containing provisions relating to corporate interest deductibility and group losses carried forward.
These rules and the number of potential elections available in the U. K. make the assessment of impact of the rules complex and subject to a degree of judgement.
Whilst no material net adverse valuation impacts have currently been noted, there can be no guarantee that responses to the OECD proposals by other governments or changes in approach to these rules as a consequence of changes in guidance or recognised industry practice will not have a negative impact on the Companys performance.
Common Reporting Standard All qualifying entities are now required to comply with the requirements of the Common Reporting Standard CRS.
The Company through its registrar Capita has implemented appropriate systems and procedures for compliance with these regulations.
CRS reporting for the end of 2017 is on course to be submitted by June 2018.
Tax Strategy reporting Legislation requiring large businesses to publish a Tax Strategy document became effective from 1 January 2017.
Whilst it is not clear the legislation should directly capture the Company, the Company has chosen to publish its Tax Strategy document for the purposes of transparency and good governance and will continue to monitor compliance going forward.
Retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes Financial Conduct Authority FCA rules came into force on 1 January 2014 relating to the restrictions on the retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes and close substitutes came into effect.
The Company continues to confirm its shares qualify as an 'excluded security' under these rules and will therefore be excluded from the FCA's restrictions, which apply to non-mainstream pooled investment products.
As such, the Company's shares can continue to be recommended by independent financial advisers IFAs to ordinary retail investors in accordance with the FCA's rules.
The Company is advised that the basis of being excluded from these restrictions is principally due to the Company conducting its affairs in such a manner that it would have qualified for approval by HMRC as an investment that had been resident in the U. K. in its previous accounting periods.
The Company intends to conduct its affairs so that this remains the case for the foreseeable future.
FOCUS FOR 2018 Alongside routine matters, this year the Committee will progress the independent review of the Companys tax policies and procedures, as well as continue to monitor any political, tax, and regulatory developments in its applicable geographies.
