STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 53 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CHAIRMANS INTRODUCTION Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Report which sets out our governance structure and highlights the governance activity of the Board and its principal Committees during the course of the year.
The Board remains committed to maintaining good corporate governance practices throughout the Ferrexpo Group.
The structure, policies and procedures we have adopted, which are described in this report, the Directors Report and the reports of the various Committees, reflect this commitment, but we recognise the need to keep them under review and to make changes where necessary to ensure that standards are maintained.
The Board and management of the Group have a policy of conducting all business affairs in a fair and transparent manner and of maintaining high ethical standards in dealings with all relevant parties.
Information on Board succession is set out below in the Nominations Committee Report.
As expected, the rate of departures slowed in 2017 and, as the longestserving Nonexecutive Director joined only in August 2014, we can now afford a brief pause in the Board succession process, which we will use in order to take stock before planning the next round of appointments.

The Board also held sessions at which the relevant executive heads of department led a more detailed discussion on aspects of operations, finance, HR and management succession planning, sales and marketing, and communications.
The Board visited the Groups operations in Horishni Plavni formerly known as Komsomolsk between 27 and 29 September 2017.
During that time the Board inspected various parts of the operations and community projects in the local area, received various presentations from executive management in respect of operations and strategy, and held an informal meeting at which many of its standard agenda items were covered.
The Board meets for dinner on the evening immediately prior to each scheduled Board meeting.

The Board is supported by the Executive Committee which meets approximately monthly.
All of the information that is submitted to the Board by management is reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee.

There is now a Chairman, two Executive Directors and four independent Directors, and the Board and Committee structure is such that decision making is not dominated by a single individual or small group.
Controlling Shareholder Relationship Agreement Kostyantin Zhevago is a beneficiary of The Minco Trust, which owns 100% of Fevamotinico S. a. r. l. the majority shareholder in the Company.
Consequently he, The Minco Trust and Fevamotinico S. a. r. l. collectively the Controlling Shareholder have entered into a Relationship Agreement with the Company in order to ensure that the Group is capable of carrying on its business independently, that transactions and relationships between the Group, Fevamotinico S. a. r. l. The Minco Trust and Mr Zhevago are at arms length and on normal commercial terms, and that there shall be at all times a majority of Directors independent of Fevamotinico S. a. r. l.

This procedure operates effectively in identifying potential conflicts and ensuring that they are managed appropriately and that conflicted individuals are not involved in the relevant decisionmaking process.
The Group aims to follow emerging best practice in this area.
Training and Professional Development The Chairman is responsible for agreeing training and development requirements with each Director to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to continue to contribute effectively to the Boards discussions.
All Directors receive updates given to the Board as a whole on changes and proposed changes in laws and regulations affecting the Group, as and when necessary.
During 2017 separate training sessions were held for the members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees on recent developments in regulation and recommended practice.
Site visits are held for the whole Board annually, so as to ensure that all Directors are familiar with the Groups operations, and Directors may visit the operations of the Group independently to the extent to which they feel this is necessary.
During the year, as in previous years, the Board spent two days visiting the site in Ukraine.
In addition, training may be provided by the Groups advisers in respect of specific areas of interest to the Board, including general economic and market conditions, developments in corporate governance regulations and best practice and any other matters as agreed by the Chairman.
All Directors may take independent professional advice at the expense of the Group in the furtherance of their duties.
Induction On appointment, all Directors are advised of their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of a public listed company.
In addition, an appropriate induction programme is provided to each Director upon appointment, taking into consideration the individual qualifications and experience of the Director.
Following their appointments to the Board at the end of 2016 and in June 2017 respectively, Vitalii Lisovenko and Simon Lockett received an induction briefing that took account of their previous experience and their responsibilities at Ferrexpo.
Where relevant, these inductions included meetings with other Directors and key members of the senior management team.
They were also provided with relevant information, including the Companys most recent financial reports, Board briefing packs and Group policies and procedures.
Information Flow The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all Directors receive timely and accurate information in order to enable them to discharge their obligations effectively.
Working with the Company Secretary, the Chairman ensures that agendas, briefing notes and reports for each Board meeting are agreed and distributed to the Board in advance and in sufficient time to allow proper consideration of their contents.
The papers include reports on the Groups operations, and take into account the factors set out in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors duty to promote the success of the Company, and such factors are also considered by the Executive Committee when making any proposals and recommendations to the Board.
Decisions made by the Board are set within the framework of the Directors statutory duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole.
Minutes of each Board and Committee meeting are prepared shortly after the meeting and their contents agreed with the Chairman or relevant Committee Chairman before being circulated more widely to the Board where appropriate.
Actions arising from the meetings are recorded and communicated as appropriate, and updates on outstanding actions are discussed at subsequent meetings.
Directors have the right to request that any concerns they have are recorded in the appropriate Committee or Board minutes.
Ferrexpo plc 2017 Annual Report & Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 58 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED Time Commitment Nonexecutive Directors would normally expect to spend at least two days a month, on average, on Ferrexpos affairs, and in the case of the Senior Independent Director, the Committee Chairmen and in particular the Chairman of the Board, considerably more than that.
The attendance of the Directors at Board and Committee meetings during 2017 is shown in the table below.
The Nonexecutive Directors are required to confirm at least annually that they are able to commit sufficient time to the affairs of the Company, and all of our Nonexecutive Directors have given this confirmation in respect of 2018.

3 Bert Nacken was unable to attend the Board and Committee meetings in November 2017 as he was recovering from an operation.
Performance Evaluation The annual performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees was carried out internally in 20162017 by the Chairmen of these bodies.
The evaluation process involved the completion of questionnaires by Board and Committee members, with responses collated and analysed by the Chairmen with assistance from the Company Secretary.
The Chairman of the Board then discussed the feedback from the questionnaires, and the comments made, with each Director individually before relaying the conclusions to the Board.
The last externally facilitated evaluation the Companys first was conducted in 2013 and was reported on in the 2013 Annual Report.
In line with the Governance Code, the Board had intended to conduct an externally facilitated performance evaluation process during 20162017, but later decided in view of the number of changes to the Board during the year that it was preferable to postpone this until 20172018.
The 20162017 evaluation concluded that the Board and its Committees continued to work well after significant changes in their composition: that Boardlevel relationships were generally good, with effective communication and open discussion of the various challenges that Ferrexpo faced.
The process revealed a demand for more training in order to ensure that Directors keep abreast of changing regulatory requirements, and training sessions were arranged for the Audit and Remuneration Committees towards the end of 2017 this was also in line with one of the Bank F&C review subcommittees recommendations for improvements in corporate governance.
The Senior Independent Director and the other Nonexecutive Directors have evaluated, and will continue to monitor, the performance of the Chairman.
