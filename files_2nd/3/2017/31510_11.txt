The following analysis, required we are exposed are foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net cash Foreign exchange risk and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared We are exposed to foreign exchange risk, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this from non-Sterling revenues.
Our policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of our financial assets and liabilities to sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the currency risk is as follows: sensitivity analysis: Deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
30 December 2017 24 December 2016 No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible m m to further rate movements.
Euro Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been Trade receivables 2.4 2.6 excluded from this analysis.
Other receivables 1.9 1.9 Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Cash and cash equivalents 19.3 6.9 Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result Trade payables 19.6 18.2 from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Other payables 2.0 2.1 Interest rate sensitivity 2.0 8.9 The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in US Dollar interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

Trade payables 0.7 0.5 At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit 0.3 0.3 and profit and loss reserve would increase by 0.2m 2016: remain the same.
Japanese Yen For a decrease of 50 basis points, the current year figures would decrease by 0.2m 2016: remain the same.
Trade payables 0.1 Foreign exchange sensitivity 0.1 As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro and US dollar exchange rates.
The following information details our sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in Sterling against the Euro and the US Dollar.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign TOTAL 1.6 9.2 currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of our exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the end of the financial period, and based on the outstanding foreign currency balances at the period end.
