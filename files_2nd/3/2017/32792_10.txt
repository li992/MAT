GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE The Directors support high standards of corporate governance and it is the policy of the Company to comply with current best practice in UK corporate governance to the extent appropriate for a company of its size.
The Board intends that the Company will comply fully with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code April 2016 during the 2018 financial year, save as set out below: a William A. Franke, the Chairman, does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate Governance Code, given that he is the managing partner of Indigo.
However, given the benefits to the Company of his recognised experience in the airline industry, the Board believes that Mr Franke should continue as Chairman.
b The underlying principles of the Companys Remuneration Policy, described in more detail in the Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 54, are that: i remuneration must be competitive whilst not being more than is necessary to attract, retain and motivate executive management of the quality required to continue to run the Company successfully: and ii a significant proportion of remuneration remains performance based.
Following a period of consultation with a large number of significant Shareholders, the policy was approved by the Companys Shareholders at the Companys 2015 annual general meeting and will remain in place for a period of three years.
The policy does not include provisions allowing the Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum as mentioned in paragraph D. 1.1. of the Corporate Governance Code.
The Company believes that the policy as approved by Shareholders reflects the Companys preference to keep all aspects of its business as simple as possible.
Nonetheless, the Company has been transparent with its Shareholders in this respect and the Remuneration Committee will continue to review all aspects of the Remuneration Policy on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to align with the Companys and Shareholders interests.
The Board considers that it and the Company have, during the financial year ended 31 March 2017, complied with the Corporate Governance Code September 2014, save as set out above.
The Corporate Governance Code is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and is available for review on the Financial Reporting Council's website: www.
