Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Governance AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT Chairmans Introduction to the Audit Committee Report I am pleased to present the Report of the Audit Committee for 2017.
This Report provides shareholders with an overview of the activities carried out by the Committee during the year.
On 1 December 2016, I succeeded Andrew Cripps as Chairman of this Committee.
We reported last year that having tendered the external audit engagement we intended to appoint  LLP PwC as the Companys statutory auditor for the year ending March 2018.
This was intended to enable a smooth transition from KPMG to PwC, having completed the process of integrating Budgens and Londis into the Groups accounting systems.
On 27 January 2017 it was announced that we were intending to merge with Tesco.
As a consequence, the Committee and the Board concluded that the Companys best interests would be served by maintaining the status quo and ensuring stability until completion of the merger.
Accordingly, we agreed to recommend KPMG as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with Tesco.
Should the merger not complete, the Company would then look to re-tender the external audit engagement.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Andrew Cripps for his significant contribution to the Group over the past nine years and was pleased that, rather than retiring as planned, he has agreed to remain a member of the Board and Audit Committee.
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee.

26 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Governance In carrying out its reviews during the year, the Committee considered: whether the Group had applied appropriate accounting policies and practices both on a year on year basis and across the Group: the significant areas in which judgement had been applied in preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out on pages 64 to 69 of the Annual Report and Accounts: the paper prepared to support the going concern and viability statement referred to on page 17 of the Annual Report and Accounts: reports from the Group Finance Director and the External Auditor: the clarity and completeness of disclosures and compliance with relevant financial reporting standards and corporate governance and regulatory requirements: and whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups position and performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee also: approved the Internal Audit and External Auditors work plans for the Group: considered regular reports from the Head of Internal Audit on their findings: reviewed the External Auditors independence and objectivity, the effectiveness of the audit process and approved the External Auditors remuneration: reviewed the recommendation to appoint PwC as statutory auditor for the year ending 30 March 2018 and recommended the re-appointment of KPMG as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with Tesco: and approved the appropriateness of the External Auditor providing non-audit services and related fees.
Significant Judgemental Areas The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the accounts for the year ended 24 March 2017 and how these were addressed are outlined below.
Each of these areas received particular focus from the External Auditor, who provided detailed analysis and assessment of the matters in their report to the Committee.
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension Schemes The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, as outlined in note 18 to the financial statements.
Although the defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual, they are sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions.
We challenged the valuations prepared by the Groups pension advisors and, following discussions with management, were satisfied that the judgements exercised were appropriate.
During their audit, KPMG evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used by the Groups pension advisors and assessed whether the assumptions made were appropriate and not materially different from external benchmarks.
KPMG reported to us on the assumptions used and the way that our schemes had been accounted.
Property Provisions The Group has recorded property provisions in the sum of 37.9m as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements, which, by their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental.
We scrutinised the key elements of judgement with management to assure ourselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions.
Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements exercised were appropriate.
As part of the year end audit, KPMG considered the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, any developments relating to specific claims, and the prior history of lease obligations, provisions and claims in order to assess whether the provisions recorded were appropriate.
Following discussions with the External Auditor, and the deliberations set out above, we were satisfied that the financial statements dealt appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement.
The External Auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that they had found in the course of their work.
The Committee noted their work and were satisfied that no material amounts required adjustment.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable Assessment One of the key compliance requirements of a groups financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, balanced and understandable.
The coordination and review of Group wide contributions into the Annual Report and Accounts follows a well established and documented process, which is performed in parallel with the formal process undertaken by the External Auditor.
The Committee received a summary of the approach taken by management in the preparation of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts to ensure that it met the requirements of the Code.
This, and our own scrutiny of the document, enabled the Committee, and then the Board, to confirm that the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups position and performance, business model and strategy.
27 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Governance AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups internal controls and risk management systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls.
In order to keep the Committee abreast of latest developments, the Head of Internal Audit reported to each meeting on developments and emerging risks to internal control systems and on the evolution of major risks.
In addition, the Committee reviewed reports issued by both Internal Audit and the External Auditor and held regular discussions with the Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the External Auditor.
During the course of these reviews, the Committee has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant.
Internal Audit The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function including its focus, work plan, activities and resources.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Committee reviewed and approved the Internal Audit plan for the year having considered the principal areas of risk in the business and the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the function.
During the year, the Committee received regular verbal and written reports from the Head of Internal Audit summarising findings from the work of Internal Audit and the responses from management to deal with the findings.
Amongst other topics, these included further reports on the operations in India, where the control environment continues to mature well.
The Committee monitors progress on the implementation of any action plans arising on significant findings to ensure these are completed satisfactorily and meets with the Head of Internal Audit in the absence of management.
External Audit It is the responsibility of the Committee to monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of KPMG, the External Auditor.
In February 2017, we met with KPMG to agree the audit plan for the year end, highlighting the key financial statement and audit risks, to ensure that the audit was appropriately focused.
In addition, KPMGs letter of engagement and independence was reviewed by the Committee in advance of the audit.
In May 2017, in advance of the finalisation of the financial statements, we received a report from KPMG on their key audit findings, which included the key areas of risk and significant judgements referred to above, and discussed the issues with them in order for the Committee to form a judgement on the financial statements.
In addition, we considered the Letter of Representation that the External Auditor requires from the Board.
We meet with the External Auditor privately at least twice a year to discuss any matters they may wish to raise without management being present.
Assessment of Effectiveness of External Audit The Committee obtained feedback on the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit process from key management personnel through a short questionnaire.
The results were positive, confirming such areas as effective planning, appropriate focus on risk, continuity, commitment and integrity.
The Committee then reviewed the audit process with KPMG and noted the beneficial effect of open discussion of potential issues early in the process.
The Committee concluded that the external audit process was operating effectively and KPMG continued to prove effective in its role as External Auditor.
Audit Tender The current External Auditor was first appointed for the year ended 1 April 2005 and the external audit had not been tendered since then.
We reported last year that following a tender process we intended that, following the completion of the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 25 March 2016, KPMG would be re-appointed as the Companys External Auditor subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on 6 July 2016, and that PwC would be appointed as the Companys External Auditor, subject to approval by shareholders, at the AGM in July 2017.
This was intended to enable a smooth transition to new auditors, during a year in which we are engaged in the process of integrating Budgens and Londis, particularly into the Companys accounting systems.
On 27 January 2017 it was announced that we were intending to merge with Tesco to create the UKs leading food business.
As a consequence, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board concluded, that the Companys best interests would be served by maintaining the status quo and ensuring stability until completion of the merger.
Accordingly, we agreed to retain KPMG as statutory auditor until completion of the merger with Tesco.
Accordingly, a resolution proposing the re-appointment of KPMG as the Companys External Auditor will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 5 July 2017.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Companys choice of External Auditor.
The Committee will continue to review the auditor appointment and the need to tender the audit, ensuring the Groups compliance with the Code and any related regulations.
28 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Governance Non-Audit Services The Committee recognises the potential for any non-audit services to compromise auditor independence.
Hence as reported last year, the Committee reviewed its policy on non-audit services provided by the External Auditor to ensure that the External Auditor remains free from any actual or perceived conflict of interest, in accordance with professional and regulatory requirements.
The principal requirements of the policy are that the External Auditor may not undertake prohibited services, which include: book keeping: the design and implementation of financial information systems or financial controls: outsourced internal audit services that relate to internal accounting controls, financial systems of financial statements: secondments to the Group where the audit firm secondee acts as an employee of the Group or performs any decision making, supervisory or ongoing monitoring function: remuneration related services: actuarial services: management functions: tax services that depend for their effectiveness on a particular accounting treatment: and legal services unrelated to the audit.
The Committee must approve any individual non-audit services above 25,000.
Discretion is used, subject to the controls set out above, in obtaining non-audit services from the External Auditor, although other accountancy firms are also used when appropriate.
In accordance with the policy, a cumulative summary of non-audit fees paid to the External Auditor and third party providers is presented to the Committee on a scheduled basis.
In view of their knowledge of the Groups ways of working and the importance of efficient integration of the combined businesses, KPMG were asked to provide due diligence services in respect of the merger with Tesco.
The aggregate fee for this amounted to 275,000.
Other non-audit work comprised the interim review, for which fees of 44,000 were charged, and other small assignments to assist with tax compliance, advice received in relation to India and other matters for aggregate fees of 133,080.
The Committee believes that there are sound commercial and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the External Auditor and that it is not of a nature which would affect its independence as External Auditor.
The Committee has taken note of the EU Audit Reforms which came into full force from June 2016 and only apply to financial years beginning on or after 17 June 2016.
Accordingly the Committee is undertaking a review of its terms of reference and its policy on non-audit services applicable to the financial year ending 30 March 2018 to ensure that they are compliant.
Compliance with Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014 The Group complies with the Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014 relating to audit tendering and the provision of nonaudit services, as discussed further above.
Whistleblowing Programme The Group has a whistleblowing programme in all of its operations whereby employees can, in confidence, report on matters where they feel a malpractice has taken or is taking place, or if health and safety standards have been or are being compromised.
Additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to the environment.
The programme allows employees to raise their concerns with their line manager or, if that is inappropriate, to raise them on a confidential basis.
An externally facilitated confidential helpline and confidential email facility are provided to protect the identity of employees in these circumstances.
Any concerns are investigated on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department and or the Company Secretary and feedback is given to the person making the complaint as appropriate via the confidential email facility.
An official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and results are summarised for the Committee.
Committee Effectiveness The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by both the Board and the Committee itself and results are summarised for the Committee.
The Audit Committee is charged to ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate independent investigation and appropriate follow up.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2017.
