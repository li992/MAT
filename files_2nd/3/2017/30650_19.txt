The impact on equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the US Dollar against the Pound Sterling, Thai Baht and the Malaysian Ringgit would have decreased or increased equity by 7.0m, 3.1m and 1.0m, respectively.
Interest rate risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long-term in fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
Occasionally a portion of fixed debt interest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
As at year end 2017, the percentage of debt at fixed interest was 92% 2016 77%.
