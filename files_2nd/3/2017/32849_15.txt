Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the available cash in the Company under Jersey law.
As Russian, Kazakh and Armenian legislation identifies the basis of distribution of the dividends as accumulated profit, the ability to distribute cash up to the Company from the Russian, Kazakh and Armenian operating companies will be based on the statutory historical information of each standalone entity.
Statutory financial statements in the Russian Federation are prepared in accordance with Russian accounting standards which differs from IFRS, while Kazakhstan and Armenia have adopted IFRS from 1 January 2006 and 1 January 2011, respectively.
However, current legislation and other statutory regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal interpretation: consequently, actual distributable reserves may differ from the amount of accumulated profit in accordance with statutory financial statements.
