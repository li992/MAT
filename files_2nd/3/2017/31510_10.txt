We have assessed these balances for recoverability and we believe that their credit quality remains intact.

The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.

Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
They return a fixed rate of interest.
The weighted average effective interest rate on the Gilts held at the balance sheet date is 0.1% pa. An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: These investments are classified as held-to-maturity, and are held at amortised cost.
The Directors estimate that the fair value of these 30 December 2017 24 December 2016 investments at the current period end is equal to their carrying value.

Balance at end of period 9.9 8.7 17 OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade and other payables The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 26.
We have no significant concentration of credit risk, as our exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
We charge interest at appropriate market rates on balances 30 December 2017 24 December 2016 which are in litigation.
m m Current liabilities Before accepting any new credit customer, we obtain a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then we set credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
We review credit limits regularly, and adjust them if Trade payables 88.6 93.9 circumstances change.
In the case of one-off customers, our policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer Other tax and social security 61.5 58.4 credit terms.
Other payables 11.7 10.6 The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result we consider the credit quality of period end trade receivables to be Accruals and deferred income 50.3 51.3 high.
We regularly review trade receivables which are past due but not impaired, and we consider, based on past experience, whether 212.1 214.2 the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable.
We maintain regular contact with all such customers and, where necessary, we take legal action to recover the receivable.
We make an allowance for impairment for any specific amounts which we consider to be irrecoverable or only Trade payables, other payables, and accruals principally comprise amounts due in respect of trade purchases and ongoing costs.
We also have a separate general allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales and is based on historical Their carrying value in both periods approximates to their fair value.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 9.9m 2016: 8.7m consists of a specific provision of 4.0m 2016: 3.5m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 5.2m 2016: 4.5m, and a general provision The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 45 days 2016: 47 days.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, we The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those have recorded impairment charges in the consolidated income statement and have written carrying values down to their estimated terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.

On a funding basis also known as a Technical Provisions The facility is secured on the trade receivables and stock of the Group.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the basis, being the basis on which the triennial actuarial valuations are carried out, the funding deficit at the current period end is asset backing at the time and can never exceed 140m.
There were no borrowings under the facility at either the current or previous estimated at 220m, this estimate being based on an approximate roll-forward of the 2014 triennial funding valuation.

It is a lump sum payable on retirement, not a recurring pension.
As such, there is no underlying pension plan.

All trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plan beneficiaries.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined Rate of increase in salaries 4.40% 4.50% by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2014 by the plan actuary.
The 5 April 2017 valuation is in progress but is not completed.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently Inflation assumption RPI 3.40% 3.50% rolled forward the results of the 5 April 2014 valuation to 30 December 2017.
This roll-forward exercise involves updating all the Inflation assumption CPI 2.40% 2.50% assumptions which are market-based i. e. inflation, discount rate, rate of increase in pensions and rate of CARE revaluation to values Discount rate 2.50% 2.85% as at 30 December 2017.
The mortality tables used to derive life expectancy assumptions for the accounting valuation are the same Life expectancy yrs : pensioner aged 65 as those used for the most recent agreed triennial actuarial valuation, albeit that they are adjusted each year for actual experience.
We only change the underlying mortality tables once a triennial actuarial valuation has been agreed with the plan Trustees.
We are currently male 88.0 87.9 using CMI 2013 mortality tables, and we will update these in line with the agreed April 2017 triennial valuation once it is completed.

Funding arrangements female 92.4 92.3 beyond June 2018 are in the process of being agreed with the plan trustees together with the April 2017 valuation.
The Groups estimated total cash contributions to the defined benefit plan in the 52 weeks ending 29 December 2018 will depend on these funding arrangements, so they cannot be accurately estimated at the time of approving these financial statements.
