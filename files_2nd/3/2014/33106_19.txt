The evaluation assessed the performance of the Chairman, the individual Directors and the Board.
Any concerns were noted, discussed at the subsequent Board meeting and appropriate action taken.
Leadership: each of the Directors evaluated the Chairmans performance and the Senior Independent Director discussed the results with the Chairman.
It was considered that the Chairmans performance had improved yearonyear, the agenda for meetings were well structured and that meetings were effective and open.
strategy: during the year it had been noted that the Board had increased the amount of time spent discussing strategy and making strategic decisions for the long term.
However it was regarded that this matter be given further prominence and that strategy be more clearly defined and conveyed to shareholders.
