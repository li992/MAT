CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT Save in the limited instances explained below, the Board is pleased to report that during the year and as at the date of this Annual Report the Company has complied with the main principles and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012.
Copies of the Code are available at www.
This report, together with the Directors Report on pages 68 to 71 and the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 67, provides details of how the Company has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Code and where required explains the rationale for instances where the Company has not been compliant, namely: i the external facilitation of a Board evaluation exercise: ii putting the external audit out to tender: iii the specification of Board diversity targets: and iv the design of performance-related elements of remuneration, i. e. the requirement for awards to be phased rather than being granted in blocks.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board meets regularly to review the progress of the Company and to discuss the measures required for its future development.
Directors are provided in advance with a formal agenda of matters to be discussed at each meeting, and with the detailed information needed to monitor the progress of the Company.
Records of meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained by the Company Secretary and are approved by the Board at the following meeting.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and, if required, are able to take independent advice at the Companys expense in the furtherance of their duties.
Any question of the removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Whilst the members of the Board are all experienced and well qualified, the opportunity to receive further training at the Companys expense is available to them at all times.

4.2 of the Code, the non-executive directors also met without the executives present during the year.
BOARD EVALUATION The directors recognise that the Code requires an external evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies to be carried out at least every three years.
However, the directors considered the position in relation to the current year and concluded that an external evaluation was not necessary.
In reaching this conclusion the directors were mindful of the effective operation of the Board during the year and the continuing strong performance of the Company.
An internal evaluation of the Board for the current year was conducted through the completion of formal detailed board, and board committee evaluation questionnaires by each director.
In addition a review involving each director was carried out.
This review was conducted by the Deputy Chairman and Company Secretary and principally covered the following areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board evaluation questionnaires, individual directors performances and key objectives for the coming year, and the identification of any specific training and development requirements.
The evaluation questionnaires were focussed on assessing effectiveness in the following key areas: the size and balance of the Board: the quality of board debates and its decision making processes: the individual contributions made by each director: the Chairmans approach to leadership: the non-executive directors challenge of the executive directors: the Boards approach to identifying and mitigating key business risks: the quality of the Companys communications with key stakeholders: the Boards consideration of diversity and succession planning: and the induction and training of board members.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 37 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED In accordance with provision B.
6.3 of the Code and building on the results of the evaluation questionnaires, the Deputy Chairman led a separate evaluation of the performance of the Chairman.
This evaluation principally comprised a review of the Chairmans leadership style and tone in promoting effective decisionmaking and ensuring constructive and sufficient debate took place around key issues.
The results of this evaluation were entirely satisfactory.
The evaluation concluded that overall the Board and its Committees had operated well during the year, with all directors making an effective contribution to the Board commensurate with their experience and responsibilities.
However, as was also the case in previous years, the evaluation identified that succession planning remained an area that needed to be given greater focus.
Consistent with the requirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Nomination Committee has therefore been tasked with developing a firm plan for independent nonexecutive director succession over the coming year, to reflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006.
BOARD BALANCE AND DIVERSITY The Board has remained unchanged during the year and consists of three executive directors and three independent non-executive directors.
Julian Schild acts as the Companys Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
Membership of each committee of the Board is set out in the table below: NAME OF DIRECTOR REMUNERATION AUDIT NOMINATION COMMITTEE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE 3 Charles Wigoder - - 3 3 Julian Schild Chairman Andrew Lindsay - - - Chris Houghton - - - 3 3 Melvin Lawson - 3 Michael Pavia Chairman Chairman indicates independent non-executive directors The Board, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, regularly reviews whether the composition of the Board and the diversity of its members remain appropriate in the light of the commercial challenges and risks facing the Company.
The members of the Nomination Committee believe that the composition of the Board is currently appropriate for the size of the Company and the nature of its operations which have not materially changed in scope since the prior year.
However, the Committee appreciates that should the Companys situation change in future, then the appointment of new directors to the Board may be required.
38 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The main objective of the Nomination Committee in considering the appointment of new directors to the Board, remains to ensure that successful candidates are of the highest calibre and demonstrate the best possible combination of skills and experience.
The Committees Terms of Reference further stipulate that candidates from a wide range of backgrounds shall be considered and that due regard will be given to the benefits of diversity on the Board.
Notwithstanding the Code requirement to set out measurable objectives in relation to Board diversity, it remains the Committees strong view that it is not appropriate to stipulate the characteristics of any future directors, including gender, ahead of a full assessment of the particular requirements of each role at the time a candidate is being sought.
The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out above in identifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory manner.
Further detail regarding the Companys position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the organisation is set out in the People and Organisation section of the Strategic Report on pages 29 to 31.
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company with the Executive Chairman responsible for developing the strategic direction of the business and ensuring the effective operation of the Board, including compliance with principles of good corporate governance, and the Chief Executive primarily responsible for implementing strategy and running the Groups operations on a day to day basis.
As appropriate, and in order to ensure good corporate governance, the Executive Chairman is assisted by the Companys independent non-executive Deputy Chairman in ensuring the effective operation of the Board.
The division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive has been set out in writing and agreed by the Board in accordance with the Code provision A.
SUPPLY OF INFORMATION Information is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in advance of meetings.
When the Board requests additional information it is provided.
RE-ELECTION The Companys Articles stipulate that one third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.
However, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Therefore all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in July.
Acknowledging the Code requirement for a particularly rigorous review in circumstances where non-executive directors terms are being extended beyond six years, the Board has determined that all directors continue to make a valuable contribution to the commercial success of the Company, with each bringing a complementary range of skills to the team.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 39 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration of executive directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre.
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, namely Julian Schild Chairman of the Committee, Melvin Lawson and Michael Pavia.
The Directors Remuneration Report, giving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 48 to 67.
The Remuneration Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Companys website www.
co. uk, which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by the Board.
AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael Pavia Chairman of the Committee, Melvin Lawson and Julian Schild in compliance with the Code provision C. 3.1.
The activities of the Audit Committee are set out on pages 44 to 47.
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Companys website www.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR The Audit Committee is mindful of the Codes requirement for FTSE 350 companies to put external audit contracts out to tender at least every ten years.
In March 2013 the Companys then auditor PKF UK LLP PKF, which had been in place for over ten years, completed its merger with fellow accountancy firm BDO LLP BDO.
During PKFs tenure, and in accordance with ethical procedures, audit partners rotated every five years.
The prior year represented the fifth and final year for the Companys then audit partner and the Committee would ordinarily have proposed that the external audit contract for the current year be put out to tender.
However, the Committee concluded that the merger of PKF and BDO increased the breadth of resources available to the Company for the conduct of the audit.
The audit for the current year was led by a partner from the BDO side of the merger and therefore in practice the Committee felt that the audit was conducted by a new audit firm with few pre-conceptions and a fresh perspective, and as such this marks the first year of a fresh ten year cycle.
Nonetheless, and whilst the Committee is satisfied with the performance of BDO, it is conscious of the principles behind the requirement in the Code to tender the external audit and will therefore continue to closely monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of BDO.
Should any concerns arise in these areas then it is likely the Committee will reconsider its position in relation to tendering the audit contract within the current ten year period as set out in the Code.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE The Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia Chairman of Committee, Julian Schild and Charles Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the Code 40 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements provision B.
The main purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new directors.
The Nomination Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Companys website www.
The activities of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 43.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS It is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them informed about the objectives of the business.
The Board considers that it is appropriate for the executive directors to discuss any relevant matters regarding company performance with major shareholders and this is undertaken primarily by the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
The Chief Executive provides feedback from major shareholders to the other directors, in order to ensure that Board members, and in particular non-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors.
The executive directors met with a number of the Companys main shareholders during the year.
The Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director also have periodic discussions with the Companys brokers and issues are fed back to the Board as appropriate.
When reports are received from the Companys brokers following investor presentations, these are submitted to the Board for review.
Additionally the non-executive directors have at least one opportunity each year to meet with the Companys brokers to discuss any issues.
Responsibility for communication with key shareholders in relation to corporate governance and Board remuneration matters lies primarily with the Deputy Chairman who is assisted in this regard by the Company Secretary.
Individual invitations to engage with the Deputy Chairman were sent out to key shareholders during the year and, where requested, matters were discussed in more detail.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
Separate resolutions are proposed for each matter including the adoption of the Report and Accounts, the approval of the Companys Remuneration Policy, the Directors Remuneration Report and the appointment of the Groups external auditor.
Proxy votes are counted and the meeting is advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution.
The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees and the remaining non-executive directors are available to answer questions.
Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting.
INTERNAL CONTROL The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Groups systems of internal control and risk management.
However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 41 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED In conjunction with the Companys senior management team, the executive directors regularly identify, review and evaluate the key risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in place to mitigate these risks.
The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets out a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk.
The document is reported to the Audit Committee and the Companys external auditor for review at least once per year.
The Board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Company including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management and the principal risks which the Company faces during the year.
No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year.
The principal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address these risks are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 28.
The disclosures regarding internal controls do not encompass the Companys investment in the associate Opus Energy Group Limited.
SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS Details of the Companys share capital and substantial shareholdings can be found in the Directors Report under the capital structure and substantial shareholders sections on pages 69 and 70.
