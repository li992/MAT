Annual Bonus Annual bonuses are discretionary and are typically awarded in Q1 following the financial year to which they relate.
The 2014 bonus awards reflect the Committees assessment of the extent to which each of the executive Directors achieved their Financial 50% weighting and Balanced Scorecard 35% weighting performance measures and their personal objectives 15% weighting, and an holistic assessment of all other relevant factors.
A summary of the considerations and rationale for the bonus outcomes are set out below.
For more information see pages 87 and 88.
Financial 50% weighting The approach adopted for assessing financial performance is based on driving balanced performance outcomes across the financial measures Adjusted profit before tax, Adjusted Costs ex CTA, CET1 ratio fully loaded basis and the leverage ratio, weighted 20%, 10%, 10%, 10% respectively total of 50% weighting.
In line with this, performance is initially assessed against a target range for each financial measure with a binary outcome i. e. below range zero and within range 100%.
After this the Committee is required to apply discretion, considering all relevant factors, to ensure that the final outcome is appropriate.
As each financial target has been met or exceeded, a formulaic assessment of the current outcomes against financial measures implies a full 50% weighting prior to the application of Committee discretion.
There has been sustained and consistent progress made towards our 2016 Transform targets and Barclays has met all 2014 Transform financial and capital targets.
Higher Group and Core adjusted profit before tax were driven by focused cost saving initiatives.
Significant Non-Core run down throughout the year contributed to strengthening of Group capital and leverage ratios.
Group adjusted profit before tax increased 12% to 5,502m.
CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% 2013: 9.1% demonstrating progress towards the 2016 Transform financial target in excess of 11%.
The Leverage Ratio increased to 3.7% close to the 2016 Transform target to exceed 4%.
Balanced Scorecard 35% weighting Each of the five Cs of the Balanced Scorecard was assessed.
Barclays has published its 2018 targets on page 11.
There has been steady progress across the Balanced Scorecard towards our 2018 targets.
There was however deterioration in the sustained engagement metric and the Relationship Net Promoter Score.
The move in both metrics is predominately due to changes Barclays has undergone during 2014 with the Strategy Update affecting a structural change in the company.
Based on an assessment of performance against 2014 Balanced Scorecard milestones, the Committee has agreed a 22% outcome out of a maximum of 35%.
Personal objectives 15% weighting In summary, Antony Jenkins has shown strong leadership throughout the year and has been fully committed to delivering on the Transform financial targets and on improving the control environment across the organisation during 2014.
Tushar Morzaria had demonstrated a consistent strive for excellence and challenged the status quo where appropriate to drive results and achieve cost targets.
For each of the Directors, the Committee judged that 11% of a maximum of 15% was appropriate.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 29 Becoming Go-To Running the company well Overall summary The initial performance assessment outcome was 83% for each of the Directors.
The Committee subsequently used its discretion to reduce the overall outcome.
The adjustment was considered appropriate in the context of an holistic assessment which recognised that, amongst other factors, while there has been solid financial performance and steady progress has been made on strategic repositioning, statutory profit before tax continues to be impacted by material conduct issues and there remains significant further work to be done to improve overall returns.
This adjustment therefore also incorporated consideration of executive accountability for the significant Group-wide conduct issues that impacted Barclays in 2014 which included, for example, the ongoing Foreign Exchange trading investigations.
The resulting 2014 bonus is 1,100,000 57% of maximum bonus for Antony Jenkins and 900,000 64% of maximum bonus for Tushar Morzaria.
60% of each executive Directors 2014 bonus will be deferred in the form of an award under the Share Value Plan vesting over three years with one third vesting each year.
20% will be paid in cash and 20% delivered in shares.
All shares whether deferred or not deferred are subject to a further six month holding period from the point of release.
2014 bonuses are subject to clawback provisions and, additionally, unvested deferred 2014 bonuses are subject to malus provisions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses including to nil.
LTIP Barclays LTIP amount included in Antony Jenkins 2014 single total figure is the value of the amount scheduled to be released in relation to the LTIP award granted in 2012 in respect of performance period 2012-2014.
As Tushar Morzaria was not a participant in this cycle, the LTIP figure in the single figure table is shown as zero for him.
Release is dependent on, amongst other things, performance over the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014.

The Committee was satisfied that this underpin was met, and accordingly determined that the award should be considered for release to the extent of 30% of the maximum number of shares under the total award.
