Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code Throughout the year ended 28 March 2014 and to the date of this document, the Company complied with the provisions and applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 the Code.
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the Remuneration Report, describes how the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Role of the Board and its Committees The Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors the Board chaired by Richard Rose.
The Board currently consists of five Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors.
Richard Rose was an Executive Director and Chairman of Blueheath immediately prior to the reverse acquisition of Blueheath by the Booker Group in 2007 and became Non-Executive Chairman of the Company upon completion of the merger.
The Groups combined business is significantly different to and larger than Blueheath and there is a division of responsibilities between Richard and the Executive Directors and, in particular, Charles Wilson as Chief Executive, such that his current and former roles can be considered incomparable.
Having regard to all the circumstances, including the independence Richard has demonstrated as Chairman, the Board is satisfied and has determined that Richard is independent.
Consequently, all the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement in accordance with the Code.
The independence of Non-Executive Directors is considered at least annually and is based on the criteria suggested in the Code.
The Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge and bring independence to the Board and its decision making process.
The Board believes that it is appropriate to have a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Lord Bilimoria fulfils this role.
He is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal channels and for when such contact would be inappropriate.
The Board believes that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it is not so large as to be unwieldy.
The Board contains a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors such that no individual, or group of individuals can dominate the Boards decision making.
No one individual has unfettered powers of decision.
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors biographies on pages 18 and 19.
The Board meets regularly on at least twelve scheduled occasions during each year and more frequently if necessary.
There were twelve Board meetings, five Audit Committee meetings, two Nomination Committee meetings and five Remuneration Committee meetings held in the year under review and the attendance by Directors was as follows: Board Audit Nomination Remuneration Executive a b c Charles Wilson 12 12 3 5 1 2 4 5 a c Jonathan Prentis 12 12 5 5 1 5 Mark Aylwin 12 12 Guy Farrant 12 12 Bryn Satherley 12 12 Non-Executive a c Richard Rose 12 12 2 5 2 2 5 5 d Lord Bilimoria 12 12 5 5 2 2 5 5 d Helena Andreas 12 12 d Andrew Cripps 12 12 5 5 2 2 5 5 b d Stewart Gilliland 11 12 5 5 1 2 d Karen Jones 12 12 5 5 a Not a member of the Audit Committee but attended by invitation b Not a member of the Nomination Committee but attended by invitation c Not a member of the Remuneration Committee but attended by invitation d Independent Non-Executive Director 20 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance The Board is responsible to shareholders for ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and that it achieves its objectives.

Information and Professional Development Directors are continually updated on the Groups businesses, the markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive and regulatory environment through briefings to the Board and meetings with senior executives.
Board visits to Group business locations enable the Directors to meet with local management and employees and to update and maintain their knowledge and familiarity with the Groups operations.
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to visit Group operations throughout their tenure to increase their exposure to the business.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information.

Performance Evaluation An external evaluation process was conducted by the Institute of Directors in April 2013.
The next externally facilitated board evaluation will be conducted in April 2016.
During the year, the Board conducted an evaluation of its own performance and that of its three principal committees.
The individual performance of the Non-Executive Directors was also evaluated through one to one interviews with the Chairman.
In April 2014, each Director completed a questionnaire prepared by the Chairman and the Company Secretary to rate the collective performance of the Board and its committees.
The Company Secretary collated the evaluation results and the Chairman then reviewed an unattributed executive summary, highlighting key outcomes.
A report of the findings was then presented to and discussed by the Board.
No actions were considered necessary as a result of these evaluations and the Chairman confirms that each Director continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board and, where relevant, its Committees and devotes sufficient time to the role.

Directors Conflicts of Interest In accordance with the Companys Articles of Association and section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, formal procedures for the notification and authorisation of potential and actual conflicts of interest have been approved by the Board.

These procedures have operated effectively throughout the current financial period.
22 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Internal controls and risk management The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its responsibility for, the Groups systems of internal control and risk management and receives regular reports on such matters.
The Boards policy is to have systems in place which optimise the Groups ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner.
The Board has delegated to the Executive Committee detailed responsibility for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these are to be managed.
In addition to formal reviews of risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to report to the Executive Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material control issues, serious accidents or events that have had a major commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been identified.
Such matters are reported to the next Board meeting and or Audit Committee meeting as appropriate.
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated accounts which are monitored by the Audit Committee on the Boards behalf and reviewed annually by the Board.
These include: the formulation and deployment of Group accounting policies and procedures: Group policies governing the maintenance of accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial control procedures: monthly operational review meetings which include, as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues and financial control monitoring: and ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel.
The Groups systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
They are not designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board formally reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls on an annual basis.
The latest review covered the financial year to 28 March 2014.
No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from this review.
The Board has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group.
This process is continual and has been in place for the year under review up to the date of this report, and is regularly reviewed by the Board in accordance with relevant guidance.
There is an established framework of internal controls, which is set out in procedures approved by the Board and which include financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
These procedures are readily accessible to staff, who follow their guidance.
The more important elements of this framework are as follows: Management structure The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and the Executive Committee has responsibility for specific aspects of the Groups affairs.
The Board and each of its committees operate under a schedule of matters or terms of reference and the Board determines how the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee may operate within a framework of delegated authorities and reserved powers which seek to ensure that certain transactions which are significant in terms of their size or type, are undertaken only after Board review.
The Executive Committee is chaired by Charles Wilson Chief Executive and comprises Jonathan Prentis Group Finance Director, Mark Aylwin Managing Director Booker Direct, Guy Farrant Managing Director UK Cash and Carry, Bryn Satherley Operations Director, Mark Chilton Company Secretary and General Counsel and other senior executives representing the operational functions within the Group.
It meets twice a month to discuss operational matters, compliance, health and safety and trading performance.
Corporate accounting and procedures Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the corporate communication procedure.
Accounting, delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures, together with the general ethos of the Group are included in these communications, and standardised accounting policies are in place reflecting this policy.
These procedures are subject to review to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made.
23 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED Quality and integrity of personnel The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training.
Quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the ethical standards expected are communicated through senior members of staff.
Budgetary process Each year the Board approves the annual budget, which includes an assessment of key risk areas.
Performance is monitored and relevant action taken throughout the year by regular reporting to the Board of updated forecasts together with information on key risk areas.
Risk management The Board assesses risk management throughout the Group aided by detailed reviews of internal controls and risk management procedures.
The Groups risk register is reviewed by the Board as part of annual strategic planning and budgetary cycles.
Investment appraisal Capital expenditure is regulated by the use of authorisation levels.
For all expenditure beyond specified levels, Board approval is required.
Internal audit The Groups internal audit function, which reports to the Group Finance Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, monitors the effectiveness of key internal controls and the adequacy of these controls to manage business risk and to safeguard the Groups assets and resources, in accordance with a work plan approved and monitored by the Audit Committee.
Its conclusions are communicated to the relevant level of management and the function has a direct reporting responsibility to the Audit Committee.
