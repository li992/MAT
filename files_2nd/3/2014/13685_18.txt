64 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Audit committee report continued Main Activities of the Audit Committee in the Year The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year and dealt with the following matters: May November January Financial reporting and significant judgements Full year results and announcement 9 Half year results and announcement 9 Going concern report 9 External audit Review and consideration of Audit Highlights Memorandum 99 Board representation letter 99 Evaluation of external audit function 9 Reappointment recommendation to Board 9 Fees for non-audit activities 999 External audit plan 9 Separate meeting with External Auditor 99 Internal audit Internal controls & risk management report 9 Internal controls & risk management update 9 Internal audit update 99 Evaluation of Internal audit function 9 2014 Internal audit plan 9 Other Annual review of terms of reference 9 Annual evaluation of committee 9 Compliance with UK Corporate Governance and other 9 The Committees monitoring and review role during the year has been particularly focused on the financial impacts of the Fitter for the Future programme, particularly following the launch of Phase 2 of the programme and the subsequent decision to sell the Cobelplast businesses which are disclosed as Discontinued Operations, and the accounting for the two acquisitions in the year, M&H Plastics and Helioplast.
The Committee also considered recent EU directives on external auditor tenure and how this might impact the Group going forward.
In addition to the above meetings in 2013 14, at its meeting in May 2014 the Committee reviewed the Groups financial statements and other relevant disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Financial Reporting and significant Financial Judgements The Committee is responsible for reviewing whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates and judgements in the preparation of the financial statements.
In respect to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014, the significant issues reviewed and how these issues were addressed are summarised below: Restructuring and closure costs, impairment losses and other exceptional items Note 4 on page 91 of the financial statements describes the nature of the 26.7m of non-recurring and exceptional items recognised in the year, relating to the Fitter for the Future business optimisation programme and additional costs arising from other one-off events.
The Committee considered the accounting treatment and disclosure of these costs in the financial statements through a detailed review of managements plans in respect to the programme, and also sought the views of the external auditor as to the appropriateness and consistency of the accounting treatment and disclosures.
On the basis of this review the Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure of these items were appropriate.
Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 65 Valuation of assets and liabilities held for sale Note 18 on page 101 describes the basis on which certain Assets and Liabilities held for sale have been valued.
As a result of the launch of Phase 2 of the Fitter for the Future programme, the Board announced a plan to dispose of certain assets and liabilities of the Group.
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities will be recovered principally through a sales transaction and have been presented separately in the balance sheet.
The Committee considered and critically reviewed the assumptions used in managements calculations of the fair value of these assets and liabilities and considered the views of the external auditor in this issue.
On the basis of this review, the Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosures were appropriate.
Valuation of acquired intangibles In December 2013, the Group acquired two businesses, M&H Plastics for 103m and Helioplast for 8m.
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value and to separately identify intangible assets from goodwill, initially measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value.
For RPC these intangible assets were customer relationships.
There is judgement involved in estimating fair value, particularly in relation to identiable intangible assets, which requires the directors to estimate the useful economic life of each asset and the future cash ows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable discount rate.
The Group adopted a methodology which has been consistently applied to all acquisitions in recent years.
The auditor provided the Committee with their review of the fair value exercise and following discussion the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate and that the resultant fair values were reasonable.
Details of how this acquisition has been accounted for are set out in note 25 of the financial statements In addition the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that the results communications are fair, balanced and understandable, and review the results announcements and annual report and accounts to ensure that this is the case.
External Auditor KPMG has been the Companys external auditor since 1999 with the lead audit partner changing every five years.
There was a new lead audit partner for the year ended 31 March 2012.
In early 2012, the Audit Committee conducted an external audit tender.
Four audit rms including KPMG LLP were invited to participate in the process.
The tender documents and presentations were carefully scrutinised and the candidates assessed according to a range of selection criteria.
At the conclusion of the process, the Committee recommended and the Board approved that KPMG LLP be proposed for reappointment as the Companys external auditor.
The Committee policy is to put the external audit contract out to tender at least every ten years in accordance with the 2012 edition of the Code, but given the recent EU directives on auditor rotation and the length of tenure of KPMG the Committee plans to undertake another tender during the current financial year to take effect from 2015 16.
The Committee will continue to monitor best practice developments in the Code and related guidance and any changes at EU level.
The Committee has conducted a detailed review of non-audit fees paid to the external auditor and reviewed monitoring and approval procedures during the year.
It is satisfied that the level of fees for non-audit services has not impaired auditor objectivity and independence based on the principles adopted in the Group policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services.
Under the policy, the auditor may not be engaged to audit their own work, make management decisions for the Group, have a mutual financial interest with the Group or be put in the role of advocate for the Group.
Prior approval of the Audit Committee is required for non-audit services where the fees are likely to exceed specified limits both for individual assignments and in the aggregate.
Details of the amounts payable to the external auditors during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 3 to the financial statements.
The Committee is monitoring developments in the EU regarding limitations on the provision of non-audit services and will review its policy accordingly.
In addition to its review of non-audit fees, the Committee has conducted its annual assessment of the external auditor, including matters that might have a bearing on their independence, objectivity and effectiveness of their audit.
The assessment takes into account the systems and procedures adopted by KPMG and the results of internal questionnaires.
The Committee is satisfied that the external audit process remains effective and that auditor objectivity and independence is properly safeguarded.
Internal Audit The Group Internal Audit Manager is invited to attend Audit Committee meetings where external audit and internal control matters are considered and to report on the results of internal audits and progress on the implementation of recommendations directly to the Committee.
The internal audit process has become wellestablished and has continued to develop to take into account the expansion of the Group and new responsibilities, such as Bribery Act 2010 compliance and IT audits.
During the year, the Committee approved the annual internal audit plans and the scope of audits.
It also reviewed the results of audits and the internal audit resources in respect of the Group.

Such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Through the use of risk registers, these risks are assessed on a continual basis.
t An annual review is performed on the effectiveness of the system of internal control, including a detailed risk assessment.
The internal audit function undertakes work to review the system of internal control at each operation visited and reports findings to management.
t Matters relating to internal control brought to the attention of the management by internal and external auditor are reviewed and any corrective actions to the internal control procedures are made in a timely manner.
t The Group operates an effective group reporting and consolidation system.
Written monthly reports, management accounts and key performance indicators are submitted by operating units and reviewed every month by senior management.
significant risks and internal control issues are considered, actions agreed and progress monitored regularly with reporting entities and, where appropriate, at executive and Board meetings.
t Operating units produce plans to improve controls relating to key risks and any significant weaknesses identied by Group executives in addition to other initiatives and ongoing actions in progress at the local or cluster level.
t An Internal Controls Committee, comprising senior finance managers in the Group, ensures that operating units respond to and implement internal control recommendations arising from internal and external audits.
t An interim report is reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board to monitor the operating units progress against their plans to improve controls to ensure that necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses identied.
