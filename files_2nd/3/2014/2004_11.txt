Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential Amortisation of facility fees 1.3 0.9 development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built Other finance costs 3.9 3.9 and or completed in the current year and those for future years.

The Group makes assumptions to determine the timing and its best estimate of the quantum of its construction and other liabilities for which provisions are held.
Other finance costs represent imputed interest on taxation and on land purchased on deferred settlement terms.

The goodwill balance relates solely to the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited, completed on 7 November 2006, that was not already owned by the Group.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the value in use of the business using the current five year pre-tax forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash flows beyond a five year period are not extrapolated: ii A pre-tax discount rate of 13.21% 2013: 11.62% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have identified no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
