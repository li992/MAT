The Company applies shareholding requirements of 150,000 shares for the Group Chief Executive and 105,000 shares for the Group Chief Financial Officer.
New Executive Directors are expected to build holdings to these levels over time, principally through the retention of shares released to them after settling any tax due following the vesting of share awards.
As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Committee has given consideration as to whether the Executive Directors should be required to hold a minimum number of shares and to hold shares for a further period after the vesting or exercise of awards, including for a period after leaving the Company.
The Company has a long established shareholding requirement for the Executive Directors and Group Executive Board members which the Committee considers remains appropriate: at the current time, particularly taking into account that the Executive Directors and Group Executive Board Members have very significant shareholdings in the Company.
