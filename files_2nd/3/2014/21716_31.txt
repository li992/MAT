Report of the Directors RISK COMMITTEE A Risk Committee has been established and its membership and Terms of Reference are available on the Companys website www.
The Committees primary focus is around investment risk in its broadest sense, including elements such as counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Committees work has focused on two levels: 1 the direct exposures of the Company itself, for instance to AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and cash counterparts: and 2 the exposures embedded within AllBlue, its investment characteristics and the risks associated with owning AllBlue The Committee meets regularly and has, over the course of its first year, spent time defining the scope and mandate of its operations, reviewing key documentation, developing key reporting and interacting with BlueCrest and JTC to examine and understand the risks that the Company is exposed to at both levels.
Further information relating to the work of the Risk Committee is explained in the Risk Committee report on page 38.
BRIBERY The Directors have undertaken to operate the business in an honest and ethical manner and accordingly take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption.
The key components of this approach are implemented as follows: The Board is committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships: The Company will implement and enforce effective procedures to counter bribery: and The Company requires all its service providers and advisors to adopt equivalent or similar principles.
INTERNAL CONTROLS & RISK MANAGEMENT REVIEW The Board is responsible for the Companys system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board confirms that there is an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the significant risks faced by the Company.
