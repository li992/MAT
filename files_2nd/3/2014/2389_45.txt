a Since 2010, vesting of the deferred shares has been subject to a safety and environmental sustainability hurdle, and this will continue.
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all.
In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the SEEAC.
There is no identied minimum vesting threshold level.

d The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 11 February 2013 of 4.55. e The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 12 February 2014 was 4.87 and for ADSs was $48.38 and on 11 February 2015 was 4.46 and for ADSs was $40.35.

The vesting of these shares is not subject to further performance conditions and he receives deferred shares at each scrip payment date as part of his election choice.
g All matching shares have been pro-rated to reect actual service during the performance period and these gures have been used to calculate the face value.
