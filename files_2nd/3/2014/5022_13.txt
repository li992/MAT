Strategic report Governance Financials LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE Matt Davies Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee Dear Shareholder, This is our first report under the revised Corporate Governance Code and I hope that the additional disclosures will give a greater Insight into how the Audit and Risk Committee carries out its responsibilities.
In accordance with the new requirements, we have also confirmed to the Board that we consider the annual report and accounts as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable.
As KPMG had been the Groups auditors since 2003, we carried out a competitive tender for our external audit during the year, which included a non big four firm.
 offered the best combination of quality and price, and in January 2014 we appointed that firm as auditors for the 2013 14 accounts in place of KPMG.
I would like to thank KPMG for the work they have conducted during their ten year tenure.
In accordance with best practice, we intend to tender the external audit every 5 years going forward.
2013 14 was the first year of our formalised internal audit programme.
Reports were received by the Committee on readiness for Greenhouse Gas reporting, business continuity planning, payment controls and compliance with pensions auto-enrolment regulations.
Further information is provided in the report.
Shareholders will note that we did not pay any advisory fees to our auditor PwC in the financial year.
Following the change of Board responsibilities noted in the Corporate Governance Report, this is my last report as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, and I welcome Liz Doherty as the incoming Chair.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM.
Yours sincerely, Matt Davies Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee 11 September 2014 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 43
