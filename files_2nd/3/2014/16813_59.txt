Vodafone Group Plc Strategy Additional 74 Annual Report 2014 Overview review Performance Governance Financials information 75 Estimates of total future potential remuneration from 2015 pay packages The tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for each of the executive directors based on the remuneration opportunity granted in the 2015 financial year.
Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided for each executive director.
The assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.
Fixed Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.
Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2014 financial year table on page 78 of the 2014 report and on a similar basis for Nick Read promoted to the Board on 1 April 2014.
Pensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 30% of base salary at 1 July 2014.
Base Benefits Pension Total fixed 000 000 000 000 Chief Executive 1,150 38 345 1,533 Chief Financial Officer 675 23 203 901 Chief Technology Officer 600 21 180 801 On target Based on what a director would receive if performance was in line with plan.
The target award opportunity for the annual bonus GSTIP is 100% of base salary.
The target award opportunity for the long-term incentive GLTI is 237.5% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 210% for others.
Weassumed that TSR performance was at median.
Maximum Two times the target award opportunity is payable under the annual bonus GSTIP.
The maximum levels of performance for the long-term incentive GLTI are 250% of target award opportunity.
We assumed that TSR performance was at or above the 80th percentile equivalent.
All scenarios Each executive is assumed to co-invest the maximum allowed under the long-term incentive GLTI, 100% of salary, and the long-term incentive GLTI award reflects this.
Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value i. e. no assumption for increase in share price or cash dividend equivalents payable.

The remuneration policy table pages 72 and 73 sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment of an executive director.
Any new directors remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing directors performing similar roles.
This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 594% of base salary.
When considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration package of that individual in their prior role.
We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards foregone.
If necessary we will seek to replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to it.
This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and if appropriate based on performance conditions.
A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited.
