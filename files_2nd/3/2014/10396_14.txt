Strategic Report Governance Financial 47 Assurance In line with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors and the revised C. 2.1, the Board performs a formal annual assessment of the operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control, covering all material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls, and updates this assessment prior to the signing of the Annual Report and Accounts.
To support the previously reported redesign of the internal control questionnaire, a more robust exercise was carried out to gather evidence to support the responses submitted by the businesses.
The feedback from this exercise has been used to improve and strengthen the system of internal control, embed effective controls further into the operations of the group and to implement other procedural improvements.
These activities are monitored at executive level to ensure that control changes are implemented appropriately and that they are effective.
The Head of Internal Audit oversees the application of control environment improvements and attends each Audit Committee meeting to provide regular updates on the effectiveness of the groups internal controls and the results of the internal audit process.
Features of the internal control and risk management systems that ensure accuracy and reliability of financial reporting include: a culture of good governance, integrity, competence, fairness and responsibility: group level policies and procedures to support the business by providing an operational internal control framework: clearly defined responsibilities, delegated in accordance with the groups delegated authorities and authorisation registers: and a group function with a team of specialist resources.

Our policy on diversity Mitie welcomes, as a general principle, the updated Code requirement to consider diversity at Board level and sees this as an opportunity to consider the appropriateness of our approach to managing the diversity of ideas and skills on the Board.
The Board believes that setting aspirational diversity targets could drive a practice that is not necessarily in the best interests of the organisation and that the issue of Board diversity should be tackled in a manner that considers all areas of the diversity agenda such as skills and experience, as well as gender, race, disability or other aspects of difference.
Diversity of candidates at Board level has to be balanced against the required skills and experience and should be a consideration in any recruitment, succession planning and talent management process.
During the past year, the groups Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy has been reviewed and updated to include specific references to boardroom diversity.
The Board has been responsible for further driving the diversity agenda throughout the organisation in a number of ways, including the development of divisional diversity forums.
With specific targets around gender, race and age, these business-specific diversity forums reflect the Boards commitment to diversity, through their work to implement bespoke diversity action plans, which support the goals of those business areas.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 49 The Board is keen to ensure that all aspects of diversity are considered in the promotion, retention and development of the talent pipeline throughout the group as well as at Board level, and a suite of diversity policies and procedures have been cascaded and embedded throughout the group.
Further details of the diversity of Mities people can be found in the sustainability report which is available on the Companys website at www.
Since the fourth quarter of 2012, we have been monitoring our workforce data, by salary banding, to understand progress made on employee diversity, with regard to gender, age, disability and ethnicity.
Particular achievements to date include continued improvements in the percentage of women in the higher salary bands within the organisation.
Additionally, the number of people employed in the 16-24 age group has also grown over the last year, as has the percentage of people employed aged 60 and over.
Disability and ethnic minority percentages have remained stable over the same time period and these are particular areas of focus at this time.
We work with a number of external search consultancies, none of which have any other connection with the Company.
In addition, we have recently built a bespoke recruitment portal, which we use to create and publish vacancies, which are also posted to third party jobsites.
In the past 12 months we have formalised our long-standing relationship with Remploy by signing a partnership agreement.
Our relationship with Remploy provides work experience and employment opportunities for disabled people and those facing complex barriers to work.
Additionally, in the past 12 months we have formed links with Pink Jobs UKs largest LGBT job vacancies board.
In effect this means that all external vacancies are now open to Pink Jobs and Remploy candidates.
Additionally, we are working towards developing further partnerships with Leonard Cheshire and the Ethnic Jobsite.
We have a long-standing relationship with Remploy and since 2006 more than 450 disabled people have been employed by Mitie.
