Non-hedge accounted interest rate swaps - 1 Non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts 1 - The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market rates at the end of the accounting period.
It is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap at the end of the reporting period, taking into account current interest 12 9 rates, credit risks and bid ask spreads.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates The Groups exposure to interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks is disclosed in note 5.6. at the end of the accounting period.
Hedge accounting 5.5 Finance income and costs The Group has designated its interest rate swaps as hedges against variable cash flows resulting from fluctuations in interest rates.
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, Accounting policies including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, and the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.
The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as Income and costs on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value Finance income comprises interest income, applicable foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated, and whether the actual results of the income statement.
Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and each hedge are within a range of 80-125%.
Effectiveness testing is performed using regression analysis at inception and on a regular losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they basis thereafter.
