Second line of defence risk oversight Risk management Risk management continued RISK GOVERNANCE The risk governance structure below is integral to implementing the RMF across the Group and, by ensuring risk is appropriately represented on key committees, ensures that risk management is discussed in these meetings.
This structure outlines the flow and escalation of risk information and reporting from business areas and Risk Division to the GEC and Board.
Conversely, strategic direction and guidance is cascaded down from the Board and GEC.
The components of the RMF can be found in the risk overview on page 31.

CREDIT RISK Definition Credit risk is defined as the risk that parties with whom the Group has contracted fail to meet their obligations both on and off-balance sheet.
Risk appetite Credit risk appetite is described and reported on a monthly basis through a suite of Board metrics derived from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of credit risk rating systems as inputs.
The Board metrics are supported by more detailed sub-Board appetite metrics at divisional and business level and by a comprehensive suite of credit risk appetite statements, credit policies, sector caps, and product and country limits to manage concentration risk and exposures within the Groups approved risk appetite.
The metrics cover but are not limited to geographic concentration, single name customer concentration, mortgage exposure, Loan to Value ratios LTVs, higher risk sector concentration, limit utilisation, leveraged exposure, equity exposure, affordability and the quality of new lending.
Credit risk appetite statements and credit policies are regularly reviewed to ensure that the metrics continue to reflect the Groups risk appetite appropriately.
For further information on risk appetite refer to page 112.
116 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Exposures The principal sources of credit risk within the Group arise from loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives to customers, financial institutions and sovereigns.
The credit risk exposures of the Group are set out in note 54 on page 293. Credit risk exposures are categorised as retail, arising primarily in the Retail, Consumer Finance and Run-off divisions, and small and medium sized enterprises SMEs and corporate including corporates, banks, financial institutions and sovereigns arising primarily in the Commercial Banking, Run-off and Insurance divisions.
In terms of loans and advances, credit risk arises both from amounts lent and commitments to extend credit to a customer or bank as required.
These commitments can take the form of loans and overdrafts or credit instruments such as guarantees and standby, documentary and commercial letters of credit.
With respect to commitments to extend credit, the Group is potentially also exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total unused commitments.
However, the likely amount of loss is less than the total unused commitments, as most retail commitments to extend credit can be cancelled without notice and the creditworthiness of customers is monitored frequently.
Most commercial term commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards, which are monitored regularly.
Credit risk can also arise from debt securities, private equity investments and derivatives.
The total notional principal amount of interest rate, exchange rate, credit derivative and equity and other contracts outstanding at 31 December 2014 is shown on page 124.
The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Groups credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group.
Such amounts are reflected in note 54 on page 293. Credit risk exposures in the Insurance business largely result from holding bond and loan assets in the shareholder funds including the annuity portfolio and from exposure to reinsurers.
Second order credit risk exposure exists within the unit-linked funds, through the value of future fee income, and with-profits funds, through any guarantees.
Credit risk exposure also arises in the Groups defined benefit pension schemes from holding investments.
Note 38 on page 240 provides further information on the defined benefit schemes assets and liabilities.
Loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives also expose the Group to refinance risk.
Refinance risk is the possibility that an outstanding exposure cannot be repaid at its contractual maturity date.
If the Group does not wish to refinance the exposure then there is refinance risk if the obligor is unable to repay by securing alternative finance.
This may be because the borrower is in financial difficulty, or because the terms required to refinance are outside acceptable appetite at the time.
Refinance risk exposures are managed in accordance with the Groups existing credit risk policies, processes and controls, and are not considered to be material given the Groups prudent and through the cycle credit risk appetite.
Where refinance risk exists such as in the Run-off book exposures are minimised through intensive account management and are impaired or forborne where appropriate.
Measurement In measuring the credit risk of loans and advances to customers and to banks at a counterparty level, the Group reflects three components: i the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations: ii current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default: and iii the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations the loss given default.
For regulatory capital purposes the Groups rating systems assess probability of default and if appropriate, exposure at default and loss given default, in order to derive an expected loss.
If not appropriate, regulatory prescribed exposure at default and loss given default values are used in order to derive an expected loss.
In contrast, impairment allowances are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for loss events that have occurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
Due to the different methodologies applied, the amount of incurred credit losses provided for in the financial statements differs from the amount determined from the expected loss models that are used for internal operational management and banking regulation purposes.
Note 2 H on page 193 provides details of the Groups approach to the impairment of financial assets.
The quality measurement of both retail and commercial counterparties exposures is largely based on the outcomes of credit risk probability of default PD models.
The Group operates a significant number of different rating models, typically developed internally using statistical analysis and management judgement retail models rely more on the former, commercial models include more of the latter, especially in the larger corporate and more specialised lending portfolios.
Internal data is supplemented with external data in model development, where appropriate.
The models vary, inter alia, in the extent to which they are point in time versus through the cycle.
The models are subject to rigorous validation and oversight governance including, where appropriate, benchmarking to external information.
In commercial portfolios the PD models segment counterparties into a number of rating grades, with each grade representing a defined range of default probabilities, and there are a number of different model rating scales.
Counterparties exposures migrate between rating grades if the assessment of the PD changes.
The modelled PDs map through local scales to a single Corporate non-retail Master Scale comprising of 19 non-default ratings.
Together with four default ratings the Corporate Master Scale forms the basis on which internal reporting is completed.
In the principal retail portfolios, exposure at default and loss given default models are also in use.
They have been developed internally and use statistical analysis combined, where appropriate, with external data and subject matter expert judgement.
For reporting purposes, counterparties are also segmented into a number of rating grades, each representing a defined range of default probabilities and exposures migrate between rating grades if the assessment of the counterparty probability of default changes.
Each rating model is subject to a validation process, undertaken by independent risk teams, which includes benchmarking to externally available data, where possible.
The most material rating models are approved by the Group Risk Committee.
Responsibility for the approval of the remaining material rating models, and the governance framework in place around all Group models, is delegated to the Group Model Governance Committee.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 117 Risk management Risk management continued Mitigation The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk.
Credit principles, risk policies and appetite statements: Risk Division sets out the credit principles, risk policies and appetite statements.
Principles and policies are reviewed regularly, and any changes are subject to a review and approval process.
Policies and risk appetite statements, where appropriate, are supported by lending guidelines, which provide a disciplined and focused benchmark for credit decisions.
Collectively they define chosen target market and risk acceptance criteria.
Risk Division also use early warning indicators to help anticipate future areas of concern and allow the Group to take early and proactive mitigating actions.
Risk oversight teams monitor credit performance trends, review and challenge exceptions to planned outcomes, and test the adequacy of credit risk infrastructure and governance processes throughout the Group.
This includes tracking portfolio performance against an agreed set of key appetite tolerances.
Oversight and reviews are also undertaken by Group Audit and Credit Risk Assurance.
Controls over rating systems: The Group has established an independent team in the Risk Division that sets common minimum standards, designed to ensure risk models and associated rating systems are developed consistently, and are of sufficient quality to support business decisions and meet regulatory requirements.
Internal rating systems are developed and owned by the Risk Division.
The designated model owner takes responsibility for ensuring the validation of the rating systems, supported and challenged by an independent specialist group function.
Concentration risk: Credit risk management includes portfolio controls on certain industries, sectors and product lines to reflect risk appetite as well as individual, customer and bank limit guidelines.
Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the Groups risk appetite and restricts exposure to higher risk countries and more vulnerable sectors and segments.
Note 18 on page 222, provides an analysis of loans and advances to customers by industry for commercial customers and product for retail customers.
Exposures are monitored to prevent an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations.
These concentration risk controls are not necessarily in the form of a maximum limit on lending, but may instead require new business in concentrated sectors to fulfil additional certain minimum policy and or guideline requirements.
The Groups large exposures are reported in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements.
Cross-border exposures: The Board sets country risk appetite.
Within this, country limits are authorised by the country risk appetite committee, taking into account economic, financial, political and social factors.
Group policies stipulate that these limits must be consistent with, and support, the approved business and strategic plans of the Group.
Specialist expertise: Credit quality is managed and controlled by a number of specialist units within Risk Division providing, for example: intensive management and control see Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty : security perfection, maintenance and retention: expertise in documentation for lending and associated products: sector specific expertise: and legal services applicable to the particular market place and product range offered by the business.
Stress testing and scenario analysis: The Groups credit portfolios are also subjected to regular stress testing, with stress scenario assessments run at various levels of the organisation.
Exercises focused on individual divisions and portfolios are performed in addition to the Group led and regulatory stress tests.
For further information on the stress testing process, methodology and governance refer to page 111. Credit risk assurance and review: A specialist team within Group Audit, comprising experienced credit professionals, is in place to perform credit risk assurance.
This team carries out independent risk based internal control audits and credit quality reviews, providing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls, risk management practices, credit risk classification, as well as the accuracy of impairment provisions.
These audits and reviews cover the diverse range of the Groups businesses and activities, and include both standard risk based audits and reviews as well as bespoke assignments to respond to any emerging risks or regulatory requirement.
The work of Group Audit therefore continues to provide executive and senior management and Audit Committee with assurance and guidance on credit quality, effectiveness of credit risk controls and Business Support Unit BSU work out strategies, as well as accuracy of impairments.
Credit risk oversight within Risk Division is also undertaken by independent Credit Risk Oversight functions operating within Retail and Consumer Credit Risk and Commercial Banking which are part of the Groups second line of defence.
Its primary objective is to provide reasonable and independent oversight that credit risk is being managed with appropriate and effective controls.
Oversight is executed through a combination of standard and non-standard reviews.
Group Audit performs third line of credit risk assurance.
Additional mitigation for Retail and Consumer Finance customers The Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing applications for mortgages and unsecured lending.
The general approval process uses credit acceptance scorecards and involves a review of an applicants previous credit history using information held by credit reference agencies CRA.
The Group also assesses the affordability of the borrower under a stressed interest rate scenario.
In addition, the Group has in place quantitative limits such as product maximum limits, the level of borrowing to income and the ratio of borrowing to collateral.
Some of these limits relate to internal approval levels and others are hard limits above which the Group will reject the application.
The Group also has certain criteria that are applicable to specific products such as for applications for a mortgage on a property that is to be let by the applicant.
In 2014 the Group updated its policy for high-value mortgage lending, to restrict UK mortgage applications for greater than 500,000 to a maximum income multiple of four.
This was a targeted policy change primarily designed to address specific inflationary pressures in the London housing market.
118 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 For UK mortgages, the Groups policy is to reject all standard applications with a LTV greater than 90 per cent.
Applications with a LTV up to 95 per cent are permitted for certain schemes, for example the UK governments Help to Buy scheme.
For mainstream mortgages the Group has maximum per cent LTV limits which depend upon the loan size.
Buy-to-let mortgages are limited to a maximum of 1,000,000 and 75 per cent LTV.
All mortgage applications above 500,000 are subject to manual underwriting.
The Groups approach to underwriting applications for unsecured products ensures that lending is affordable and sustainable.
The Group takes reasonable steps to validate information used in the assessment of a customers income and expenditure.
The Group rejects any application for an unsecured product where a customer is registered as bankrupt or insolvent, or has a County Court Judgment registered at a CRA used by the Group.
In addition, for credit cards the Group rejects any applicant with total unsecured debt greater than 50,000 registered at the CRA: revolving debt-to-income ratio greater than 75 per cent: or total unsecured debt-to-income ratio greater than 100 per cent.
For unsecured personal loan applications, the Group rejects any applicant with total unsecured debt greater than 50,000 registered at the CRA.
Credit scoring: In its principal retail portfolios, the Group uses statistically based decisioning techniques primarily credit scoring models.
The Risk Division reviews model effectiveness, while new models and model changes are referred by them to the appropriate Model Governance Committees for approval.
The most material changes are approved in accordance with the governance framework set by the Group Model Governance Committee.
Additional mitigation for commercial customers Individual credit assessment and independent sanction: With the exception of small exposures on SME customers where relationship managers have limited delegated sanctioning authority, credit risk in commercial customer portfolios are subject to sanction by the independent Risk Division, which considers the strengths and weaknesses of individual transactions, the balance of risk and reward and how credit risk aligns to the Groups risk appetite.
Exposure to individual counterparties, groups of counterparties or customer risk segments is controlled through a tiered hierarchy of delegated sanctioning authorities and limit guidelines.
Approval requirements for each decision are based on a number of factors including the transaction amount, the customers aggregate facilities, credit risk ratings and the nature and term of the risk.
The Groups credit risk appetite criteria for counterparty and customer underwriting is generally the same as that for assets intended to be held to maturity.
Counterparty limits: Limits are set against all types of exposure in a counterparty name, in accordance with an agreed methodology for each exposure type.
This includes credit risk exposure on individual derivative transactions, which incorporates potential future exposures from market movements against agreed confidence intervals.
Aggregate facility levels by counterparty are set and limit breaches are subject to escalation procedures.
Daily settlement limits: Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the expectation of a corresponding receipt in cash, securities or equities.
Daily settlement limits are established for each counterparty to cover the aggregate of all settlement risk arising from the Groups market transactions on any single day.
Collateral The principal collateral types for loans and advances, contingent liabilities and derivatives with commercial and bank counterparties customers are: mortgages over residential and commercial real estate: charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivables: financial instruments such as debt securities: cash: and guarantees received from third parties such as export credit agencies.
The Group maintains appetite guidelines on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral.
Collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the instrument.
Debt securities, treasury and other bills are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset-backed securities and similar instruments such as covered bonds, which are secured by portfolios of financial assets.
Collateral is generally not held against loans and advances to financial institutions, except where securities are held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions or where a collateral agreement has been entered into under a master netting agreement.
Derivative transactions with wholesale counterparties are typically collateralised under a Credit Support Annex in conjunction with the ISDA Master Agreement.
It is the Groups policy that collateral should always be realistically valued by an appropriately qualified source, independent of both the credit decision process and the customer, at the time of borrowing.
Collateral values are reviewed on a regular basis and will vary according to the type of lending and collateral involved.
For residential mortgages, the Group adjusts open market property values to take account of the costs of realisation and any discount associated with the realisation of the collateral.
In order to minimise the credit loss, the Group may seek additional collateral from the counterparty as soon as impairment indicators are identified for the relevant individual loans and advances.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 119 Risk management Risk management continued The Group considers risk concentrations by collateral providers and collateral type, as appropriate, with a view to ensuring that any potential undue concentrations of risk are identified and suitably managed by changes to strategy, policy and or business plans.
Refer to note 54 for further information on collateral.
Master netting agreements Where it is appropriate and likely to be effective, the Group seeks to enter into master netting agreements.
Although master netting agreements do not generally result in an offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis, they do reduce the credit risk to the extent that, if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis.
The Groups overall exposure to credit risk on derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements can change substantially within a short period, since this is the net position of all trades under the master netting agreement.
Other credit risk transfers The Group also undertakes asset sales, credit derivative based transactions and securitisations as a means of mitigating or reducing credit risk, taking into account the nature of assets and the prevailing market conditions.
Monitoring In conjunction with Risk Division, businesses identify and define portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key benchmarks, behaviours and characteristics by which those portfolios are managed and monitored in terms of credit risk exposure.
This entails the production and analysis of regular portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior management.
Risk Division in turn produces an aggregated review of credit risk throughout the Group, including reports on significant credit exposures, which are presented to the Divisional Risk Committees, GRC and the BRC.
The performance of all rating models is monitored on a regular basis, in order to seek to ensure that models provide appropriate risk differentiation capability, the generated ratings remain as accurate and robust as practical, and the models assign appropriate risk estimates to grades pools.
All models are monitored against a series of agreed key performance indicators.
In the event that the monitoring identifies material exceptions or deviations from expected outcomes, these will be escalated in accordance with the governance framework set by the Group Model Governance Committee.
Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty The Group operates a number of treatments to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress.
The material elements of these treatments through which the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below and in note 54 on page 293.
Retail and Consumer Finance customers The Groups aim in offering forbearance and other assistance to retail customers in financial distress is to benefit both the customer and the Group by discharging the Groups regulatory and social responsibilities to support its customers and act in their best long-term interests and by bringing customer facilities back into a sustainable position which, for residential mortgages, also means keeping customers in their homes.
The Group offers a range of tools and assistance to support retail customers who are encountering financial difficulties.
Cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being affordable and sustainable for the customer.
Operationally, the provision and review of such assistance is controlled through the application of an appropriate policy framework, controls around the execution of policy, regular review of the different treatments to confirm that they remain appropriate, monitoring of customers performance and the level of payments received, and management visibility of the nature and extent of assistance provided and the associated risk.
Assistance is provided through trained colleagues in branches and dedicated telephony units, and via online guidance material.
For those customers requiring more intensive help, assistance is provided through dedicated support units where tailored repayment programmes can be agreed.
Customers are actively supported and referred to free money advice agencies when they have multiple credit facilities, including those at other lenders that require restructuring.
Within the Collections and Recoveries functions, the sharing of best practice and alignment of policies across the Group has helped to drive more effective customer outcomes and achieve operational efficiencies.
One component of the Groups relationship management approach is to contact customers showing signs of financial difficulty to discuss their circumstances and offer solutions to prevent their accounts falling into arrears.
The specific tools available to assist customers vary by product and the customers status.
In defining the treatments offered to customers who have experienced financial distress, the Group distinguishes between the following categories: Reduced contractual monthly payment: a temporary account change to assist customers through periods of financial difficulty where arrears do not accrue at the original contractual payments, for example temporary interest only arrangements and short-term payment holidays granted in collections.
Any arrears existing at the commencement of the arrangement are retained.
Reduced payment arrangements: a temporary arrangement for customers in financial distress where arrears accrue at the contractual payment, for example short-term arrangements to pay.
Term extensions: a permanent account change for customers in financial distress where the overall term of the mortgage is extended, resulting in a lower contractual monthly payment.
Repair: a permanent account change used to repair a customers position when they have emerged from financial difficulty, for example capitalisation of arrears.
120 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 To assist customers in financial distress, the Group also participates in, or benefits from, the following UK government sponsored programmes for households: Income Support for Mortgage Interest This is a government medium-term initiative that provides certain defined categories of customers, principally those who are unemployed, access to a benefit scheme, paid for by the government, which covers all or part of the interest on the mortgage.
Qualifying customers are able to claim for mortgage interest on up to 200,000 of the mortgage.
All decisions regarding an individuals eligibility and any amounts payable under the scheme rest solely with the government.
Payments are made directly to the Group by the appropriate government department.
Mortgage Rescue Scheme This is a government short-term initiative for borrowers in difficulty and facing repossession, who would have priority for re-housing by a local authority e. g. the elderly, disabled, single parents.
Eligible customers can have their property bought in full or part by the social rented sector and then remain in their home as a tenant or shared equity partner.
If the property is sold outright the mortgage is redeemed in full.
Commercial customers Early identification, control and monitoring are key in order to support the customer and protect the Group.
With the exception of small exposures on SME customers all non-retail loans and advances in the Commercial Banking and Run-off Divisions are reviewed at least annually by the independent Risk Division and more frequently where required.
As part of the Groups established Credit Risk Classification system, every loan and advance in the good book is categorised as either good or watchlist.
This complements the Groups risk rating tools and is designed to identify and highlight portfolio levels of asset quality as well as individual problem credits.
All watchlist names are reviewed by the business and Risk Division regularly, and the classification is updated if required.
This process seeks to ensure that relationship managers act promptly to identify, and highlight to senior management those customers who have the possibility to become higher risk in the future.
Those customers deemed higher risk where there is cause for concern over future repayment capability or where there is a risk of impairment will lead to the customer being transferred to the Business Support Unit BSU at an early stage.
In addition, any forbearance concession requested by a customer is reviewed and must be approved by the independent Risk Division.
If approved and Risk Division determines that the customer is in financial difficulty and the concession is outside of the Groups appetite, then the customer will be transferred to BSU.
The over-arching aim of the BSU is to provide support and work with each customer to try and resolve the issues, to restore the business to a financially viable position and thereby bring about a business turnaround.
This may involve a combination of debt restructuring, work out strategies and other types of forbearance.
BSU case officers manage non-retail distressed assets in Commercial Banking and Run-off Divisions, and are part of the independent Risk Division.
They are highly experienced and operate in a closely controlled and monitored environment, including regular oversight and close scrutiny by senior management.
The BSU case officers will continue to work in partnership with Relationship Managers throughout the process to achieve the shared common goals.
A detailed assessment is undertaken by the specialist risk team for cases in BSU and to assist in reducing and minimising risk exposure and to also highlight potential strategic options.
A range of information is required to fully appraise and understand the customers business, cashflow and therefore debt serviceability and will involve the Group, in addition to using its own internal sector experts, engaging professional advisers to perform asset valuations, strategic reviews and where applicable independent business reviews.
The assessment may also involve: critically assessing customers ability to successfully manage the business effectively in a distressed situation where turnaround is required: analysis of market sector factors, i. e. products, customers, suppliers, pricing and margin issues: performance review of operational areas that should be considered in terms of current effectiveness and efficiency and scope for improvements: financial analysis to model plans and factor in potential sensitivities, vulnerabilities and upsides: and determining the most appropriate corporate and capital structure suitable for the work-out strategy concerned.
The above assessment, monitoring and control processes continue throughout the period the case is managed within the BSU.
All the analysis performed around cash flows is used to determine appropriate impairment provisions.
The level of Commercial Banking Division BSU gross lending to customers reduced from 7.3 billion to 5.0 billion between 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014.
The net reduction of 2.3 billion in BSU managed lending in Commercial Banking was driven by returns to mainstream, disposals, write-offs and repayments.
In addition, as a result of the continued deleverage of the non-retail Run-off portfolio during 2014 and the focus on reducing the level of higher risk loans, the level of Run-off assets managed by BSU has reduced materially during the year.
The Groups accounting policy for loan renegotiations and forbearance is set out in note 2 on page 194.
Income statement information set out in the credit risk tables is on an underlying basis see page 41.
The Group credit risk portfolio in 2014 Significant reduction in impairments The impairment charge decreased by 60 per cent from 3,004 million in 2013 to 1,200 million in 2014.
The impairment charge has decreased across all divisions.
The material reduction reflects lower levels of new impairment as a result of effective risk management, improving economic conditions and the continued low interest rate environment.
The charge also benefited from significant provision releases but at lower levels than seen during 2013.
The impairment charge as a percentage of average loans and advances to customers improved to 24 basis points compared to 57 basis points during 2013.
Impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances reduced to 2.9 per cent at 31 December 2014, from 6.3 per cent at 31 December 2013, driven by improvements in all divisions.
Impaired loans reduced substantially by 18 billion during the period, mainly due to disposals and write-offs, and lower levels of newly impaired loans.
Impairment provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increased from 50.1 per cent at 31 December 2013 to 56.4 per cent at 31 December 2014, driven by the Retail, Commercial Banking and Run-off divisions.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 121 Risk management Risk management continued Low risk culture and prudent risk appetite The Group is delivering sustainable growth by maintaining the Groups lower risk origination discipline.
The overall quality of the portfolio has improved over the last 12 months.
The Group continues to deliver above market lending growth in SME whilst maintaining the Groups prudent risk appetite.
Portfolio credit quality has remained stable or improved across key metrics.
The Group continues to adopt a conservative stance across the Eurozone, maintaining close portfolio scrutiny and oversight.
Detailed contingency plans are in place and exposures to financial institutions domiciled in peripheral Eurozone countries remain modest and managed within tight risk parameters.
Re-shaping of the Group is substantially complete Run-off net assets have reduced from 33.3 billion to 16.9 billion at the end of 2014.
This reduction was capital accretive.
The Run-off portfolio now represents only 3.0 per cent of the overall Groups total loans and advances and poses substantially less downside risk to the Group.
The remaining assets are the subject of frequent review, and are impaired to appropriate levels based on external evidence and internal reviews.
The Groups UK Direct Real Estate gross lending at 31 December 2014 in Commercial Banking, Wealth within Retail division and Run-off divisions was 21.6 billion 31 December 2013: gross 27.8 billion.
The portfolio continues to reduce significantly, and the higher risk Run-off element of the book has reduced from gross 7.6 billion to gross 3.3 billion during 2014.
The remaining gross lending of 18.3 billion 31 December 2013: 20.2 billion is the lower risk element in Commercial Banking and Wealth, where the Group continues to write new business within conservative risk appetite parameters.
The loan to value LTV profile of the UK Direct Real Estate portfolio in Commercial Banking continues to improve.
The Group continues to reduce its exposure to Ireland with gross loans and advances reducing by 7.5 billion during 2014 mainly due to strategic transactions, disposals, write-offs and net repayments.
The Group has disposed of two significant impaired portfolios in 2014, with a combined gross book value of 2.4 billion.
The Irish commercial portfolio remains significantly impaired at 89 per cent, with provision coverage of 81 per cent.

The Irish Retail portfolio has reduced from 5,944 million at 31 December 2013 to 4,464 million at 31 December 2014.
Within this portfolio, impaired loans have reduced from 1,002 million 16.9 per cent at 31 December 2013 to 120 million 2.7 per cent at 31 December 2014, driven primarily by the disposal of the majority of impaired assets in the second half of 2014.

4 The fair value adjustments relating to loans and advances were those required to reflect the HBOS assets in the Groups consolidated financial records at their fair value and took into account both the expected losses and market liquidity at the date of acquisition.
The unwind relating to future impairment losses requires significant management judgement to determine its timing which includes an assessment of whether the losses incurred in the current period were expected at the date of the acquisition and assessing whether the remaining losses expected at the date of the acquisition will still be incurred.
The element relating to market liquidity unwinds to the income statement over the estimated expected lives of the related assets until 2014 for commercial loans and 2018 for retail loans although if an asset is written-off or suffers previously unexpected impairment then this element of the fair value will no longer be considered a timing difference liquidity but permanent impairment.
The fair value unwind in respect of impairment losses incurred was 251million for the period ended 31 December 2014 31 December 2013: 512million.
The fair value unwind in respect of loans and advances is expected to continue to decrease in future years as fixed-rate periods on mortgages expire, loans are repaid or written-off, and will reduce to zero over time.

Net loans and advances reduced by 5.2 billion from 8.2 billion to 3.0 billion.
The book continues to reduce significantly ahead of expectations.
Run-off UK Direct Real Estate LTV analysis The Group considers this portfolio to be appropriately provided for after taking into account the provisions held for each loan and the value of the collateral held.
In the case of impaired UK Direct Real Estate exposures over 5 million, there is a net property collateral shortfall of approximately 60 billion.
This figure excludes benefits of credit mitigants such as cross collateralisation and cross guarantees, The Group makes use of a variety of methodologies to assess the value of property collateral, where external valuations are not available.
The exposures comprise on-balance sheet exposures based on their balance sheet carrying values and off-balance sheet exposures, and are based on the country of domicile of the counterparty unless otherwise indicated.
The Group manages its exposures to individual countries through authorised country limits which take into account economic, financial, political and social factors.
In addition, the Group manages its direct risks to the selected countries by establishing and monitoring risk limits for individual banks, financial institutions, corporates and individuals.
Identified indirect exposure information, where available is also taken into account when setting limits and determining credit risk appetite for individual counterparties.
This forms part of the Groups credit analysis undertaken at least annually for counterparty and sector reviews, with interim updates performed as necessary.
Interim updates would usually be triggered by specific credit events such as rating downgrades, sovereign events or other developments such as spread widening.
Examples of indirect risk which have been identified, where information is available, are: European Banking groups with lending and other exposures to certain Eurozone Countries: corporate customers with operations or significant trade in certain European jurisdictions: major travel operators known to operate in certain Eurozone Countries: and international banks with custodian operations based in certain European locations.
The Group Financial Stability Forum GFSF monitors developments within the Eurozone, carries out stress testing through detailed scenario analysis and completes appropriate due diligence on the Groups exposures.
The GFSF has carried out a number of scenario analyses and rehearsals to test the Groups resilience in the event of further instability in certain Eurozone countries.
The Group has developed and refined pre-determined action plans that would be executed in such scenarios.
The plans set out governance requirements and responsibilities for the key actions which would be carried out and cover risk areas such as payments, liquidity and capital, communications, suppliers and systems, legal, credit, delivery channels and products, employees and the impact on customers.
The gross IFRS reported values for the exposures to Eurozone countries are detailed in the following tables.
However, derivative balances are included within exposures to financial institutions or corporates, as appropriate, at fair value adjusted for master netting agreements at obligor level and net of cash collateral in line with legal agreements.
Exposures in respect of reverse repurchase agreements are included on a gross IFRS basis and are disclosed based on the counterparty rather than the collateral repos and stock lending are excluded : reverse repurchase exposures are not, therefore, reduced as a result of collateral held.
Reverse repurchase exposures to Institutional funds secured by UK Gilts are excluded from all Eurozone exposures as detailed in the footnotes.
Exposures to central clearing counterparties are shown net.
For multi-country asset backed securities exposures, the Group has reported exposures based on the largest country exposure.
The country of exposure for asset backed securities is based on the location of the underlying assets which are predominantly residential mortgages not on the domicile of the issuer.
Insurance shareholder assets are assets where the Group is directly exposed to risk of loss and are held outside the with-profits and unit-linked funds.
These exposures relate to direct investments where the issuer is resident in Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal or Ireland and the credit rating is consistent with the tight credit criteria defined under the appropriate investment mandate.
Insurance also has interests in two funds domiciled in Ireland Global Liquidity Fund and the Investment Cash Fund where, in line with the investment mandates, cash is invested in short term financial instruments.
For these funds, the exposure is analysed on a look through basis to the country risk of the obligors of the underlying assets rather than treating the insurance holding in the funds as exposure to Ireland.
Exposures to selected Eurozone countries The Group continues to have minimal exposure, in aggregate, which could be considered to be direct recourse to the sovereign risk of the selected countries.

Environmental risk management The Group ensures appropriate management of the environmental impact of its lending activities.
The Group-wide Credit Risk principles require all credit risk to be incurred with due regard to environmental legislation and the Groups Code of Business Responsibility.
Within Commercial Banking, an electronic environmental risk screening system has been the primary mechanism for assessing environmental risk in lending transactions.
This system provides screening of location specific and sector based risks that may be present in a transaction.
Identified risk sees the transaction referred to the Groups expert in-house Environmental Risk team for further review and assessment, as outlined below.
Where required, the Groups panel of environmental consultants provide additional expert support.
The Group provides colleague training in environmental risk management as part of the standard suite of credit risk courses.
Supporting this training, a range of online resource is available to colleagues and includes environmental risk theory, procedural guidance, and information on environmental legislation and sector-specific environmental impacts.
The Group has been a signatory to the Equator Principles since 2006 and has adopted and applied the expanded scope of Equator Principles III.
The Equator Principles support the Groups approach to assessing and managing environmental and social issues in Project Finance, Project-Related Corporate loans and Bridge loans.
Further information is contained within the Groups Responsible Business Report.

Risk appetite The Group has no appetite for systemic unfair customer outcomes arising from any of its activities: through product design, sales or other after sales processes.
The appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
To stay within appetite, the Group has policies, processes and standards which provide the framework for businesses and colleagues to operate in accordance with the laws, regulations and voluntary codes which apply to the Group and its activities.
Exposures Conduct risk affects all aspects of the Groups operations, all types of customers and other stakeholders.
The Group faces significant conduct risks, for example, through products or services not meeting the needs of its customers: sales processes resulting in poor advice: failure to deal with a customers complaint effectively where the Group has got something wrong and not met customer expectations: or engaging in conduct which disrupts the fair and effective operation of a market in which it is active.
Given the high level of scrutiny regarding financial institutions treatment of customers and business conduct from regulatory bodies, the media, politicians and consumer groups, there is a risk that certain aspects of the Groups current or legacy business may be determined by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and other regulatory bodies or the courts as not being conducted in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, or in a manner that fails to deliver fair and reasonable treatment.
The Group may also be liable for damages to third parties harmed by the conduct of its business.
Measurement To articulate its conduct risk appetite, the Group has sought more granularity through the use of suitable conduct risk metrics and tolerances that indicate where it may potentially be operating outside its conduct appetite.
Conduct Risk Appetite Metrics CRAMs have been designed for all 139 product families offered by the Group: a set of common metrics have been agreed for all products to support a consistent approach.
These contain a range of product, sales and post-sales metrics to provide a more holistic view of conduct risks: each product also has additional bespoke metrics.
These metrics are part of the Board approved risk appetite.
The Group also continues to measure how effectively the overall conduct strategy is embedded across all divisions and functions and its impact on customer outcomes.
The common metrics are sales volume, product governance adherence, target market, outcome testing: meet customer needs, outcome testing: information disclosure, outcome testing: regulatory compliance, retention, usage, claims decline rates, complaints per 1,000 accounts, Financial Ombudsman Service FOS uphold rate and complaints outcome testing.
Each of the tolerances for the metrics are agreed for the individual product and are tracked month by month.
In relation to market conduct, metrics have also been generated, covering, for example, the way in which confidential information and potential conflicts of interest are managed.
Mitigation The Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to this risk: it has implemented a customer-focused, UK-centric strategy, strengthened its culture and values, improved systems and processes, and implemented more effective controls.
These actions are being embedded throughout the Group across all business areas and all supporting functional areas as part of the Groups Conduct Strategy and will support continuing the journey to become the industry leader for complaints performance.
This includes: Conduct risk appetite established at Group and business area level: Customer needs explicitly considered within business and product level planning and strategy: Cultural transformation, supported by strong direction and tone from senior executives and the Board.
This is underpinned by the Groups values and Codes of Responsibility, to deliver the best bank for customers: Enhanced product governance framework to ensure products continue to offer customers fair value, and meet the needs of the relevant target market throughout their life cycle: Sales processes and governance framework to deliver consistently fair outcomes: Effective root cause analysis which enables issues to be rectified at an earlier stage: Enhanced recruitment and training, and a focus on how the Group manages colleagues performance with clearer customer accountabilities: and Application of the conduct strategy to third parties involved in serving the Groups customers.
The Group has also prioritised activity designed to reinforce good conduct in its engagement with the markets in which it operates, together with the development of preventative and detective controls in order to be able to demonstrate this.
The Groups leadership team is committed to embedding the Conduct Strategy within the business and to creating the right customer centric culture.
The Board and Group Risk Committee receive regular reports and metrics to track progress on how the Group is meeting customer needs and minimising conduct risk.
136 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 All Group business areas continue to apply significant resources to the Conduct Strategy and ambitious conduct transformation plans are aligned with the Groups strategy.
The Groups Conduct Strategy continues to evolve and be enhanced.
The Group actively engages with regulatory bodies and other stakeholders in developing its understanding of current customer treatment concerns, and those relating to the fairness and effectiveness of markets, to ensure that the implementation of the Groups conduct strategy meets evolving stakeholder expectations.
Monitoring Monitoring and reporting is undertaken at Board, Group and business area committees.
As part of the reporting of Conduct Risk Appetite Measures, a robust outcomes testing regime is in place to test performance of customer critical activities.
Customer metrics are proactively used when reviewing business performance and feedback loops have been established to take learnings from root cause outcome testing.
There is also focus on the enhancement of preventative and detective controls to encourage and demonstrate the Groups support for the fair and effective operation of relevant markets.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 137 Risk management Risk management continued MARKET RISK Definition Market risk is defined as the risk that unfavourable market moves including changes in and increased volatility of interest rates, market-implied inflation rates, credit spreads and bond prices, foreign exchange rates, equity, property and commodity prices and other instruments, lead to reductions in earnings and or value.
Risk appetite The Groups Risk Management Framework articulates accountabilities for the management of market risk across the Group, and how this is discharged through a robust governance structure against sanctioned risk appetite.
Market risk exposures are measured and controlled through a combination of scenario stress analysis, percentile based measures and sensitivity analysis.
Exposures Table 1.30 below shows relevant balance sheet items relating to banking, trading and insurance activities.
The trading book Value at Risk VaR sensitivity inputs are separately identified.
The information provided in table 1.30 below aims to facilitate the understanding of linkages between balance sheet items and the positions disclosed in the Groups market risk disclosures.
This breakdown of financial instruments included and not included in trading book VaR provides a linkage with the market risk measures reported later on in the market risk section.
It is important to highlight that this table does not reflect how the Group manages market risk, since it does not discriminate between assets and liabilities in its VaR model.

Within the Groups balance sheet these fall under the trading assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
The assets and liabilities are classified as trading books if they have been acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near future.
These consist of government, corporate and financial institution bonds and loans deposits and repos.
Derivative assets and liabilities are held for three main purposes: to provide risk management solutions for clients, to manage portfolio risks arising from client business and to manage and hedge the Groups own risks.
The majority of derivatives exposure arises within Financial Markets.
Insurance business assets and liabilities relate to unit-linked funds and with-profit funds, as well as shareholder invested assets, including annuity funds.
The Group recognises the value of in-force business VlF in respect of Insurances long-term life assurance contracts as an asset in the balance sheet.
This asset represents the present value of future profits expected to arise from the portfolio of in-force life assurance contracts.
The Group ensures that it has adequate cash and balances at central banks and stocks of high quality liquid assets e. g. Gilts or US Treasury Securities that can be converted easily into cash to meet liquidity requirements.
The majority of these assets are held as Available-for-Sale with the remainder held as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
Further information on these balances can be found under the Risk Management section Funding and Liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk in the asset portfolios is swapped into floating.
The majority of debt issuance originates from the Issuance, Capital Vehicles and Medium Term Notes desks and the interest rate risk of the debt issued is hedged by swapping them into a floating rate.
The table below shows the key market risks for the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and trading, banking and Insurance activities.

Interest rate risk arises from the liability discount rate, with partial offsets from fixed interest assets such as gilts and corporate bonds, and swaps.
Credit spread risk also arises from the liability discount rate, with partial offsets from the credit portfolio.
Equity and alternative asset risk arises from direct asset holdings.
For further information on defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities please refer to note 38 on page 240.
Trading portfolios The Groups trading activity is small relative to its peers and the Group does not have a programme of proprietary trading activities.
All the trading VaR resides within Commercial Banking.
The average 95 per cent 1-day trading VaR was 4.3 million for the year to 31 December 2014 31 December 2013: 4.1 million.
The Groups trading activity is undertaken to meet the requirements of commercial and retail customers for foreign exchange, credit spread and interest rate products.
Trading market risk measures are applied to all the Groups regulatory trading books where positions arise from supporting customer flow and market making.
All positions are held with trading intent.
Measures include daily VaR table 1.32, sensitivity based measures, and stress testing.
Banking activities The Groups banking activities expose it to the risk of adverse movements in interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices, with little or no exposure to commodity risk.
The volatility of market values can be affected by both the transparency of prices and the amount of liquidity in the market for the relevant asset or liability.
Interest rate risk in the Groups divisional portfolios and in the Groups capital and funding activities arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Groups non-trading assets, liabilities see loans and advances to customers and customer deposits in table 1.30 above and off balance sheet positions of the Group.
Interest rate risk arises predominantly from the mismatch between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, but also to the reinvestment rate on the Groups structural hedging of rate insensitive liabilities comprising customer deposits and net free reserves, and the need to minimise income volatility.
Margin compression risk also arises from the current low rate environment, which may restrict the ability to change interest rates applying to customers in response to changes in interbank and central bank rates.
Prepayment risk arises, predominantly in the Retail division, as customer balances amortise more quickly or slowly than anticipated due to economic conditions or customers response to changes in economic conditions.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 139 Risk management Risk management continued Pipeline and pre hedge risk arises where new business volumes are higher or lower than forecasted, requiring the business to unwind or execute additional hedging at rates which may differ to what was expected.
Basis risk arises from the possible changes in spreads, for example where the bank lends with reference to a central bank rate but funds with reference to LIBOR and the spread between these widens or tightens.
Foreign currency risk arises from: translational exposure: the Groups investment in its overseas operations.
Net investment exposures are disclosed see note 54 on page 293 and it is Group policy to hedge non-functional currency exposures: and transactional exposure: where assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the business functional currency.
The Group has a policy of forward hedging its forecasted currency income less impairments to year end.
Equity Risk arises from different sources: The Groups equity holdings in Banco Sabadell and Aberdeen: Exposure to Lloyds Banking Group share price through deferred shares and deferred options granted to employees as part of their benefits package: and The Groups private equity investments.
Credit spread risk arises largely from the following: The assets held mainly within the liquid asset portfolio: and The credit and debit valuation adjustments CVA and DVA sensitivity to credit spreads.
As explained within the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CVA and DVA are applied to the Groups over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to standard interbank collateral arrangements.
These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking Division.
Insurance portfolios The Groups insurance activities expose it to market risk including equity, credit and credit spread, interest rate, exchange rate and property risk: With-profits funds are managed with the aim of generating smoothed returns consistent with policyholders expectations.
Exposure arises where the value of the underlying funds are insufficient to meet the obligations, termed burnthrough.
Unit-linked funds where policyholders select their investments.
Exposure arises as future fee income is dependent upon the performance of those assets.
This fee income forms part of the value of in-force business, see note 25on page 227.
Annuities where policyholders future cashflows are guaranteed at retirement.
Exposure arises if the assets, predominantly bonds and loans, backing the liabilities do not perform in line with expectations.
Insurances surplus assets also result in market risk exposure.
These assets are held primarily in three portfolios: i in the long-term funds within the life insurance companies: ii in the corresponding shareholder funds: and iii in investment portfolios within the general insurance business.
Measurement Market risk is managed within a Board approved framework and risk appetite.
This is supplemented by divisional market risk appetite limits and triggers.
A variety of risk measures are used such as: Scenario stress based measures e. g. single factor stresses, macroeconomic scenarios : Percentile based measures e. g. VaR and Stressed VaR : and Sensitivity based measures e. g. sensitivity to 1 basis point move in interest rates.
Scenario based measures include the use of five different economic multi-risk scenarios which the Group introduced as part of its Board risk appetite.
These assess the impact of unlikely, but plausible adverse scenarios on income, with the worst case for defined benefit pensions, trading portfolios, banking activities and insurance portfolios being reported against the Board risk appetite.
Internal market risk models for trading book activities comprise VaR, Stressed VaR and Incremental Risk Charge and these are explained in detail in the Groups Market Risk section of the Pillar 3 Report.
In addition: A trigger on the pension scheme deficit is used in respect of defined benefit pensions which has a material impact on capital resources: Profit and loss triggers are used in the trading books in order to ensure that mitigating action is considered if profit and loss becomes volatile: Interest rate repricing gaps, earnings sensitivity analysis, and open foreign exchange positions are used for banking book activity: and Stress testing and scenario analysis are also used in certain portfolios and at Group level, to simulate the impact of extreme conditions and to understand more fully the interdependence of different parts of the balance sheet.
These measures are reviewed regularly by senior management to inform effective decision making.
Defined benefit pension schemes Management of the assets is the responsibility of the Trustees of the schemes who are responsible for setting the investment strategy and for agreeing funding requirements with the Group.
The difference between assets and liabilities determines whether there is a surplus or deficit.
Any deficit must be met by the Group with additional funding agreed with the Trustees as part of a triennial valuation process.
For accounting purposes, a AA corporate bond based discount rate is used to determine present value of liabilities resulting in significant credit spread risk.
Assets are marked to market.
140 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Trading portfolios Based on the 1-day 95 per cent confidence level, assuming positions are held overnight and using observation periods of the preceding 300 business days, the VaR for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 based on the Groups global trading positions is detailed in table 1.32.
The risk of loss measured by the VaR model is the minimum expected loss in earnings given the confidence level and assumptions noted above.
The total and average trading VaR reported below does not assume any diversification benefit across the five risk types.
The Group internally uses VaR as the primary measure for all trading book positions arising from short term market facing activity.
The maximum and minimum VaR reported for each risk category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the maximum and minimum VaR reported as a whole.
The average VaR for 2014 was similar to the average over 2013.

Trading risk appetite is controlled with VaR limits.
Limits are allocated on a 95 per cent 1-day VaR.
VaR limits are complemented with profit and loss referrals, positional limits, and stress test triggers.
VaR limits are set and managed at both desk and overall trading book levels.
Although an important market standard measure of risk, VaR has limitations.
These arise from the use of limited historical data which may not encompass all potential events, particularly those which describe extreme market conditions, defined holding periods which assume the risk can be liquidated or hedged within that period and the exposure level at the confidence interval does not convey any information about potential losses which may occur if this level is exceeded.
The Group recognises these limitations and supplements the use of VaR with a variety of other measurements which reflect the nature of the business activity.
These include detailed sensitivity analysis, position reporting and stress testing analysis.
Trading book VaR 1-day 99 per cent is compared daily against both forecast and actual profit and loss.
1-day 99 per cent VaR charts for Lloyds Bank, HBOS and Lloyds Banking Group models can be found in the Groups Pillar 3 Report.
The Group holds securities within its trading books mainly under the Credit Trading, Gilts and Repo Trading businesses within Financial Markets for funding and to meet customer requirements.
The outright interest rate risk exposure, after hedging, is small relative to the Group.
Banking activities Market risk in non-trading books consists of exposure to changes in interest rates including basis risk.
This is the potential impact on earnings and value that occurs due to mismatches in the timing of repricing assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily: a Market value sensitivity: this methodology considers all repricing mismatches behaviourally adjusted where appropriate in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in market value that would result from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis points parallel rise or fall in the yield curve subject to a floor at zero per cent.
b Interest income sensitivity: this measures the impact on future net interest income arising from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis points parallel rise or fall in all the yield curves over a rolling 12 month basis subject to a floor at zero per cent.
Unlike the market value sensitivities, the interest income sensitivities incorporate additional behavioural assumptions as to how and when individual products would reprice in response to such change.
c Market Value notional limit: this caps the amount of conventional and inflation-linked government bonds held by the Group for liquidity purposes.
The Group has an integrated Asset and Liability Management ALM system which supports non traded asset and liability management of the Group.
This provides a single consolidated tool to measure and manage interest rate repricing profiles including behavioural assumptions, perform stress testing and produce forecast outputs.
Interest rate repricing profiles are reported by currency and used to calculate the income and value sensitivities in GBP equivalent.
Repricing assumptions and customer reaction to changes in product pricing is a major determinant of the risk profile.
The Group is aware that any assumptions based model is open to challenge.
However, a full behavioural review is performed annually by Group ALM functions to ensure the assumptions remain appropriate, and is reviewed by Risk Division.
A limit structure exists to ensure that risks stemming from residual and temporary positions or from changes in assumptions about customer behaviour remain within the Groups risk appetite.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 141 Risk management Risk management continued Table 1.33 below shows, split by material currency, the Groups market value sensitivities to an instantaneous parallel up and down 25 and 100 basis points change to all interest rates.
The measure, however, is simplified in that it assumes all interest rates, for all currencies and maturities, move at the same time and by the same amount.
Table 1.34 below shows the banking book income sensitivity to an instantaneous parallel up and down 25 and 100 basis points change to all interest rates.
Table 1.34: Banking activities: net interest income sensitivity audited 2014 2013 Up 25bps Down 25bps Up 100bps Down 100bps Up 25bps Down 25bps Up 100bps Down 100bps m m m m m m m m Client facing activity and associated hedges 4.6 46.0 176.3 222.3 48.2 136.0 390.3 364.4 Income sensitivity is measured over a rolling 12 month basis.
The market value sensitivity is driven by temporary customer flow positions not yet hedged plus other positions occasionally held within limits, by the Groups wholesale funding desks in order to minimise overall funding and hedging costs.
The level of risk is low relative to the size of the total balance sheet.
Low interest income sensitivity continues to reflect structural hedging against margin compression, with small year on year variances reflecting changes in operational flows.
The Group ensures that it has adequate stock of high-quality liquid assets for example Gilts or US Treasury Securities that can be converted easily into cash to meet liquidity requirements.
The interest rate risk in these portfolios is hedged with interest rate swaps on an asset swap basis.
Insurance portfolios Current and potential future market risk exposures within Insurance are assessed using a range of stress testing exercises and scenario analyses.
Risk measures include 1-in-200 year stresses for Insurances Individual Capital Assessment ICA and single factor stresses for profit before tax.
Table 1.35 demonstrates the impact of the Groups Fiscal Solvency stress scenario with no diversification benefit on Insurances portfolio: this is the most onerous scenario for Insurance out of the Group scenarios.
The amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
Impacts can be assumed to be reasonably symmetrical.
Table 1.35: Insurance activities: profit before tax sensitivities Increase reduction in profit before tax m 2014 2013 Interest rates increase 100 basis points 124 214 Inflation increase 50 basis points 143 128 Credit spreads 100% widening 582 697 Equity 30% fall 745 692 Property 25% fall 60 68 The key market risks within Insurance are equity and credit spread risks.
The majority of Insurances equity risk exposure relates to unit-linked funds, through the value of future fee income, and with-profits funds, through burnthrough.
Credit spread risk exposure largely results from holding bond and loan assets in the annuity portfolio with the aim of providing additional returns.
Further stresses that show the effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions, including the risk-free rate, equity investment volatility, widening of credit default spreads on corporate bonds and an increase in illiquidity premia, as applied to profit before tax are set out in note 34 on page 238.
142 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Mitigation Various mitigation activities are undertaken across the Group to manage portfolios and seek to ensure they remain within approved limits.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Group takes an active involvement in agreeing risk management and mitigation strategies with the Trustees of the schemes through whom any such activity must be conducted.
An interest rate and inflation hedging programme is in place to reduce liability risk.
The schemes have also reduced equity allocation and are investing the proceeds in credit assets as part of a programme to fide-risk the portfolio.
Trading portfolios and banking activities The Groups policy is to optimise reward whilst managing its interest rate risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board.
For individual banking divisions, simple positional interest rate risk is minimal due to the Group requirement for these businesses to hedge or match fund promptly all open positions directly via the Group Corporate Treasury GCT function.
As defined within the scope of the Group Interest Rate Risk in the banking book Policy, all hedgeable interest rate risk in the non-traded book should be transferred to GCT via the Interest Rate Risk Transfer Pricing ITP framework.
GCT is responsible for managing centralised risk and does this through natural offsets of matching assets and liabilities, and appropriate hedging activity of the residual exposures, subject to the authorisation and mandate of Group Asset and Liability Committee GALCO within the Board risk appetite.
The Group centrally manages the overall interest rate structure of the balance sheet giving consideration to both the stability of net interest income and protection of shareholder value from changes in market interest rates.
A structural hedging programme is in place to manage rate insensitive balances through investing in longer term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps, subject to the authorisation and mandate of Group Asset and liability Committee within the Board risk appetite.
Derivative desks in Financial Markets will then externalise the hedges to the market.
However, certain residual interest rate risks may remain outside the centre due to differences in basis and profile mismatches, largely arising from customer behaviour.
Whilst the bank faces margin decompression in the current low rate environment, its exposure to pipeline and prepayment risk are not considered material, and are appropriately monitored and controlled through Divisional ALCOs.
Customer facing divisions incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
GCT incurs foreign exchange risk through its various debt and capital management programmes.
All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled within the trading risk appetite and any residual risk is hedged in the market.
Insurance portfolios Investment holdings are diversified across markets and, within markets, across sectors.
Holdings are diversified to reduce specific risk and the relative size of large individual exposures is monitored closely.
For assets held outside unit-linked funds, investments are only permitted in countries and markets which are sufficiently regulated and liquid.
Where considered appropriate, hedges are in place to reduce exposure to market risk, principally equity, interest rate risk and foreign currency.
For annuity liabilities the aim is to invest in assets such that the cash flows on investments will match those on the projected future liabilities.
It is not possible to eliminate risk completely as the timing of insured events is uncertain and bonds are not available at all of the required maturities.
As a result, the cash flows cannot be precisely matched and so sensitivity tests are used to test the extent of the mismatch.
Further, in assessing the current value of these future cashflows, it is not always possible to achieve equally resilient levels of matching between the different capital measures that are used to assess regulatory solvency.
Monitoring The Group Asset and Liability Committee and the Group Market Risk Committee regularly review high level market risk exposure, as part of the wider risk management framework.
They also make recommendations to the Group Chief Executive concerning overall market risk appetite and market risk policy.
Exposures at lower levels of delegation are monitored at various intervals according to their volatility, from daily in the case of trading portfolios to monthly or quarterly in the case of less volatile portfolios.
Levels of exposures compared to approved limits and triggers are monitored by Risk Division and where appropriate, escalation procedures are in place.
Defined benefit pension schemes In addition to the wider risk management framework, governance of the schemes includes two specialist pensions committees one Group executive sub-committee and a supporting management committee.
The surplus or deficit in the schemes is tracked on a monthly basis along with various single factor and scenario stresses which consider the assets and liabilities holistically.
The impact on Group capital resources of the schemes is monitored monthly.
Performance against risk appetite triggers is also regularly monitored.
Hedges are in place and asset liability matching positions are also actively monitored.
Trading portfolios and banking activities Trading is restricted to a number of specialist centres, the most important centre being the Financial Markets business in London.
These centres also manage market risk in the Commercial Banking non-trading portfolios, both in the UK and internationally.
The level of exposure is strictly controlled and monitored within approved limits.
Active management of the portfolios is necessary to meet customer requirements and changing market circumstances.
Market risk in the Groups divisional portfolios and in the Groups capital and funding activities is managed centrally within triggers defined in the Group policy for interest rate risk in the banking book, which is reviewed and approved annually.
Insurance portfolios Ongoing monitoring is in place to track market risks.
This includes monitoring the progression of market risk capital against risk appetite limits, as well as the sensitivity of profit before tax to combined market risk stress scenarios and in year market movements.
Asset liability matching positions and hedges in place are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within certain tolerances.
In addition market risk is controlled via approved investment policies and mandates.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 143 Risk management Risk management continued OPERATIONAL RISK Definition Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
The aim of operational risk management is to manage operational risks in line with defined appetites, and to protect both customers and the Group whilst delivering sustainable growth.
The Group Operational Risk framework is the method by which operational risks are managed in terms of setting risk appetite, evaluating key exposures, measuring risk, mitigating risk, and monitoring risks on an ongoing basis, as set out below.
Risk appetite The Groups Operational risk appetite is designed to safeguard the interests of customers, internal and external stakeholders, and shareholders.
Appetite is expressed through six high level statements summarised below, each of which are defined with limits and triggers approved by the Board, and are regularly monitored by executive and Board risk committees: Customer: The Group builds trust and does not expect its customers to be impacted negatively.
Reputation: The Group manages its external profile effectively.
The Group will manage and mitigate any prominent negative sentiment.
Financial loss: The Group does not expect to experience cumulative fraud or operational losses above a defined level of budgeted Group income, or individual losses above a defined amount.
Management time and resources: The Group does not expect internal events that divert excessive senior management time from running the business or have extensive impact on colleague time and or morale.
Cyber: The Group minimises the impact from cyber attacks and information breaches that result in a significant loss of customer confidence or undermine the financial stability of the Group.
Risk culture: All colleagues are responsible for risk within their individual roles.
The Group sets a strong tone from the top and embraces a risk culture across the business which is aligned to its strategy, vision, values and codes of responsibility.
The Group encourages an open dialogue and rapid escalation of potential threats and events.
Exposures The principal operational risks to the Group are: The risk that the Group is unable to provide services to customers as a result of an IT systems failure: Cyber risks associated with malicious attacks on the confidentiality or integrity of electronic data, or the availability of systems: External fraud arising from an act of deception or omission: Risks arising from inadequate delivery of services to customers: The risk associated with the ongoing provision of services to TSB and other organisations.
The risks below also have potential to negatively impact customers and the Groups future results: Terrorist acts, other acts of war or hostility, geopolitical, pandemic or other such events and responses to those acts events may create economic and political uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on UK and international macroeconomic conditions generally, and more specifically on the Groups results of operations, financial condition or prospects in ways that cannot necessarily be predicted.
Systems and procedures are implemented and maintained by the Group to comply with increasingly complex and detailed anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations.
However, these may not always be fully effective in preventing third parties from using the Group as a conduit for money laundering and other illegal or prohibited activities.
Should the Group be associated with money laundering or breaches of financial crime regulations and prohibitions, its reputation could suffer and or it could become subject to fines, sanctions and legal enforcement: any one of which could have a material adverse effect upon operating results, financial condition and prospects.
Measurement Operational risk is managed within a Board approved framework and risk appetite, as set out above.
A variety of measures are used such as: scoring of potential risks, using impact and likelihood, with impact thresholds aligned to the risk appetite statements above: assessment of the effectiveness of controls: monitoring of events and losses by size, business unit and internal risk categories.
In 2014, the highest frequency of events occurred in external fraud 63.17 per cent and execution, delivery and process management 20.70 per cent.
Clients, products and business practices accounted for 75.86 per cent of losses by value driven by legacy issues where impacts materialised in 2014 excluding PPI.
The table overleaf shows high level loss and event trends for the Group using Basel II categories.

The Group calculates its operational risk capital requirements using the Standardised Approach TSA, which the Basel Committee states as being appropriate for an internationally active bank.
Mitigation The Group has a strong control environment that is subject to ongoing enhancements through regular reviews and investment.
Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management as appropriate.
This ensures the correct level of visibility and engagement.
The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer which would also include insurance and acceptance.
Contingency plans are maintained for a range of potential scenarios, with regular disaster recovery and scenario testing scheduled to test and challenge the readiness of the Group to respond in the event of an incident.
An independent review of the Groups IT Resilience and supporting capabilities was completed in 2013.
This highlighted areas of strength alongside known risks that have the potential to impact resilience, and a three year investment programme of strategic enhancements was initiated.
The first year of this programme has been completed.
Additionally the Group has developed a customer focused risk appetite for IT systems that support the Groups Critical Customer and Business Processes and continues to monitor these on a regular basis.
The threat landscape associated with Cyber risk has continued to evolve alongside an increasing industry and Regulator focus.
The Board is developing a revised Cyber Risk Appetite and is supporting incremental investment to help mitigate this risk.
In addition to initiatives that protect the Group against a malicious Cyber attack the Group continues to invest in enhanced protection of customer information, including limiting access to key systems and enhancing the security, durability and accessibility of critical information.
The Group adopts a risk based approach to mitigate the external fraud risks it faces, reflecting the current and emerging external fraud risks within the market.
This approach drives an annual programme of enhancements to the Groups technology, process and people related controls, with an emphasis on preventative controls supported by real time detective controls wherever feasible.
Through Group-wide policies and operational control frameworks, the Group has developed a robust fraud operating model with centralised accountability.
The Groups fraud awareness programme remains a key component of its fraud control environment.
The Group remediates issues that are identified in its Customer Processes, addressing root cause and rectifying customers as required.
Enhancing the overall servicing environment remains a focus of dedicated Group programmes such as Simplification.
Following the successful divestment of TSB the Group retains responsibility for the ongoing provision of key services which are managed via robust change management governance and a consolidated strategic change plan.
There are separate governance arrangements in place to oversee the impacts of the divestment on the retained business customers, operations and controls.
Operational resilience measures and recovery planning defined in the Groups Business Continuity Management policy ensure an appropriate and consistent approach to the management of continuity risks, including potential interruptions from a range of internal and external incidents or threats including environmental and climatic issues, terrorism, cyber, economic instability, pandemic planning and operational incidents.
The Group has adopted policies and procedures to detect and prevent the use of its banking network for money laundering, bribery and activities prohibited by legal and regulatory sanctions.
The Group regularly reviews and assesses these policies to keep them current, effective and consistent across markets.
The Group requires mandatory training on these topics for all employees.
Specifically, the  procedures include know-your-customer requirements, transaction monitoring technologies and reporting of suspicions of money laundering to the applicable regulatory authorities and the Anti-Bribery Policy prohibits the payment, offer, acceptance or request of a bribe, including facilitation payments by any employee or agent and provides a confidential reporting service for anonymous reporting for suspected or actual bribery activity.
The Sanctions and the Related Prohibitions Policy sets out a framework of controls for compliance with legal and regulatory sanctions.
Monitoring Monitoring and reporting is undertaken at Board, Group and business area committees, in accordance with delegated limits of authority which are regularly reviewed and refreshed.
Business unit risk exposure is aggregated and discussed at the monthly Group Operational Risk Committee, and matters are escalated to the Chief Risk Officer, or higher committees, if appropriate.
A combination of systems, monthly reports from business areas, and oversight and challenge from the Risk Division: audit: and assurance teams ensures that key risks are regularly presented and debated by an executive audience.
The Group maintains a formal approach to operational risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated.
Root causes of events are determined, where possible and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.
The insurance programme is monitored and reviewed regularly, with recommendations being made to the Groups senior management annually prior to each renewal.
Insurers are monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure counterparty risk is minimised.
A process is in place to manage any insurer rating changes or insolvencies.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 145 Risk management Risk management continued FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK Definition Funding risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient.
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
Risk appetite Funding and liquidity risk is managed separately for the Banking and Insurance businesses.
Funding and liquidity risk appetite for the Banking business is set with the support of the Group Asset and Liability Committee GALCO.
Within the Banking business, funding and liquidity risks are managed separately for TSB.
The liquidity risk appetite for the Insurance business is reviewed and set annually by the Insurance Board.
For the Banking Group, the liquidity risk appetite covers a range of metrics considered key to maintaining a strong liquidity and funding position, with regular reporting to GALCO and the Board.
Strict criteria and limits are in place to ensure central bank cash and highly liquid marketable securities are available as part of the portfolio of liquid assets.
Risk appetite is a key element of the annual Group planning process with risk appetite defined over the life of the funding plan.
Exposure Liquidity exposure represents the amount of potential stressed outflows in any future period less expected inflows.
Liquidity is considered from both an internal and a regulatory perspective.
Measurement A series of measures are used across the Group to monitor both short and long-term liquidity, including: ratios, cash outflow triggers, wholesale funding maturity profile, early warning indicators and stress test survival periods from two weeks out to a year.
Details of contractual maturities for assets and liabilities form an important source of information for the management of liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity.
Contractual maturities also form the basis of the Groups liquidity stress testing.
Note 54 on page 293 sets out an analysis of assets and liabilities by relevant maturity grouping.
In order to reflect more accurately the expected behaviour of the Groups assets and liabilities, measurement and modelling of the behavioural aspects of each is constructed.
Divisional teams form a view of customer behaviour based on quantitative and qualitative analysis.
The analysis takes into account items such as early repayment, forbearance and impairment for assets and rollover and early withdrawal for liabilities.
The assumptions are subject to governance via divisional asset and liability committees.
The behavioural reviews form the foundation of the Groups Liquidity Transfer Pricing LTP and are applied to the contractual profile of the Group for the liquidity risk stress testing framework.
Mitigation The Group mitigates the risk of a liquidity mismatch in excess of its risk appetite by managing the liquidity profile of the balance sheet through short-term liquidity management and over the life of the funding plan.
Short-term liquidity management is considered from two perspectives: business as usual and stressed conditions, in the less than one year time horizon.
The Group manages its risk appetite and liquidity position as a coverage ratio proportion of stressed outflows covered by eligible liquid assets corresponding with the PRA and CRD IV liquidity requirements.
Longer term funding is used to manage the Groups strategic liquidity profile, determined by the Groups balance sheet structure.
Longer term is defined as having an original maturity of more than one year.
The Groups funding and liquidity position is underpinned by its significant customer deposit base, and is supported by strong relationships with corporate customers and certain wholesale market segments.
A substantial proportion of the retail deposit base is made up of customers current and savings accounts which, although mostly repayable on demand, have traditionally in aggregate provided a stable source of funding.
Additionally, the Group accesses the short-term wholesale markets to raise interbank deposits and to issue debt securities to meet short-term obligations.
Funding concentration by counterparty and currency is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Where concentrations do exist for example, maturity profile : these are limited by the internal risk appetite and considered manageable.
The ability to deploy assets quickly, either through the repo market or through outright sale, is also an important source of liquidity for the Groups Banking businesses.
In addition to central bank reserves, the Group holds sizeable balances of high grade marketable debt securities and other assets, as set out in table 1.43.
The assets can be sold to provide, or used to secure, additional cash inflows should the need arise from either market counterparties or central bank facilities Bank of England, European Central Bank and Federal Reserve.
To assist in managing the balance sheet the Group operates a LTP Policy which: allocates relevant interest expenses from GCT to the Groups Banking businesses within the internal management accounts in a manner consistent with the Group Funding and Liquidity Policy: helps drive the correct inputs to customer pricing and supports the overall Group balance sheet strategy: and is consistent with regulatory requirements.
Relevant interest expenses allocated via LTP include term funding spreads incurred over a three month LIBOR benchmark and the cost of funding and holding liquid asset reserves.
LTP makes extensive use of behavioural maturity profiles, taking account of expected customer loan prepayments and stability of customer deposits.
Such behavioural maturity assumptions are subject to formal governance, reviewed at least annually and founded on analysis and evidence of actual customer behaviour using historical data gathered over several years.
Liquidity risk within the Insurance business may result from the inability to sell financial assets quickly at their fair values: or from an insurance liability falling due for payment earlier than expected: or from the inability to generate cash inflows as anticipated: or from an unexpected large operational event: or from a general insurance catastrophe e. g. a significant weather event.
The shareholder is exposed to liquidity risk through the shareholder business.
This is predominantly the annuity portfolio, where the aim is to invest in assets such that the cash flows on investments will match those on the projected future liabilities.
Unit-linked and with-profits funds are normally expected to meet their own liquidity obligations.
Liquidity risk is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business to ensure that, even under stress conditions, there is sufficient liquidity to meet obligations and remains within approved risk appetite.
In addition, liquidity risk is controlled via approved funding and liquidity policies.
146 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Monitoring Liquidity is actively monitored at Group level.
Routine reporting is in place to senior management and through the Groups committee structure, in particular GALCO which meets monthly.
In a stress situation the level of monitoring and reporting is increased commensurate with the nature of the stress event.
Liquidity policies and procedures are subject to independent internal oversight.
Daily monitoring and control processes are in place to address internal and regulatory liquidity requirements.
The Group monitors a range of market and internal early warning indicators on a daily basis for early signs of liquidity risk in the market or specific to the Group.
These are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: daily variation of customer balances, changes in maturity profiles, cash outflows, funding concentration, changes in primary liquidity portfolio, credit default swap CDS spreads and changing funding costs.
In addition, the monitoring framework has two other important components.
Firstly, the Group carries out stress testing of its liquidity and potential cash flow mismatch position over both short up to two weeks and longer term up to three months horizons against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA the idiosyncratic, market wide and combined stresses and the Groups own scenarios reflecting possible future liquidity risks.
The Groups scenarios cover US market disruption, market counterparty failure, UK sovereign rating downgrade, Eurozone stress and a cyber attack.
The key risk driver assumptions applied to the scenarios are: Liquidity risk driver Market wide and Group specific stresses Marketable assets Haircut widening and repos assumed not to roll on contractual maturity Non marketable assets Loan repayments under stress and possible liquidity value of less liquid assets Wholesale funding Outflows calculated based on contractual maturity of wholesale funding with limited roll over Retail and commercial funding Substantial outflows on customer deposit base Intra-day liquidity Liquidity required for clearing and payment systems under stressed conditions Intra-group liquidity Requirements from the stressed position of subsidiaries Off balance sheet Stressed cash outflows from commitments granted.
Specifically, commitments granted include the pipeline of new business awaiting completion as well as other standby or revolving credit facilities Downgrade Contractual outflows resulting from short and long-term rating downgrades Funding concentration risk Segmentation by instrument, product, currency, counterparty and term structure Franchise viability Actions that need to be taken to maintain the Groups core business franchise and reputation The scenarios and the assumptions are reviewed at least annually to gain assurance that they continue to be relevant to the nature of the business.
The Groups liquidity risk appetite is calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.
For further information on the Groups 2014 liquidity stress testing results refer to page 151.
In addition to the liquidity stress testing framework, the Group funding plan is stressed against a range of macroeconomic scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA.
The Group also applies its own macroeconomic stress scenarios, including a one in 20 year recession.
Liquidity risk appetite and regulatory metrics are calculated and monitored over the life the plan under base and stress conditions.
Secondly, the Group maintains a Contingency Funding Plan which is designed to identify emerging liquidity concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken to avoid a more serious crisis developing.
Contingency Funding Plan invocation and escalation processes are based on analysis of five major quantitative and qualitative components, comprising assessment of: early warning indicators, prudential and regulatory liquidity risk limits and triggers, stress testing results, event and systemic indicators and market intelligence.
Funding and liquidity management in 2014 The Groups funding position has been significantly strengthened and the Group has transformed its balance sheet structure in recent years.
Total funded assets reduced by 14.5 billion to 493.4 billion.
The Group loan to deposit ratio has improved to 107 per cent compared with 113 per cent at 31 December 2013.
Customer deposits, excluding repos, increased by 10.6 billion and, excluding reverse repos, loans and advances to customers reduced by 15.3 billion primarily driven by a continued reduction in the Run-off portfolio 31 December 2014: 16.9 billion: 31 December 2013: 33.3 billion.
The increase in customer deposits along with the continued reduction in the Run-off portfolio has enabled the Group to make changes in wholesale funding which reduced by 21.1 billion to 116.5 billion, with the volume with a residual maturity less than one year reducing to 41.1 billion 44.2 billion at 31 December 2013.
The Groups term funding ratio wholesale funding with a remaining life of over one year as a percentage of total wholesale funding reduced to 65 per cent 68 per cent at 31 December 2013 as expected in line with maturities of wholesale term funding and limited term wholesale issuance in 2014.
During 2014, the Group has experienced stable term issuance costs that have remained significantly lower than in previous years.
The Group has had a limited demand for term wholesale funding in recent years but this may increase in the future as the Group continues to optimise the balance sheet structure.
Following the recent UK implementation of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, ratings agencies may review their ratings to reassess the likelihood of UK extraordinary government support.
On 3 February 2015 Standard & Poors lowered the long term ratings on the two holding companies Lloyds Banking Group plc and HBOS plc by two notches to the BBB level.
The operating companies Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc continue to have long term ratings of A but have been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications.
At the same time Standard & Poors announced that the holding companies of the Group have a positive outlook as they could revise upward the unsupported Group Credit Profile of Lloyds Banking Group.
Lloyds Bank plc is currently rated A1 by Moodys and A by Fitch, however it is likely that they may review these ratings later in the year, taking into account regulatory changes, particularly relating to Recovery and Resolution.
The effects of a downgrade from all three rating agencies are included in the Group liquidity stress testing.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR is due to become the Pillar 1 standard for liquidity in the UK from October 2015.
The Group continues to monitor the requirements, has a robust and well governed reporting framework in place and expects to meet the minimum requirements following finalisation from the PRA.
Based on the Groups current knowledge of the LCR standards due in October 2015, it believes that it met the upcoming requirements as at 31 December 2014.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 147 Risk management Risk management continued The combination of a strong balance sheet and access to a wide range of funding markets, including government and central bank schemes, provides the Group with a broad range of options with respect to funding the balance sheet in the future.

Utilisation of the UK governments Funding for Lending Scheme FLS has further underlined the Groups support to the UK economic recovery and the Group remains committed to passing the benefits of this low cost funding on to its customers.
The Group drew down 2.0 billion in January 2014, under the 2013 FLS and a further 10.0 billion over the remainder of the year as part of the 2014 scheme, bringing total drawings under the FLS to 20.0 billion.
Liquidity portfolio At 31 December 2014, the Banking business had 109.3 billion 2013: 89.3 billion of highly liquid unencumbered assets in its primary liquidity portfolio which are available to meet cash and collateral outflows and PRA regulatory requirements.
A separate liquidity portfolio to mitigate any insurance liquidity risk is managed within the Insurance business.
Primary liquid assets of 109.3 billion represent 5.8 times 31 December 2013: 4.2 times the Groups money market funding less than one year maturity excluding derivative collateral margins and settlement accounts and are 2.7 times 31 December 2013: 2.0 times all wholesale funding less than one year maturity, and thus provides a substantial buffer in the event of continued market dislocation.

Future use of such facilities will be based on prudent liquidity management and economic considerations, having regard for external market conditions.
The entire primary liquidity portfolio and a subset of the secondary portfolio are LCR eligible.
The Group considers diversification across geography, currency, markets and tenor when assessing appropriate holdings of primary and secondary liquid assets.
This liquidity is managed as a single pool in the centre and is under the control of the function charged with managing the liquidity of the Group apart from the TSB Liquidity Buffer which is managed separately.
It is available for deployment at immediate notice, subject to complying with regulatory requirements, and is a key component of the Groups liquidity management process.
Stress testing results Internal stress testing results at 31 December 2014 showed that the Banking business had liquidity resources representing 148 per cent of modelled outflows from all wholesale funding sources, retail and corporate deposits, intra-day requirements and rating dependent contracts under the Groups most severe liquidity stress scenario the three month PRA combined scenario.
Assets and liabilities within the TSB Banking Group were not included as their stress testing is managed separately.
The liquidity stress testing assumes that further credit rating downgrades may reduce investor appetite for some of the Groups liability classes and therefore funding capacity.
A hypothetical idiosyncratic two notch downgrade of the Groups current long-term debt rating and accompanying short-term downgrade implemented instantaneously by all major rating agencies, could result in an outflow of 2.5 billion of cash over a period of up to one year, 2.4 billion of collateral posting related to customer financial contracts and 8.6 billion of collateral posting associated with secured funding.
The Groups internal liquidity risk appetite includes such a stress scenario.
The stress scenario modelling demonstrates the Group has available liquidity resources to manage such an event.
Encumbered assets This disclosure provides further detail on the availability of assets that could be used to support potential future funding requirements of the Group.
The disclosure is not designed to identify assets that would be available in the event of a resolution or bankruptcy.
The Group has analysed its balance sheet between unencumbered and encumbered assets.
Encumbered assets: Assets recognised on the Groups balance sheet which have been pledged as collateral against an existing liability, and as a result are assets which are unavailable to the Group to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements.
The following sub analyses have been provided for unencumbered assets: Unencumbered Readily realisable: Assets regarded by the Group to be readily realisable in the normal course of business, to secure funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, and are not subject to any restrictions on their use for these purposes.
Unencumbered Other realisable: Assets where there are no restrictions on their use to secure funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but are not readily realisable in the normal course of business in their current form.
Unencumbered Cannot be used: Assets that have not been pledged but which the Group has assessed could not be pledged and therefore could not be used to secure funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements.
Assets held within the Groups Insurance businesses are generally held to either back liabilities to policyholders or to support the solvency of the Insurance subsidiaries: accordingly all Insurance assets are classified as unencumbered cannot be used.
Assets held within consolidated limited liability partnerships to provide security for the Groups obligations to its pension schemes are classified as unencumbered cannot be used.
The Board and GALCO monitor and manage total balance sheet encumbrance and readily realisable unencumbered assets via a number of risk appetite metrics.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had 134,916 million 31 December 2013: 118,446 million of encumbered and 719,980 million 31 December 2013: 723,934 million of unencumbered on balance sheet assets.
Of the unencumbered assets, 355,298 million 31 December 2013: 384,502 million was classified as realisable for potential future funding requirements with a large pool 188,141 million: 31 December 2013: 201,191 million of readily realisable assets, from which if needed the Group could meet potential funding requirements at short notice.
Primarily the Group encumbers mortgages and term lending through the issuance programmes and tradable securities through securities financing activity.
The above table sets out the carrying value of the Groups encumbered and unencumbered assets, separately identifying those that are available to support the Groups funding needs.
It should be noted that the table does not include collateral received by the Group that is not recognised on its balance sheet, some of which the Group is permitted to repledge.
The Group provides collateralised security financing services to its clients, providing them with cash financing or specific securities.
Collateralised security financing is also used to manage the Groups own short-term cash and collateral needs.
For securities accepted as collateral the reverse repo, margin and bond borrowing mandate is credit rating driven with appropriate notional limits per rating, asset and individual bond concentration.
All securities are investment grade.
With regard to repo and stock lending agreements the Group only trades with regulated entities.
Many factors are taken into consideration the main being, the credit worthiness of the counterpart, pricing transparency, underlying bond liquidity, central bank eligibility, credit rating, concentration and country risk.
The vast majority of collateral the Group uses in repo reverse repo and stock lending stock borrowing transactions is investment grade Government issued, primarily UK Government debt.
The majority of repo reverse repo and stock lending stock borrowing transactions are short-term, having a residual maturity of less than three months.
152 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 CAPITAL RISK Definition Capital risk is defined as the risk that the Group has a sub-optimal amount or quality of capital or that capital is inefficiently deployed across the Group.
Risk appetite Capital risk appetite is set by the Group Board, reflecting the Groups strategic plans, regulatory capital constraints and market expectations.
It is defined by a number of minimum capital ratios in normal and stressed conditions, a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum buffer over regulatory solvency requirements for the Insurance business set by the Insurance Board.
The Group monitors its actual and forecast capital positions aiming to remain within its appetite at all times.
Exposures A capital exposure arises where the Group has insufficient capital resources to support its strategic objectives and plans, and to meet external stakeholder requirements and expectations.
This could arise due to a depletion of the Groups capital resources as a result of the crystallisation of any of the risks to which it is exposed.
Alternatively a shortage of capital could arise from an increase in the amount of capital that is needed to be held.
The Groups capital management approach is focused on maintaining sufficient capital resources to prevent such exposures while optimising value for shareholders.
Measurement The Group measures the amount of capital it holds using the regulatory framework defined by the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation CRD IV as implemented in the UK by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA policy statement PS7 13.
Full details on the Groups regulatory capital framework are provided on page 20 of the Pillar 3 Report.
The minimum amount of total capital, under Pillar 1 of the regulatory framework, is determined as 8 per cent of the aggregate risk-weighted assets calculated in respect of credit risk, counterparty credit risk, operational risk and market risk.
At least 4 per cent of risk-weighted assets were required to be covered by Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital in 2014, increasing to 4.5 per cent from 1 January 2015.
The minimum requirement for capital is supplemented by Pillar 2 of the regulatory framework.
Under Pillar 2A, additional minimum requirements are set through the issuance of bank specific Individual Capital Guidance ICG, which adjusts the Pillar 1 minimum for those risks not covered or not fully covered under Pillar 1.
A key input into the PRAs ICG setting process is a banks own assessment of the amount of capital it needs, a process known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The Groups Pillar 2A ICG equates to 3.8 per cent of RWAs, of which 2.1 per cent must be covered by CET1 capital.
This reflects a point in time estimate by the PRA, which may change over time, of the total amount of capital that is needed and includes risks that are not fully covered by Pillar 1 such as credit concentration and operational risk, and those risks not covered by Pillar 1 such as pensions and interest rate risk.
As part of the capital planning process, forecast capital positions are subjected to extensive stress analyses to determine the adequacy of the Groups capital resources against the minimum requirements, including ICG.
Under Pillar 2B the PRA uses the outputs from some of these stress analyses to inform the setting of the Groups Capital Planning Buffer CPB, defining a minimum level of capital over and above the minimum regulatory requirements that should be maintained in non-stressed conditions as mitigation against potential future periods of stress.
The PRA requires the CPB to remain confidential between the Group and the PRA.
In addition to the CPB, a countercyclical capital buffer could potentially apply of up to 2.5 per cent.
This buffer is time-varying and is designed to require banks to hold additional capital to remove or reduce the build up of systemic risk in times of credit boom, providing additional loss absorbing capacity and acting as an incentive for banks to constrain further credit growth.
The Group is not currently required to hold a countercyclical capital buffer.
The Financial Policy Committee FPC of the Bank of England can also set sectoral capital requirements which are temporary increases to banks capital requirements on exposures to specific sectors, if the FPC judges that exuberant lending to these sectors poses risks to financial stability.
No sectoral capital requirements currently apply to the Group.
Under CRD IV two other CET1 capital buffers, the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent and the systemic risk buffer of up to 3 per cent, will be phased in over the period from 1 January 2016 to 2019.
To recognise these new buffers the PRA intends to rename the CPB as the PRA buffer and when setting the PRA buffer, will take into account the extent to which these CRD IV buffers already capture the risks identified in the PRA buffer assessment.
In addition to the risk-based capital framework described above, the Group is also subject to minimum capital requirements under the leverage ratio framework.
The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital resources by a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items.
The Groups leverage ratio currently exceeds the aggregate minimum levels proposed by the FPC which require major domestic banks to meet a minimum ratio of 3 per cent, a supplementary systemic risk based buffer of up to 1.05 per cent to apply from 2016 for globally systemically important banks G-SIBs and from 2019 for major domestic banks and a time-varying countercyclical leverage buffer of up to 0.9 per cent currently set at zero per cent.
At least 75 per cent of the minimum 3 per cent and the entirety of any buffers must be met by CET1 capital.
It is expected that the proposals will be implemented during 2015.
Mitigation The Group has a capital management framework including policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that it operates within its risk appetite, continues to comply with regulatory requirements and is positioned to meet anticipated future changes to its capital requirements.
The Group is able to accumulate additional capital through the accumulation of profits over time, by raising new equity via, for example, a rights issue or debt exchange and by raising additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital by issuing subordinated liabilities.
The cost and availability of additional capital is dependent upon market conditions and perceptions at the time.
The Group is also able to manage the demand for capital through management actions including adjusting its lending strategy, risk hedging strategies and through business disposals.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 153 Risk management Risk management continued Additional measures to manage the Groups capital position include seeking to strike an appropriate balance of capital held within its Insurance and Banking subsidiaries and through improving the quality of its capital through liability management exercises.
Monitoring Capital is actively managed and regulatory ratios are a key factor in the Groups planning processes and stress analyses.
Five year forecasts of the Groups capital position, based upon the Groups operating plan, are produced at least annually to inform the Groups capital strategy whilst shorter term forecasts are more frequently undertaken to understand and respond to variations of the Groups actual performance against the plan.
The capital plans are tested for capital adequacy using a range of stress scenarios covering adverse economic conditions as well as other adverse factors that could impact the Group and the Group maintains a Recovery Plan which sets out a range of potential mitigating actions that could be taken in response to a stress.
Capital policies and procedures are subject to independent oversight.
Regular reporting of actual and projected ratios, including those in stressed scenarios, is undertaken, including submissions to the Group Asset and Liability Committee, the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Board.
The regulatory framework within which the Group operates continues to be developed at a global level through the Financial Stability Board FSB and Basel Committee, at a European level mainly through the issuance of CRD IV technical standards and guidelines and within the UK by the PRA and through directions from the FPC.
At a global level the Basel Committee has set out a summary of various policy and disclosure initiatives that it expects to undertake during 2015 themed around reducing excessive variability in banks regulatory capital ratios.
Proposed revisions to the Standardised Approach risk-weight framework in addition to early stage proposals on the design of a new capital floors framework were issued toward the end of 2014.
At a European level a number of capital related CRD IV technical standards and guidelines were published by the European Banking Authority EBA during the year, with further technical standards and guidelines expected to be published in 2015, which the Group will continue to be required to meet.
In the UK the Financial Policy Committee FPC finalised proposals for a UK leverage ratio framework.
In January 2015 the PRA issued a consultation on proposals to reform the Pillar 2 framework, including new approaches for determining Pillar 2A capital requirements and the setting of Pillar 2B capital requirements the PRA buffer.
The Group continues to monitor these developments very closely, analysing the potential capital impacts to ensure the Group continues to maintain a strong capital position that exceeds the minimum regulatory requirements and the Groups risk appetite and is consistent with market expectations.
Capital management in 2014 The Group continued to strengthen its capital position during 2014 through capital-efficient profit generation, further dividends from the Insurance business, changes to and improved valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements and a reduction in risk-weighted assets.
The positive impact of these items was partly offset by the recommended dividend, charges relating to legacy issues and the Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs exchange and tender offers where the Group repurchased the equivalent of 5 billion nominal 4 billion regulatory value of ECNs and issued 5.3 billion of new CRD IV compliant additional tier 1 AT1 securities.
The CET 1 ratio increased 2.5 percentage points from 10.3 per cent pro forma to 12.8 per cent.
The leverage ratio increased 1.1 percentage points from 3.8 per cent pro forma to 4.9 per cent.
The transitional total capital ratio increased 3.2 percentage points from 18.8 per cent pro forma to 22.0 per cent.
The Group is now assuming a steady state CET 1 ratio requirement of around 12 per cent.
The directors have recommended a dividend of 0.75 pence per share.
The dividend, amounting to approximately 535 million, will be recognised in the Groups 2015 financial statements.
The Group intends to have a progressive dividend policy with dividends starting at a modest level and increasing over the medium term to a dividend payout ratio of at least 50 per cent of sustainable earnings.
The ability of the Group to pay a dividend is subject to a number of constraints.
Under the Companies Act 2006, dividends may only be paid out of profits available for distribution, which are determined by reference to a companys separate financial statements.
Lloyds Banking Group plc acts a holding company which also raises debt to fund the activities of the Group.
The profitability of the Company is therefore dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries and consequently its ability to sustain dividend payments is in turn largely dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to continue making dividend payments.
At 31 December 2014 the Company had accumulated distributable reserves of approximately 8,500 million.
Substantially all of the Companys merger reserve is available for distribution under UK company law as a result of transactions undertaken to recapitalise the Company in 2009.
As the parent company of a banking group payment of a dividend is also dependent upon the maintenance of an adequate level of regulatory capital.
The Group remains strongly capitalised, increasing its CET 1 capital ratio from 10.3 per cent at 31 December 2013 to 13.0 per cent pre dividend at 31 December 2014.
The payment of a dividend reduces an entitys CET 1 capital and, as a result, reduces its CET 1 capital ratio.
The current recommended dividend reduces the Groups CET 1 ratio to 12.8 per cent.
Capital position at 31 December 2014 The Groups capital position as at 31 December 2014 is presented in the following section applying CRD IV transitional arrangements, as implemented in the UK by PRA policy statement PS7 13, and also on a fully loaded CRD IV basis.

31 December 2013 common equity tier 1 ratios, excluding the benefit of these sales, were 10.0 per cent fully loaded and 10.1 per cent on transitional rules, while risk-weighted assets under fully loaded rules were 271.1 billion and under transitional rules were 272.1 billion.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 155 Risk management Risk management continued The key differences between the transitional capital calculation as at 31 December 2014 and the fully loaded equivalent are as follows: Capital securities that previously qualified as tier 1 or tier 2 capital, but do not qualify under CRD IV, can be included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital as applicable up to a specified limit which reduces by 10 per cent per annum until 2022.
The significant investment deduction from AT1 in 2014 will transition to tier 2 by 2018.

2 As the Insurance business is excluded from the scope of the Groups regulatory capital consolidation, profits made by Insurance are removed from CET1 capital.
Dividends paid to the Group by Insurance, however, are recognised through CET1 Capital and for the period include 400 million paid in March 2014 and 300 million paid in December 2014.
In addition, the sale of Heidelberger Leben resulted in the payment of an additional dividend by Insurance to the Group of 295 million.
CET1 capital resources have increased by 2,471 million in the period, mainly due to profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, reflecting underlying profit, dividends from the Insurance business, and a pensions credit resulting from changes to the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements, partly offset by charges relating to legacy issues and the ECN exchange and lender offers.
Additionally, favourable pension variations through other comprehensive income, favourable movements in available-for-sale AFS reserves, a reduction in the excess of expected losses over impairment provisions and value adjustments and a reduction in deferred tax and significant investment deductions, further increased CET1 capital resources partially offset by an increase in the pensions asset deducted from capital and foreseeable dividends.
AT1 capital resources have increased by 5,060 million in the period, mainly due to the ECN exchange and tender offers that resulted in the issuance of 5.3 billion of CRD IV compliant AT1 instruments, partially offset by other movements in grandfathered tier 1 subordinated debt, including foreign exchange movements and fair value unwind.
As a result of the offers launched in the first half of the year, the Group has met its AT1 requirement under the CRD IV capital framework.
Through the exchange and tender offers, the Group repurchased the equivalent of 5 billion nominal 4 billion regulatory value of ECNs and issued 5.3 billion of new AT1 securities.
In addition to delivering the Groups AT1 requirement, the exchange and tender offers also increased the Groups leverage ratios by approximately 50 basis points, improved the Groups rating agency metrics, and has benefited the Groups net interest margin in 2014 by approximately 7 basis points.
Coupon payments on the new AT1 securities are accounted for as distributions from reserves.
The exchanges resulted in a net accounting charge of approximately 1.1 billion, which has reduced the Groups fully loaded CET1 capital ratio by approximately 50 basis points.
Tier 2 capital resources have reduced by 5,962 million in the period.
This primarily reflects the ECN exchange and tender offers, which resulted in 4.0 billion of existing tier 2 ECN instruments being redeemed in exchange for the issuance of AT1 instruments as outlined above and the Groups stated intention to approach the PRA to seek the appropriate permission to redeem a number of remaining ECN instruments following the Capital Disqualification Event that occurred upon the release of the PRA stress test results which resulted in a further reduction of 0.5 billion.
Additional factors contributing to the reduction in tier 2 capital resources included a reduction in eligible provisions and other movements in tier 2 subordinated debt, including foreign exchange, fair value unwind, amortisation of dated instruments and other calls and redemptions.
The reduction in tier 2 capital resources was partially offset by the issuance of a 0.6 billion CRD IV compliant tier 2 dated subordinated debt instrument in November 2014.

2 TSB risk-weighted assets are on a Lloyds Banking Group reporting basis and differ to those reported by TSB as a standalone regulated entity.
3 Threshold risk-weighted assets reflect the element of significant investments and deferred tax assets that are permitted to be risk-weighted instead of deducted from CET1 capital under threshold rules.
Significant investments primarily arise from the investment in the Groups Insurance business.
4 Differences may arise between transitional and fully loaded threshold risk-weighted assets where deferred tax assets reliant on future profitability and arising from temporary timing differences and significant investments exceed the fully loaded threshold limit, resulting in an increase in amounts deducted from CET1 rather than being risk-weighted.
At 31 December 2014 the fully loaded threshold was not exceeded and therefore no further adjustment was applied to the transitional threshold risk-weighted assets.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 157 Risk management Risk management continued Key differences between risk-weighted assets at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 under transitional rules are as follows: Retail division risk-weighted assets reduced by 5.2 billion in the year primarily due to improvements in credit quality arising from active portfolio management and the impact of positive economic factors including favourable movements in UK house prices and reduced unemployment as well as the exit from its joint venture banking operations with Sainsburys.
These movements are partially offset by risk-weighted asset increases arising from model changes.
Consumer Finance division risk-weighted assets increased by 0.8 billion largely due to new business lending and model changes partially offset by reductions arising from improvements in credit quality and economic factors.
Commercial Banking risk-weighted assets reduced by 17.8 billion mainly reflecting market risk reductions, active portfolio management and methodology refinements.
The market risk-weighted asset reduction of 6.3 billion is primarily due to the removal of a temporary capital buffer applied to the Groups internal market risk models on completion of specific market risk infrastructure projects.
Central Items risk-weighted assets primarily comprise the Groups liquidity portfolio and strategic equity investments and other balance sheet assets such as fixed assets and sundry debtors.
The increase in the year of 4.4 billion is primarily due to equity received in consideration for the disposal of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership SWIP.
The reduction in Run-off risk-weighted assets of 13.8 billion is mainly due to disposals, including the sale of loans in the Irish retail mortgage portfolio and movements in external economic factors.

The risk-weighted asset movements table provides an analysis of the movement in risk-weighted assets in the year and an insight in to the key drivers of the movements.
The analysis is compiled on a monthly basis through the identification and categorisation of risk-weighted asset movements and is subject to management judgement.
Management of the balance sheet includes risk-weighted asset movements arising from new lending and asset run-off and management of market risk positions.
During the year risk-weighted assets decreased 6.9 billion primarily in Commercial Banking, partially offset by business growth in Consumer Finance and equities received in consideration for the disposal of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership within Central Items.
Disposals include risk-weighted asset reductions arising from the sale of assets, portfolios and businesses.
Disposals reduced risk-weighted assets by 10.0 billion, primarily in the Run-off portfolio, including the sale of loans in the Irish retail mortgage portfolio as well as exiting the joint venture banking operation with Sainsburys, in Retail.
External economic factors captures movements driven by changes in the economic environment.
The reduction in risk-weighted assets of 9.2 billion is mainly due to positive macroeconomic factors including favourable movements in UK house prices and reduced unemployment which have led to improvements in the credit risk profile of customers.
Model and methodology changes include the movement in risk-weighted assets arising from new model implementation, model enhancement and changes in credit risk approach applied to certain portfolios.
Model and methodology changes reduced risk-weighted assets by 5.6 billion, primarily due to the removal of a temporary capital buffer applied to the Groups internal market risk models on completion of specific market risk infrastructure projects.
Reductions in credit risk arise from a number of small methodology refinements in Commercial Banking, partially offset by risk-weighted asset increases arising from updates to mortgage models and refinement of risk models for unsecured products in Retail and Consumer Finance.
158 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Leverage ratio The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital excluding grandfathered tier 1 securities by a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items.
On 12 January 2014 the Basel Committee issued a revised Basel III leverage ratio framework that included a number of amendments to the original calculation of the exposure measure, in particular the methodologies applied in determining the exposure measures for derivatives, securities financing transactions SFTs and off-balance sheet items.
In addition the scope of consolidation has been fully aligned to that applied to the risk-based capital framework, thereby requiring all on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items of the Insurance division to be excluded from the Groups total exposure measure and replaced by a measure of the banking groups investment in Insurance.
In January 2015 the existing CRD IV rules on the calculation of the leverage ratio were amended to align with the European Commissions interpretation of the revised Basel III leverage ratio framework.
Although there remain some minor differences between the framework and the amended CRD IV rules, the Group does not consider these to be material and has therefore elected, in accordance with PRA guidance, to disclose on the basis of the revised Basel III leverage ratio framework, in keeping with the interim 2014 disclosures.

4 Includes the pro forma benefit of the sales of Heidelberger Leben, Scottish Widows Investment Partnership and the Groups 50 per cent stake in Sainsburys Bank.
Assets related to Group subsidiaries that fall outside of the Groups regulatory capital consolidation are deconsolidated.
These are replaced with a proportion of the Groups investment in the subsidiaries, reflecting amounts not already deducted from tier 1 capital as part of significant investment deductions.
This primarily applies to the Groups Insurance subsidiaries resulting in the removal of assets related to Insurance division.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 159 Risk management Risk management continued Adjustments are applied to the balance sheet asset value of derivatives financial instruments to reflect the application of regulatory netting rules, adjustments for the recognition of cash variation margin subject to certain restrictions, the addition of notional amounts of written credit derivatives and the requirement to reflect potential future exposure amounts in accordance with regulatory rules.
Securities financing transactions, predominantly comprising repurchase transactions, are subject to the netting rules imposed by the framework.
These are considered to be similar to current IFRS accounting rules on netting.
In addition a counterparty credit risk amount is calculated and added to the SFT measure, representing the extent to which a SFT is under-collateralised.
Off-balance sheet items primarily consist of undrawn credit facilities, including facilities that may be cancelled unconditionally at any time without notice.
The leverage ratio exposure value for off-balance sheet items is determined by applying set credit conversion factors to the nominal values of the items, based on the classification of the item.
In accordance with the requirements of the framework the credit conversion factors applied to off-balance sheet items follow those prescribed by Standardised credit risk rules, subject to a floor of 10 per cent.
Other regulatory adjustments consist of other balance sheet assets that are required under CRD IV rules to be deducted from tier 1 capital such as deferred tax asset amounts, pension assets and goodwill and intangibles.
The removal of these assets from the exposure measure ensures consistency is maintained between the capital and exposure components of the ratio.
Key movements The 1.1 per cent increase in the Groups fully loaded leverage ratio from 3.8 per cent pro forma to 4.9 per cent predominantly reflects the increase in the Groups tier 1 capital position over the period, including the issuance of 5.3 billion of CRD IV compliant AT1 instruments and the growth in CET1 capital, as discussed on page 154.
G-SIB requirements Although the Group is not currently classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank G-SIB, by virtue of the leverage exposure exceeding 200 billion, the Group is required to report G-SIB metrics to the PRA.
The Groups metrics used within the 2014 Basel G-SIBs annual exercise will be disclosed from April 2015, and the results are expected to be made available by the Basel Committee later this year.
Life insurance businesses The business transacted by the life insurance companies within the Group comprises unit-linked business, non-profit business and with-profits business.
Several companies transact either unit-linked and or non-profit business, but Scottish Widows plc Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited Clerical Medical hold the only With-Profit Funds managed by the Group.
Basis of determining regulatory capital of the life insurance businesses Available capital resources Available capital resources represent the excess of assets over liabilities calculated in accordance with detailed regulatory rules issued by the PRA.
Statutory basis: Assets are generally valued on a basis consistent with that used for accounting purposes with the exception that, in certain cases, the value attributed to assets is limited and which follows a market value approach where possible.
If the market is not active, the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
Liabilities are calculated using a projection of future cash flows after making prudent assumptions about matters such as investment return, expenses and mortality.
Discount rates used to value the liabilities are set with reference to the risk adjusted yields on the underlying assets in accordance with the PRA rules.
Other assumptions are based on recent actual experience, supplemented by industry information where appropriate.
The assessment of liabilities does not include future bonuses for with-profits policies that are at the discretion of management, but does include a value for policyholder options likely to be exercised.
Regulatory capital requirements Each life insurance company must retain sufficient capital to meet the regulatory capital requirements mandated by the PRA: the basis of calculating the regulatory capital requirement is given below.
Except for Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical, the regulatory capital requirement is a combination of amounts held in respect of actuarial reserves, sums at risk and maintenance expenses the Long-Term Insurance Capital Requirement and amounts required to cover various stress tests the Resilience Capital Requirement.
The regulatory capital requirement is deducted from the available capital resources to give statutory excess capital.
For Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical, no Resilience Capital Requirement is required.
However, a further test is required in respect of the With-Profit Funds.
This involves comparing the statutory basis of assessment with a realistic basis of assessment as described below.
Realistic basis: The PRA requires each life insurance company which contains a With-Profit Fund in excess of 500 million to also carry out a realistic valuation of that fund.
The Group has two such funds: one within Scottish Widows and one within Clerical Medical.
The word realistic in this context reflects the fact that assumptions are best-estimate as opposed to prudent.
This realistic valuation is an assessment of the financial position of a With-Profit Fund calculated under a methodology prescribed by the PRA.
The valuation of with-profits assets in a With-Profit Fund on a realistic basis differs from the valuation on a statutory basis as, in respect of non-profit business written therein, it includes the present value of the anticipated future release of the prudent margins for adverse deviation.
In addition, the realistic valuation uses the market value of assets without the limit affecting the statutory basis noted above.
The realistic valuation of liabilities differs from the statutory basis in including an allowance for future bonuses whilst the value of options and guarantees are assessed using a stochastic simulation model which values these liabilities on a basis consistent with tradable market option contracts a market-consistent basis.
In calculating the realistic liabilities, the model also takes account of policyholder behaviour on a best-estimate basis and includes an adjustment to reflect future uncertainties where the exercise of options by policyholders might increase liabilities.
Further details regarding the stochastic simulation model are given in the section entitled Options and guarantees on page 164.
The realistic excess capital is calculated as the difference between realistic assets and realistic liabilities of the With-Profit Fund with a further deduction to cover various stress tests the Risk Capital Margin.
In circumstances where the realistic excess capital position is less than the statutory excess 160 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 capital, the company is required to hold additional capital to cover the shortfall.
Any additional capital requirement under this test is referred to as the With-Profits Insurance Capital Component.
The determination of realistic liabilities of the With-Profit Funds includes the value of internal transfers expected to be made from each With-Profit Fund to the Non-Profit Fund held within the same life insurance entity.
These internal transfers may include charges on policies where the associated costs are borne by the Non-Profit Fund.
Capital statement The following table provides more detail regarding the capital resources available to meet regulatory capital requirements in the life insurance businesses.
The figures quoted are based on managements current expectations pending completion of the annual financial returns to the PRA.

BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 161 Risk management Risk management continued Formal intra group capital arrangements Scottish Widows has also provided subordinated loans to its fellow group undertaking Scottish Widows Bank plc.
No such arrangement exists for Clerical Medical.
Constraints over available capital resources Scottish Widows Scottish Widows was created following the demutualisation of Scottish Widows Fund and Life Assurance Society in 2000.
The terms of the demutualisation are governed by a Court-approved Scheme of Transfer the Scheme which, inter alia, created a With-Profits Fund and a Non-Participating Fund and established protected capital support for the with-profits policyholders in existence at the date of demutualisation.
Much of that capital support is held in the Non-Participating Fund and, as such, the capital held in that fund is subject to the constraints noted below.
The requirements of the Scheme sit alongside Scottish Widows published Principles and Practices of Financial Management of With-Profit business.
Requirement to maintain a Support Account: The Scheme requires the maintenance of a Support Account within the Non-Participating Fund.
The quantum of the Support Account is calculated with reference to the value of assets backing current with-profits policies which also existed at the date of demutualisation.
Under the Scheme assets can only be transferred from the Non-Participating Fund if the value of the remaining assets in the fund exceeds the value of the Support Account.
Scottish Widows has obtained from the PRA permission to include the value of the Support Account or, if greater, the excess of realistic liabilities for business written before demutualisation over the relevant assets subject to the Non-Participating Fund being able to cover this amount by its surplus admissible assets in assessing the realistic value of assets available to the With-Profit Fund.
At 31 December 2014 the estimated value of surplus admissible assets in the Non-Participating Fund was 796 million 2013: 1,902 million and the estimated value of the Support Account was nil 2013: nil.
However, at 31 December 2014, the excess of realistic liabilities of with-profits business written before demutualisation over the relevant assets was 39 million 2013: 54 million which, in accordance with the PRAs permission, has been used to assess the estimated value of realistic assets available to the With-Profit Fund and has therefore reduced the value of the Non-Participating Funds surplus admissible assets by that amount.
Further Support Account: The Further Support Account is an extra tier of capital support for the with-profits policies in existence at the date of demutualisation.
The Scheme requires that assets can only be transferred from the Non-Participating Fund if the economic value of the remaining assets in the fund exceeds the aggregate of the Support Account and Further Support Account.
Unlike the Support Account test, the economic value used for this test includes both admissible assets and the present value of future profits of business written in the Non-Participating Fund or by any subsidiaries of that fund.
The balance of the Further Support Account is expected to reduce to nil by the year 2030.
At 31 December 2014, the estimated net economic value of the Non-Participating Fund and its subsidiaries for the purposes of this test was 3,676 million 2013: 6,784 million and the estimated combined value of the Support Account and Further Support Account was 1,930 million 2013: 2,070 million.
Other restrictions in the Non-Participating Fund: In addition to the policies which existed at the date of demutualisation, the With-Profit Fund includes policies which have been written since that date.
As a result of statements made to policyholders that investment policy will usually be the same for both types of business, there is an implicit requirement to hold additional regulatory assets in respect of the business written after demutualisation.
The estimated amount required to provide such support at 31 December 2014 is 147 million 2013: 156 million.
Scottish Widows has obtained from the PRA permission to include the value of this support in assessing the realistic value of assets available to the With-Profit Fund.
There is a further test requiring that no amounts can be transferred from the Non-Participating Fund of Scottish Widows unless there are sufficient assets within the Long-Term Fund to meet both policyholders reasonable expectations in light of liabilities in force at a year-end and the new business expected to be written over the following year.
Clerical Medical The surplus held in the Clerical Medical With-Profit Fund can only be applied to meet the requirements of the fund itself or distributed according to the prescribed rules of the fund.
Shareholders are entitled to an amount not exceeding one ninth of the amount distributed to policyholders in the form of bonuses on traditional with-profits business.
The use of capital within the fund is also subject to the terms of the Scheme of Demutualisation effected in 1996 and the conditions contained in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management of the fund.
In extreme circumstances capital within the Clerical Medical Non-Profit Fund may be made available to support the With-Profit Fund.
Other life insurance businesses Except as described above capital held in UK Non-Profit Funds is potentially transferable to other parts of the Group, subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of these businesses.
There are no prior arrangements in place to allow capital to move freely between life insurance entities or other parts of the Group.
Overseas life business includes several life companies outside the UK.
In all cases the available capital resources are subject to local regulatory requirements, and transfer to other parts of the Group is subject to additional complexity surrounding the transfer of capital from one country to another.
162 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Movements in regulatory capital The movements in the Groups available capital resources in the life business can be analysed as follows: Table 1.52: Movements in available capital resources Scottish Clerical Widows Medical UK Life With-Profit With-Profit UK Non-Profit Shareholder Overseas Total Fund Fund Funds Funds Life Business Life Business m m m m m m At 31 December 2013 157 1,382 2,314 82 3,935 Changes in estimations and in demographic assumptions used to measure life assurance liabilities 1 431 11 443 Dividends and capital transactions 500 202 702 Change in support arrangements 24 24 New business and other factors 8 1 172 171 10 344 At 31 December 2014 125 1,509 2,283 103 4,020 With-Profit Funds Available capital in the Scottish Widows With-Profit Fund has decreased from 157 million at 31 December 2013 to an estimated 125 million at 31 December 2014 mainly due to a decrease in the liabilities of the transferred business.
Available capital in the Clerical Medical With-Profit Fund is estimated to be zero at 31 December 2014 no change from 31 December 2013.
This is because the fund is in the process of distributing the free estate and all surplus will ultimately be distributed to policyholders.
UK Non-Profit Funds Available capital in the UK Non-Profit Funds has increased from 1,382 million at 31 December 2013 to an estimated 1,509 million at 31 December 2014.
This is mainly due to emergence of surplus on existing business and assumption charges offset by new business strain and a reduction due to transfers to Shareholder Funds.
UK Life Shareholder Funds Available capital in the UK Life Shareholder Funds has decreased from 2,314 million at 31 December 2013 to an estimated 2,283 million at 31 December 2014.
The decrease mainly reflects the funding used to pay the dividend from Scottish Widows Group to Lloyds Bank and a tranche of subordinated debt due to be redeemed in 2015 which therefore no longer contributes to capital, partly offset by receipt of transfers from the Non-Profit Funds.
Overseas life business Available capital has increased during 2014 due to profits emerging on in force business and the impact of assumption charges.
Analysis of policyholder liabilities reported in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups life insurance business is as follows.
With-Profit Fund liabilities are valued in accordance with FRS 27.

With-Profit Funds The with-profits realistic liabilities and the available capital for the With-Profit Funds are sensitive to both market conditions and changes to a number of non-economic assumptions that affect the valuation of the liabilities of the fund.
The available capital resources and capital requirements are sensitive to the level of the stock market, with the position worsening at low stock market levels as a result of the guarantees to policyholders increasing in value.
However, the exposure to guaranteed annuity options increases under rising stock market levels.
An increase in the level of equity volatility implied by the market cost of equity put options also increases the market consistent value of the options given to policyholders and worsens the capital position.
Various hedging strategies are used to manage these exposures.
The most critical non-economic assumptions are the level of take-up of options inherent in the contracts higher take-up rates are more onerous, mortality rates lower mortality rates are generally more onerous and lapses prior to dates at which a guarantee would apply lower lapse rates are generally more onerous where guarantees are in the money.
The sensitivity of the capital position and capital requirements of the With-Profit Funds is partly mitigated by the actions that can be taken by management.
Other long-term funds Outside the With-Profit Funds, assets backing actuarial reserves in respect of policyholder liabilities are invested so that the values of the assets and liabilities are broadly matched.
The most critical non-economic assumptions are mortality rates in respect of annuity business written lower mortality rates are more onerous.
Assumptions relating to future expenses are also significant with increases in the expected level of future costs leading to increases in the value of the liabilities and consequently leading to a reduction in available capital.
Reinsurance arrangements are in place to reduce the Groups exposure to deteriorating mortality rates in respect of non-annuity life insurance contracts such that assured life mortality is a less significant assumption.
For Clerical Medical, assumptions relating to the provision in relation to German insurance business litigation are also significant.
Assets held in excess of those backing reserves are invested in readily tradable assets e. g. cash and fixed interest securities, cash and a range of less liquid fixed interest instruments, at levels consistent with the liquidity risk appetite of the Insurance business.
Options and guarantees The Group has sold insurance products that contain options and guarantees, both within the With-Profit Funds and in other funds.
164 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds The most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.
For those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the Scheme a separate memorandum account was set up within the With-Profit Fund of Scottish Widows called the Additional Account which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies.
The Additional Account had a value at 31 December 2014 of 2.6 billion 2013: 2.2 billion.
The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options.
The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.
As noted above, under the realistic capital regime of the PRA, the liabilities of both the Clerical Medical and Scottish Widows With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model.
This model is used in order to place a value on the options and guarantees which captures both their intrinsic value and their time value.
The most significant economic assumptions included in the model are: Risk-free yield.
The risk-free yield is defined as spot yields derived from swap yield curves.
The calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical observed volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.
For example, at 31 December 2014, the 10 year equity-implied at-the-money assumption was set at 22.3 per cent 2013: 22.1 per cent.
The assumption for property volatility was 13 per cent 2013: 15 per cent.
The volatility of interest rates has been calibrated to the implied volatility of swaptions which was broadly 27 per cent 2013: 17 per cent.
The model includes a matrix of the correlations between each of the underlying modelled asset types.
The correlations used are consistent with long-term historical returns.
The most significant non-economic assumptions included in the model are management actions in respect of investment policy and bonus rates, guaranteed annuity option take-up rates and assumptions regarding persistency both of which are based on recent actual experience and include an adjustment to reflect future uncertainties where the exercise of options by policyholders might increase liabilities, and assumptions regarding mortality which are based on recent actual experience and industry tables.
Options and guarantees outside the With-Profit Funds A number of typical guarantees are provided outside the With-Profit Funds such as guaranteed payments on death e. g. term assurance or guaranteed income for life e. g. annuities.
In addition, certain personal pension policyholders in Scottish Widows, for whom reinstatement to their occupational pension scheme was not an option, have been given a guarantee that their pension and other benefits will correspond in value to the benefits of the relevant occupational pension scheme.
The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns.
There is currently a provision, calculated on a deterministic basis, of 61 million 2013: 63 million in respect of those guarantees.
If future salary growth were 0.5 per cent per annum greater than assumed, the liability would increase by approximately 1 million.
If yields were 0.5 per cent lower than assumed, the liability would increase by approximately 9 million.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 165 Risk management Risk management continued REGULATORY RISK Definition Regulatory risk is defined as the risk that the Group is exposed to fines, censure, or legal or enforcement action due to failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations, codes of conduct or legal obligations.
Risk appetite The Group has zero risk appetite for material regulatory breaches.
This appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
To achieve this, the Group has policies, processes and standards which provide the framework for businesses and colleagues to operate in accordance with the laws, regulations and voluntary codes which apply to the Group and its activities.
Exposures The Group periodically experiences material regulatory breaches outside its risk appetite.
Regulatory exposure is also driven by the significant volume of current legislation and regulation within the UK and overseas with which the Group has to comply, along with new or proposed legislation and regulation which needs to be interpreted, implemented and embedded into day-to-day operational and business practices across the Group.
This is particularly the case currently: the industry still continues to witness increased levels of government and regulatory intervention in the financial sector with an increasing number of regulatory rules from both the UK and overseas affecting the Groups operations.
It is clear that regulatory challenges remain, including the area of conduct where the Group incurred a combined fine of 217 million by UK and US regulators for serious misconduct relating to the Special Liquidity Scheme SLS, the Repo Rate benchmark and the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR.
Measurement Regulatory risks are measured against a set of risk appetite metrics, with appropriate thresholds, which have been approved by the Board and which are regularly reviewed and monitored.
Metrics include assessments of control and material regulatory rule breaches.
Mitigation Mitigation is undertaken across the Group and comprises the following key components: Risks are assessed by the business and controls put in place to mitigate them: Enhanced regulatory reporting: Implementation of systems, processes and effective controls including mandatory training for colleagues: Regulatory horizon scanning: Oversight and assurance of the regulatory risks within the business: Quality assurance theme reviews to assess compliance with rules, regulations and policies: Continued investment in the Groups IT systems is enabling the Group to meet its regulatory commitments: Senior business leaders monitor the progress of these assessments and mitigations: Material risks and issues are escalated to Group-level bodies which challenge the business on its management of risks and issues: and Mandated policies and processes require appropriate control frameworks, management information and standards to be implemented.
Monitoring Business unit risk exposure is reported to Risk Division where it is aggregated at Group level and a report prepared.
The report forms the basis of challenge to the business at the monthly Group Compliance and Conduct Risk Committee.
This committee may escalate matters to the Chief Risk Officer, or higher committees.
The report also forms the basis of the regulatory sections in the Groups consolidated risk reporting.
166 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 INSURANCE RISK Definition Insurance risk is defined as the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured underwritten events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and or value.
Risk appetite Insurance risk appetite in the Insurance business is set by the Insurance Board and includes maximum earnings exposures to longevity and persistency risk in defined stresses.
Insurance risk appetite for longevity in the defined benefit pension schemes is set by the Board using two key metrics: a one year increase to life expectancy and a combined market and longevity stress.
Insurance risk appetite is monitored through Group, Insurance business and pension scheme governance.
Exposures The major sources of insurance risk within the Group are the Insurance business and the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
The nature of Insurance business involves the accepting of insurance risks which relate primarily to mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency and expenses for the life and pension business, and property insurance for the general insurance business.
The prime insurance risk of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is longevity.
Measurement Insurance risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress and scenario testing, and where appropriate, stochastic modelling.
Current and potential future insurance risk exposures are assessed and aggregated on a range of stresses including risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for Insurances Individual Capital Assessment Group defined benefit pension schemes utilise 1-in-20 year stresses and other supporting measures where appropriate, including those set out in notes 36 and 37 to the financial statements.
Mitigation A key element of the control framework is the consideration of insurance risk by an appropriate combination of high level committees and Boards.
For the Insurance business the ultimate control body is the Insurance Board but significant risks from Insurance and the defined benefit pension schemes are reviewed by the Group executive and Group Risk Committees and or Board.
Governance of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes also includes two specialist pension committees one Group executive sub committee and a supporting management committee.
Insurance risk is mitigated through pooling and through diversification across large numbers of individuals, geographical areas, and different types of risk exposure.
A number of processes are used to control insurance risk including: underwriting the process to ensure that new insurance proposals are properly assessed : pricing-to-risk new insurance proposals are priced to cover the underlying risks inherent within the products : claims management: product design and management: policy wording: reinsurance and cost controls and efficiencies.
In addition, exposure limits by risk type are assessed through the business planning process and used as a control mechanism to ensure risks are taken within risk appetite.
The most significant insurance risks within the Insurance business are longevity risk, persistency risk and expenses.
Longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions, as potential risk mitigants, are considered on a regular basis.
It is not practical to hedge persistency risk.
General insurance exposure to accumulations of risk and possible catastrophes is mitigated by reinsurance arrangements which are broadly spread over different reinsurers.
Detailed modelling, including that of the potential losses under various catastrophe scenarios, supports the choice of reinsurance arrangements.
Appropriate reinsurance arrangements also apply within the life and pensions businesses with significant mortality risk and morbidity risk being transferred to different reinsurers with limits on the level of risk placed with each reinsurer.
The most significant insurance risk in the defined benefit pension schemes is longevity risk.
The merits of longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are regularly reviewed.
Monitoring Ongoing monitoring is in place to track the progression of insurance risks.
In respect of the Insurance business this involves monitoring relevant experiences against expectations for example claims experience, persistency experience, expenses and non-disclosure at the point of sale as well as tracking the progression of insurance risk capital against limits and the sensitivity of profit before tax to the most significant insurance risks persistency and longevity.
The effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance risk is evaluated and significant divergences from experience or movements in risk exposures are investigated and remedial action taken.
Progress against risk appetite metrics in respect of longevity risk in the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is regularly reported and reviewed by the relevant committees.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 167 Risk management Risk management continued PEOPLE RISK Definition People risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to lead, manage and enable colleagues to deliver to customers, shareholders and regulators leading to reductions in earnings and or value.
Risk appetite The Groups people risk appetite and corresponding measures enable the Group to lead responsibly and proficiently, manage people resource effectively, support and develop colleague talent, and meet legal and regulatory obligations related to its people.
Exposures The Groups management of material people risks is critical to its capacity to deliver against its strategic objectives and to be the best bank for customers.
Over the coming year the Group anticipates the following key people risk exposures: The pending introduction of a new Senior Managers Regime and Certification Regime which introduces a reverse burden of proof and increased accountability may impact the Groups ability to attract and retain talent through appropriate incentive and reward schemes: Attracting and retaining talent may be impacted by a more active external market alongside regulatory changes which impact remuneration and reward arrangements: Colleague engagement may be challenged by ongoing media attention on banking sector culture, sales practices and ethical conduct: Maintaining organisational people capability in response to an increasingly digital business environment: and Resource stretch due to pace and volume of organisational change.
Measurement People risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of people risk for the Group such as succession, retention and whistleblowing.
In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, people risks and controls are monitored across individual Divisions and business units.
Divisional metrics are calibrated against the Groups risk appetite and monitored on a monthly basis via the Groups risk governance framework and reporting structures.
Mitigation The Group takes many mitigating actions with respect to people risk.
Key areas of focus include: Working with the Regulators to ensure their guidance on increased accountability in the new regimes and strengthening remuneration governance is clear and pragmatic to balance implementation costs with the benefits gained from enhanced governance: Continued focus on the Groups culture by developing and delivering initiatives that reinforce behaviours which generate the best possible long-term outcomes for customers and colleagues: Maintain effective remuneration arrangements to ensure they promote an appropriate culture and colleague behaviours that meet customer needs and regulatory expectations: Focusing on leadership and colleague engagement, through delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high calibre people together with implementation of rigorous succession planning: Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to Senior Manager Regime and Certification Regime, embedding compliant and appropriate colleague behaviours in line with Group policies, values and its people risk priorities: and Ongoing consultation with the Groups recognised unions on changes which impact their members.
Monitoring People risks from across the Group are monitored and reported through Board and Group Governance Committees in accordance with the Group Risk Management Framework and People Risk Sub-framework.
Risk exposures are discussed monthly via the Group HR & People Risk Committee with upwards reporting to Group Risk and Executive Committees.
In addition oversight, challenge and reporting is completed at Risk Division level and combined with Risk Assurance reviews, is intended to assess the effectiveness of controls against root cause, recommending follow up remedial action if relevant.
At Business level a full assessment of the People Risk Profile is completed to ensure an optimum level of control is in place to protect colleagues, customers and the Group.
All material People Risk events are escalated in accordance with the formal Group Operational Risk Policy and People Policies to the respective Divisional Managing Directors and the Group Compliance, Conduct & Operational Risk Director.
168 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL REPORTING RISK Definition Financial reporting risk is defined as the risk that the Group suffers reputational damage, loss of investor confidence and or financial loss arising from the adoption of inappropriate accounting policies, ineffective controls over financial and regulatory reporting, failure to manage the associated risks of changes in taxation rates, law, ownership or corporate structure and the failure to disclose accurate and timely information.
Risk appetite The risk appetite is set by the Board and reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently.
It includes complying with statutory and regulatory reporting requirements and compliance with tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Exposures Exposure represents the sufficiency of the Groups policies and procedures to maintain adequate systems, processes and controls to support statutory, prudential regulatory and tax reporting, to prevent and detect financial reporting fraud, to manage the Groups tax position and to support market disclosures.
Measurement Financial reporting risk is measured by the adequacy of and compliance with a number of key controls.
Identification of potential financial reporting risk also forms a part of the Groups Operational Risk management framework.
Mitigation The Group maintains a system of internal controls, which is designed to: ensure that accounting policies are consistently applied, transactions are recorded and undertaken in accordance with delegated authorities, that assets are safeguarded and liabilities are properly recorded: enable the calculation, preparation and reporting of financial, prudential regulatory and tax outcomes in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards, statutory and regulatory requirements: and ensure that disclosures are made on a timely basis in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements and as far as possible are consistent with best practice and in compliance with the British Bankers Association Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure.
Monitoring Financial reporting risk is actively monitored at business unit and Group levels.
There are specific programmes of work undertaken across the Group to support: annual assessments of 1 the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting: and 2 the effectiveness of the Groups disclosure controls and procedures, both in accordance with the requirements of the US Sarbanes Oxley Act: annual certifications by the Senior Accounting Officer with respect to the maintenance of appropriate tax accounting arrangements, in accordance with the requirements of the 2009 Finance Act.
The Group also has in place an assurance process to support its prudential regulatory reporting and monitoring activities designed to identify and review tax exposures on a regular basis.
There is ongoing monitoring to assess the impact of emerging regulation and legislation on financial, prudential regulatory and tax reporting.
The Group has a Disclosure Committee which assists the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in fulfilling their disclosure responsibilities under relevant listing and other regulatory and legal requirements.
In addition, the Audit Committee reviews the quality and acceptability of the Groups financial disclosures.
For further information on the Audit Committees responsibilities relating to financial reporting see pages 75 to 78.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 169 Risk management Risk management continued GOVERNANCE RISK Definition Governance risk is defined as the risk that the Groups organisational infrastructure fails to provide robust oversight of decision making and the control mechanisms to ensure strategies and management instructions are implemented effectively.
Risk appetite Governance risk appetite is defined and embedded through the Groups Governance Principle and Policy which are reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis.
The Group has governance arrangements that support the effective long-term operation of the business and the vision of being the best bank for customers, maximise shareholder value and meet regulatory and social expectations.
Exposures The internal and corporate governance arrangements of major financial institutions continue to be subject to a high level of regulatory and public scrutiny.
The Groups exposure to governance risk is also reflective of the significant volume of existing and proposed legislation and regulation within the UK and overseas with which it must comply.
Risk governance and risk culture are mutually reinforcing.
Measurement The Groups governance arrangements are assessed against new or proposed legislation and regulation and best practice among peer organisations in order to identify any areas of enhancement required.
Mitigation The Groups Risk Management Framework establishes robust arrangements for risk governance, in particular by: defining individual and collective accountabilities for risk management, risk oversight and risk assurance through a Three lines of Defence model which supports the discharge of responsibilities to customers, shareholders and regulators: outlining governance arrangements which articulate the enterprise-wide approach to risk management: and supporting a consistent approach to Group-wide behaviour and risk decision making through a Group Policy Framework which helps everyone understand their responsibilities by clearly articulating and communicating rules, boundaries and risk appetite measures which can be controlled, enforced and monitored.
Under the banner of the Risk Management Framework new training modules have been launched during 2014 to support all colleagues in understanding and fulfilling their risk responsibilities.
The Ethics and Responsible Business Policy and supporting Codes of Personal Responsibility and Business Responsibility embody the Groups values and reflect its commitment to operating responsibly and ethically both at a business and an individual level.
All colleagues are required to adhere to the Codes in all aspects of their roles.
Driving adherence to the Groups Risk Management framework goes hand in glove with its approach to risk culture which is embedded in the Groups approach to recruitment, selection, training, performance management and reward.
Monitoring A review of the Groups Risk Management Framework, which includes the status of the Groups Principles and Policy Framework, and the design and operational effectiveness of key governance committees, is undertaken on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Board.
This includes a review of the Groups current approach to governance and ongoing initiatives in light of the latest regulatory guidance.
