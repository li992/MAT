Report of the Audit Committee Introduction The Committee has continued to focus on the integrity of Bodycotes financial reporting, risk management and internal controls and on the quality of the external and internal audit processes.
The Committee will continue to keep our activities under review as the regulatory environment changes.
This year I have given more emphasis to the work actually done by the Committee in addition to the other matters we report upon.
Membership The members of the Audit Committee are J.
A. Biles, R. Rajagopal, E. Lindqvist and I.
B. Duncan who joined on 17 November 2014, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
Their biographical details are shown on pages 36 and 37 and their remuneration on page 63.
The Group Company Secretary is the secretary to the Audit Committee.
Mr Biles has been Chairman of the Audit Committee since 16 August 2007 when he was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
The Board considers that Mr Biles has recent and relevant financial experience.
He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Price Waterhouse & Co, served as a plc Finance Director FKI PLC 19982004 and Chubb Security PLC 19911997 and has chaired the Audit Committee of several other PLCs.
Objective The Committees objective is to provide effective governance over the Groups financial reporting, including the adequacy of related disclosures, the management and oversight of the Groups systems of internal control, financial risks and the performance of internal audit and the appointment and performance of the external auditor.
Role and responsibilities The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose main role is to encourage and safeguard the highest standards of integrity, financial reporting, financial risk management and internal controls.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in its Terms of Reference, which include all matters required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Code, and are available on the Groups website.
These responsibilities include: reviewing the form and content of the interim and year-end accounts and results announcements: reporting to the Board on the appropriateness of the Groups accounting policies and practices and significant areas of judgement: advising the Board on whether the Committee believes that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups strategy, business model and performance: reviewing risk management and internal controls: overseeing the relationship with the external auditor: and assessing the performance and reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of internal audit.
Committee meetings The Audit Committee met four times during 2014 and in February 2015 and all members attended all meetings that they were eligible to attend.
The Committee Chairman also invited the Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller and Group Head of Risk who is responsible for internal audit to attend all meetings.
Other executives from the Group were also invited, as appropriate, to attend certain meetings to provide a deeper level of insight into key issues.
The Committee Chairman also invited the external auditor, Deloitte LLP Deloitte, to every meeting.
Mr Biles also held preparatory meetings separately with Deloitte and the Group Head of Risk prior to most Committee meetings to review their reports and discuss issues in detail.
The external auditor met with the Audit Committee without the executives present.
Main activities of the Committee during the year As part of the process of working with the Board to carry out its responsibilities and to maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee generally take place just prior to Board Meetings.
At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following main areas.
Financial reporting The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting has been to review with management and the external auditor the appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters: the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices: the application and impact of significant judgements or matters where there was significant discussion with the external auditor: the clarity of disclosures and compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards: and whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups strategy, business model and performance.
Reports from management were considered on significant matters, including in respect of litigation, treasury and tax matters and also reports from the external auditor on the outcome of their work.
The Committee challenged both management and Deloitte to ensure that the scope of the audit was appropriate and that Deloitte had applied the necessary level of professional scepticism in their work.

The Committee challenged the assumptions, particularly the discount rate and growth factors, used in the discounted cash flow calculations for each cash generating unit, the sensitivity analysis applied and the projected future cash flows used to support the carrying values of the goodwill and intangibles and tangible assets.
Details of the sensitivity analysis applied to key assumptions used in the impairment review are set out in note 10 to the Financial Statements on page 91.
The Committee has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2014.
Restructuring, reorganisation and environmental provisions.
The Committee received reports, including from professional advisers, and challenged the basis and completeness of the assumptions used to calculate the provisions and the appropriateness of disclosures in the Annual Report.
The Committee discussed with management the key judgements behind all provisions, taking note of the range of possible outcomes, and agreed with their recommendations.
A number of judgements are involved in calculating tax provisions and the level of deferred tax assets to be recognised.
The Committee reviewed the associated risks and challenged managements assessment concerning the Groups key tax risks, noting the work of the OECD in respect of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS, and managements forecast of the future taxable profits of the relevant businesses.
The Committee challenged the validity of the going concern assumption used in the preparation of the Annual Report, in particular considering the Groups forecast for profits and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and covenant compliance.
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand the impact of changes to all key variables.
Management took external professional advice in determining pension liabilities.
The Committee challenged the assumptions used, particularly in respect of inflation, the discount rate and life expectancy, by considering current norms and the sensitivity of the reported liability to changes in the assumptions.
Risk management The Committee reviewed a report at each meeting from the Group Head of Risk who has primary responsibility for developing the Groups risk management framework.
The Committee reviewed changes to the principal risks and mitigating actions identified by management.
The Committee also received quarterly reports to the Open Door Line an external independent service where employees may report matters of concern and assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk.
Internal control At each meeting the committee considered and challenged reports from the internal auditors on the effectiveness of internal controls and requested certain changes to those controls.
The Committee also performed an annual review of the Groups internal control processes and considers the system to be effective and in accordance with Internal Controls Guidance for Directors in the Combined Code the Turnbull Guidance.
Internal audit The internal audit plan for 2015 was presented to the Committee in December 2014 and accepted following discussions and challenge as to the scope and areas of focus.
At each meeting the Group Head of Risk presented a report to the Committee on the status of internal audit plans for the current year, points arising from audits completed and follow up action plans to address areas of weakness.
The status of these actions is monitored closely by the Committee until they are completed.
The Committee also received reports on actual or suspected frauds and thefts by third parties and employees.
None had any material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and procedures were altered to minimise the risk of recurrence.
External audit At the April and December meetings the external auditor presented their audit plans for the interim review and year end audit respectively.
The Committee considered and challenged both the scope and materiality to be applied to the Group audit and its components.
In 2014 the Committee considered carefully the scope in respect of smaller and more remote locations and noted that all local audits are undertaken by Deloitte.
Cyber risk The members of the Committee completed the cyber risk questionnaire produced by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Committee was further briefed on this important area by specialists from Deloitte.
A cyber security improvement plan was proposed by and agreed with the Chief Information Officer.
The points identified are being progressively implemented, with the most important matters having been concluded during 2014.
Training Updates were presented to the Committee on new accounting developments and any changes in corporate governance requirements that may affect the Group.
Committee members also attended training briefings by accounting firms and other advisers.
48 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2014 23846.02 9 March 2015 12:35 PM Proof 2 Overview The Committee examined the 2014 Annual Report and was specifically tasked by the Board to advise it on whether the 2014 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.
The Committee did this by satisfying itself that there was a robust process of review and challenge to ensure balance and consistency.
In doing so the Committee examined these processes, which included the allocation of responsibility for the preparation of certain sections of the Annual Report to individuals in the head office team and a second person taking responsibility for the review process of each section of the Annual Report.
Additional reviews were carried out by internal and external personnel including an independent legal review.
The Committee also reviewed the Annual Report.
Taken as a whole, in the light of their knowledge of the Group and its performance, the outcome of the activities described above and based on robust discussion with both management and the external auditor, the Committee has concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups strategy, business model, position and performance, and reported to the Board accordingly.
External audit Appointment The Committee considers the re-appointment of the external auditor each year and as part of this process considers the independence of the auditor and the effectiveness of the external audit process.
Having reviewed the performance of Deloitte in 2014, the Committee has decided to recommend to the Board that Deloitte be reappointed for the 2015 audit and a resolution to this effect will be put to the 2015 AGM.
The Committee reviewed and agreed the fee for 2014.
The external auditor is required to change the lead partner every five years and other partners periodically in order to protect independence and objectivity and provide fresh challenge to the Group.
The current lead partner, Mrs N. Mitchell, has been in place for five years and will be replaced by another Deloitte lead partner in 2015.
Deloitte has been the Groups auditor for 13 years and in 2013 the Committee had decided that the audit would be put out to tender in 2014 to coincide with the end of the lead audit partners five year tenure.
However, as the Competition & Markets Authority has now issued its final form order clarifying transitional provisions and modifying requirements, and in view of the changeover of the Chairman of the Audit Committee, it has been decided to delay the tender process until after the new Chairman is appointed.
Independence The independence of the external auditor has been confirmed by Deloitte every half year and was last confirmed in February 2015.
The Committee considered Deloittes presentation and confirmed that it considered the auditor to be independent.
Effectiveness of the external audit process The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit quality which includes the following aspects: assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and the audit team: audit approach and scope, including identification of risk areas: execution of the audit: interaction with management: communication with and support to the audit committee: insights, management letter points, added value and reports: and independence, objectivity and scepticism.
An assessment questionnaire has been completed by each member of the Committee, by the Group Finance Director and other senior finance executives.
The feedback from the process is considered by the Audit Committee and provided to the external auditor and management.
The full formal questionnaire is completed every three years with key areas being completed every year.
As the full formal questionnaire was completed in 2013, only key areas were completed for this year.
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of management in the external audit process by considering timely identification and resolution of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements and other documents provided for review by the external auditor and the Committee.
The Committee considered the FRC Audit Quality Review Team report on Deloitte LLP dated May 2014.
If the audit is selected for quality review, the Committee understands that any resulting reports will be sent to the Committee by the FRC.
After considering the above matters the Committee felt that the external audit had been effective.
Non-audit services The external auditor may be invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed to undertake the work.
However, no contracts in excess of 20,000 can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the Chairman of the Committee or, in his absence, another member of the Committee.
Non-audit fees paid to the auditor are shown in note 3 on page 88 and amounted to 6% of the audit fee.
com 23846.02 9 March 2015 12:35 PM Proof 2 Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Report of the Audit Committee continued Internal audit The internal audit programme is managed by the Group Head of Risk and provides independent assurance over the key financial processes and controls in operation across the Group.
The Group has engaged Ernst & Young LLP Ernst & Young since 2012 to provide certain internal audit services.
The Committee reviewed and approved the annual internal audit plan before the start of the financial year and considered it appropriate to retain Ernst & Young as an internal audit service provider.
The plan takes account of the Groups strategic objectives and risks and provides the degree of coverage deemed appropriate by the Committee.
Since the beginning of 2013, additional assurance has been obtained through control self-assessment.
Internal auditors have received selfcertification from every plant and shared service centre that internal controls have been complied with and noting any non-compliance.
A summary of results is presented to the Committee.
The accuracy of returns is monitored by Internal Audit by verification visits to a random sample of sites.
In 2014 Ernst & Young attended one Committee meeting to give the members of the Committee an opportunity to hear first-hand from them about their work.
The effectiveness of internal audit is reviewed and discussed annually with the Group Head of Risk and the Ernst & Young engagement partner.
In 2014 internal audit was assessed as effective.
Committee evaluation The Committees activities formed part of the review of Board effectiveness which was undertaken internally this year.
Based on this and as a result of the work done during the year, the Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and carried out its responsibilities effectively.
