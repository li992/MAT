Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia Chairman of the Committee, Julian Schild and Charles Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code provision B.
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include: making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new non-executive and executive directors, including making recommendations as to the composition of the Board generally and the balance between executive and non-executive directors: giving consideration to succession planning for directors and other senior executives: reviewing on an annual basis the time required from non-executive directors and assessing whether the non-executive directors are spending enough time to fulfil their duties: reviewing the re-election by shareholders of directors under the annual re-election provisions of the Code: and evaluating any matters relating to the continuation in office of any director including the suspension or termination of service of an executive director.
Although no new directors were appointed to the Board during the year, other Committee matters were periodically discussed as part of full Board meetings.
These discussions principally concerned the appropriateness of the composition of the Board in the light of the Companys existing operations and medium-term strategic objectives, and succession planning for directors and senior management.
No changes to the Board were deemed necessary during the year although consistent with the requirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Committee has been tasked with developing a firm plan for independent non-executive director succession over the coming year, to reflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006.
The Committees position in relation to diversity and the Code requirement to specify measurable objectives in this regard is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 39 of this document.
