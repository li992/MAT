Dignity plc 38 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Directors statement on corporate governance How the Board Functions The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors that meets regularly throughout the year.
The Board has adopted a formal Schedule of Matters Reserved to it which was reviewed, updated and readopted during 2014.
The structure of the Board, together with explanations of responsibilities is shown on page 35.
Informal meetings are held between individual Directors as required.
The management of the Group on a day to day basis is delegated, via the Executive Directors, to an experienced senior and middle management team whose size and structure is commensurate with the complexity of the Groups activities.
Managers have the necessary skills and knowledge relevant to their areas of responsibility.
The remainder of the responsibilities rest with the Board however, certain capital expenditures and acquisition projects are delegated under the formally adopted Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board and the Expenditure Authorisation Policy.
All Directors are provided with the necessary papers in advance of the meetings to permit them to make informed decisions at those meetings.
The Board also considers employee issues and key appointments, including the role of Company Secretary.
The Board comprises eight Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman.
There are the same number of independent Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors which the Board consider to be an appropriate and effective combination and also complies with the Code in respect of FTSE 250 listed companies.
The Board also considers that four Executive Directors are sufficient to manage a Company of this size and organisational structure.
The four independent Non-Executive Directors who served for the period were: Jane Ashcroft, Ishbel Macpherson, Alan McWalter and Martin Pexton.
Biographical details for the Non-Executive Directors appear on page 37.
Their role is to challenge constructively the management of the Group and help develop proposals on strategy.
The Non-Executive Directors are chosen for their diversity of skills and experience.
Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for a fixed term of two years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
This term may then be renewed by mutual consent up to a maximum of nine years in accordance with the Code.
Appointments beyond six years are also subject to rigorous review prior to approval.
The Non-Executive letters of appointment are available from the Company Secretary.
Alan McWalter is the Senior Independent Director of the Group.
His role is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and act as an intermediary for other Directors if needed and to be available to shareholders if so required.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are required to, and have, confirmed formally to the Board that, mindful of their other commitments they have, and will have, sufficient time to devote to their responsibilities as Directors of the Company.
Jane Ashcroft, Ishbel Macpherson, Alan McWalter, and Martin Pexton are independent of management, as defined by the Code.
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice on the furtherance of their duties if necessary at the Groups expense.
They also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director and, where it is considered appropriate and necessary, training is made available to Directors.
All Directors receive annual training and updates on the duties and responsibilities of being a Director of a listed company.
This covers legal, accounting and tax matters as required.
In addition any newly appointed director receives appropriate induction training.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of any legal action against its Directors including in respect of prospectuses issued in connection with the issue of additional Secured Notes and Returns of Value to Shareholders.
The level of cover is currently 70 million.
The Directors have, during the period, formally reminded themselves of their duties as Directors under the Companies Act 2006 Section 171-177.
These duties include the need to avoid conflicts of interest Section 175.
No such conflicts of interest exist.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors will submit themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Board Appraisal In accordance with the requirements of the Code an external evaluation of the Board and its Committees was completed in 2013 by Independent Audit Ltd, a specialist company, entirely independent of the Group.
The next external evaluation will be completed in 2016, in accordance with the requirements of the Code that an external evaluation takes place on at least a three yearly basis.
An action plan was developed and implemented to address the points identified, which relate to minor administrative matters.
During the period, the Board undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and Directors by way of the issue of a detailed questionnaire to all Directors.
This was then followed by a detailed review of the responses, by the Directors, and identification of any actions arising.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman taking in to account the views of the other Executive Directors.
The Board was satisfied that its performance and that of its Chairman, individual Directors and Committees was of the appropriate standard.
Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements Other Information Governance Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 39 Board and Board Committee Attendance Those attending and the frequency of Board and Committee meetings held during the year was as follows: Audit Remuneration Nomination i Main Board Committee Committee Committee Number of meetings 8 4 4 3 Jane Ashcroft 8 4 4 3 ii Andrew Davies 8 4 ii ii Peter Hindley 8 4 4 3 ii ii ii Mike McCollum 8 4 3 2 Alan McWalter 8 4 4 3 iv Ishbel Macpherson 7 4 4 3 Martin Pexton 8 4 4 3 iv iii iii iii Richard Portman 7 4 3 2 ii Steve Whittern 8 4 i Only full Board meetings, of which there are seven per annum, have been included in the attendance analysis together with one further meeting that was convened to deal with the Return of Value to shareholders.
17 further meetings were held with a quorum of Directors to approve announcements, documents or the issue of shares under the LTIP and SAYE schemes and technical aspects of the Return of Value to shareholders.
ii In attendance by invitation of the respective Committee.
iii Richard Portman attended certain Committee meetings in his capacity as Company Secretary.
iv Richard Portman was unable to attend one Board meeting because of a long standing family commitment and Ishbel Macpherson was unable to attend one procedural meeting relating to the issue of the New Notes and Return of Value called at short notice at a time when she had a previous commitment.
The Board has increased the number of regular full Board meetings by one to seven per annum spread broadly equally across the year.
After careful consideration it was decided that this is the appropriate number required to exercise effective governance and control.
Further meetings are arranged if required.
When Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are advised of the matters to be discussed and given an opportunity to make their views known to the Chairman prior to the meeting.
A process exists whereby such views will be included in the minutes of the meeting if necessary.
Three meetings between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors being present were held during 2014.
These are usually scheduled to occur before full Board meetings.
The Company Secretary The Company Secretary, Richard Portman, is responsible for overseeing the preparation and distribution of all agendas, minutes and related Board and Committee papers.
As Corporate Services Director, he attends the Board meetings in his capacity as a Director of the Company but as Company Secretary provides corporate governance advice and ensures all procedures are followed at those meetings, if required.
The minutes of the meeting are taken by an experienced Administrator from the Corporate Services function.
Richard Portman also attends the Committee meetings when requested to do so by the Chairman of that Committee to provide corporate governance advice as Company Secretary with the minutes being taken by the Administrator.
The Board is happy that the role of Company Secretary is undertaken by the Corporate Service Director as, whilst traditionally it might be considered more appropriate to have the roles separate, the Board believes in Dignitys case it is the most cost effective and sensible way of filling the role particularly given the skills and knowledge of the Corporate Services Director.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Internal Control and Risk Management The Board recognises it is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and risk management, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
A formal ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group was in place for the period and in place up to the date the Governance Report was signed and approved for the Annual Report and Accounts 2014.
This process was in place at the date of approval of the Annual Report and is in accordance with the Code.
Internal controls are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Internal Audit completes a programme of work each year that provides assurance that the internal controls have been tested and also proposes improvements where appropriate and necessary.
Coupled with this, the six monthly review of the Risk Register provides a further formal review mechanism for considering and reviewing internal controls.
All such work is reported to and monitored by the Audit Committee who recommends approval to the full Board and is discussed in the Audit Committee Report on pages 42 to 44.
Dignity plc 40 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Directors statement on corporate governance continued The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board has formally reviewed during the year and continues to keep under review the effectiveness of the Groups systems of internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
The Audit Committee reviews risk management annually and receives reports from executive management regarding weaknesses in internal control, any losses arising out of weaknesses in internal control and progress in implementing revised procedures to improve and enhance internal control.
There have been no reports of system weaknesses that have resulted or would have resulted in a material misstatement or loss.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the period, are as follows: Financial reporting The Group has a comprehensive system of internal budgeting and forecasting.
The Groups monthly actual results analysed by operating division are reported to the Board and significant variances to budget are investigated with revised forecasts prepared as necessary.
Operational management receives comprehensive management accounts covering their areas of responsibility, which forms the basis for the consolidated accounts: Financial controls The Executive Directors have defined appropriate and necessary financial controls and procedures to be employed by operational management.
Key controls over major business risks include reviews against budgets and forecasts, review against key performance indicators and exception reporting: Quality and integrity of personnel One of the Groups core values is integrity.
This is regarded as vital to the maintenance of the Groups system of internal financial control.
The Directors have put in place an organisational structure appropriate to the size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority where the Board considers it necessary and appropriate: Internal audit The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Audit Committee and the Chief Executive.
It coordinates the completion of self-assessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control weakness or exposure.
Internal audit reviews are completed on such areas, together with selected areas of the head office function and any area where a Director or the Audit Committee requests such a review.
During 2014, as in previous years, there were quarterly meetings between the Head of Internal Audit and the Executive Directors to review formally and discuss Internal Audits work programme and findings.
There were also one to one meetings between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Head of Internal Audit.
In addition, regular meetings between Internal Audit and the external auditors,  LLP and subsequently Ernst & Young LLP, were held during the year to discuss and plan audit work and to ensure a complementary approach.
The Head of Internal Audit provides reports to the Audit Committee at every meeting: Procedures The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its operations, both client facing and in support departments.
These provide clear guidance on the correct or most appropriate course of action in various circumstances.
Procedures are supplemented by training, where needs have been identified.
Both Internal Audit and a comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such processes and procedures: and Risk assessment Management has responsibility for the identification and evaluation of significant risks that might arise in their area of responsibility, together with the design of suitable internal controls.
This was in place throughout the accounting period and at the date of approval of the Annual Report.
The Executive Directors and the wider management team regularly assess the risks.
A Risk Register is maintained, which is formally presented to and reviewed by the Audit Committee twice a year.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, which are documented in the Risk Register, are discussed on pages 27 and 28 of the Annual Report.
These procedures are designed to, amongst other things, help to provide assurance around the process of preparing consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting system.
An explanation of how the Group aims to create and preserve value and the strategy for delivering its objectives is included in the Operating review on pages 16 to 21.
Relationship with Shareholders The Group encourages two-way communication with both its institutional and private shareholders and responds promptly to any queries received.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director have regular meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and analysts to discuss information made public by the Group.
Where appropriate or if requested, such meetings could include either or both the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and the Non-Executive Directors are also available to meet separately with shareholders if necessary or requested to discuss any issues that they may have.
The Chairman is also available to discuss governance and strategy matters with the major shareholders.

The Directors consider that this Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups performance, business model, risks and strategy.
In order to assess whether the Annual Report and Accounts were fair balanced and understandable, the Board received an early draft to enable time for review and comment.
The Board then met to consider the criteria for a fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report and to review the process underpinning the compilation and assurance of the report, in relation to financial and non-financial management information.
As part of that meeting the Board considered the Annual Report and Accounts as a whole and discussed the tone, balance and language of the document, being mindful of the UK reporting requirements and consistency between narrative sections and the financial statements.
