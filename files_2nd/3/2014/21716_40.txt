Risk Committee Report MEMBERSHIP The Risk Committee was established in April 2014 and comprises Paul Meader Chairman, Richard Crowder, John Le Prevost and Andrew Dodd.
Steve Le Page, as the remaining director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, has right of attendance and has attended all the meetings of the Committee since his appointment.
COMMITTEE OVERVIEW The Committees primary focus is around investment risk in its broadest sense, including elements such as counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Committees work has focused on two levels: 1 the direct exposures of the Company itself, for instance to AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and cash counterparts: and 2 the exposures embedded within AllBlue, its investment characteristics and the risks associated with owning AllBlue During 2014 preparatory meetings took place to seek to define the scope and mandate of the Risk Committee's operations, reviewing key documentation, developing key reporting and interacting with BlueCrest and JTC to examine and understand the risks that the Company is exposed to at both levels.
Subsequently, the Committee then met formally in Q4 2014 and will, henceforth, meet regularly.
The work of the Committee revolves primarily around: Market risk: Credit risk: Counterparty risk: Interest rate risk: Liquidity risk: and Leverage risk: ENGAGEMENT WITH BCML Clearly, the purpose of identifying risks is to seek to understand which can be managed and mitigated and which cannot.
The nature of the Companys structure is that it does not have a direct contractual relationship with BlueCrest as investment manager of AllBlue.
This has always been the case.
The process with BlueCrest, therefore, is one of constructive engagement on both sides the Company challenging and probing on behalf of Shareholders because AllBlue is the majority investment of the Company, and BlueCrest because the Company is the largest, and a material, investor in AllBlue.
38 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Risk Committee Report The Risk Committee has continued with this process.
I am pleased to report that this has been successful and that BlueCrest are highly responsive and transparent with the Company.
We receive detailed reporting from BlueCrest regarding AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged.
We also receive reporting from GlobeOp, the administrator of AllBlue, which provides additional information and assists with the validation of the BlueCrest reporting.
ALLBLUE AND UNDERLYING FUNDS During the year we have examined and monitored the absolute and relative investment risk exposures of AllBlue including the degree of embedded diversification.
In June 2014 BlueCrest Equity Strategies Fund BESF was introduced as a seventh fund into AllBlue and work was undertaken by the Committee to understand the return characteristics of BESF, including correlations to other funds most particularly to BlueCrest Quantitative Equity Fund BlueMatrix and to the broader equity and credit markets.
We are satisfied that, to date and based on the characteristics of BESF prior to its inclusion within AllBlue, there has been no appreciable reduction in diversification or increase in equity linkage in the returns of AllBlue.
The work of the Committee has been to look both at individual underlying fund characteristics and also at the effect of aggregating portfolio exposures.
The Committee places a particular emphasis on the evolution of trends and I am pleased to be able to report that, whilst there is inevitably some degree of statistical variability, there appears to be a well established pattern that the seven funds demonstrate no statistically significant correlation with each other.
AllBlues and the Companys performance is also reviewed against the market opportunity set and against peers.
The Committees work also extends to the aggregation of various exposures at the Company level.
JTC provide reporting on a large number of aggregated, Company-level risk metrics which the Risk Committee monitors and their reporting also enables the Risk Committee to validate some of BlueCrests data.
EXPOSURE MONITORING As explained elsewhere, as well as owning shares in AllBlue, the Company maintains a cash balance and exposure to AllBlue Leveraged.
This facilitates, amongst other things, the Companys repurchase of Shares in the market but brings a number of additional risks.
In particular, there is a risk that the buyback of Shares will cause the Companys economic exposure to AllBlue to vary from its objective of 1:1 over time.
This exposure is reset as frequently as possible monthly subscriptions and quarterly 39 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Risk Committee Report redemptions, with notice.
During the year, the economic exposure of the Sterling Shares to AllBlue varied between 100.73% and 104.90%.
The Company periodically has a material cash balance and this brings additional counterparty and credit risks to the Company over and above those that would exist if the Company solely invested in AllBlue.
Accordingly, the Risk Committee recently developed a Treasury Policy for the Company which has been considered and adopted by the Board subsequent to the balance sheet date.
This should ensure greater risk spreading of the Companys cash than previously existed.
RISK MATRIX Finally, the Risk Committee undertook a root and branch review of the Companys risk matrix and its implementation.
This included a focus on the key controls surrounding the principal pre-control risks faced by the Company and the principal post-control risks that the Company continues to face.
The resulting revised risk matrix has been approved by the Board.
This should facilitate a greater focus henceforth on those key risk controls and the material post control risks.
CONCLUSION I believe that the introduction of a Risk Committee has brought a sharper focus to the Companys identification, assessment, monitoring and management of risks.
Inevitably this is a work in progress and during the first half of 2015, the Committee will seek to evaluate its progress to date and, I hope, further enhance its processes and assessments.
In addition, with the spin-off of Systematica Investments in January 2015, we have subsequently assessed the changes that this has brought, including a meeting with Systematica personnel.
