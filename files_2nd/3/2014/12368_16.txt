The principal assumptions used for the estimation of environmental obligations were as follows: Starting from March 2014, sanctions have been imposed in several packages by the US and the EU on certain Russian officials, businessmen and companies.
International credit agencies downgraded Russias long-term foreign currency sovereign rating with a negative outlook.
In December 2014, 2014 2013 the Central Bank of the Russian Federation significantly increased its key interest rate, which resulted in higher interest rates on domestic borrowings.

These developments may result in the reduced access of the Russian businesses Inflation rates 4.10%-11.8% 4.12%-5.77% to international capital and export markets, capital flight, further weakening of the Rouble and other negative economic consequences.
