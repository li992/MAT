Calculation of recoverable amount Trade and other receivables In accordance with accounting standards the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts considered by to sell.
To assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount management to be uncollectible.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost rate.
The Group uses a multiple of EBITDA to estimate fair value.
This multiple is based on the Groups average market capitalisation less impairment losses.

The Groups internally approved five year business plans are used as the basis for these calculations, with cash flows beyond the five year business plan horizon then extrapolated using a long term growth rate.

At 27 December 2014 if the estimated EBITDA levels used in the value in use calculations had been 1% lower or the discount rate used been 0.1% higher Between 30 and 60 days overdue 1 2 no impairment charges would have arisen.
Over 60 days overdue 1 - 16 12 Projecting future growth involves a degree of judgement and uncertainty.
The Group operates in geographically and politically diverse areas and although the Group has attained knowledge from the past performance of opening new attractions, inevitably the performance of new attractions, particularly in new markets, can be difficult to accurately predict.
Similarly, the exposure of certain attractions to macro-economic volatility can give rise to uncertainties in these projections.
No impairment losses were recorded in 2014 or 2013.
The Directors consider that no reasonably foreseeable change in any of the above key assumptions, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used, would significantly alter the outcome of the Groups impairment testing.

They are established on inception and discounted back to present value with the discount then being unwound through the income statement as part of finance costs.
They are reviewed at least annually.
Other Other provisions largely relate to the estimated cost arising from open insurance claims, tax matters and legal issues.
As a result of changes in circumstances during the year, certain provisions were reclassified from current to non-current.
There are no anticipated future events that would be expected to cause a material change in the timing or amount of outflows associated with the provisions.

The Group assesses whether the terms of the borrowings provide a clear commercial incentive or a contractual commitment to repay them over a specific period that is shorter than the contractual life of the facility, or if the Groups current plans or forecasts suggest an early repayment or refinancing is probable.
If this is the case the Group will adopt that as the period used for the In 2013 the Group entered into an amendment of its existing bank facility that extended the contractual date of repayment from July purposes of the effective interest rate calculations.
If neither of these conditions exists the Group calculates its effective interest rate and 2017 to July 2019.
The Group accounted for this amendment on a continuation basis, reflecting managements judgement that this hence amortises transaction costs based on the contractual term of the facility.
If the Group determines that a different date should was a non-substantive change to the existing facility.
The terms of the Groups borrowings provided no clear commercial incentive or be adopted for the purposes of the effective interest rate calculations, the resulting adjustment is recognised as a gain or loss on contractual commitment to repay them over a specific period that was shorter than the contractual life of the facility.

If the Group modifies its debt arrangements, it considers how substantive the change is in determining the appropriate accounting.
The Group determined at 27 December 2014 that a more reliable estimate could be formed of the likelihood and timeframe for an This includes both qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis of the level of change in the cash flows of the new and old arrangements.
This was determined following reviews undertaken by management and external advisors of refinancing options.
As a result the Group has accelerated the amortisation of financing costs and the resulting adjustment has been recognised as a loss on re-measurement and separately presented in the income statement as an exceptional charge of 23 million see note 2.2.
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has secured a new banking facility that, once drawn, will replace the existing debt facilities see note 6.7.
The existing loans are secured by fixed charges over the shares in certain Group companies and certain intra-group receivables.
The nominal interest rate for secured bank loans in the table above represents the floating interest rate, including applicable margin, which prevailed at the reporting date.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure and these are described in note 5.4.
