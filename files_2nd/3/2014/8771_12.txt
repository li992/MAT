The Board and JAB Luxury are mindful ofthe need to consider the interests of the Companys new minority shareholders.
The Board believes that the Board and its Committees, with the addition of the new independent Non-Executive Directors will provide the appropriate corporate governance balance in light of the interests of both the majority shareholder and the new minority shareholders.
The Audit and Risk Committee consists solely of independent Non-Executive Directors and the Board has also established a Conflicts Committee to help manage the relationship between the Company and its majority shareholder.
Further details ofthese measures are contained within this report.
Under the Relationship Agreement between JAB Luxury and the Company, JAB Luxury is able to appoint up to one half of the Board while it continues to own 50% or more of the Companys Shares.
Further details of the Relationship Agreement can be found on page 51.
The Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards in place in the structures and processes implemented to consider and protect the interests of independent shareholders.
The Company does have a number of areas in which it does not fully follow the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
These are that at least half ofthe Board of Directors of a UK-listed company, excluding the Chairman, does not comprise Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Board has established a joint Remuneration and Nomination Committee, rather than separate Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which is not made up solely of independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board believes that these departures from the Code are reasonable in the circumstances of JimmyChoos ownership.
Since the Company only recently listed, it is not practicable to expect full compliance with the rest of the provisions of the Code.
Accordingly, this report includes a description of how the Company has applied the principles of the Code since 22 October 2014 and how it intends to apply those principles throughout 2015 PETER HARF CH AIRM A N 18 March 2015 JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 GOV ERN A NCE 48 JIMMYCHOO LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS Ensuring maintenance of effective systems of internal control THE BOARD STRUCTURE andrisk management The structure and business of the Board is designed to ensure that Reviewing these systems of control and risk management the Board focuses its time and energy on providing entrepreneurial BOARD MEMBERSHIP leadership to the Group, setting strategy and monitoring performance, and ensuring that the necessary financial and human Changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board resources are in place to enable the Company to meet its objectives.
