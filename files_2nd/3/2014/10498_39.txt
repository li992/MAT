Governance 82 Corporate governance continued Internal control The Groups system of internal control, embedded in all key operations, is designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the Groups business objectives will be achieved, within risk tolerance levels defined by the Boards.
Regular management reporting provides a balanced assessment of key risks and controls and is an important component of the Boards assurance.
Full details of Mondis risk management framework and most significant risks can be found in the Strategic report on pages 30 to 33.
Key elements of the Groups system of internal control are: a simple and focused business strategy: a clearly-defined organisation structure with established and reasonable division of responsibilities: Group financial, business conduct, operating and administrative policies and procedures which incorporate statements of required behaviour: annual risk-profiling by local businesses and the Group to identify, monitor and manage significant risks, with the results discussed at business reviews and internal control, audit and risk meetings: a continuous review of operating performance: a comprehensive reporting system, including monthly results, annual budgets and periodic forecasts, monitored by the executive committee and Boards: approval by the Boards of all major investments, with proposals being subject to rigorous strategic and commercial examination: a centrally coordinated internal audit programme, using internal and external resources to support the Boards in ensuring a sound control environment: completion by business unit management of a six-monthly internal control assessment, confirming compliance with Group policies and procedures, listing any weaknesses: and assurance activities covering the key business risks summarised and reported annually to the Boards, the audit committee and the sustainable development committee.
Speakout The Group has a confidential reporting hotline called Speakout operated by an independent third party.
Speakout, monitored by the audit committee, enables employees, customers, suppliers, managers or other stakeholders, on a confidential basis, to raise concerns about conduct that is considered to be contrary to Mondis values.
It makes communication channels available to any person in the world who has information about unethical practice in the Groups operations.
During 2014, 129 2013: 79 Speakout messages were received covering a number of areas.
