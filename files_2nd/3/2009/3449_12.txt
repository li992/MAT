The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Committee and the meetings were attended by invitation by the Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Risk Manager and other senior finance staff.
The external auditors also attended the Committee meetings.
During the year, the Committee met once with the auditors without executive managers being present.
It also held a private meeting with the Group Risk Manager.
In addition, the Committee Chairman met regularly with the Group Risk Manager to review matters arising from his site visit reports and with the external auditors.
Attendance at meetings by the Committee members was as set out in the corporate governance report on page 35.
ACTIVITIES The meeting that took place in May 2008 was principally concerned with the draft financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2008 together with the draft preliminary results announcement.
The Audit Committee also considered the report of the external auditors on the full-year audit, concentrating on issues of judgement and audit focus identied in the audit plan, including a review of valuation assumptions, impairment reviews and disclosures in the annual report.
The steps taken to ensure that all relevant audit information had been disclosed to the auditors were reviewed, enabling the directors to make the statement in the directors report on page 34.
In addition, the Committee was updated on internal control and risk management issues, in accordance with normal procedure.
At the October meeting, in addition to an update on internal control and risk management issues, the Committee considered the draft interim financial statements for the period ending 30 September 2008, together with the draft interim results announcement.
In addition the audit scope and fee proposal for 2008 2009 and audit expectations were reviewed and approved.
The meeting in February 2009 was concerned primarily with the review of the risk management process including the activities of the Risk Committee, the outcome from risk control visits and the agreement of the Group Risk Managers visit plan for the forthcoming year.
The external audit plan for 2008 2009 was also considered and approved, and the external auditors reported on the structure in place to ensure their independence.
The insurance arrangements for 2008 2009 were also considered.
ANNUAL REPORT 2009 39 Section 3: Governance AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE During the year, the Committee reviewed its performance through the process described in the corporate governance report on page 37.
The Committee considered it had the skills to perform its responsibilities, particularly through Mr Traceys financial and audit experience.
Actions for improvement focused on training requirements and adding resource to the Group Risk Management function to ensure that the scope of activity could be maintained throughout the year.
AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process following the 2007 2008 audit, and shared its findings with the auditors.
The Committee considered that in addition to a high level of technical competence and objectivity, the auditors demonstrated a clear understanding of the business and communicated the issues of judgement and focus effectively to the Committee.
Based on the Committees view of the performance of the external auditors and on the planning and execution of the 2008 2009 audit, the Committee has recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Company has a policy for determining the types of non-audit work for which it is appropriate to use the external auditors, including a clearance procedure for fees.
The Committee is satisfied that these procedures have been followed during the year, and that the external auditors have in place robust procedures, including the rotation of audit staff and partners, to ensure their independence, preserve objectivity and comply with regulatory and professional requirements.
The Committee has also reviewed the performance of the external auditors with the help of questionnaires completed by all of the directors and relevant senior management members.
As stated in note 5 to the financial statements, audit fees of 397,000 were payable to Deloitte together with non-audit fees of 28,000 relating to taxation advice and interim review procedures.
The Audit Committee considers that this balance is appropriate and does not constitute a threat to the auditors independence.
This report was approved by the Board on 1 June 2009 and signed on its behalf by ERIC TRACEY CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 40 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
