BUSINESS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT The Board has complied with the revised Combined Code produced by the Committee on Corporate Governance except where detailed below and has applied the principles of good governance in the following ways: THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board meets regularly to review the progress of the Company and to discuss the measures required for its future development.
Directors are provided in advance with a formal schedule of matters to be discussed at each meeting, and with the information needed to monitor the progress of the Company.
Records of meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained by the Company Secretary and are approved by the Board at the following meeting.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, and if required are able to take independent advice at the Companys expense in the furtherance of their duties.
Any question of the removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
While the members of the Board are all experienced and well qualified, the opportunity to receive further training at the Companys expense is available to them at all times.
Mr Houghton attended training to assist him in the role of Company Secretary.
An internal evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole, of its Committees and of the individual directors during the course of the year has been carried out in accordance with section A.
6 of the Combined Code, which concluded that all were operating effectively.
This included an appraisal of the Chairman, although no separate meeting took place to appraise his performance.
The Chairman informally discusses issues with other non-executive directors periodically as required.

The non-executive directors have wide experience and a variety of skills.

23 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED SUPPLY OF INFORMATION Information is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in advance of meetings.
When the Board requests additional information it is provided.
RE-ELECTION One third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION The Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility it is to ensure that the remuneration of directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the quality required.
The Remuneration Committee was comprised of three non-executive directors, namely Keith Stella Chairman of the Committee, Peter Nutting and Michael Pavia.
The revised Combined Code provision B.
2.1 states that the Committee should only comprise independent non-executive directors and does not define Mr Nutting as independent.
However, the Board considers that Mr. Nutting makes a valuable contribution to the Remuneration Committee due to his considerable business experience.
The directors remuneration report, giving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 26 to 30.
AUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDITORS The Audit Committee is composed of three non-executive directors, Michael Pavia Chairman of the Committee, Peter Nutting and Keith Stella.
The revised Combined Code provision C. 3.1 states that the Committee should only comprise independent non-executive directors and does not define Mr Nutting as independent.
However, the Board considers that Mr Nuttings financial knowledge and considerable business experience are important to the Audit Committee.
The Committee has written terms of reference which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by the Board.
Among these duties are the review of risk assessment, internal controls, financial reporting and the results of the audit, the appointment of external auditors and the direction of the auditors to investigate any matters of concern.
In its meetings the Committee receives a report on the risk assessment, the systems of internal control and their effectiveness, and uses the meeting with the auditors as a further means of evaluating these measures.
The auditors have provided certain tax and other services to the Group during the year.
The Committee has reviewed the services provided and considers that auditors objectivity and independence are not compromised and that the auditors are best placed to provide these services.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE The Nomination Committee comprised Michael Pavia Chairman of Committee, Keith Stella and Charles Wigoder, and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the revised Combined Code provision A.
The purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new directors.
The activities of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 31.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS It is the policy of the Group to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them informed about the objectives of the business.
The Board considers that it is appropriate for the Chief Executive to discuss issues with major shareholders.
The Chief Executive feeds back comments from major shareholders to the other directors, in order to ensure that Board members, and in particular non-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors.
Both the Chairman and the Chief Executive have periodic discussions with the Companys Brokers and feed back issues to the Board as appropriate.
24 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS BUSINESS Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
Separate resolutions are proposed for each issue including the adoption of the Report and Accounts, the Directors Remuneration Report and the appointment of auditors.
Proxy votes are counted and the meeting is advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution.
The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees and the remaining non-executive directors are available to answer questions.
Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting.
FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board believes that the report and accounts contained in this document represent a balanced and understandable assessment of the Groups position and prospects.
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for preparing the accounts and the auditors have made a statement in this regard.
INTERNAL CONTROL The board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Group and the principal risks which the Group faces.
Measures have been taken to reduce certain risks and improve control over the assets of the Group.
The Group is fully compliant with the guidance given by the Turnbull Committee.
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and risk management, and has completed the procedures for review and evaluation of internal controls and risk management.
It is, however, recognised that no system can eliminate risk entirely.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and have concluded that the size and nature of the Group do not justify such a function at present.
GOING CONCERN The directors believe, after making inquiries they consider to be appropriate, that the Group has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
POLICY STATEMENT The Group has been in compliance with the revised Combined Code throughout the year, save as referred to above.
Careful consideration has been given by the Board to the departures from the revised Combined Code.
In all instances, the Board has considered the commercial implications and concluded that the instances of non-compliance were not in any way to the detriment of the Company or its shareholders.
