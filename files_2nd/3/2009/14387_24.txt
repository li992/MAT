59 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Corporate governance statement Compliance with the Combined Code Throughout the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009 the Company has been in full compliance with the June 2008 issue of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code, published by the Financial Reporting Council and available on its website www.
uk, except that the value of any fees received by executive directors in respect of external non-executive directorships is not disclosed in the Directors remuneration report, as this is not considered relevant to the Company.
Directors The Board In reviewing the performance of the Board during the year, the Board determined that the following statement of its role would be used to judge its success: Good corporate governance is about helping to run the Company well.
It involves putting in place an effective internal framework of authority and accountability that promotes success whilst permitting the management of risk to appropriate levels.
It involves the exercise of judgement as to definitions of success and of appropriateness of risk.
The exercise of this judgement is the responsibility of the Board and involves consideration of processes as well as outcomes.
It also involves the creation of a sensitive interface for the views of shareholders and other stakeholders to be given appropriate consideration when reaching these judgements.
The executive is required to provide such information to the Board as it needs to enable it to exercise its judgement over these matters.
There is a very fine distinction between the approval of processes and their definition.
Wherever possible it is the role of the Board to approve process rather than initiate or define it.
Only exceptionally would the Board intervene to initiate or define.
The Board also sets the tone for the Company.
The way in which it conducts itself, its attitude to ethical matters, its definitions of success and appropriate risk all define the atmosphere within which the executive team works.
Good corporate governance is not about adhering to codes of practice although adherence may constitute a part of the evidence of good governance but rather about the exercise of a mindset to do what is right.
Recent changes to the law have, of course, changed some of the associated responsibilities.
One of the challenges facing any Board is the way in which the non-executive and the executive directors interact.
It is clear that they each have the same legal responsibility but it is generally unrealistic to expect executive directors to speak individually on all occasions with the same freedom as the non executive directors.
Equally executive directors who just toe the executive line in contradiction to their own views may not be effectively contributing to good governance.
A well-functioning Board needs to find the right balance between hearing the collective executive view and being aware of the natural internal tensions in an executive team.
One of the consequences of both increasing the watchdog role of the Board, for example setting and examining the pay of executive directors, and this balance between individuality and team behaviour is driving more and more Boards to have fewer and fewer executive directors.
In our circumstances as a holding company for a number of businesses, the reduced Board size works effectively.
In a successful Board, all the members should endeavour to form a team notwithstanding the inherent tensions created by many external expectations, some of which may be wholly or in part unrealistic.
Ideally it should be composed of a group of respected, experienced, likeminded ,  ie those who honestly criticise at times but encourage all the time and who create confidence in all stakeholders in the integrity of the business.
Board meetings should feel like a meeting at which everyone is participating to solve problems together.
Above all, all participants should be able to say after a Board meeting that value has been added as a result of the meeting taking place.
This added value will come in many forms: comfort, advice, clarity, imagination, support, sharing of problems, or creating strategic intent.
The list is not exhaustive.
Board membership is for 365 days of the year.
Responsibilities do not start and end with formal meetings.
Board members, on the Companys and their own initiative, should endeavour to engage outside of meetings to bring their experience to the assistance of the executive team whenever possible.
Above all there should be a sense of value added from the engagement of the Board members in all their interaction with the Company, formal or otherwise.
During the last financial year the membership of the Board was unchanged.
On 1 August 2009 Ms A C Quinn was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Company.
As at 26 September 2009, the Board comprises Mr Brydon Chairman, Mr Bowman Chief Executive, Mr Langston Finance Director and five independent non-executive directors.
Mr Jackson is the senior independent director.
Biographies of these directors, giving details of their experience and other main commitments, are set out on page 51.
The wide-ranging experience and backgrounds of the non-executive directors ensure that they can debate and constructively challenge management in relation to both the development of strategy and the evaluation of performance against the goals set by the Board.
60 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Corporate governance statement continued The Board normally holds formal meetings at least six times a year to make and review major business decisions and monitor current trading against plans which it has approved.
It additionally exercises control by determining matters specifically reserved to it in a formal schedule which only the Board may change: these matters include the acquisition of significant companies, the issue of shares, significant contractual commitments, the review of the effectiveness of risk management processes and major capital expenditure.
Once a year, the Board meets with a particular focus on long-term strategy and developments affecting the Company.
Additional meetings are arranged as necessary to deal with urgent items.
The Board sets the Companys values and standards and has adopted a Code of Business Ethics which is referred to on page 46.
The Chairman meets the non-executive directors without the executive directors present at least three times a year.
The senior independent director meets the other non-executive directors without the Chairman present at least annually.
Directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a directors and officers liability insurance policy.
The following table shows the number of scheduled Board and Board Committee meetings held during the financial year ended 31 July 2009 and .

The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda.
Once agreed by the Board as a whole, it is the Chief Executives responsibility to ensure delivery of the strategic and financial objectives.
Board balance and independence There is a balance of executive and non-executive directors such that no individual or small group can dominate the Boards decision taking.
Throughout the financial year at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, has comprised independent non-executive directors.
In deciding the chairmanship and membership of the Board Committees, the need to refresh membership of the Committees is taken into account.
All the non-executive directors are considered to be independent and Mr Brydon was considered independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman.
Appointments to the Board The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which are made on merit and against objective criteria.
Information and professional development The Board is provided with detailed information several days in advance on matters to be considered at its meetings and non-executive directors have ready access to the executive directors.
Regular site visits are arranged and non-executive directors are encouraged to visit sites independently.
During site visits, briefings are arranged and the Board is free to discuss aspects of the business with employees at all levels.
Newly-appointed directors undergo an induction programme to ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and understanding of the Company and its activities.
They undertake briefing sessions on corporate governance, strategy, stakeholder issues, finance and risk management and HR strategy, as well as meetings and site visits to business locations in the UK and overseas.
Each directors individual experience and background is taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements.
Ongoing training is provided as and when necessary.
The suitability of external courses is kept under review by the Company Secretary who is charged with facilitating the induction of new directors and with assisting in the ongoing training and development of directors.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and a procedure is in place for them to take independent professional advice at the Companys expense should this be required.
61 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Conflicts of interest The new statutory duties for directors relating to conflicts of interest, set out in the Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act, came into force on 1 October 2008.
Under the 2006 Act a director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the companys interests.
The requirement is very broad, and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
The 2006 Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate and where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect, as the Companys Articles do.
The Board has put procedures in place for directors to report any potential or actual conflicts to the other members of the Board for their authorisation where appropriate.
The initial Board-wide review process was completed in September 2008, and repeated in March 2009.
Each directoris awareof therequirement to seekapproval of theBoardforanynew conflictsituations, as they mayarise.
Theprocess of reviewing conflicts disclosed, and authorisations given, will be repeated at least annually.
Any conflicts or potential conflicts considered by the Board and any authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of directors conflicts which is maintained by the Company Secretary.
Performance evaluation The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and the individual directors.
In 2008 this process was facilitated by Professor Goffee of the London Business School.
The evaluation process formed the basis of a review by the whole Board, led by the Chairman.
The performance evaluation of the Chairman was led by the senior independent director who obtained the views of both the executive and non-executive directors.
The directorships in listed companies and other significant commitments of the Chairman and the non-executive directors are shown on page 51.
Itis confirmedthatthe Chairman andthenon-executive  to fulfil theircommitmentsto theCompany: thattheChairman does not hold the office of chairman of another FTSE 100 company: and that no executive director holds more than one non-executive directorship of another FTSE 100 company.
Re-election Currently, all directors stand for election by the shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting AGM following their appointment and subsequently for re-election at least every three years.
With effect from 2010, the Board has resolved that all directors who are willing to continue in office will stand for re-election by the shareholders each year at the AGM.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a specified term of three years and reappointment for a second three-year term is not automatic.
In exceptional circumstances and only after rigorous review, a non-executive director may serve for a third term.
Remuneration Information regarding the Remuneration Committee is set out on page 63 and the Directors remuneration report is on pages 65 to 73.

The Board is satisfied that it has met this obligation.
A summary of the directors responsibilities for the financial statements is set out on page 74.
The going concern statement required by the Code is set out in the Group directors report on page 54.
Internal control The Board maintains a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the Companys assets.
The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed at least annually, covering all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems, and the Board reports to shareholders that it has done so.
The Financial Reporting Councils report Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code October 2005 provides guidance.

The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing these internal control and risk management systems.
The Companys internal control is based on assessment of risk and a framework of control procedures to manage risks and to monitor compliance with procedures.
The procedures for accountability and control are outlined below.
The Companys internal control systems are designed to meet the Companys particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed and, by their nature, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material loss to the Company or material misstatement in the financial accounts.
