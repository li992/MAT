Genus Annual Report 2009 I 37 Corporate Governance Audit Committee Report Continued External Auditors Under its terms of reference the Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the independence, objectivity and performance of the external auditors, and for making a recommendation to the Board regarding the appointment of external auditors on an annual basis.
The Groups external auditors, Deloitte LLP, were first appointed as external auditor of the Company for the period ended June 2006 following a formal tender process.
The Groups policy on non-audit services sets out services which the external auditors will and will not be allowed to provide to the Group, addressing both the nature of services and monetary thresholds requiring approval by the Group Finance Director and the Audit Committee Chairman.
Deloitte LLP are retained for tax advisory and tax compliance services.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the use of Deloitte LLP for such services does not impair their independence as the Groups external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee has reviewed: the external auditors fulfilment of the agreed audit plan: the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements: the content of the external auditors reports: a report from management on the quality of the external audit work: and cost effectiveness.
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities outlined above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the external auditors be re-appointed for a further year.
Internal Audit Function The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
The Companys internal audit function has been outsourced to Ernst & Young LLP and the Audit Committee believes this arrangement provides an effective internal audit function given the geographical spread of the Group.
In fulfilling its responsibities the Committee has reviewed the following in the period: the scope, terms of reference, resource and activities of the internal audit function within the Group: internal audits plans and its achievement of the planned activity: the results of key audits and other significant findings, the adequacy of managements response and the timeliness of resolution: and the level and nature of non-audit activity performed by Internal Audit.
The Groups Whistleblowing Policy contains arrangements for the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing issues and related matters for reporting to the Audit Committee as appropriate.
Overview As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference.
It has also ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and has assisted the Board in its review of the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work of the committee.
