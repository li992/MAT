Corporate governance Governance structure The board The board considers that it is vital to ensure that there is an appropriate range of skills and experience among its members, and that the objectivity and integrity of members should be exemplary.
The board currently comprises a non-executive chairman, four other non-executive directors and five executive directors.
The directors biographies are on pages 28 and 29.
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting after their appointment to the board and to re-election by shareholders every three years thereafter.
The division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the board.
The job descriptions are available on request.
The chairman has primary responsibility for running the board and devotes such time to his role as is necessary to properly discharge his duties.
The chief executive has responsibility for executing the companys strategy and achieving operational and financial goals.
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for its decision, including approval of the long-term objectives and strategy, approval of budgets and financial statements including the report and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to the structure of the group and overall corporate governance issues.
It reviews trading performance and considers major capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities.
Management is delegated the task of the detailed planning and implementation of the companys strategy.
Information and training Full and timely information is provided to the board to enable it to properly discharge its functions.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and are provided with the opportunity to question management as required.
The training needs of the board are regularly reviewed.
Explanations of issues and legislative changes affecting the industry have been provided to the board during the year.
There is an agreed procedure, set out in writing, for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice at the companys expense.
The company has in place directors and ofcers liability insurance.
Newly appointed directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the board to acquaint them with the company.
This takes the form of meetings with other board members and the provision of an induction pack containing general information on the company, its policies and procedures, financial information and a brieng on directors responsibilities.
Performance evaluation The board believes it is appropriate to undertake a regular performance evaluation of the board, its committees and individual directors.
It has determined that an internal process of evaluation is most appropriate, to enable first-hand input from individual directors to be obtained.
The last evaluation exercise was undertaken in March 2008 and it is the boards intention to conduct such reviews approximately every 18 months.
No formal evaluation exercise was therefore undertaken during the 2008 9 financial year.
The board is, however, satisfied that an open dialogue exists between all board members enabling issues to be raised and dealt with as they occur rather than waiting for the next formal evaluation process, and accordingly believes that it and its committees are operating effectively.
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee in conjunction with their annual pay review and the payment of bonuses.
The performance of Tim Bridge, chairman, was reviewed by the non-executive directors, led by Norman Murray, the senior independent non-executive director, taking into account the views of the executive directors.
Independence of non-executive directors The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are carefully examined and fully discussed.
Their independence and objectivity are of paramount importance.
The board believes that they all have a range of skills and experience which will help the company and that their understanding of the company, its strategy and operations increases over the years.
The board is satisfied that all of the non-executive directors were independent throughout the year, being free from any relationship with the executive management which could result in any conict or affect their independent judgment, and that they all remained independent in character and judgment.
None of the independent non-executive directors participates in the share option schemes or long-term incentive plan operated by the company and none was dependent on the fees received from the company as their primary source of income.
Following the retirement of Howard Phillips at the AGM in September 2008, Norman Murray took over the role of senior independent nonexecutive director.
Norman was appointed to the board in January 2004, has never been employed by the company and has had diverse business interests.
The board considers that he has remained independent from management in both character and judgement, that his performance has been effective and that he has demonstrated commitment to the role.
A key responsibility for the senior independent director is to be available to shareholders in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay views through the chairman, chief executive or finance director.
Tim Bridge took over as chairman of the board in May 2005 for an initial term of three years.
The board noted that, because of his long tenure as an executive director, he did not meet all of the independence criteria set out in the combined code.
However, the board was, and remains, confident that the strength of character and independent judgement that he exhibited as chief executive would continue in his role as chairman.
The board is satisfied that his performance as chairman is effective and that he demonstrates continued commitment to the role.
He was therefore re-appointed for a further three-year period in May 2008.
Tim Bridge is also a non-executive director of William Ransom & Son plc and Weatherbys Ventures Limited but these are not regarded as significant commitments and do not impact upon his ability to perform his role as chairman effectively.

A small number of such potential conicts have been approved by the board following disclosure by certain directors, in each case with the relevant director not taking part in any decision relating to their own position.
Directors are also aware that the disclosure and authorisation of any potential conict situations does not detract from their requirement to notify the board separately of an actual or potential conict in relation to a proposed transaction by the company.
The board will keep its authorisations under review on a regular basis.
Board committees The board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has formal terms of reference governing its method of operation.

GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Audit committee report The audit committee was chaired by Norman Murray until the AGM in September 2008, at which point he stood down from the committee to take up, instead, the chairmanship of the remuneration committee.
Ian Durant, already a member of the committee, then took over as chairman.
The other members of the committee during the year were Jane Scriven and John Brady.
All members have been considered by the board to be independent.

Limits of authority have been placed on the ability of the finance director and the chairman of the audit committee to approve specic engagements, with fees in excess of those limits being subject to approval of the full committee.
The company has a limited internal audit function which focuses on the groups managed house divisions, where the greatest financial risks are perceived to exist.

After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
