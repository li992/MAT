Sheila king Approach Director, Group retail leasing the success of a Hammerson property relies on our ability to engage with retailers and office occupiers to understand and meet their requirements.
in 2009, we commissioned interviews with some of our major customers to assess their perceptions of value and to gain feedback on actions which we could take to improve our service.
Analysis of the results will allow us to respond to their needs and improve our own performance, which we will benchmark by conducting a similar survey on an annual basis.
As a result of this survey we have restructured our internal teams to focus on specific customers.
