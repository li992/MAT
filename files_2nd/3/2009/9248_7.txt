Internal control Laird PLC is a holding company registered in the UK with businesses primarily located overseas.
These businesses are organised as subsidiary companies where the management of these companies are appointed to manage within the framework established by the Laird PLC Board, as well as complying with local statutory and regulatory requirements.
Overall responsibility for the Groups systems of internal control and reviewing their effectiveness lies with the Laird PLC Board.
During the year a review was carried out which assessed the adequacy of those systems.
Primary responsibility for systems of internal control rests with the managers of the subsidiaries.
Laird PLCs executive directors are responsible for implementing Group policy and for monitoring the businesses and performance of operating companies and units and reporting to the Board thereon.
The financial information received by Laird PLC is reviewed at divisional level as well as by the Finance Department of Laird PLC who review the consolidation and financial statements to ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are appropriately reflected.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group is in place and complies with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control and is regularly reviewed by the Board.
This process has been in place for the full financial year and up to the date the accounts were approved by the Board.
The systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives as well as safeguarding the Groups assets.
These systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Group operating rules are issued each year to the managers of subsidiaries setting out their responsibilities and the procedures to be followed to agree their commercial and financial objectives.
These rules require approval for specific transactions and call for accurate and relevant financial information to be delivered on a timely basis.
The ability to identify risk is enhanced by the timely reporting of management information and the short lines of communication with operating managers.
Subsidiaries submit their budgets annually to Laird PLCs executive directors.
In addition, through a risk and controls self-assessment process, they are required to identify the key risk and control issues that their businesses face and set out the strategies they will employ to manage them.
The issues raised by the subsidiaries are reviewed by the Board as part of the annual risk review process.
A risk management update, reporting emergent risks and any changes to the risk environment, is presented at all Board Meetings.
This process is supplemented by papers submitted to the Board by the executive directors throughout the year and by meetings from time to time between the Board and the management of the subsidiaries, some of which take place at the premises of the operating companies.
The Chief Executive presents the Groups business objectives which are approved by the Board, and the Board also addresses those risks which affect Laird as a whole.
The Board instigates further reports and investigations as it considers necessary.
Risk management strategy, risk performance monitoring and risk oversight at Group level for all areas including operational, environmental and health and safety risk rests with the Laird Risk Management Group RMG.
The RMG is chaired by the Group Chief Executive and reports to the Board.
Co-ordination of risk identification and review and actions in all areas below corporate level and improvements in controls and operational risk management are driven by the Laird Technologies Risk Management Committee RMC, chaired by the President of one of Laird Technologies business divisions, with representation for all divisions and Laird Technologies functions.
The RMC and RMG both met three times during the year.
The Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the Chairman of the RMC are members of both committees, reinforcing consistency and linking between Lairds risk management strategy and its implementation in all countries.
Further details on the RMG and RMC are set out in the Corporate social responsibility report on pages 36 to 39.
As noted above, the Audit Committee reviews the Group and Companys financial statements.
It also has responsibility for reviewing the process for identifying and managing financial risk and for reviewing the internal financial controls and considers the scope and planning of internal and external audits.
It reviews reports on internal financial control including reports by the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the Finance Director and the results from internal financial audits.
As part of their audit, the external auditor, to the extent they consider necessary to support their audit opinion, review and test the systems of internal control and the data contained in the accounts, including an independent and objective review of the approach of management to the reporting of the operating results and financial condition.
