qxd 24 7 09 1:47 pm Page 18 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance The Board is required by the Financial Services Authority to report on the extent of its application of the principles and of its compliance with the provisions contained in the revised Combined Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003.
Your Board fully supports the goal of better Corporate Governance and we comply with the majority of the provisions of the revised Code.
We do not comply with the provisions of the revised Code in connection with non-executive representation on the Board, as we are doubtful that further extending non-executive participation at present would benefit our shareholders.
We consider it vital that the principles of a unitary Board of Directors sharing responsibility for all facets of the Companys business should not be undermined by reserving areas of decision making solely for non-executive Directors.
For this reason the matters which the Code recommends should be reserved for audit, nomination and remuneration committees are dealt with by the entire Board and it is intended to continue this practice.
In view of the fact that the Board comprises only three Directors it is also not considered necessary to split the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive.
Executive remuneration is not directly related to performance, but a link is established by the fact that remuneration is not agreed upon until after the results for the year are known.
Changes should be made when they are appropriate and in the best interests of the Company, rather than for the sake of change itself.
This Company has a successful track record and whilst the Board will continue to keep under review any proposals which may improve the efficiency of its operations, the current structure has stood the Company in good stead over many years and should continue to do so in the future.
The Board The Group is controlled through its Board of Directors.
The Boards main roles are to create value to shareholders, to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the Group, to approve the Groups strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary financial and other resources are made available to enable them to meet those objectives.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year on both a formal and informal basis.
Comprehensive management information covering all aspects of the Companys business is supplied to the Board in a timely manner and in a form and quality to enable it to discharge its duties.
The Boards principal focus, in accordance with the formal schedule of matters referred to it for decision, is on the formation of strategy and the monitoring and control of operations and financial performance.
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary who is responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures are complied with.
The Board has agreed a procedure for Directors in the furtherance of their duties to take independent professional advice if necessary, at the Companys expense.
The Board consult on a regular basis with the Groups external auditors and are charged with ensuring that their objectivity and independence is safeguarded.
The entire Board is responsible for the selection and approval of candidates for appointment to the Board.
All Directors retire by rotation and submit themselves to shareholders at Annual General Meetings at regular intervals and at least every three years.
The Board acknowledge that in view of his length of service the non-executive Director is not technically independent.

The names of the Directors together with their biographical details are set out on page 13.
All the Directors served throughout the period under review.
Directors Remuneration Details of the Directors remuneration are contained in the Remuneration Report on page 16.
Internal Controls The Board is ultimately responsible for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The revised Combined Code introduced a requirement that the Directors review the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls.
This extends the existing requirement in respect of internal financial controls to cover all controls including: financial, operational, compliance, and risk management.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant business risks faced by the Group, that this process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
This process is reviewed by the Board at regular intervals and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board has considered the benefits likely to arise from the appointment of an internal audit function and have concluded that this is not currently necessary having regard for other controls which operate within the Group.
Key elements of the Groups system of internal controls are as follows: Controls environment: The Group is committed to the highest standards of business conduct and seeks to maintain these standards across all its operations across the world.
The Group has a clear organisational structure for planning, executing and monitoring business operations in order to achieve the Groups objectives.
Lines of responsibility and delegation of authority are well defined.
Risk identification and evaluation: Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation of key risks applicable to the areas of the property market which impact their objectives.
These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a variety of internal and external sources.
The Board considers the risk implications of business decisions including those affecting all major transactions.
Information and communication: Periodic strategic reviews are carried out which include the consideration of long term financial projections.
Annual budgets are prepared and performance against plan is actively monitored at the Board level.
Through these mechanisms group performance is monitored, risks identified in a timely manner, their implications assessed, control procedures reevaluated and corrective actions agreed and implemented.
qxd 24 7 09 1:47 pm Page 20 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Corporate Governance continued Control procedures: The Group has implemented control procedures designed to ensure complete and accurate accounting for financial transactions and to limit the potential exposure to loss of assets or fraud.
Measures include physical controls, segregation of duties, reviews by management and external audit to the extent necessary to arrive at their audit opinion.
Monitoring and corrective action: The Board meets regularly formally and informally throughout the year to review the internal controls.
This includes an annual review of the significant business risks, formally considering the scope and effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control.
In addition, the Directors and senior management staff have a close involvement in the day to day operations of the Group and as such the controls are subject to ongoing monitoring.
Investor Relations The Board values communication with private and institutional shareholders and with analysts.
The Annual General Meeting is used as an opportunity to meet private shareholders.
Other opportunities are taken during the year to discuss the strategic and other issues with institutional shareholders and analysts.
The Board continues to support the concept of individual resolutions on separate issues at Annual General Meetings.
Details of proxy voting on each resolution are disclosed to the Meeting after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
In accordance with the revised Code, notice of the Annual General Meeting and the Report and Financial Statements will be sent to shareholders at least twenty working days before the meeting.
