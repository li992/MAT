The performance evaluation exercise focused on matters such as Board process and functioning: Board performance: governance and independence of non-executive directors: committee functioning, performance and composition: and the Chairmans role and Board composition, including succession planning both in respect of the Board and senior management.

John Hawkins, Mike Buzzacott, Nigel Turner and Barry Furr will be available to answer questions as Chairmen of the Board and its Committees at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 November 2009.
Internal Control and Risk Management The Board has applied principle C. 2 of the Code by establishing a structured risk management system which identifies, evaluates and prioritises risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and actively reviews control and mitigation activities.
The Board has continued to enhance the Groups risk management system during the year.
The system applies on an on-going basis to each business unit of the Group worldwide, divisional management Boards, the Companys Operating Board and Main Board.
The Groups internal audit function is outsourced to Ernst & Young LLP who are tasked to audit specific key business risks identified by the Companys risk management system and agreed by the Board.
In addition, specialist third party consultants may be tasked from time to time to perform an internal audit of a specific key business risk, for example the Companys compliance with environmental and health & safety requirements.
The Board believes this internal audit structure provides an effective internal audit function given the size and geographical spread of the Group.
The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C. 2.1 of the Code, the Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control and the Groups financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
This assessment considered all significant aspects of internal control arising during the period covered by this report including the work programme of the Companys internal audit function, and management reports prepared at the time of the approval of the Companys interim and final reports and financial statements, to consider whether significant risks were identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses had arisen and the remedial action that had been taken.
The management reports were based on the responses received to comprehensive questionnaires issued to each of the Groups business units and divisional management, together with the risk events and controls that had been advised to the Groups other means of day to day risk management, namely the divisional management Boards, the Operating Board, the Main Board and insurers.
Whilst areas are routinely identified for improvement, during the course of its review of the system of internal control the Board has neither identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be material or significant.
The key elements of the Groups risk management process are as follows: Management of Business Risk The Board is ultimately responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Group.
Key risks facing the business include the impact of the economic downturn on sales and profit growth and disease and environmental risks related to the keeping of livestock.
The Board, Chief Operating Officers and their regional management teams are tasked with the responsibility for the ongoing identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risks to ensure the significant risks affecting the Company are properly identified and managed.
Management Structure Authority to operate the Groups subsidiary companies is delegated to the Chief Operating Officers and their regional management teams within limits set by the Board.
The appointment of executives to the most senior positions within the Group requires the approval of the Board.
Formal empowerment levels, which set out delegation of authority, authorisation levels and other control procedures are in place.
These procedures are supplemented by operating standards set by the Chief Operating Officers and their regional management, as required for the type of business and the geographical location of each subsidiary.
An operating Board, chaired by the Chief Executive and comprising the Group Finance Director, the Chief Operating Officers, the Group Company Secretary & General Counsel, the Group Financial Controller and other executives by invitation meet on a regular basis to review each regions performance against its budget, long and short term strategies and other key business issues, indicators and activities.
Genus Annual Report 2009 I 35 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Statement Continued Information and Financial Reporting Systems The Groups current planning and financial reporting procedures include detailed operational budgets for the year ahead together with the preparation of three year strategic plans, which the Board reviews and approves.
Performance is monitored and relevant action taken throughout the year through monthly reporting of key performance indicators and variances, updated full year forecasts and information on key business risk areas.
Quality and Integrity of Personnel The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards enhanced by post-recruitment training courses.
High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the expected ethical standards are communicated throughout the Group.
Investment Appraisal Capital expenditure is regulated by a budgetary process and pre-determined authorisation levels.
For expenditure above specific levels, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board.
Due diligence work is carried out if a business is to be acquired and post-acquisition reviews are conducted on a timely basis.
Investigations are performed on any significant overspends and corrective action is taken where required.
