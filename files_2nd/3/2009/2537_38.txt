The Executive Committee have delegated the management of risk to the group Risk Committee, chaired by the group Finance Director, which reviews the group risk register on a quarterly basis, with the Audit Committee reviewing it on a semi-annual basis.
RISK ManaGEMEnT PROCESS There is in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group, which has operated throughout the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2009.
This process involves a quarterly assessment of functional risk registers, which is then reviewed and signed off by the group Risk Committee.
The groups risk management framework is designed to support this process and is the responsibility of the group Risk Committee, chaired by the Finance Director.
The risk framework governs the management and control of both financial and non-financial risks.
The adoption of this policy throughout the group enables a consistent approach to the management of risk at both regional and business unit level.
Internal Audit run regular workshops throughout the group to ensure a consistent deployment of the framework and test compliance with the policy.

The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and it must be recognised that it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In that context, the review, in the opinion of the board, did not indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and the board is not aware of any change to this status up to the approval of this report.
