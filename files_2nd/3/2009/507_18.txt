Main activities of the Committee during the year We held two meetings during 2009, the first to confirm Russell Kings appointment as a Non-executive Director and the second to consider a detailed succession plan for each of the Executive Directors.
As part of the Companys annual evaluation of Board performance, all Directors were consulted on the composition of the Board, and were of the view that it was of the right size, with the appropriate range of skills and balance between Executive and Non-executive Directors.
