Close Brothers Group plc 112 Annual Report 2011 Financial Statements The Notes 35.
Post balance sheet event On 16 September 2011, the group announced the phased sale of its 49.9% investment in Mako, which is included within the Securities division, to the management team.
The sale is consistent with the groups focus on developing its core businesses where it has full control.
Given the nature of its business, Mako has a more volatile earnings profile which is not consistent with the groups strategy.
The sale is for an estimated consideration of US$40 million in cash and will be effected via a series of purchases over several years by the management team.
The sale of the first 16.6% is expected to close in the next few months, and the amount and timing of future purchases will depend on the financial performance of Mako.
In addition, whilst it remains a shareholder in Mako, the group will continue to receive a dividend from Mako equivalent to its share of all profit after tax.
Should the aggregate performance of Mako outperform certain predefined levels of profitability, the group will also be entitled to further deferred contingent consideration of up to US$7.5 million.
As a result of the transaction, the group has written down the value of its investment in Mako by 36.0 million.
