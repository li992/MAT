A training session was held during October 2011, where Deloitte updated the committee on a number of relevant accounting matters and discussed latest developments in Corporate and Social Responsibility reporting and changes to UK corporate governance practice.
Independence of external auditor The Audit Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the independence of the audit is not compromised.
In this respect, the Audit Committee reviewed: the external auditors plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory auditor, who signs the audit report and who, in accordance with the professional rules, has not held office for more than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff: the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship: and the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor as specified below.
Related and non-audit fees paid to the auditor are available in note 3 on page 67.
There has been no significant non-audit engagement.
The policy in respect of services provided by the external auditor is as follows: audit-related services.
The external auditor is invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed to undertake the work.
This includes reporting and certification connected with borrowings, shareholders and circulars, regulatory requirements and work in respect of acquisitions and disposals: in the case of other services no contracts in excess of 20,000 in value can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the Chairman of the Audit Committee: tax and general consulting work.
In general and where conflict could arise, the work is not awarded to the external auditor and is put out to tender: and there are no contractual restrictions on who the AuditCommittee can choose as external auditor.
Internal audit Internal Audit independently reviews the risk and control processes operated by management.
It carries out independent audits in accordance with an internal audit plan which is agreed with the Audit Committee before the start of the financial year.
This plan takes account of the risk management framework surrounding major business risks in each operation and provides a high degree of financial and geographical coverage.
Where appropriate, either because of language, geographical remoteness or where technical expertise is required, the Internal Audit Department engages third party specialists to conduct Internal Audits.
Internal Audit reports include recommendations to improve internal controls together with agreed managerial action plans to resolve issues raised.
Internal audit follows up the implementation of recommendations and reports progress to senior management and the Audit Committee.
The Committee noted that the 2011 Internal Audit programme was successfully completed with sites representing approximately 70% of Group revenue being the subject of internal audit reports.
At the same time there was a declining trend in the requirement for corrective actions.
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function is reviewed and discussed on an annual basis with the Vice President Risk and Business Processes and Senior Internal Auditor.
Following a review of the Groups internal audit processes and capabilities a decision was taken by the Committee to outsource internal audit.
The Group went out to tender to three major accounting firms and after receiving presentations from them, the contract for services was awarded to Ernst & Young LLP, who will commence their work in April 2012.
Overview As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
On behalf of the Audit Committee: J.
A. Biles Audit Committee Chairman 23 February 2012
