They bring an independent judgement to bear on Group policies and strategies as well as management actions and performance, including resourcing and standards of conduct.

Conflicts of interest A director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 the Act to avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or possibly may conflict with the Companys interests.
The Act allows the Board to authorise a directors conflict or potential conflict of interest where the Articles of Association contain a provision to this effect and also allows the Articles of Association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
Shareholders approved the necessary changes to the Companys Articles of Association at the AGM on 7 May 2008.
There are safeguards which apply when directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
Only independent directors those who have no interest in the matter being considered are able to take the relevant decision, and in taking the decision the directors must act in a way which they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Companys success.
The directors are also able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation.
A register of actual or potential conflicts notified and authorised is maintained and reviewed regularly by the Board.
