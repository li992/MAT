This consisted of an internally run exercise led by the Chairman with the assistance of the Company Secretary.
The appraisal questionnaire used in connection with the process was wide-ranging and based on questions outlined in the Code, covering both board and committee performance.

com Internal control The board has overall responsibility for the groups system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness.
In discharging that responsibility, the board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to apply the Code, including clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority.
These procedures have been in place since the company listed and are regularly reviewed by the board.
Business performance is managed closely and the board and the Executive Committee have established processes, as part of the normal good management of the business, to monitor: Strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress towards strategic objectives: Financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, financial reporting, analysing variances against plan and taking appropriate management action: Capital investment and asset management performance, with detailed appraisal, authorisation and post investment reviews: and Principal risks and risk management processes, which accords with the Turnbull guidance published by the FRC in October 2005 and is supported by reports from the Head of Internal Audit and Risk that the significant risks faced by the group are being identified, evaluated and appropriately managed, having regard to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity.
The board has delegated the management of risk to the Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Company Secretary, which reviews the group risk register on a quarterly basis, and reports to the Audit Committee at least twice a year.
Management, with the assistance of the finance function, is responsible for ensuring the appropriate maintenance of financial records and processes that ensure all financial information is relevant, reliable, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, and distributed both internally and externally in a timely manner.
A review of the consolidation and financial statements is completed by management to ensure that the financial position and results of the group are appropriately recorded, circulated to members of the board and published where appropriate.
All financial information published by the group is subject to the approval of the board, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee.
Risk management process There is in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group, which has operated throughout the year.
This process involves a quarterly assessment of functional and business unit risk registers, which is reviewed and signed off by the Group Risk Committee.
The groups risk management framework is designed to support this process and is the responsibility of the Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Company Secretary.
The risk framework governs the management and control of both financial and non-financial risks.
The adoption of this policy throughout the group enables a consistent approach to the management of risk at both regional and business unit level.
The internal audit function holds regular workshops across the group to ensure a consistent deployment of the framework and test compliance with the policy.
In addition, during the year, the Audit Committee received: Reports from the Head of Internal Audit and Risk on the work carried out under the annual internal audit plan: Risk management reports, including the status of actions to mitigate major risks and the quantification of selected risks: and, Reports from the external auditors.
Through the monitoring processes set out above, the board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the year.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and it must be recognised that it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In that context, the review, in the opinion of the board, did not indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and the board is not aware of any change to this status up to the date of approval of this report.
