Audit Committee Report continued Overview of the actions taken by the Audit Committee to discharge its duties Since the beginning of the financial year the Audit Committee has: reviewed the March 2010 report and financial statements, the September 2010 half-yearly report and the trading updates issued in July and January.
As part of this review the Committee received a report from the external auditors on their audit of the annual report and financial statements and review of the half-yearly report: considered the output from the Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks: reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups internal controls and disclosures made in the annual report and financial statements on this matter: reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the auditors: agreed the fees to be paid to the external auditors for their audit of the March 2011 financial statements and September half-yearly report: undertaken an assessment of the qualification, expertise and resources, and independence of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process.
This included consideration of a report on the audit firms own quality control procedures and the audit firms annual transparency report, and the report produced by the Audit Inspection Unit on the audit firm: assessed the risks associated with the possible withdrawal of the external auditor from the market: met the Groups external valuers: undertaken an evaluation of the performance of the external auditors: and reviewed its own effectiveness.
External Auditors The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the Groups policy on external audit.
The policy assigns oversight responsibility for monitoring the independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements to the Audit Committee, and day to day responsibility to the Chief Financial Officer.
The policy states that the external auditors are jointly responsible to the Board and the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee is the primary contact.
The Groups policy on external audit sets out the categories of non-audit services which the external auditors will and will not be allowed to provide to the Group, subject to fide minimis levels.
They may not provide a service which places them in a position where they may be required to audit their own work.
Specifically, they are precluded from providing services relating to bookkeeping, financial information system design and implementation, appraisal or evaluation services, actuarial services, any management functions, investment banking services, legal services unrelated to the audit or advocacy services.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed: the changes in key external audit staff in the external auditors plan for the current year: the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship: a report identifying the number of former external audit staff now employed by the Group and their positions within the Group: a report from the external auditors describing their arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest: and the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditors, in addition to their case-by-case approval of the position of non-audit services by the external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed: the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors independence and objectivity: the external auditors fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and variations from the plan: the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements: and the content of the external auditors comments on control improvement recommendations.
Regard is paid to the nature of, and remuneration received, for other services provided by Deloitte LLP to the Group and, inter alia, confirmation is sought from them that the fee payable for the annual audit is adequate to enable them to perform their obligations in accordance with the scope of the audit.
Where non-audit services are provided, the fees are based on the work undertaken and are not success related.
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2011, the auditors remuneration comprised 165,000 for audit work and 158,000 for other work, principally relating to corporation tax work.
As part of this years decision to recommend the re-appointment of the auditors, the Audit Committee has taken into account the tenure of the auditors and the audit partner and the need to consider at least every five years whether there should be a full tender process.
The auditors, Deloitte LLP, have been in tenure since 2000 and the current audit partner has been in place since the audit of the 2009 financial statements.
There are no contractual obligations that act to restrict the Audit Committees choice of external auditors.
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities outlined above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the external auditors are re-appointed.
Overview As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.

The Groups Board Reports communicate progress on our CSR objectives to the Companys Directors.
In order to maintain a sustainable business for its customers, staff and investors, the Board has committed significant resources to the social and environmental aspects of its operations.
These are measured by key performance indicators KPIs, the most significant of which are reported below.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Highlights Our CSR programme for 2011 committed us to focus on our most significant environmental challenge of energy efficiency and carbon reduction.
In order to achieve these objectives we: 1. increased the roll-out of our store lighting energy efficiency re-lamping programmes, 41% of the estate is now converted: 2. reduced store carbon intensity emissions by 2.1%: 3. reduced Construction Fit Out carbon emissions by 63.5%: 4. increased solar panel electricity generation by 20.6%: 5. increased renewable energy generation by 11.5%: and 6. generated 255 MWh of solar electricity and 398 MWh of cumulative renewable energy since 2008.
Our most significant social and environmental performance indicators are summarised as follows: This year store carbon emissions including our head office at Bagshot and one warehouse building represents 97.48% of our emissions, with flexi office gas accounting for 1.56% of emissions and construction fit out only 0.96% of emissions.
