Its The Board has considered the principles and three sections cover the Board: Board Meetings and recommendations of the AIC Code by reference to the AIC Guide.
The AIC Code, as explained by the AIC relations with the Investment Manager: and Shareholder Guide, addresses all the principles set out in the Communications.
Principles of the AIC Code Application of the principles The Board 1.
The chairman should be Mr H M Henderson has been Chairman of the Company since the Annual independent.
General Meeting in March 2003: he joined the Board in 1988.
The Board considers that Mr Henderson is, and has been since his appointment, an independent non-executive director.
Independence stems from the ability to make those objective decisions that may be in conflict with the interests of management: this in turn is a function of confidence, integrity and judgement.
Mr Henderson has served on the Board for more than nine years.
Accordingly, he stands for re-election by the shareholders each year and will do so for as long as he continues to serve on the Board.
The Board is firmly of the view, however, that length of service does not of itself impair a directors ability to act independently: rather, a directors longer perspective adds value to the deliberations of a well-balanced investment trust company board.
The other independent non-executive directors, under the chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director, review and evaluate annually the performance and continuing independence of the Chairman.
Mr Henderson was formerly a partner of Cazenove & Co. the firm which for many years acted as the Companys stockbroker.
However, he did not have responsibility for or involvement with Cazenoves role with the Company, being for many years responsible for aspects of Cazenoves fund management division.
Accordingly, the Board considers that the Chairman has no relationships that might create a conflict of interest between his interests and those of the other shareholders.
28 Annual Report 2011 Principles of the AIC Code Application of the principles Mr A Watson was appointed as the Senior Independent Director in February 2008.
As noted above, he takes the lead in the annual evaluation of the Chairman.
He is also able to act as a sounding board for the Chairman and serve as an intermediary for the other directors, should this prove necessary, and to act as a channel of communication for shareholders in the event that contact through the Chairman has failed to resolve concerns or is inappropriate.
A majority of the board At 31 December 2011 the Board was composed of seven independent nonshould be independent of executive directors and one executive director the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board is therefore independent of the Companys executive management.
All the directors are wholly independent of the Companys various investment managers.
In the opinion of the Board, each of the directors is independent in character and judgement and there are no relationships or circumstances relating to the Company that are likely to affect their judgement see also section 1 on page 28.
Directors should be submitted New directors stand for election by the shareholders at the annual general for re-election at regular meeting of the Company that follows their appointment.
Nomination for directors stand for re-election at least every three years, as required by the re-election should not be Companys Articles of Association.
Directors who have served for more than assumed but be based on nine years stand for re-election annually.
There are currently two directors disclosed procedures and with service of more than nine years: Mr H M Henderson the Chairman and continued satisfactory Mr R A Bruce who was appointed as a director in 2002. performance.
The Board has reviewed Provision B.
7.1 of the Corporate Governance Code, which states that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders.
The Board considers that the annual reelection of all the directors is inappropriate to the Company.
There are two main reasons for this view: a it appears to place excessive emphasis on the short term and insufficient emphasis on the need for an effective board to work together and to refresh its composition over time: and b there is some danger, because many small and nominee shareholders choose not to exercise their voting rights, that if all the directors seek re-election at once a minority of the shareholders could engineer the removal of the whole Board for reasons injurious to the interests of the Companys investors as a whole.
Therefore the Board considers it appropriate to continue to apply Provision B.
7.1 as if the Company were not a constituent of the FTSE 350 Index, a view which a number of prominent institutional investors have shared.
Every year the Board reviews its composition and the composition of its two Committees.
The Boards Remuneration Committee, which serves as its nominations committee, oversees this process.
Further details are given under section 7 below.
The board should have a New directors are appointed for an initial term ending three years from the policy on tenure, which is date of their first annual general meeting after appointment and with the disclosed in the annual report.
expectation that they will serve two three-year terms.
The continuation of directors appointments is contingent on satisfactory performance evaluation and re-election at annual general meetings.
Directors appointments are reviewed formally every three years by the Board as a whole.
None of the non-executive directors has a contract of service and a director may resign by notice in writing to the Board at any time: there are no set notice periods.
The Boards tenure and succession policy seeks to ensure that the Board is well-balanced and refreshed regularly by the appointment of new directors with the skills and experience necessary, in particular, to replace those lost by 29 Witan Investment Trust plc Directors Report Corporate Governance Statement continued Principles of the AIC Code Application of the principles directors retirements.
Directors must be able to demonstrate their commitment to the Company, including in terms of time.
The Board seeks to encompass past and current experience of various areas that is relevant to the Companys objective and operations, the most important skill-sets being investment management, finance, marketing, financial services, risk management, custody and settlement, and investment banking.
Specialist agents are used to assist with recruitment.
While the roles and contributions of longer serving directors are subject to rigorous review, the Board is strongly of the view that length of service is only one factor and that the shareholders benefit from having directors with a longer perspective of the Companys history and its place in the savings market.
Therefore there is no absolute limit to the period for which a director may serve.
There should be full Details of the directors are set out on page 22.

behalf of the Board until his retirement in May 2011.
Following a review of the skills available within the Board, the Board has appointed Ms Neubert as a new Director with significant marketing experience, with effect from 2 April 2012.
Board Diversity As announced in November 2011, the Company welcomes the objectives of the Davies Report to improve the performance of Corporate boards by encouraging the appointment of the best people from a range of differing perspectives and backgrounds.
The Company recognises the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender, and takes this into account in its board appointments.
The Company is committed to ensuring that its Director search processes actively seek both men and women with the right qualifications so that appointments can be made, on the basis of merit, against objective criteria from a diverse selection of candidates.
To this end the Board will continue to dedicate time to consider diversity during the director search process.
The board should undertake a The Board has established a process to evaluate its performance on an annual formal and rigorous annual basis.
This process is based on open discussion and seeks to assess the evaluation of its own strengths and weaknesses of the Board and its Committees.
The Chairman performance and that of its leads on applying the conclusions of the evaluation.
The Chairman reviews committees and individual with each director his or her individual performance, contribution and directors.
The Senior Independent Director leads the annual evaluation of the Chairman and reviews the conclusions with him.
The Boards Remuneration Committee oversees this process.
In addition, in consideration of Provision B.
6.2 of the Corporate Governance Code, which states that evaluation of the board of FTSE 350 companies should be externally facilitated at least every three years, the Board concluded that, regardless of the size of the company, periodic external evaluation should add value to the process.
Accordingly, a sub-committee of the Board reviewed a number of the firms offering this service and, in September 2010, appointed Trust Associates Limited to carry out an evaluation programme.
The Board has reviewed the report submitted to it and the Chairman has led on implementing those changes recommended by the report that the Board considered should be made.
The report did not identify any material weaknesses or concerns.
Trust Associates Limited as a firm has been used to identify possible candidates for recruitment to the Board in the past.
