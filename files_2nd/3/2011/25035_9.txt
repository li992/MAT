Corporate Governance structure, including details of how the Board delegates responsibility for internal control and risk management to our Audit and Risk committees, is described in detail in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.
The Group has no significant concentration of market risk.
No sensitivity analysis is presented for equity market price risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups net trading revenue and equity are not significant, being less than the Groups The Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP provides an on-going assessment of the risks the Group believes have average daily net trading revenue from financial instruments 2011: 1,252,000: 2010: 1,148,000.

The exposure is monitored on a Group-wide Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

Exposure limits are set by the Risk Committee for each product, and also is analysed into market price, currency and interest rate risk components.

The Groups market risk is managed under the Market Risk Policy on a Group-wide basis and exposure to market risk at any point in time The exposure to interest rate derivatives and commodities at the year-end are as follows: depends primarily on short-term market conditions and the levels of client activity.
The Group utilises market position limits for operational 2011 2010 efficiency and does not take proprietary positions based on an expectation of market movements.

Interest rate derivatives 21,332 8,381 Commodities 10,261 4,999 The Groups Market Risk Policy incorporates a methodology for setting market position limits, consistent with the Groups risk appetite, for each financial market in which the Groups clients can trade, as well as certain markets which the Board consider to be correlated.
These limits are determined with reference to the liquidity and volatility of the underlying financial product or asset class and to an extent the No sensitivity analysis is presented for other market price risk, as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups volumes which the Groups clients transact and represent the maximum long and short client exposure that the Group will hold without net trading revenue is not significant.

The Groups real-time market position monitoring system allows it to monitor its market exposure against these limits continuously.
ii Foreign currency risk If exposures exceed these limits, the policy requires that hedging is undertaken to bring the exposure back within the defined limit.
The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign currency risk.
There is a significant level of natural hedging arising from the Groups global client base pursuing varying trading strategies which results a Translational foreign currency risk in a significant portfolio hedging effect.
This reduces the Groups net market exposure prior to the Group hedging any residual net client Translation exposures arise from financial and non-financial items held by an entity with a functional currency different from the Groups exposures, as well as minimising concentration risk within the market risk portfolio.
The functional currency of each company in the Group is that denominated by the country of incorporation as disclosed in note 14.
The Group does not hedge translational exposures as they do not have a significant impact on the Groups capital resources.
Where the Group has positions in markets for which it has not been possible or cost-effective to hedge, the Risk Committee determines the appropriate action and reviews these exposures regularly, subject to the risk management framework approved by the Board.
b Transactional foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures represent financial assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional Binary bets are typically difficult or not cost-effective to hedge and there is often no direct underlying market which can be utilised in currency of the transacting entity.
Transaction exposures arise in the normal course of business and the management of this risk forms part setting the price which the Group quotes.
The Group normally undertakes no hedging for these markets, but can hedge specific positions of the risk policies outlined above.
Limits on the exposures which the Group will accept in each currency are set by the Risk Committee if considered necessary.
The Group aims to reduce the volatility of revenue from these markets by offering a large number of different and the Group hedges its exposures as necessary with market counterparties.
Foreign currency risk is managed on a group-wide basis, betting opportunities, the results of which should, to some extent, offset each other irrespective of the underlying market outcome.
The while the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk is not considered by the Directors to be significant.
overwhelmingly short-term nature of these bets means that risk on these markets at any point in time is not considered to be significant.
