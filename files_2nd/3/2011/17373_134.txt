Awards granted in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were granted under the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan III.
Vesting Schedules The vesting schedules used for the various awards under both plans are shown in the following tables.
In respect of awards granted in 2007 and 2008, when actual performance falls between these positions, the match is calculated on a proportionate basis.
In respect of awards granted in 2009, 2010 and 2011, when actual performance is not exactly equal to a percentile in the table below, but is more than 50% and less than 90%, the percentage of matching shares will be determined on a straight-line basis between the relevant figures.

Where a company that delists during a performance period has an undisturbed share price for less than 40% of that performance period, the Compensation Committee would usually exclude that company from the comparator group for the award in question.
Otherwise, the company would usually be deemed to be disposed of and the proceeds reinvested, in respect of LEAP III, in a market capitalisation weighted index, and in respect of Renewed LEAP, in a non-market capitalisation weighted index, both of which track the TSR of the remaining comparator companies.
