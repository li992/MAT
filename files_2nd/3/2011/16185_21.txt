As at At 1 October 2010 as previously stated 183 111 648 154 305 1,401 30 September 2011, there remains no excess in the recoverable value over carrying value for these two CGUs.
Therefore any reasonably possible Restatement Note 1 B ii 1 19 20 deterioration in an assumption will cause the recoverable value to be below the carrying value and therefore require an impairment, as shown above.
