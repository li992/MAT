We will therefore not exercise our option to extend this franchise United Kingdom 3,428.7 3,324.9 for the three years to March 2016 and it will now end in March 2013.
The provision reflects our best estimate of the likely losses on the United States of America 2,508.0 2,505.0 franchise over the two years to 31 March 2013 which arise largely due to the accelerated write off of assets dedicated to this contract due Canada 492.5 432.0 to the earlier than expected end date.
