In undertaking its duties, the Committee has access to the services of the Finance Director and the Company Secretary and their resources, as well as access to external professional advice.
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in accordance with an agreed annual work plan of which the main features were: at meetings in February and July 2011, the Committee reviewed the Groups Preliminary results announcement and Annual report and accounts, and the Half year results announcement and Half year report respectively.
On each occasion, the Committee received reports from management and the external auditor identifying accounting or judgemental issues requiring its attention and also satisfied itself of the independence and objectivity of the external auditor: at each meeting the Committee received reports from the internal audit function on the progress of their programme for the year, reviewed new internal audit reports and monitored progress with the implementation of internal control recommendations.
The Committee continues to focus on specifically identified strategic risk areas, as well as ensuring the provision of a core compliance assurance service.
No significant weaknesses were identified in any of the internal audit reports although certain improvements in processes and procedures were made as a result of reviews: in July 2011, the Committee reviewed the arrangements for the provision of the internal audit function and the performance of the current provider, Grant Thornton UK LLP.
The Committee considered that outsourcing the internal audit function through Grant Thornton UK LLP continues to be effective and appropriate: 63 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 in April 2011, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the management letter covering the external auditors findings in respect of the prior financial year and also reviewed the performance of the external auditor: at meetings in April and November 2011, the Committee reviewed the Companys risk register and in February and November 2011, it undertook a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls and consideration of fraud: during 2011,  LLP PwC conducted a further phase on the effectiveness of controls applicable to Drax Power Limiteds commodity trading activities.
In July 2011, the results of this further phase were presented to the Committee.
The report did not identify any significant weaknesses in the controls: during the year, the Committee met three times in the absence of management with each of the external and internal auditor.
No matters of concern were drawn to the Committees attention at any of these meetings.
The Committees understanding with both the external and internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters occasioning them material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committees attention via the Chairman of the Committee.
Nothing was subject to this procedure in the course of the year: and strategic reviews of tax July 2011, treasury and the finance team both November 2011, were undertaken and presented to the Committee and in addition, policy reviews covering auditor independence and whistleblowing were put to, and approved by, the Committee in April 2011.
The nature of the Groups activities, and the markets in which it operates, are such that from time to time there is a need to consider carefully certain complex accounting issues and make subjective judgements.
Independence of the external audit In April 2011, the Committee considered and adopted an enhanced Auditor Independence Policy.
In accordance with the Policy, the Committee annually reviews the quality and cost effectiveness of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
The provisions of the Policy include: seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in their professional judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from them an account of all relationships which may affect the firms independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff: a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct non-audit work under which: the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain categories of work, including those where they may be required to audit their own work or make management decisions, or where the auditor would act in an advocacy role for the Group: there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditor to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to financial limits: all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work are reported to the next meeting of the Committee: the balance between the fees paid to the external auditor for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee: and a policy on the employment by the Group of former employees of the external auditor, the essence of which is to require a period of two years to elapse between the cessation of an individuals association with the auditor and appointment to any financial reporting oversight role within the Group.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements on page 93.
