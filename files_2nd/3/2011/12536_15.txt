42 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW continued Safety cases are in place at all of our operated installations.
This safety case regime is aligned with the regulated standards in the United Kingdom.
We believe this represents best practice and are committed to implementing such cases at all of our operated production facilities worldwide, even when not required by the local regulatory regime.
Safety cases are developed during the project and become more detailed as a project nears the operation stage.
Safety cases must be in place before production commences.
Premier is also developing an asset integrity and maintenance management process based on the asset integrity toolkit standard produced by Oil & Gas UK.
The process will apply to all of our installations and is intended to ensure the requirements set out in our performance standard for safety critical elements are met and maintained.
High potential incidents This last year saw a significant reduction in HIPOs per million man-hours from 1.59 in 2010 to 0.83 in 2011.
This was largely due to exceptional performance at our drilling and construction operations with annual frequencies of 0.00 and 0.36 respectively.
Our production operations achieved an annual frequency of 2.44.
Together, this overall reduction in frequency allowed the achievement of our 2.0 target.
Our HIPO frequency target for 2012 is also 2.0.
Loss of primary containment During 2011, there were no reported loss of primary containment LOPC events of greater consequence as defined in IPIECA 2011.
Such incidents are characterised as unintended process safety events with severe consequences.
These can include multiple fatalities, widespread environmental impact and or significant property damage.
There was one Tier 1 event and 35 LOPC events of lesser consequence reported 2010: 18 events.
This includes a single crude oil spill in the pump room classified as Tier 1, 15 gas leaks or contained spills that did not reach the environment 2010: five gas leaks and 20 minor spills 2010: 13 minor spills outlined below and in our Social Performance Review 2011.
Environmental performance Environmental assessment, management and reporting forms a major part of Premiers HSE risk management process.
We conduct baseline surveys and environmental and social impact assessments for each new operated activity.
This involves an assessment of the physical, socio-economic and biological environments, including biodiversity.
We measure and review each impact in turn and gauge both its significance and how it can be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable ALARP by adopting best available techniques, in line with our internal environmental ALARP process.
Potential actions to improve environmental performance are screened based on cost, duration and impact to determine which are feasible for implementation.
We periodically review these environmental impacts and actions for our existing facilities to ensure we comply with our policy of continuous improvement.
Environmental indicators and targets We report our environmental performance in line with the IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2010.
We then benchmark our performance by contributing our data to an industry database compiled and published by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers.
As an oil company with production facilities in the North Sea, we also comply with the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and submit an annual, externally verified report on our emissions profile to the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
We also participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project where we achieved a carbon disclosure score of 66 in 2011 2010: 74.
Key environmental parameters and indicators 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Greenhouse gases tonnes per thousand tonnes of production 305 185 171 167 171 Oil spills tonnes 2.7 1.3 1.5 13.7 Oil in produced water parts per million 14 11 19 23 20 Energy use gigajoules per tonne of production 2.6 2.1 1.7 2.0 1.8 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 43 Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrocarbon combustion at our operated assets amounted to 615,000 tonnes in 2011 2010: 350,000 tonnes.
This increase in absolute emissions from 2010 was largely due to a significant increase in development drilling activity and associated diesel consumption, as well as the start-up of our Gajah Baru and Chim So operations in Asia.
A number of technical challenges at Chim So during an extended commissioning required us to implement a longer period of gas flaring that was beyond our initial expectations.
Our operated emissions intensity also increased from 185 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production to 305 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production in 2011.
This is mainly due to the above additional development drilling activity as well as a series of unexpected events.
The latter included flaring at Chim So due to prolonged commissioning issues as well as three months of no production at our Balmoral facility in the North Sea.
When excluding this development work and unexpected events, our underlying steady-state emissions intensity figure is 163 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production.
We calculate our greenhouse gas CO equivalent emissions both for operated assets and 2 on an equity basis for production across our global portfolio.
Greenhouse gas emissions from flaring and fuel gas combustion associated with our full equity portfolio amounted to 172 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production 2010: 155 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production.
Spills and discharges The total volume of produced water discharged from our operations in 2011 amounted to 2,055,878 tonnes 2010: 2,922,707 tonnes.
This decrease was largely due to the shut-down of our North Sea operations for three months of the calendar year.
The average oil in produced water increased slightly from 11 ppm-wt in 2010 to 14 ppm-wt in 2011.
This increase in the oil concentration of produced water was mainly due to a slight increase at Balmoral that averaged 14 ppm-wt 2010: 10.4 ppm-wt.
The average concentration of oil in produced water, discharged by our Anoa facility, reduced significantly to 13 ppm-wt 2010: 17.7 ppm-wt.
In 2011, there were 20 spills to the environment 2010: 13 spills.
16 of these were hydrocarbon spills 2010: seven spills.
Four of these hydrocarbon spills were greater than one barrel with the remainder being minor in nature.
The largest of these was 5.4 barrels.
The total volume amounted to 2.7 tonnes 2010: 1.3 tonnes.
About 90 per cent 2.4 tonnes of this total was associated with the 13 spills at our production operations, and 0.3 tonnes with the three hydrocarbon spills at our drilling activities.
We maintain oil spill contingency plans for each of our operations and have ongoing contracts with oil spill response specialists to provide support in the unlikely event of a major incident.
Four other chemical spills occurred at our production operations in 2011 2010: six chemical spills totalling 1.3 tonnes 2010: 6.9 tonnes.
