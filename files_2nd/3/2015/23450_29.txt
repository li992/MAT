Corporate Governance The Board of the Company has considered the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance AIC Code by reference to the AIC Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies AIC Guide both of which were issued in February 2015.
The AIC Code as explained by the AIC Guide, addresses all of the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, which was issued in September 2014, as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues that are of specific relevance to the Company.
The Board considers that reporting against the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code and by reference to the AIC Guide which incorporates the UK Corporate Governance Code will provide better information to shareholders.
The Company has complied with the recommendations of the AIC Code and the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code during the year to 30 September 2015 except as set out below.
The UK Corporate Governance Code includes provisions relating to the role of chief executive, executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function.
For the reasons set out in the AIC Guide, and as explained in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board considers these provisions are not relevant to the position of the Company as it is an externally managed investment company.
In particular, all of the Companys day-to-day management and administrative functions are outsourced to third parties.
As a result, the Company has no executive Directors, employees or internal operations.
The Company has, therefore, not reported further in respect of these provisions.
The Board of Directors The Board comprised six Directors as at 30 September 2015, all of whom were non-executive.
Mr Roger Yates is Chairman of the Company.
The Board has nominated Dame Kate Barker as the Senior Independent Director.
The Directors terms of appointment are available for inspection on request from the Company Secretary.
It is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that there is effective stewardship of the Companys affairs.
The Board has agreed a schedule of matters reserved for its specific approval, which includes a regular review of the Companys management arrangements with Electra Partners.
Management agreements between the Company and Electra Partners set out the matters for which Electra Partners is responsible and those over which Electra Partners has authority in accordance with the policies and directions of the Board.
Regular Board meetings are held to consider, as appropriate, such matters as overall strategy, investment performance, gearing, share price performance, share price discount, the shareholder profile of the Company and communication with shareholders.
The Chairman is responsible for setting the Boards agenda and ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion on all agenda items, in particular strategic issues.
The Board considers that it meets sufficiently regularly to discharge its duties effectively.
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees of the Board held during the year and the attendance of the individual Directors at those meetings is shown in the table below.

Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 125 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview The Board receives information that it considers to be sufficient and appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties.
Directors receive board papers several days in advance of Board meetings and are able to consider in detail the Companys performance and any issues to be discussed at the relevant meeting.
The Directors believe that the Board has an appropriate balance of skills and experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable it to provide effective strategic leadership and proper governance of the Company.
Information about the Directors, including their relevant experience, can be found on pages 134 to 135.
Independence of the Board Mr Yates, Mr Perkin and Mr Cullinan were non-executive Directors of Electra Private Equity Investments PLC throughout the year.
Electra Private Equity Investments PLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electra which was established solely for the purpose of issuing and redeeming Zero Dividend Preference shares.
The Board has carefully considered the independence of each Director under the provisions of the AIC Code and, notwithstanding the cross-directorships detailed above, has concluded that each Director is wholly independent on the basis that the Board firmly believes that independence is a state of mind and the character and judgement which accompany this are distinct from and are not compromised by cross-directorships.
The Board carries out a formal appraisal process of its own operations and performance and those of its Committees each year.
The Boards policy is that this review should be externally facilitated every three years, as required by the Code.
An externally facilitated review was last carried out in 2012, when the Board commissioned Boardroom Review to carry out an  evaluation of its operations and performance and those of its Committees.
Issues covered included Board composition, meeting arrangements and communication.
Boardroom Review presented a detailed report to the Board on the conclusions of its evaluation and these were discussed with the Board.
The report did not identify any material weaknesses or concerns.
Both the former and current Chairmen have led on implementing those changes recommended by Boardroom Review that the Board considered should be made.
Since 2012, the Board has carried out an annual evaluation of its operations and performance and those of its Committees through questionnaires which were completed by Directors, the results of which were discussed by the Board.
The process is considered by the Board to be constructive in identifying areas for improving the functioning and performance of the Board and its Committees.
The Board has concluded that its performance and that of its Committees is satisfactory.
The Board has recently commissioned BoardAlpha to carry out an  evaluation of its operations and performance and those of its Committees.
BoardAlpha is expected to report the results of the evaluation to the Board at its next meeting, following which the Directors will consider any recommendations made regarding the functioning and performance of the Board and its Committees.
BoardAlpha does not have any other connection with the Company.
The Chairman has considered the performance of each of the Directors during the year and the Board, under the leadership of the Senior Independent Director, has similarly considered the Chairmans performance.
Relevant matters considered included attendance and participation at Board and Committee meetings, commitment to Board activities and the effectiveness of the contribution made by the relevant Director.
As a result of this process, the Chairman has confirmed that all of the Directors, all of whom currently intend to retire and offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2016, continue to be effective and that all of them continue to show commitment to his or her role.
The Senior Independent Director has also confirmed the continuing effectiveness and commitment of the Chairman.
Directors Terms of Appointment The Companys Articles of Association require that Directors shall retire and be subject to appointment by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment by the Board and be subject to re-election at least every third year thereafter.
Directors who have served for more than nine years and who wish to continue in office are required to submit themselves for re-election annually.
The Board does not believe that length of service disqualifies a Director from seeking re-election.
In accordance with the AIC Codes provisions on the re-election of Directors, which state that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual re-election by shareholders, the Boards policy is that Directors should be re-elected annually.
In accordance with this policy all Directors were re-elected at the Annual General Meeting held in March 2015.
126 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 Re-election of Directors In accordance with the Boards policy on Directors Terms of Appointment, all the Directors currently intend to retire at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2016 and to offer themselves for re-election.
Biographical details of the Directors are set out on pages 134 to 135.
Independent Professional Advice Individual Directors may seek independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties at the Companys expense within certain parameters.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
Company Secretary Frostrow Capital LLP acted as the independent Company Secretary in addition to its role as Board Advisor during the year under review.
The Audit Committee The Board is supported by the Audit Committee which comprised all the Directors during the year, other than the Chairman of the Board, Mr Yates.
Mr Perkin is Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee met three times in the year under review and the report of its activities is contained in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 130 to 131.
The Committee has written terms of reference which are available on the Companys website.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises all the Directors of the Company, all of whom are considered to be independent.
The Board considers it appropriate, given the number of Directors, that the Committee should comprise all Directors.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee was chaired by Dame Kate Barker throughout the year.
The Committee did not meet in the year under review as there were no matters for its consideration.
The report on its activities is contained in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 120 to 124.
The Committees duties in relation to remuneration include determining and agreeing with the Board the policy for remuneration of the Directors.
Where appropriate, the Committee will consider both the need to judge the position of the Company relative to other companies regarding the remuneration of Directors and the need to appoint external remuneration consultants.
The Committees duties in relation to nomination include identifying and nominating, for the approval of the Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies based on merit and against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board including gender.
The Companys policy on diversity is further detailed in the Strategic Report.
The Valuations Committee The Valuations Committee adds a further level of oversight to the valuation process carried out by Electra Partners under its contractual arrangements with the Company.
The Valuations Committee is chaired by Dame Kate Barker and comprised all the Directors during the year, other than the Chairman of the Board, Mr Yates.
The Committee met twice during the year.
Management Engagement Committee The Management Engagement Committee is chaired by Mr Cullinan.

Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 127 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview Induction and Training New Directors are provided with an induction programme which is tailored to the particular circumstances of the appointee and which includes being briefed fully about the Company by the Chairman, senior executives of Electra Partners and the Company Secretary.
Following appointment, the Chairman regularly reviews and agrees with Directors their training and development needs as necessary to enable them to discharge their duties.
The Companys Relationship with its Shareholders The Company places great importance on communication with its shareholders.

Meetings are held with principal shareholders to discuss relevant issues as they arise.

The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director can be contacted either through the Company Secretary, Frostrow Capital LLP, at Southampton Buildings, London WC2A 1AL or at the Companys registered office at Paternoster House, 65 St Pauls Churchyard, London EC4M 8AB.
Risk Management and Internal Controls The Manager, as AIFM of the Company under AIFMD, is responsible for risk management and the ongoing process of identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing the risks facing the Company in accordance with AIFMD.
This process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and accords with the FRCs Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting published in September 2014.
The Board keeps the Managers performance of these responsibilities under review as part of its overall responsibility for the Companys risk management and internal control and includes the review of internal controls related to the financial reporting process which has been delegated to the Audit Committee.
The Board has carried out an annual review of the effectiveness of the Companys system of risk management and internal control for the year ended 30 September 2015 and concluded from the information reviewed that there were no significant failings or weaknesses.
Risk Appetite The Business Model and Investment Strategy, as further detailed in the Strategic Report, provide the Company with one of the most flexible mandates in the private equity sector.
This means that the Company invests across the full range of private equity opportunities, in any sector and across the capital structure.
The Manager can therefore adapt its implementation of the Investment Strategy given changing investment conditions and opportunities.
The Carried Interest Schemes as further detailed in Note 22 and 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements are structured to try to foster the desired balance between risk and return.
The Manager is obliged to put a reasonable amount of its own capital against each investment on a pari passu basis with Electra.
The Carried Interest Schemes in place since 2006 take account of the time value of money and the mix and diversity of investments as they are based on pools of investments made in consecutive three year periods and have a hurdle of 8%.
The Board carefully reviews the activities and performance of the Manager, in particular through the Management Engagement Committee and considers that the Manager has the culture and willingness to take on appropriate risk to implement the Companys Investment Strategy and that this culture is embedded.
128 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 Reporting by Manager to the Board in respect of Risk Management and Internal Control The Board receives monthly Managers Reports from the Manager.
These Reports include detailed information relating to risk management and liquidity risk management of the Company and are the primary mechanism the Manager has in place to evidence that it is fulfilling its obligation as AIFM to manage the risks facing the Company.
By reviewing these Reports the Board is also evidencing its monitoring of the risks facing Electra.
The Board receives and reviews the certificates verifying compliance with documented controls provided by Electra Partners on a six monthly basis.
Additionally the external auditors perform certain agreed upon procedures regarding these controls.
Operation of Risk Management and Internal Controls As detailed in the Strategic Report, the Principal Risks facing the Company are considered by both the Board and the Manager to be Macroeconomic Risks, Gearing Risks, Foreign Currency Risks, Long-Term Strategic Risks, Investment Risks, Portfolio Diversification Risk, Valuation Risk and Operational Risk along with the risks detailed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
The Board and the Manager regularly consider the changes in the nature, likelihood and impact of the Principal Risks along with the Companys ability to respond to changes in its business and the external environment.
As required under the AIFMD, the AIFM must assess the appropriateness of the risk of each investment at the time of making the investment.
Responsibility for this is undertaken by the Partners of the Manager, but is sponsored by a Partner who is independent of the investment team responsible for that investment.
The valuations of investments are carried out by the Manager in accordance with the Companys Principles of Valuation of Investments as detailed on pages 98 to 100.
Again, Partners independent of each particular investment are responsible for authorising the valuation.
Additionally, as described above, the Valuations Committee of the Company also adds a further level of oversight to the valuation process of the Manager.
Since investment management, custody of assets and many administrative systems are provided or arranged for the Company by Electra Partners, the Companys system of internal control mainly comprises the monitoring of the services provided by Electra Partners, including the operating controls established by them to ensure they meet the Companys business objectives.
As part of this process Electra Partners is responsible for submitting performance statistics, investment valuations and management accounts to the Board.
The key elements designed to provide effective internal control are as follows: Financial Reporting regular and comprehensive review by the Board of key investment and financial data, including management accounts, revenue projections, analyses of transactions and performance comparisons.
Investment Strategy regular review by the Board of the Companys Objective and Investment Policy, including commitments to new funds.
Management Agreements and Investment Performance the Board regularly monitors the performance of Electra Partners to ensure that the Companys assets are managed in accordance with the Companys Objective and Investment Policy.
The Board considers the Companys system of risk management and internal control to be integrated with the Companys Business Model and Investment Strategy.
Public Reporting The Companys consolidated annual Financial Statements, along with the half-yearly Financial Statements, Quarterly Update Reports and other RNS releases are prepared in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Voting Policy Under the investment management agreements Electra Partners has complete discretion in relation to all voting issues in respect of the Companys investments.
Electra Partners has adopted the UK Stewardship Code and has made disclosures regarding its policies on stewardship on its website www.
Electra Partners policies on stewardship have been reviewed and endorsed by the Board.
