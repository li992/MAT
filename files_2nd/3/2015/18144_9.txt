In respect of IFRS 15 the Group is undertaking an assessment of the impact of this standard.
In respect of IFRS 9, it is not practical provide an estimate of the effect of this 2.4 Investment properties standard until it is effective.
Investment properties are those properties held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
Additions to investment properties comprise costs of a capital nature: in the case of investment properties under development, these include capitalised interest and certain staff costs directly attributable to the management of the development.
Capitalised interest is calculated at the rate on associated borrowings applied to direct expenditure between the date of gaining planning consent and the date of practical completion.
The acquisition of an investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group, typically on unconditional exchange of contracts or when legal title passes.
Investment properties are carried at fair value, based on market value as determined by professional external valuers at the balance sheet date.
Investment properties being redeveloped for continuing use as investment properties, or for which the market has become less active, continue to be classified as investment properties and measured at fair value.
Changes in fair values are recognised in profit before tax.

iii Cash and cash equivalents The following are the critical estimates and judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
i Fair value of investment properties iv Trade and other receivables and payables The Group uses the valuations performed by its independent external valuers as the fair value of its investment properties.
The valuations are based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is development costs and an appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the receivable in full.

ii Listed corporate bonds v Borrowings The best evidence of the fair value of listed corporate bonds is quoted prices in an active market.
The bond market is not Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are stated always as liquid as conventional equity markets.
The Group, therefore, is required to make certain judgements when arriving at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being at the fair value of bonds which are less liquid in nature.
To the extent that bond prices are not available from third party recognised in profit before tax over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

ii Service charge income iii Income Taxes Service charge income is recognised on a gross basis in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
The Group is subject to income taxes in different jurisdictions and estimation is required to determine the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which determination is made.
