4.2 of the Code, the non-executive directors also met without the executives present during the year.
BOARD EVALUATION The directors recognise that the Code requires an external evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies to be carried out at least every three years.
However, the directors considered the position in relation to the current year and concluded that an external evaluation was not necessary.
In reaching this conclusion the directors were mindful of the effective operation of the Board during the year and the results of the internal Board evaluation exercise detailed below.
The Board considers it unlikely that an external evaluation will be conducted in the medium term.
An internal evaluation of the Board for the current year was conducted through the completion of formal detailed board, and board committee evaluation questionnaires by each director.
In addition a review involving each director was carried out.
This review was conducted by the Deputy Chairman and Company Secretary and principally covered the following areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board evaluation questionnaires, individual directors performances and key objectives for the coming year, and the identification of any specific training and development requirements.
The evaluation questionnaires were focussed on assessing effectiveness in the following key areas: the size and balance of the Board: the quality of board debates and its decision making processes: 38 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements the individual contributions made by each director: the Chairmans approach to leadership: the non-executive directors challenge of the executive directors: the Boards approach to identifying and mitigating key business risks: the quality of the Companys communications with key stakeholders: the Boards consideration of diversity and succession planning: and the induction and training of board members.
6.3 of the Code and building on the results of the evaluation questionnaires, the Deputy Chairman led a separate evaluation of the performance of the Chairman.
This evaluation principally comprised a review of the Chairmans leadership style and tone in promoting effective decisionmaking and ensuring constructive and sufficient debate took place around key issues.
The results of this evaluation were entirely satisfactory.
The evaluation concluded that overall the Board and its Committees had operated satisfactorily during the year, with all directors making an effective contribution to the Board commensurate with their experience and responsibilities.
However, the evaluation identified that succession planning, and in particular the need to strengthen the independent non executive presence on the Board, was required in the current year.
As such the Nomination Committee is in the process of identifying potential non-executive candidates for appointment to the Board in the short term.
BOARD BALANCE AND DIVERSITY The Board remains comprised of three executive directors and three independent non-executive directors.
Chris Houghton, former Finance Director, resigned from the Board on 3 October 2014 and was replaced by Nick Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015.
Julian Schild acts as the Companys Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
Membership of each committee of the Board is set out in the table below: NAME OF DIRECTOR REMUNERATION AUDIT NOMINATION COMMITTEE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE 3 Charles Wigoder - - 3 3 Julian Schild Chairman Andrew Lindsay - - - Nick Schoenfeld - - - 3 3 Melvin Lawson - 3 Michael Pavia Chairman Chairman indicates independent non-executive directors Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 39 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED The Board, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, regularly reviews whether the composition of the Board and the diversity of its members remain appropriate in the light of the commercial challenges and risks facing the Company.
The members of the Nomination Committee believe that the composition of the Board is currently appropriate for the size of the Company and the nature of its operations which have not materially changed in scope since the prior year.
However, consistent with the requirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Nomination Committee has been implementing its plan for independent non-executive director succession in the near future, to reflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006.
Further detail of the Committees activities during the year is set out in the Nomination Committee report on page 44.
The main objective of the Nomination Committee in considering the appointment of new directors to the Board remains to ensure that successful candidates are of the highest calibre and demonstrate the best possible combination of skills and experience.
The Committees Terms of Reference further stipulate that candidates from a wide range of backgrounds shall be considered and that due regard will be given to the benefits of diversity on the Board.
The Code requires companies to set out any measurable objectives that exist in relation to Board diversity.
However, it remains the Committees strong view that it is not appropriate to stipulate the characteristics of any future directors, including gender, ahead of a full assessment of the particular requirements of each role at the time a candidate is being sought.
The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out above in identifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory manner.
Further detail regarding the Companys position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the organisation is set out in the People and Organisation section of the Strategic Report on pages 30 to 32.
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company with the Executive Chairman responsible for developing the strategic direction of the business and ensuring the effective operation of the Board, including compliance with principles of good corporate governance, and the Chief Executive primarily responsible for implementing strategy and running the Groups operations on a day to day basis.
As appropriate, and in order to ensure good corporate governance, the Executive Chairman is assisted by the Companys independent non-executive Deputy Chairman in ensuring compliance with the effective operation of the Board.
The division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive has been set out in writing and agreed by the Board in accordance with the Code provision A.
SUPPLY OF INFORMATION Information is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in advance of meetings.
When the Board requests additional information it is provided.
40 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements RE-ELECTION The Companys Articles stipulate that one third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.
However, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Therefore all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in August.
Acknowledging the Code requirement for a particularly rigorous review in circumstances where non-executive directors terms are being extended beyond six years, the Board has determined that all directors continue to make a valuable contribution to the commercial success of the Company, with each bringing a complementary range of skills to the team.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration of executive directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre.
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, namely Julian Schild Chairman of the Committee, Melvin Lawson and Michael Pavia.
The Directors Remuneration Report, giving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 50 to 71.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 41 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS It is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them informed about the objectives of the business.
The Board considers that it is appropriate for the executive directors to discuss any relevant matters regarding company performance with major shareholders and this is undertaken primarily by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.
The Chief Executive provides feedback from major shareholders to the other directors, in order to ensure that Board members, and in particular non-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors.
The executive directors met with a number of the Companys main shareholders during the year.
The Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer also have periodic discussions with the Companys brokers and issues are fed back to the Board as appropriate.
When reports are received from the Companys brokers following investor presentations, these are submitted to the Board for review.
Additionally the non-executive directors have at least one opportunity each year to meet with the Companys brokers to discuss any issues.
Responsibility for communication with key shareholders in relation to corporate governance and Board remuneration matters lies primarily with the Deputy Chairman who is assisted in this regard by the Company Secretary.
Individual invitations to engage with the Deputy Chairman have previously been sent out to key shareholders and, where requested or considered necessary, certain matters have been discussed in more detail during the year.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 21 working days before the meeting.
Separate resolutions are proposed for each matter including the adoption of the Report and Accounts, the approval of the Companys Remuneration Policy, the Directors Remuneration Report and the appointment of the Groups external auditor.
Proxy votes are counted and the meeting is advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution.
The chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees and the remaining non-executive directors are normally available to answer questions.
Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting.
INTERNAL CONTROL The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Groups systems of internal control and risk management.
However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The principal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address these risks are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 29.
In conjunction with the Companys senior management team, the executive directors regularly identify, review and evaluate the key risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in place to mitigate these risks.
The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets out a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk.
The document is reported to the Audit Committee and the Companys external auditor for review at least once per year.
42 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Company including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management and the principal risks which the Company faces during the year.
No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year.
The disclosures regarding internal controls do not encompass the Companys investment in the associate Opus Energy Group Limited.
SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS Details of the Companys share capital and substantial shareholdings can be found in the Directors Report under the capital structure and substantial shareholders sections on pages 74 and 75.
