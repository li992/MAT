with the relevant skills and experience, is appointed.
We value the contribution made by Mr. Becht and welcome the As a result, this leaves two members on the Committee.
C. 3.1 There are two members on the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Board has decided that, given the professional Since 1 January 2015 JAB Luxury continues to be the majority background, experience and contribution offered by the shareholder of Jimmy Choo PLC and the Company represents a twomembers of the Committee, it is not necessary to significant investment to JAB Luxury 67.68%.
The Board and extend membership of the Committee further at this point.
JABLuxury are mindful of the need to consider the interests of the The Board will keep this under regular review.
The Board believes that the Boardand its Committees, with the addition of the new Independent Non-Executive Directors, will provide the appropriate corporate governance balance in light of the interests of both the majority shareholder and the minority shareholders.
All members of the Auditand Risk Committee are Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Conflicts Committee assists in the management of the relationship between the Company and its majority shareholder.
Further details of these measures are contained within this report.
Under the existing Relationship Agreement between JAB Luxury andthe Company, JAB Luxury is able to appoint up to one half of theBoard while it continues to own 50% or more of the Companys shares.
Further details of the Relationship Agreement can be found on page 55.
The Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards in place in the structures and processes implemented to consider and protect the interests of independent shareholders.
The Company does have a number of areas in which it does not fully follow the recommendations of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code.
These are that the Board has established a joint Remuneration and Nominations Committee, rather than separate Remuneration and Nominations Committees, which is not made up solely of Independent Non-Executive Directors and there are two members inthe Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration and Nominations Committee.
Again, the Board believes that these departures from the Code are reasonable in the circumstances of Jimmy Choos ownership.
The Board is considering ways in which itcan address further recommendations in 2016.
This report includes a description of how the Company has applied the principles of the Code during the year and how it intends to apply those principles throughout 2016.
