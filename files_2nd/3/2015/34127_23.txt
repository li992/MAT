Where changes are required, it is also responsible for the identification, selection and proposal to the Board for approval of persons suitable for appointment or reappointment to the Board, whether as Executive or Non-Executive Directors and to seek approval from the Remuneration Committee to the remuneration and terms and conditions of service of any proposed Executive Director appointment.
The Chairman of the Committee presents reports to the Board as appropriate to enable the Board as a whole to agree the appointments of new Directors.
The Committee meets at least once a year and otherwise as required and as determined by its members.

They are also available for inspection at the Companys AGM.
Board performance evaluation In the prior year, the Board engaged Lomond Consulting to undertake an evaluation of the performance of the Board and its Committees.
The aim was to seek to identify areas where the performance and the procedures of the Board may be improved.
The scope of the review was agreed between the Chairman of the Committee and the Chief Executive.
Each Director completed a questionnaire on the performance of the Board, its Committees and the Chairman.
The responses were anonymous to enable an open and honest sharing of views.
Lomond Consulting then produced a reporting showing the results of the review.
The Board has committed to carry out an external performance evaluation every three years.
In the intervening years the Board undertakes an evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committee and its individual members, with reference to the most recent external evaluation of its performance.
During the current year, the Chairman evaluated the performance of the Executive Directors, and the performance of the Chairman was evaluated by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
It was considered that the individuals, the Committees and the Board as a whole were operating effectively, with appropriate procedures put in place for minor areas identified for improvement.
Succession planning The Board comprises a team of four Executive Directors, two of whom were co-founders of the Company, complemented by Non-Executive Directors who have wide business experience and skills as well as a detailed understanding of the Groups philosophy and strategy.
Continuity of experience and knowledge, particularly of self storage, within the executive team is particularly important in a focused long-term business such as Big Yellow.
It is a key responsibility of the Committee to advise the Board on succession planning.
The Committee ensures that any future changes in the Boards composition are foreseen and effectively managed.
In the event of unforeseen changes, the Committee ensures that management and oversight of the Groups business and long-term strategy will not be affected.
The Committee also addresses the development and continuity of the Senior Management team below Board level.
62 Policy on diversity All aspects of diversity, including gender are considered at every level of recruitment.
All appointments to the Board are made on merit.
The Boards policy states that the Board seeks a composition with the right balance of skills and diversity to meet the demands of the business.
The Board does not consider that quotas are appropriate for its representation and has therefore chosen not to set targets.
Gender diversity of the Board and Company is set out below senior management are defined to be Heads of Department : 100% 11% 90% 41% 80% 45% 70% Female 60% 50% 89% Male 40% 59% 55% 30% 20% 10% 0% Board Senior All Management employees Directors standing for re-election All of the Directors will retire in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and will offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
Following a performance appraisal process, the Board has concluded that the Directors retiring by rotation are effective, committed to their roles and operate as effective members of the Board.
The Board, on the advice of the Committee, therefore recommends the re-election of each Director standing for re-election.
Full biographical details of each Director are available on page 54.
