Robert performs a vital role as Chairman of the Audit Committee and we wanted to maintain continuity of Audit Committee leadership through the external audit tender process and transition period for the new external auditor.

careers to our employees, each of which can be independently veried, and which give clear line-of-sight to the Executives.
The financial measure which we give most emphasis to is D-EPS.
The threshold D-EPS, at which level Executive Directors would start to receive bonus was set at 83.86 pence, with budget D-EPS at 88.27 Performance outcomes for 2015 pence.
The actual outcome was 69.1 pence on a constant currency basis, which meant that no bonus was payable on that element.

However, as noted above, if EPS performance is below threshold, the Committee has discretion to reduce the For 2015, annual bonus payments were determined as to 80% amount of annual bonus that would be paid under the personal based on financial performance and, for the first time, 20% based strategic element.

Therefore, none of the performance element of the 2013 awards will vest: only the matching element, equivalent in each case to 15% of salary at the time of grant will vest.
Further details of LTIPs which vested in 2015 are included in the table on page 87.
Pay reviews for 2016 In June 2015, the Company announced a new organisational structure, with the appointment of Asterios Satrazemis as President of the Rental Solutions business.
Given his new responsibilities, the Committee reviewed his base salary, taking into account the scope and size of the new Rental Solutions business and his global remit for Sales & Marketing and Global Events.
Having considered comparable roles with our advisers, we agreed that the base pay for Asterios Satrazemis should be increased from $556,200 to $605,000 8.8% increase.
The increase took effect from 1 August 2015.
Considering the context of a challenging performance year and a significant cost reduction programme, the Committee decided that it would not generally be appropriate for Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee to receive salary increases as part of the December 2015 review, which would usually take effect from January 2016.
However, as we explained in last years Annual Remuneration Statement, we committed to undertake a more detailed review for Carole Cran, in particular, once she was fully established in her role as Chief Financial officer.
In view of Caroles excellent performance and this commitment, the Committee conducted an external benchmarking exercise and proposed a base salary increase of 9.2% which would have positioned her at the market median in line with our policy and an increase in her maximum bonus opportunity for 2016 from 150% to 175% of base salary.
However, given the challenges of 2015, Carole has said that she does not wish to receive the proposed base salary increase.
The annual bonus for 2016 will operate broadly on the same basis as in 2015, with financial performance measured against D-EPS and operating cash ow accounting for 80% of total opportunity and the remaining 20% measured against personal strategic objectives.
Awards under the Long-term Incentive Plan will be made at the same level as the previous year.

Bonus payments are payable as to 75% in cash, and as to 25% deferred into shares for three years unless, at the discretion of the Committee, theindividual leaves with the Companys consent.
The Committee has discretion to reduce the number of shares that can vest in the event of gross misconduct or material misstatement of the accounts.
The targets under the 2015 annual bonus scheme were based as to 80% on financial performance measures set against the annual budget atthe start of the year and as to 20% against personal strategic objectives.
Financial performance measures The financial objectives for the Chief Executive officer Chris Weston and the Chief Financial officer Carole Cran were measured as to 75% against D-EPS and as to 25% against operating cash ow.
The financial objectives for Directors with regional responsibilities were based as to 50% on the performance of the Group, measured against Group D-EPS and as to 50% on the performance of their regions, measured as to 40%against regional trading profit and 10% against regional ROCE.
The initial regional financial elements of the bonus were based on the 2015 full year outcome.
However, following the reorganisation announced in June, the three regions ceased to exist and so the Committee decided thatregional performance would be measured based on the July full year forecast.
For these financial measures, Executive Directors would start to earn a bonus at threshold performance, calculated as a percentage below budget, increasing to half of the maximum that could be earned under that element at budget on a straight-line basis.
The bonus would then increase on a straight-line basis to the maximum, calculated as a percentage above budget.

OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS & OTHER INFORMATION AGGREKO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 87 Long-term Incentive Plan The LTIP awards which are due to vest on 5 August 2016 were granted in 2013 under the old LTIP, which expired in 2014.
The old LTIP consists oftwo distinct elements: the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Co-investment Plan CIP.
The PSP is a nil-cost conditional award of shares which vest depending on performance against the targets: it provides for annual awards of performance shares up to an aggregate limit of 100% of salary in normal circumstances and 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
The CIP is a Co-investment plan, whose purpose it is to encourage executives to buy and hold shares in the Company.
Participants can subscribe to purchase Aggreko shares up to a value of 30% of their salary, each year that they are invited to join the CIP: if they hold those shares for three years or, if earlier, the date that their CIP award vests, they will be entitled to receive a minimum award of one share for every two they subscribed the Minimum Match, plus a performance-related award of a further three shares for every two they subscribed.
The Minimum Match is not subject to performance conditions.
The PSP and CIP are both measured against performance over three financial years and they share the same performance criteria.
These are thereal compound annual growth rate of Diluted Earnings per Share D-EPS, and Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
The performance criteria for the LTIP awards granted in 2013 were as follows: 75% of the award was based on CPI ination-adjusted compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period in a range of 3% to 10%.
No performance shares would be awarded against this element if performance was below 3% and awards would increase straight-line to the maximum at 10% growth: and 25% of the award was based on average ROCE over the performance period in a range of 20% to 25%.
No performance shares would be awarded against this element if performance was below 20% and awards would increase straight-line to the maximum at 25% ROCE.
In addition to the above, and to reward truly exceptional performance, the number of shares awarded to participants in both elements of the 2013 LTIP might be increased by between one and two times if the real compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period was in a range of 10% to 20%.
The performance period for the 2013 LTIP awards ended on 31 December 2015.
Over the period: Aggrekos aggregate D-EPS was 251.9 pence, which is the equivalent of no growth.
Since this was less than the threshold of 3%, no shares willvest under this performance measure: and Aggrekos actual average ROCE for the period was 19%.
Since this was less than the threshold of 20%, no shares will vest under this performance measure.
Accordingly, only the Minimum Match will vest.
The table below shows: the resulting vesting of the 2013 LTIP awards.
These are due to vest in August 2016: and by way of comparison the vesting of the 2012 LTIP awards which vested in April 2015.

The value of the 2012 LTIP on vesting is based on the market price of Aggreko shares on date of vesting, 16 April 2015, of 1621 pence.

Percentage change in remuneration of CEO The table below shows the change in remuneration of the Director undertaking the role of Chief Executive officer for 2014 Angus Cockburn, Interim Chief Executive and for 2015 Chris Weston, Chief Executive officer in comparison to the average change in remuneration of employees within the Group central functions over that period.

The comparator group relates to the employees within the Group central function in the UK 103 employees, rather than all Group employees.
As in the previous year, we have chosen this group because the Committee believes that it provides a sufciently large comparator group to give a reasonable understanding of underlying increases, based on similar annual bonus performance measures utilised by Group central functions, whilst reducing the distortion that would arise from including all of the many countries in which the Group operates, with their different economic conditions.
