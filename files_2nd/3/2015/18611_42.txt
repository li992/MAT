The programme included seeking feedback from all major Shareholders on remuneration-related matters and meetings were also held with certain prominent proxy voting agencies.
A relatively consistent comment received as part of the feedback process related to the extent and clarity of retrospective disclosure in relation to Directors bonus targets.
In particular, that the level of transparency of the composition of such targets could be enhanced.
The Committee has taken significant care in ensuring that the narrative and disclosure levels in this years report have been brought into line with the best practice expectations of investors as we understand them and have been expanded accordingly to address this issue.
The Committee also took on board other suggestions during the engagement process for how we might bring our packages further into line with the best practice expectations of investors.
The feedback gathered informed the Committees decision to adopt recovery and withholding provisions into the incentive arrangements during the year.
