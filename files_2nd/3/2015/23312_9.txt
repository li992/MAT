Audit Committee Activities The Committee meets three times a year to review the internal financial and non-financial controls and, when applicable, the contents of the half-yearly and annual financial reports, including accounting policies.
In addition, the Committee reviews the auditors independence, objectivity and effectiveness, the quality of the services provided to the Company and, together with the Manager, reviews the Companys compliance with financial reporting and regulatory requirements as well as risk management processes.
Representatives of the Managers Compliance and Internal Audit Departments attend at least two meetings each year.
Representatives of the auditor, KPMG LLP, attend the Committee meetings at which the draft half-yearly and annual financial reports are reviewed and are given the opportunity to speak to Committee members in the absence of representatives of the Manager.
The audit programme and timetable are drawn up and agreed with the auditor in advance of the end of the financial period and matters for audit focus are discussed and agreed.
The auditor ensures that these matters are given particular attention during the audit process and reports on them, and other matters as required, in its report to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee reviews any material issues raised by the auditor.
There have been no such issue raised during the year.
The auditors report, together with reports from the Manager, the Managers Internal Audit and Compliance Departments, and from the depositary, form the basis of the Committees consideration and discussions with the various parties and any recommendations to the Board, including the Committees recommendation to sign the 2015 financial statements.

The allocation of management The allocation is reviewed by the Committee annually taking into and finance costs to capital.
account the long-term split of returns from the portfolio, both historic and projected: yield: the objective of the Company: and the latest market practice of peers.
These matters were discussed with the Manager and the auditor in pre year end audit planning, and were satisfactorily addressed through consideration of reports provided by, and discussed with, the Manager and the auditor at the conclusion of the audit process.
Consequently, and following a thorough review process of the 2015 annual financial report, the Audit Committee advised the Board that the report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be present at the AGM to answer questions relating to the annual financial report.
Review of the External Auditor, including Non-Audit Services and Re-appointment The Committee evaluated the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and their audit process.
This included a review of the audit planning, execution and reporting and the quality of the audit work, results and audit team.
This review sought the view of the Manager in their dealings with the auditor.
The Committee also considered the independence of KPMG LLP KPMG and the objectivity of the audit process.
In addition, the Committee reviewed the FRCs 2014 Audit Quality Inspection report and queried with KPMG any items which might have been of relevance to the Company.
From these reviews, and the Audit Committee Chairmans and the Committees direct interaction with KPMG, the Committee concluded that it continued to be satisfied with the performance of KPMG and that they continued to display the necessary attributes of objectivity and independence.
Prior to any engagement for non-audit services, the Audit Committee consider whether the skills and experience of the auditor make them a suitable supplier of such services and ensures there is no threat to objectivity and independence in the conduct of the audit as a result.
Excluding VAT and any expenses, the annual audit fee was 19,765 2014: 19,765 and the non-audit fee was 6,500 2014: 6,500 : this latter item covered the review of the half-yearly financial report and the annual certificate of compliance to the trustees of the debenture stock.
The Committee does not believe that this has impaired the auditors independence and objectivity.
Non-audit services up to 5,000 do not require approval in advance of the Audit Committee: amounts in excess of this require the approval of the Audit Committee.
16310 Edinburgh pp19 22 16310 Edinburgh pp19 22 26 05 2015 13:19 Page 22 22 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued In 2013 the Audit Committee placed the audit out to tender and, after detailed consideration of submissions from a number of audit firms, the Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of the incumbent, KPMG, under the remit of the new audit engagement partner.
Under European legislation, mandatory auditor rotation will be implemented.
The Company was incorporated in 1889 and the tenure of KPMG including its predecessor firms is at least fifty years.
Transition arrangements for companies where the auditor has been in place for twenty years or more mean that the Company, having undertaken an audit tender, will not be required to tender or rotate the auditor until after the year ended 31 March 2020.
However, the Committee will keep the situation under review.
Resolutions proposing the reappointment of KPMG LLP as the Companys auditor for the year to 31 March 2016 and authorising the Audit Committee to determine its remuneration will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM Internal Controls and Risk Management The Committee assessed the risks arising in relation to the Companys operations and identified the controls exercised to mitigate them by the Board and its delegates the Manager and other service providers.
These are recorded in the Companys risk matrix which effectively highlights and monitors the principal risks, details of which are provided in the Strategic Report.
The Committee also received and considered, together with representatives of the Manager, reports in relation to the operational controls of the investment manager, accounting administrator, custodian, company secretary and registrar.
These reviews identified no issues of significance in the last year.
Internal Audit The Company, being an externally managed investment company with no executive employees and in view of the Manager having an internal audit function, does not have its own internal audit function.
Committee Evaluation The Committees activities formed part of the review of Board effectiveness performed in the year.
Details of this process can be found under Board, Committee and Directors Performance Appraisal on page 25.
