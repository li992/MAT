These share prices are used to determine the number of awards granted, as well as to setoption exercise prices.
The face value of the ESOS options shown in this column has not been reduced to reflect the fact that the aggregate option price is payable on exercise.
The face value of the BIP awards is calculated using the average price of participants investment shares purchased by the trustee on 2 April 2015.
For the matching award to Erik Engstrom, who invested in NV ADRs, the price per NV ADR was $50.136 and for the matching award to Nick Luff, who invested in PLC and NV ordinary shares, the price per PLC ordinary share was 11.530 and the price per NV ordinary share was 23.060.
The 2015 grants were made in April and therefore the share prices above reflect the position prior to the change in the equalisation ratio and bonus share issue that took effect from 1 July 2015.
The face values for BIP and LTIP do not take into account the dividend equivalents relating to those awards.

For options vesting in line with expectations, a valuation factor of 20% of the face value of the award at grant has been applied.
3 Threshold payout levels for each measure have been included.
Where there are multiple measures, it is possible to achieve threshold, and hence payout, in respect of just one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three TSR comparator groups.
The performance measures and targets for awards granted in 2015 under each of the plans are set out on page 83.
