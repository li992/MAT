We saw better volumes in the second half of the year relative to the weaker prior year period, which was impacted by the falling raw material price environment in Q4 2014.
Whilst total volumes have increased year-on-year, the sterling selling price per unit has fallen mainly reflecting the weakness in the Euro and lower raw material prices due to the reduced price of Brent crude oil.
As reported during the year, falling raw material prices generally have a modest favourable impact on our margins as there is a lag effect in our formulae-based pricing on passing the benefits of falling prices on to our customers.
Similarly, when raw material prices are rising, there is a modest adverse impact on our margins.
Whilst Q1 margins benefited from rapid decline in raw material prices at the end of 2014, raw material prices softened gradually during 2015 with no pronounced benefit or cost in subsequent quarters.
