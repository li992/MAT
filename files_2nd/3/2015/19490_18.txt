Salary and fees BASE SALARY The Executive Directors salaries are normally reviewed, but not necessarily increased, with effect from 1 March each year.
The committee reviewed the salary levels of Executive Directors during the year and the result of the review is shown below.
David Smiths increase reflected that his salary on appointment was positioned to allow scope for progression in the role and the increase made in the year reflects that progression.
The increase in March 2015 for Colin Smith reflected the importance of the role to the business along with the current modest positioning compared to the external market range.
No salary increases will be made for any Executive Directors in 2016.

C. Annual bonus Annual bonuses may be awarded under the Annual Performance Related Award plan APRA.
Executive Directors receive any annual bonus awarded in March following the performance period.
The bonus is paid partially in cash andpartially in deferred shares.
The deferred shares are held in trust for two years before being released, subject to the recipient being stillemployed by the Group.
Ordinary shares held as deferred shares may receive a bonus issue of C Shares during the deferral period.
Malus and clawback provisions apply from the date of deferral until three years after the release of shares where there is: a material misstatement of the audited results: failure of risk management: serious reputational damage to the Company as a result of misconduct: serious breach of the Companys global code of conduct: or gross misconduct.
APRA 2015 The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2015 outturn against the performance measures, which are shown overleaf, and determined that bonuses would not be payable this year in respect of performance in 2015.
The APRA bonus is determined by Group financial performance and personal performance.
The Group financial performance is based on the addition of the cash and profit outturns, with a specified minimum level to be achieved on both, after deduction of the cost of bonus from profit.
For 2015, the Group financial measures were cash flow performance and group underlying profit.
Levels for both of these measures and their outcome are shown overleaf.

To reflect the disposal of the Energy business, the December 2014 forecast cash and profit were added back to the 11 month actual results for bonus purposes.
For 2015 the base level of profit was set to be equivalent to target profit.
This was to take into account the cost of the all-employee bonus plan which was aligned to the base and target profit levels.
OUR APPROACH TO APRA IN 2016 Following consultation with shareholders at the start of 2016, the committee has determined that the bonus in respect of 2016 will be operated on similar terms to 2015, but with the introduction oftwo new measures relating to customer and employee engagement.
Anybonus in relation to the non-financial targets will be subject to achieving the underlying profit threshold.
The maximum bonus opportunities for Executive Directors will remain at 180% for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for other Executive Directors.
2016 WEIGHTINGS OF ANNUAL BONUS MEASURES Employee Maximum Profit Cash Customer engagement business outturn % % % % % Target 37.5 37.5 12.5 12.5 100 Base, target and maximum performance levels are set for all business measures and result in 30%, 60% and 100% outturns respectively.
The individual performance multiplier can increase or decrease the business outturn in a range of 0-120%.
D. Long-term incentives Performance Share Plan The PSP is designed to attract, reward and incentivise selected senior executives who can influence the long-term performance of the Group andexecute the business strategy.
Under the PSP, awards of shares are made annually at the start of a three-year performance period.
Vesting is subject to continued employment and achievement of Group performance conditions.
The number of shares vesting will be determined by the growth in aggregate cash flow per share CPS over the performance period.
CPS is calculated asreported cash flow before the cost of business acquisitions or proceeds of disposals, foreign exchange translation effects, special payments into pension schemes and payments to shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
CPS is cumulative over athree-year period.
A further performance measure is growth in TSR relative to the FTSE 100 or other appropriate index.
Where the Companys TSR is ranked above median in the comparator group, the shares vesting will be increased by 25%.
Where the ranking is at or within upper quartile, thevesting will be increased by 50%.
Between these two points, the increase will be on a straight-line basis.
The above measures are underpinned by growth in earnings per share EPS.
Growth in EPS must exceed the growth in an appropriate consumer price index over the performance period for any shares to vest.
PSP awards are conditional share awards and are usually made in March with the release date being in March of the year following the completion of the three-year performance period, subject tothe performance criteria being met.
Malus and clawback provisions apply where: there has been a material misstatement of audited results: serious financial irregularity which invalidates the targets set: reputational damage: material failure of risk management: a serious breach of the Companys global code of conduct: or individual grossmisconduct.
Clawback will apply for three years after the vesting of an award.
80 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 Directors Report Committee reports Directors Remuneration Report PSP 2015 AWARD CPS TARGETS AUDITED The cash flow per share targets for awards made in 2015 were as follows and straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Aggregate cash flow per share over the three-year period Maximum award released % Less than 60p 0 60p 30 100p 100 PSP AWARDS MADE IN MARCH AND SEPTEMBER 2015 In 2015, Executive Directors received PSP awards in line with the remuneration policy as follows: Number Performance Date of shares % of period of award awarded salary end date Warren East 01 09 2015 126,643 100 31 12 2017 Colin Smith 02 03 2015 58,263 100 31 12 2017 David Smith 02 03 2015 57,204 100 31 12 2017 All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over athree-day period before the date of grant, being 944p for the award on 2 March 2015 and 730p for the award on 1 September 2015.
Theface value is the maximum number of shares that would vest 150%ofthe award multiplied by the share price at the date of grant.
Ifthe EPS and base CPS targets are not achieved, no shares vest.
PSP AWARDS VESTING IN MARCH 2016 The following sets out details in respect of the March 2013 PSP award, for which the final year of performance was the 2015 financial year.
Subject to performance conditions, these shares would be due to vest in March 2016, three years after the award was made.

Aggregate CPS Aggregate CPS over three-year period of less than 56p zero vesting.
Aggregate CPS performance over three years of45p.
100% of award Aggregate CPS over three-year period of 94p 100% vesting.
Outcome None of the 2013 shares will vest in March 2016.
OUR APPROACH TO PSP IN 2016 Following consultation with shareholders in early 2016, the committee has confirmed that CPS and TSR measures will continue to determine the vesting level of PSPawards for 2016 as described on page 80.
The EPS hurdle will also apply, although we have adjusted the calculation ofthe EPS hurdle to reflect the very significant changes in our business environment and our financial forecasts, so that the measurement willbe based on two years performance from 2016.
Without such adjustments, the awards would have been inappropriate as they would be unlikely to vest.
To balance this, we have reduced the PSP award levels from a maximum of 180% to 150% ofsalary forthe ChiefExecutive and from a maximum of 150% to 130% of salary for other Executive Directors.
These targets have been chosen to ensure that the participants maintain focus on people and customers during the transformation of our business.
The performance targets in respect of the 2016 to 2018 performance period under the aggregate CPS measure will be as follows: PSP AWARDS TO BE MADE IN MARCH 2016 Aggregate CPS over the three-year period Maximum award released % Less than 10p 0 10p 30 50p 100 The stretch of these targets reflects that, during this period, we will be investing in ramping up Trent production, IT, new product technology and aftermarket capability, while at the same time implementing cost reductions and inventory and working capital improvements.
We believe that the combination of the EPS hurdle, CPS and TSR targets are challenging and that the performance necessary to achieve awards towards the upper end of the range is stretching.
They should not, therefore, be interpreted as providing guidance on the Groups futureperformance.

DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN SHARES AUDITED We believe it is important that the interests of the Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders.
The deferred APRA award and the PSP provide considerable alignment.
However, participants in the PSP are also required to retain at least one half of the number of after-tax shares released from the PSP until the value of their shareholding reaches the percentage of salary shown in the table below.
When this level is reached it must be maintained until retirement or departure from the Group.
Each Executive Directors total shareholding, for the purposes of comparing it with the minimum shareholding requirement, includes shares held: by connected persons: in the all-employee Share Incentive Plan: and PSP shares that have vested, but does not include unvested PSP awards.
The shareholding requirement is 250% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
APRA deferred shares do not count towards their minimum shareholding requirement.
Each Executive Director has built towards compliance with the minimum shareholding requirement as detailed in the table below.
