The other members during the year were Bill Alexander, Vivian Bazalgette and Antony Hardy.
The Committee has written terms of reference which clearly define its responsibilities and duties.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, including its role and authority, were updated during the year, are compliant with the AIC Code and are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company or on the Companys section of the Managers website.
They will also be available for inspection at the AGM.

Representatives of the auditor attended the Committee meeting at which the draft annual financial report was reviewed and were given the opportunity to speak to Committee members without the presence of representatives of the Manager.
The Committee met three times in the year in the performance of its duties.
It has direct access to the auditor and representatives of the Manager, including the Managers Compliance and Internal Audit personnel, who attended Committee meetings, one meeting being prior to approval and signature of the annual financial report.
The Committee reviewed reports on the quality and effectiveness of the accounting records and management information maintained on behalf of the Company and the systems of internal controls in place.
The Committee also has direct access to the depositary which provided its first report to the Committee at the year end accounts meeting where the year end accounts were discussed.
Accounting Matters and Significant Areas of Focus For the year end, the accounting matters that were identified for specific consideration by the Committee follow: SIGNIFICANT AREA HOW ADDRESSED Accuracy of the portfolio Actively traded listed investments are valued using stock exchange prices valuation, with emphasis on provided by third party pricing vendors.

the Manager and reviewed in depth by the Committee with reference to the investment management agreement.
The recognition of income is undertaken in accordance with accounting policy note 1 e on page45.
The Committee satisfied itself that adequate systems were in place for the complete and proper recording of income.
These matters were discussed with the Manager and the auditor in pre year end audit planning, and were satisfactorily addressed through consideration of reports provided by, and discussed with, the Manager and the auditor at the conclusion of the audit process.
The Audit Committee advised the Board that, following a thorough review of the 2015 annual financial report, the report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
Review of the External Auditor, including Non-Audit Services and Re-appointment The provision of non-audit services is considered by the Committee on a case-by-case basis, and consideration is given as to whether the skills and experience of the auditor make them a suitable supplier of such services and to ensure that there is no resultant threat to the objectivity and independence of the audit.
No such fees arose during the year.
Non-audit services up to 5,000 do not require approval in advance of the Audit Committee: amounts in excess of this require the approval of the Audit Committee.
Following the satisfactory outcome to the Committees regular review of auditor effectiveness, performance and independence, the Committee recommends to the Board a resolution proposing the reappointment of Deloitte LLP at the forthcoming AGM for the year ending 31 March 2016.
Deloitte have been the auditor of the Company since its inception in 1996.
As highlighted in last years annual report, the Committee has initiated a tender process to coincide with the normal audit partner rotation cycle, which corresponds with the 2016 annual audit appointment.
Audit Information The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditor is unaware, and each Director has taken steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Internal Controls and Risk Management The Committee has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the major risks faced by the Company.
Risks are reviewed by means of the Companys risk matrix and risk control summary which, after consideration of mitigating controls, effectively highlight and monitor the Companys principal risks.
These risks include those arising in relation to the Companys operations that are, of necessity as an externally managed investment trust, contracted to external service providers.
These external service providers comprise the Manager to whom responsibility both for the Companys portfolio and for the provision of company secretarial and administrative services are delegated accounts administrator, custodian, registrar and corporate broker.
Systems are in operation to safeguard the Companys assets, to maintain proper accounting records and to ensure that financial information is reliable.
30 PIGIT pp17 35 PIGIT pp17 35 05 06 2015 11:40 Page 31 GOVERNANCE The Committee receives and considers, together with representatives of the Manager, reports by independent external accountants in relation to the operational system of financial and non-financial internal controls of the Manager, accounts administrator, custodian and registrar.
In addition the Committee, on a formal and regular basis, reviews the performance of all external service providers in relation to agreed service standards, and any issues and concerns are dealt with promptly and reported to the Board.
These reviews identified no issues of significance during the year.
Following the year end it was announced that the FCA had fined certain BNY Mellon group companies, including the entity acting as custodian of the Companys assets, for failings in relation to client assets.
The Company has incurred no loss of assets as a result of these failings but the Committee, together with the Manager and the depositary, is engaged to establish the nature of the failings identified and remedial actions taken.
Internal Audit Due to the nature of the Company, being an externally managed investment company with no executive employees, and in view of the Manager having an internal audit function, the Company does not have its own internal audit function.
I will be present at the AGM and will be available at that meeting or thereafter to answer questions relating to the annual financial report.
I look forward to seeing shareholders there.
