Deferred tax assets 56,734 95,803 6,663 95,367 Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by ZK Mayskoye LLC, Svetloye LLC, JSC Varvarinskoye, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP and JSC Polymetal during the period up to 2024.
Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes.
The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group.
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were US$648.9 million RUB 15.8 billion and Kazakh Tenge 146.6 billion and US$550.1 million RUB 20.9 billion and Kazakh Tenge 32.6 billion, respectively.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised deferred tax asset DTA of US$129.8 million at 31 December 2015 is more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and available tax planning strategies.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2015.
The Group has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable income in the carry-forward period.
At 31 December 2015 deferred tax assets in the amount of US$7.5 million 31 December 2014: US$6.9 million have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses expiring during the years 2016-2026 because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
