The vacant possession value VPV in our combined UK portfolios rose by 5.7% whilst their market value rose by 9.6%.
A particular contributor to the rise in market value has been recognition, on advice from our independent valuers, of a narrowing of the discount applied to the vacant possession value toarrive at our market value.
This is supported by continuing evidence from tenanted transactions across the whole market.
It is also reflective of our own experience when selling and buying tenanted properties.
The underlying drivers of the narrowing of the discount are that the average age of the tenants is increasing giving a shorter period to vacancy, there is increasing demand for regulated properties, and rents are moving closer to market levels.
The weighted average discount to vacant possession value on our regulated tenancy portfolio has narrowed from 22.8% to 20.0%.
The impact of this has been to increase the revaluation gain on owned investment property in the income statement by 1.5m and the uplift on trading stock from statutory book value to market value in our NAV measures by 51.4m.
This increases NAV by 12.6p per share and NNNAV by 10.1p per share.
