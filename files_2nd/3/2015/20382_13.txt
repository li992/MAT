Key Objective: The objective of the Committee is to provide assurance to the Board as to the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls and the integrity of its financial records and externally published results.

Financial Reporting The half yearly financial results, published on 29 July 2015, were not audited.
Therefore the Committees business in July was focussed on a discussion, with supporting documentation from the Secretaries, on the preparation and content of the Half Yearly Report, together with other aspects such as going concern.
In January 2016 the Committee received a report and supporting presentation from the external Auditor on its audit of the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2015.
This included details of the steps it had taken to confirm the valuation and ownership of the investment portfolio.
In addition, the Secretaries reported on the preparation of the financial results and other relevant matters.
The Committee considered these reports in detail and took further comfort from the internal control review discussed below.
The Chairman of the Committee discussed the result of the audit and the Annual Report with the audit partner without representatives of Aberforth Partners.
Consequently, the Committee concluded that it was satisfied as to: the ownership and valuation of the investment portfolio as at 31 December 2015: revenue recognition including dividend completeness and the accounting treatment of each special dividend recognised during the period.
The Committee read and discussed this Annual Report and concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, objective and strategy.
As a result the Committee agreed that it could recommend to the Board that the financial statements be approved for publication.
Going Concern and Viability The Committee received reports on going concern from the Secretaries in July and January, reflecting the guidance published by the FRC.
The content of the investment portfolio, trading activity, portfolio diversification and the existing debt facility were also discussed.
After due consideration, the Committee concluded it was appropriate to prepare the Companys accounts on a going concern basis and made this recommendation to the Board.
The relatively high level of liquidity of the portfolio was the main factor that led to this conclusion.
The Committee also assessed the viability of the Company.
In keeping with the new reporting, the Committee in October 2015 discussed and agreed a draft Viability Statement.
They agreed to provide this statement for a five year period for the reasons set out in the statement on page 5.
In January 2016, the Committee conducted a series of stress tests that considered the impact of severe market downturn scenarios on Shareholders funds, the debt facility, investment income and also the potential loss of investment trust status.
The outcome of this activity led the Committee to recommend to the Board to make the statement on page 5.
Internal Control and Risks The Committee carefully considered a Matrix of the Companys principal risks and the mitigating controls at each meeting.
In October the risks and controls were addressed in more detail.
The Committee enhanced the design and content of the Matrix during the year and believes that it continues to reflect accurately the Companys principal risks.
These risks, which are detailed on page 5 of this Report, have not changed during the year.
Also in October the Committee received the Managers report on internal controls, including the assurance report issued by  LLP PwC on the nature and effectiveness of the control framework that has been established by the Managers.
A representative of PwC attended the meeting.
In addition, the Committee received internal control reports from Northern Trust and Capita Registrars.
The Committee reviewed these reports and concluded that there were no significant control weaknesses or other issues that needed to be brought to the Boards attention.
The Committee considered the increasing risk arising from cyber threats.
As the Company outsources all of its activities, the Committee received reports from the Managers, Northern Trust, RBS and Capita Registrars on cyber security and concluded that appropriate measures are in place.
Nevertheless this potential area of risk will continue to be monitored closely in the future.
The Committee also discussed whether there was a need for a dedicated internal audit function.
The Committee concluded that, as the Company has no employees and sub-contracts all of its operations to key third party suppliers, an internal audit function is not necessary.
Investment Trust Status It is essential for the Companys to maintain its investment trust status.
The Committee confirms this point at each meeting with reference to a checklist prepared by the Secretaries.

This was a new appointment which has been renewed at each subsequent AGM.
Based upon existing legislation and that which is currently anticipated, another tender process would not be required until 2023.
Audit Planning and Audit Fees The external audit partner from Deloitte presented the detailed audit plan to the Committee in October in advance of the 2015 audit.
The plan set out the scope of the audit, the principal risks as detailed in the Independent Auditor's Report, the timetable and the proposed fees.
These amounted to 19,500, excluding VAT, for the year 2014: 18,750.
There were no non-audit activities carried out by Deloitte.
Deloitte also set out its position on audit independence which was accepted by the Committee.
Evaluation of the Auditor Following the completion of the audit, in January 2016, the Committee reviewed the Auditors effectiveness.
The Committee acknowledged that the audit team comprised staff with appropriate levels of knowledge and experience and that Andrew Partridge, the audit partner, who has significant experience of the investment trust sector, had served for three year-ends.
The Committee noted positive feedback from the Secretaries on Deloitte's performance on the audit.
Additionally Deloitte had provided confirmation that it had complied with the relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements on independence.
Taking these factors into account, the Committee is satisfied that the external audit was carried out effectively.
It has therefore recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte as the Company's auditor for the 2016 financial year.
The Board has given its support and a proposal will be put to Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Committee Evaluation A formal internal review of the Committees effectiveness, using an evaluation questionnaire, was undertaken during the year.
The outcome was positive with no significant concerns expressed.
