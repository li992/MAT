Our relationship with the RHS Witan Investment Trust has enjoyed a fruitful relationship with the Royal Horticultural Society RHS for more than 18 years.
Over this time, Witan has helped to redevelop a number of new gardens at Wisley including the Walled Garden West, the Herb Garden, the Bowes-Lyon Rose Garden and the Vegetable Garden at Hyde Hall, which is scheduled to open to the public in Spring 2017.
In 2016, Witan will sponsor a garden at the RHS Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, which runs from 5 to 10 July.
Tickets are available via the RHS website www.
Witan shareholders who hold their shares through Witan Wisdom or Jump Savings, or on the main register, are eligible to apply for a ballot for a ticket that will allow free entry for two adults to any one of the four RHS gardens in the UK.
