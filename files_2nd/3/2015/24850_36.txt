Risk Committee Report MEMBERSHIP The Risk Committee was established in April 2014 and comprises Paul Meader Chairman, Richard Crowder and Sarita Keen.
Andrew Dodd and John Le Prevost served as Committee members during the period and until their resignation as Directors.
Steve Le Page, as the remaining director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, has right of attendance and attended all the Committee meetings during the period.
THE COMMITTEES ACTIVITIES DURING 2015 The Committees activities relate to investment risk.
Other risks, such as operational risk or regulatory risk, are overseen by the Audit Committee.
The Risk Committee focused on: the direct exposures of the Company itself, for instance to AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and cash counterparts: and the exposures embedded within AllBlue, its investment characteristics and the risks associated with owning AllBlue.
During 2015, the Committee utilised data from BlueCrest, JTC, GlobeOp the administrator of AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and the majority of the funds underlying AllBlue and the Companys Corporate Brokers to review and monitor investment risk exposures and also engaged and challenged BlueCrest regarding AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged.
The work of the Committee revolved primarily around: Market risk: Credit risk: Counterparty risk: Interest rate risk: Liquidity risk: and Leverage risk.
Utilising the Companys risk matrix, the Committee sought to identify the principal pre-control investment risks to which the Company was exposed and then monitored the controls that were used to mitigate these risks.
It also focused on the material post-control investment risks.
Work was also undertaken during the year, in conjunction with the Audit Committee and Board, to identify and, where possible, quantify the Companys risk appetite.
This work fed into the development of internal tolerances for certain risks.
Page 37 v. 2.7 Clearly, the Company is in the business of taking investment risk and so the Committee does not seek to eliminate investment risks.
Rather, it seeks to ensure that the risks taken accord with the risk appetite of the Company, that no undue or abnormal exposures are taken and that all relevant controls are operating appropriately.
The Companys principal investment risks relate to its holdings of investment funds and the Companys ability to control the risks embedded in these funds is limited to its role as a shareholder in those funds.
Nonetheless, the Committee monitored underlying investment risks in some detail and had a relationship of constructive engagement with BlueCrest, as detailed below.
During the period, all investment risks were considered by the Committee to lie within normal ranges.
On 1 December 2015, the Company was notified by BlueCrest of the intention to return capital to investors in AllBlue.
Subsequent to this announcement, the work of the Risk Committee was largely undertaken by the full Board of the Company whilst the evaluation of the Companys future and then the transition to Highbridge Capital Corporation and Highbridge as AIFM took place.
Detailed discussions continued with BlueCrest during the early part of 2016.
ENGAGEMENT WITH BCML The purpose of the Committees work in identifying risks is to seek to understand which risks can be managed and mitigated and which cannot.
The nature of the Companys structure is that it did not have a direct contractual relationship with BlueCrest as investment manager of AllBlue.
This has always been the case.
The process with BlueCrest, therefore, was one of constructive engagement on both sides the Company challenging and probing on behalf of Shareholders because AllBlue was the majority investment of the Company, and BlueCrest because the Company was the largest, and a material, investor in AllBlue.
This relationship operated successfully during 2015.
During the year, a due diligence visit was undertaken to BlueCrest in London, as in prior years.
This included meetings with key risk and related personnel and examination of risk controls and processes.
It also included work to validate the reliance of the Risk Committee on data from BlueCrest.
EXPOSURE MONITORING As explained elsewhere, as well as owning shares in AllBlue, the Company maintained a cash balance and exposure to AllBlue Leveraged.
This facilitated, amongst other things, the Companys repurchase of Shares in the market but brought a number of additional risks.
In particular, there was a risk that the buyback of Shares would cause the Companys economic exposure to AllBlue to vary from its objective of 1:1 over time.
This exposure was reset as frequently as possible via monthly subscriptions and quarterly redemptions with notice.
During the year, the economic exposure of the Sterling Shares to AllBlue varied between 100.9% and 103.90% and this was within the tolerances set by the Committee and the risk appetite of the Company.
Subsequent to the compulsory redemption of the Companys investments in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged, the Company retains a residual exposure to AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged and this is monitored by the Page 38 v. 2.7 Board and the risk committee.
Cash balances were maintained during the period in accordance with the Treasury Policy.
THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE RISK COMMITTEE IN 2016 Subsequent to the period end, the Company appointed Highbridge as AIFM and, since 1 March 2016, has been invested in HCC alongside the residual interest in AllBlue.
Previously, and during the period, the Company was out of scope of the AIFMD.
The Committee has now begun to engage with Highbridge to reexamine the role of the Risk Committee, review the Committees terms of reference and also to review the key risk metrics relevant to the Companys investment in HCC.
I look forward to reporting to you on this in due course.
