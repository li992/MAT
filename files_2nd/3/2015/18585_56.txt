GSK Annual Report 2015 91 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Corporate governance continued Audit tendering PwC has been the auditor of the company and the Group since the inception of each in 2000.
Their performance has been reviewed annually and audit partner rotation requirements have been observed.
During this time, the Directors have not sought to tender PwCs contract.
As a result of the UKs implementation of the EUs mandatory rm rotation requirements, the company is required to replace PwC with another auditor no later than for the financial year commencing 1 January 2021.
In January 2015, when the Committee, as usual, reviewed PwCs performance for the previous year and recommended their reappointment for a further year, it also considered whether to initiate or defer an external audit contract tendering process.
The Committee agreed that given the level of change that was being experienced in the business, it was not appropriate to put the audit out to tender in 2015.
However, having reviewed the relative merits of conducting a tender and the recent changes in regulations in this area, the Committee considered that it was in the best interests of shareholders to plan to undertake a tender process in the second half of 2016.
It would target appointing the new auditor with effect from 1 January 2018, which would coincide with the end of the current PwC partners five year tenure as the Group audit engagement leader.
If the company was to reappoint PwC from 1 January 2018, a new PwC Partner would need to be appointed and PwC would still be required to rotate after the 2020 audit.
Consequently, PwC will not be asked to participate in the anticipated tender exercise in the second half of 2016.
Audit tender governance In December 2015, the Committee agreed that, to achieve the move to a new audit rm to take over the audit for the 2018 financial year, an audit contract tender be conducted in the autumn of 2016.
A final recommendation by the Committee of at least two audit rms with a preference expressed for the appointment of one of those rms is anticipated to be made in December 2016 for final approval by the Board by the end of 2016.
The Committee will direct and supervise the tender process and has agreed the implementation of a robust audit tender governance structure to deliver a successful audit contract tender process with minimal disruption to the Group.
The main elements of this governance structure are as follows: Audit Tender Operations Steering Executive Steering Audit & Risk Board Planning Team Committee Committee Committee Remit: design, plan, Remit: Remit: lead oversee Remit: direct and Remit: Appoints new implement and run coordinate execute audit tender process supervise audit auditor with effect audit tender process audit tender process implementation tender process from 1 January 2018 Meets: weekly and consider shortlisting Assess candidates: and recommend and agrees to seek arrangements liaise with the ARC new auditor to shareholder approval Meets: monthly then during process and the Board for the appointment fortnightly towards final evaluation at the AGM end of process Members: ARC Chair, CFO, Group Financial Controller and Company Secretary Meets: monthly 92 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Ongoing effectiveness and quality of external audit process The Committee is committed to ensuring on an ongoing basis that GSK receives a high quality and effective audit.
In evaluating the effectiveness of the audit process prior to making a recommendation on the re-appointment of the external auditor, the Committee reviews the effectiveness of their performance against criteria which it agrees, in conjunction with management, at the beginning of each years audit.
