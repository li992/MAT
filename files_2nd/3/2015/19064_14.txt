The Group sadly notes that Fabrice Lacombe, our Executive Board Director for France, Central and Eastern Europe, passed away after a long battle with illness in January 2016.
Fabrice had a profound influence on PageGroup during his 21 years with the Company and also the recruitment sector in France, within which he was highly respected.
We will remember Fabrice for his drive, intelligence, enthusiasm, integrity, commitment to fair play and great capacity for work.
Many of our specialisations and offices, in France in particular, trace their origins back to Fabrice as do many colleagues who have gone on to become directors and managing directors who will remember his support and guidance.
