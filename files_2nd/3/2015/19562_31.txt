The remaining 30% of performance profit share awards was based on individual performance against key strategic and operational objectives.
The Executive Directors were each awarded 100% of this 30%.
The Committee set strategic and operational objectives for the Executive Directors which were aligned with value creation for Savills.

In line with our policy, the base salaries for the Executive Directors continue to be positioned significantly below market median against the FTSE 250.
60 SAVILLS PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Variable remuneration Annual performance-related profit share For the profit share, in line with previous years, the target weighting will be 70% in relation to the Groups annual profit performance and 30%in relation to delivery against amix of strategic and operational objectives.
The Committee considers prospective disclosure of profit share targets and individual objectives to be commercially sensitive and disclosure will therefore be on aretrospective basis.
Performance Share Plan The remuneration policy is for maximum awards of 200% of salary.
The PSP awards for 2016 will be: 550,000 for the Group Chief Executive Officer: and 250,000 for the Group Financial Officer.
As set out in the annual statement from the Committee Chairman, following a review of the PSP performance targets taking into consideration a number of factors including current global macro-economic and political concerns, the Committee set EPS targets for 50% of the award as follows: 25% i. e. threshold of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 3% p. a. compound: 100% i. e. the maximum of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 8% p. a. compound or more: straight-line vesting between the two points.
The Committee considers that if EPS growth of RPI 8% p. a. were achieved from the excellent 2015 EPS base starting position, this would represent outstanding performance for shareholders.
The other 50% of the award will vest subject to the satisfaction of relative TSR performance versus the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts the Index as follows: 25% i. e. threshold of the element to vest if the Groups TSR performance equals that of the index: 100% i. e. the maximum of the element to vest if the Groups TSR performance outperforms the Index by 8% p. a. : straight-line vesting between the two points.

The malus provision has also been extended to include other exceptional developments which have an actual or potential material adverse effect on the value or reputation of the Group as determined by the Committee.
