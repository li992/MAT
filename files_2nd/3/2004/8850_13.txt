Corporate Social Responsibility continued Celebrating 30 years of Johnson Matthey autocatalysts When the first car to be tted with a catalytic converter rolled off a production line in the USA in 1974, it was a huge landmark for both the platinum group metals markets and the global auto industry.
In 2004 Johnson Matthey celebrates 30 years in the development of autocatalysts.
1950s Automotive exhaust emissions are proved to be a major source of photochemical smog in Los Angeles.
1960s The first federal emission standards to control pollution from automobiles are set in the US in 1965.
These targets are met without catalysts.
1970s In 1970, US Congress substantially lowers vehicle emissions limits and lead is phased out in gasoline in the USA from 1972 onwards.
Johnson Matthey files a patent in 1971 covering the use of a rhodium promoted platinum catalyst to control NOx and gaseous organic compounds.
In 1972, Johnson Matthey proves to the Environmental Protection Agency that the US emissions regulations can be met using rhodium-platinum catalysts.
The first cars fitted with oxidation catalysts reach showrooms in the USA in 1975: unleaded gasoline is widely available.
Japanese vehicle emissions standards to control HC, CO and NOx come into effect in 1976.
US Clean Air Act amendments made in 1977 agree to tighten emissions standards further from 1981 onwards.
Increased substrate surface area helps to improve pollution conversion efficiency of catalysts.
1980s More sophisticated three-way catalytic converters are introduced in 1981 to meet strict NOx limits.
Performance of three-way catalytic converters significantly enhanced by use of improved oxygen storage materials based on cerium dioxide in catalyst washcoats.
Vehicle emissions regulations introduced in Australia, incentives introduced in Germany.
1990s In 1990, Johnson Matthey files a patent covering the use of NO to reduce the combustion temperature of diesel particulate matter in a filter, 2 a system subsequently commercialised as the Continuously Regenerating Trap CRT.
New legislation introduced in Japan in 1991 sets much more stringent vehicle NOx emissions limits.
European Union emissions regulations that necessitate the use of catalytic converters Euro 1 come into effect from 1993.
In 1996, European Union emissions regulations tighten as Euro 2 standards are applied.
Californian Low Emission Vehicle LEV standards come into force, emphasising the cold-start control of pollutants: palladium based catalysts found to be particularly suited to controlling HC emissions on engine start-up.
Further improvements made in substrate surface area of catalysts.
National Low Emissions Vehicle NLEV emissions standards take effect in the USA from 1999, requiring very substantial reductions in NOx.
2000 Onwards EU emissions standards for all road vehicles become more stringent with introduction of Euro 3 regulations in 2000.
A substantial retrofit programme is created by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in a move to improve particulate pollution from diesel trucks and buses in the city.
Diesel car sales in Europe surpass six million vehicles for the first time.
Phase in of US Tier II emissions standards begins in 2004.
These mandate further large reductions in NOx and particulate matter emissions.
Tier II compliant vehicles are up to 99% cleaner than vehicles sold in the 1960s.
Regulations will be introduced in the EU and USA between 2005 and 2010 which will create a significant new original equipment market for exhaust aftertreatment products.
Johnson Matthey 28 Directors Report and Accounts Directors Report The directors submit to shareholders their one hundred and thirteenth annual report, together with the audited accounts of the group for the year ended 31st March 2004.
Pages 1 to 38 are an integral part of the report.
Principal Activities The groups principal activities are summarised on page 15.
Dividends The interim dividend of 8.2 pence per share, up 0.4 pence, was paid in February 2004.
A final dividend, which will be paid as an ordinary dividend, of 18.2 pence per share, up 0.5 pence, is being proposed to shareholders as Resolution 3 at the Annual General Meeting AGM, making a total for the year of 26.4 pence, an increase of 4% over last year.
Dividends for the year total 57.4 million.
A low cost Dividend Reinvestment Plan is in place for the benefit of shareholders.
This allows them to purchase additional shares in Johnson Matthey with their dividend payment.
Further information and a mandate can be obtained from the Company Secretary at the companys registered office.
Share Capital Allotments of ordinary shares of 1 each of the company were made during the year as set out in note 25 on page 63.
The board will again seek shareholders approval to renew the annual authority for the company to make purchases of its own ordinary shares through the market.
No shares were purchased under this authority during the year ended 31st March 2004.
Employee Share Schemes 4,636 current and former employees, representing approximately 63% of employees worldwide as at 31st March 2004, are shareholders in Johnson Matthey through the groups employee share schemes, which held 3,507,288 shares 1.59% of ordinary share capital at 31st March 2004.
A total of 834 current and former executives hold options over 6,183,642 shares through the companys executive share option schemes.
Directors Details of the directors of the company are shown on pages 12 and 13.
Dr P N Hawker and Mr L C Pentz, both appointed to the board on 1st August 2003, offer themselves for election at the forthcoming AGM.
In accordance with the companys Articles of Association, Mr M B Dearden, Mr C D Mackay, Mr J N Sheldrick and Mr I C Strachan retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the AGM.
Directors Material Interests in Contracts Other than service contracts, no director had any interest in any material contract with any group company at any time during the year.
Substantial Shareholdings The company has been advised of the following interest in its ordinary share capital as at 28th May 2004: Schroder Investment Management Ltd 7.66% Legal & General Assurance Society Ltd 4.38% Merrill Lynch Investment Managers 7.61% Deutsche Asset Management 3.74% Scottish Widows Investment Partnership Ltd 4.96% AXA Investment Managers UK Ltd 3.05% Auditors In accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution is to be proposed at the forthcoming AGM for the reappointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the company.
Policy on Payment of Commercial Debts The groups policy in relation to the payment of all suppliers set out in its Group Control Manual, which is distributed to all group operations is that payment should be made within the credit terms agreed with the supplier.
At 31st March 2004, the companys aggregate level of creditor days amounted to 5 days.
Creditor days are calculated by dividing the aggregate of the amounts which were owed to trade creditors at the end of the year by the aggregate of the amounts the company was invoiced by suppliers during the year and multiplying by 365 to express the ratio as a number of days.
Donations During the year the group donated 313,000 2003 323,000 to charitable organisations, of which 279,000 2003 299,000 was in the UK.
There were no political donations made in the year 2003 nil.
Going Concern The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have, therefore, adopted the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
