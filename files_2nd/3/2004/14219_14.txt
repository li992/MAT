The Committee also advises the Board on succession planning for Executive Board appointments.
Audit Committee The Audit Committee operates under written Terms of Reference, which were reviewed during the year, meets at least three times a year and is comprised of only independent Non-Executive Directors.
Mr. D A Haxby who is considered by the Board to have significant recent and relevant financial experience chairs the Committee.
The expertise and experience of the members of the Committee are summarised on page 32.
The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive and Finance Director normally attend meetings by invitation and the Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external auditors without management present.
The external auditors attended two of the meetings and have direct access to the Committee Chairman.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Chairman of the Committee attends the Annual General Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised on the Committees activities.
The Committees responsibilities include: reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups financial reporting and internal control procedures for the identification, assessment and reporting of risks: reviewing with the external auditors the nature and scope of their planned work: reviewing the Groups financial statements at the half year end and year end before submission to the Board: reviewing changes in accounting policies: and reviewing the cost-effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
The Committee has the power to engage outside advisers if it considers it to be necessary.
The Committee met three times in the year and its agenda is linked to events in the Companys financial calendar.
The agenda is mostly cyclical such that the Committee Chairman approves the agenda on behalf of all members.
Each member may require reports on matters of interest in addition to the regular items.
During the year in addition to its normal duties the Committee focused on the Companys preparation, policies and plans for the implementation of the new International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Audit Committee also reviews the whistleblowing policy under which employees may in confidence notify the Company of any concerns, including inter alia matters involving financial reporting.
It also reviews the procedures for investigating and resolving any such concerns.
A copy of the whistleblowing policy is available on the Companys website The Board is aware of the need to maintain an appropriate degree of independence and objectivity on the part of the Group external auditors when engaged in non-audit assignments.
Both the Audit Committee and the external auditors have safeguards in place to avoid such independence and objectivity being compromised.
The Committee also ensures that key partners within the external auditors are rotated from time to time in accordance with UK rules.
39 SIG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Audit Committee continued The Group policy on the provision by the external auditors of audit and non-audit services, which is based on the principle that the external auditors should only undertake non-audit services where they are the most appropriate provider, categorises such services between: Auditor permitted services Those services which are acceptable for the auditors to provide and the provision of which can be engaged without referral to the Audit Committee.
e. g. regulatory and other specialist financial reporting.
Auditor excluded services Those engagements that the Audit Committee and the Board do not consider appropriate for the auditors to undertake.
e. g. provision of outsourced financial or operational management functions.
Auditor authorised services Those services for which it is appropriate to consider the use of the external auditors and for which the specific approval of the Audit Committee is required before the auditors are permitted to provide the service.
e. g. transaction support and advisory work, such as due diligence.
The policy defines the types of services falling under each category and sets out the criteria to be met and the internal approvals required prior to the commencement of any assignment.
The Audit Committee at each meeting reviews an analysis of all services provided by the external auditors.
The policy is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board.
This disclosure of the fees payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP and two other accountancy firms performing audit services during the year are set out in note 4 on page 58.
A breakdown of the non-audit fees is included in the same note.
The external Auditors and Committee Chairman have regular dialogue concerning matters of independence and a report is made formally to the Committee on this matter at least once a year.
The Audit Committee is entirely satisfied with the level of fees, independence, objectivity and effectiveness of Deloitte & Touche LLP.
Accordingly a resolution for the re-appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors of the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Group does not have a dedicated internal audit function.
The Board annually reviews the need for such a function and has done so during the year.
The Group does however have a function which performs a number of internal audit tasks across the main UK Divisions and this, together with the fact that during the year, there were no adverse trends evident from the monitoring of internal controls or unexpected or unacceptable results of a material nature has led the Board to conclude that at present a dedicated internal audit function is not necessary.
The Board will continue to keep this matter under review.
Risk Management and Internal Control The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
It is the role of management to implement the Boards policies on risk and control through the design and operation of appropriate internal control systems.
For the whole of the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual report and Accounts, the Board has had formal procedures in place to ensure that it is in a position to consider all significant aspects of internal control.
The Board has conducted its annual review of the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control.
This review has covered all controls including operational, compliance and risk management procedures, as well as financial.
The formal process followed, and reviewed by the Board, to assess the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control accords with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, and is part of the ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
This process is summarised as follows: Operating management is charged with the ongoing responsibility for identifying risks facing each of the operating units and for putting in place procedures to mitigate, manage and monitor risks.
40 SIG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued Risk Management and Internal Control continued Operating units formally review all business risks and set out the significant risks to the operations, the controls in place and additional controls which could be implemented.
These proposals are approved by each operating units management and submitted in the form of risk action plans to Group Executive management for review and approval.
Any significant matters arising from this review are formally reported to the Board by the Finance Director to ensure that appropriate initiatives are developed and implemented to manage those risks.
The Board is advised in this process by the Audit Committee.
The risk and control identification and management process is monitored and periodically reviewed by Group Executive management.
The key elements of the controls framework within which the Group operates are: - an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting requirements.
- an embedded culture of openness of communication between operating company management and the Group Executive management on matters relating to risk and control.
- operating reviews covering all aspects of each business are conducted by Group Executive management each quarter.
- a comprehensive system of financial reporting.
An annual budget for each operating company is prepared in detail and approved by the Chief Executive.
The Board approves the overall Groups budget and plans.
Monthly actual results are reported against budget and prior year and the forecast for the year is revised where necessary.
Any significant changes and adverse variances are questioned by the Board and remedial action is taken where appropriate.
There is weekly cash and treasury reporting to the Finance Director and periodic reporting to the Board on the Groups tax and treasury position.
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The risk framework as outlined above, gives reasonable assurance that the structure of controls in operation is appropriate to the Groups situation and that there is an acceptable level of risk throughout the business.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group: that this has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Going Concern The Directors consider, after making appropriate enquiries at the time of approving the financial statements, that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
