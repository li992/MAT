HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 3:47 pm Page 60 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder I am delighted to introduce this, our third, HBOS Remuneration Committee Report for which we will be seeking approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
Just over a year ago, in late 2003 and early 2004, we met with over 20 of our major shareholders, collectively representing about one third of the total HBOS equity, together with their representative bodies.
These meetings assisted us with a number of issues on reward policy and practice: much of that was reflected in last years report for which we received support from 96.75% of shareholders who voted and was implemented during 2004.
This year, we have again had discussions with our major shareholders and their representative bodies on both reward policy and reward practice.
This report gives comprehensive details based on the policy we set out a year ago, along with changes we have made in the interim, and changes we plan for the future.
The disclosure regulations mean that the focus of this report is on Directors and, to a lesser extent, their most senior colleagues.
In reality, the Committees focus extends to all our 71,000 colleagues in the HBOS Group: we believe that it is important that we have consistent remuneration principles across the Group regardless of business area and seniority.
More specifically, as was the case a year ago:- our salaries are managed around median levels in the financial services sector: our annual incentives have stretching performance targets consistent with those in our operating plan: are generally team based: and focus on issues for which each team has prime accountability.
Annual incentives are a material part of reward - and all colleagues know that there is a distinct possibility of zero payments, as well as the possibility of high rewards where targets are significantly exceeded: our longer term incentives allow most of our colleagues to enjoy a share in success of HBOS: and, for our most senior colleagues, the long term arrangements are strongly driven by the Groups relative performance against key comparator companies.
These latter rewards are paid only if the Groups performance is better than the average of the key comparator companies: wherever possible, our annual and longer term incentives are denominated in shares rather than in cash so that colleagues are also shareholders.
The Committee has also set out clear requirements for all Directors, and other senior colleagues, to own shares in the Group: our benefits offering is positioned at the market median and gives colleagues flexibility over their choice of benefits: and we have an extensive colleague product offering so that colleagues are also customers.
This reward philosophy has applied in HBOS since inception, did not change during 2004 and will continue to apply in 2005 and, subject to review, in 2006.
During 2005, we will review our longer term incentives, not least to honour commitments we made to our major shareholders three years ago.
And we will also review our pension policy in the light of the legislative changes which are being introduced from April 2006.
Whilst the vast majority of our shareholders who expressed a view were supportive of our reward policy and practice, and the extent of the disclosures in last years report, it was clear that some shareholders were keen to see more extensive disclosure in the summary financial statement.
Whilst all shareholders are entitled to see a copy of this full report, we recognise that many shareholders prefer to see a summarised document.
We have thus extended the disclosure in the Annual Review & Summary Financial Statement so that it includes more specific reward details.
In similar vein, we think that it is useful to summarise in this letter the key changes during the year, although more detail is contained within the full report:- Salary increases in 2004 Whilst we need to maintain competitive salary positions for our most senior colleagues, we have sought not to be at the market forefront on increases in senior salaries.
In 2004, Executive Directors salaries increased, on average, by 6.8%: and the Chairmans fee increased by 4.8%: Introduction of special short term incentive in 2004 We enhanced short term incentive targets and maxima by one half for our most senior colleagues, firstly, to recognise that our standard targets and maxima were significantly behind the market position: secondly, to focus such colleagues on the importance of delivering substantial improvements in earnings per share, return on equity and profit before tax: thirdly, to ensure that such improvements were not achieved at the expense of risk management: and fourthly, to make sure that each of our most senior colleagues had an element of short term incentive driven from Group performance.
In 2004, those stretching targets for those Group measures were generally achieved: Removal of Abbey National from comparator group for long term incentive plan We retrospectively removed Abbey National from our comparator group effective from the end of June 2004, immediately before bid activity started which culminated in Abbey National being acquired by Banco Santander Central Hispano in November 2004 : and replaced them with Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock effective from the start of July 2004: Retirement of Mike Ellis Mike Ellis, our former Group Finance Director, retired at the end of the year on contractual terms.
There was no termination payment and no pension enhancement: 60 HBOS plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 3:47 pm Page 61 Appointment of Mark Tucker Mark Tucker, our new Group Finance Director, was hired on terms broadly equivalent to those which applied to Mike Ellis.
However, we have not included Mark Tucker in final salary pension arrangements.
We have, for 2004 only, doubled his long term incentive arrangements which will pay out only if, and to the extent that, HBOS outperforms its comparator group - and will pay nothing for average or poorer performance: and we have backdated his short term incentive arrangements to the start of 2004: Maturity of special long term incentive plan for Andy Hornby The performance period for the special long term incentive arrangement, effective from January 2002, for Andy Hornby, Chief Executive Retail, finished at the end of 2004 and performance criteria in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 were satisfied.
Specifically, that division increased profit before tax and exceptional items, using a like for like comparison, over the three year period by more than 60%.
The arrangement gives Andy Hornby the opportunity to receive up to 260,000 shares in April 2005.
Full details of the maturity will appear in the 2005 Annual Report & Accounts: Revisions to short term incentive plan for 2005 and beyond For Executive Directors and about a further 200 of our most senior colleagues, we have increased target and maximum short term incentive payment opportunities, where it was clear that our practice had fallen significantly behind the market position - for example, for Executive Directors, the target incentive, if taken in shares, has been increased from 60% to 75% of salary: but we are not repeating, in 2005, the special short term incentive scheme which applied in 2004: and Introduction of free shares in 2005 and beyond During 2005, HBOS will replace its share option plan with a free share plan - of equivalent expected value - under the Share Incentive Plan legislation.
That legislation, in broad terms, requires all UK employees to be included in the scheme, up to the free share limit of 3,000 p. a.
In the full report which follows, we have produced transparent and extensive technical details, as we have done for the past two years.
We welcome questions and feedback from all shareholders on both the report content and the report transparency.
We believe our reward policy is right for our colleagues and right for our shareholders and we encourage all shareholders to support this Report at the Companys forthcoming 2005 Annual General Meeting.

Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is a committee of the Board.
Your Board believes that a properly constituted and effective Committee is key to ensuring that Executive Directors and other colleagues remuneration is aligned with shareholders interests and that it motivates Executive Directors and other colleagues to enhance the absolute performance and the relative competitiveness of the Group.
The Committees terms of reference are summarised in Appendix 1.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee during 2004 were all independent Non-executive Directors, as shown below: Brian Ivory Chairman Sir Ronald Garrick Coline McConville Philip Yea until 30 June 2004 At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Groups Chairman and the Chief Executive attend Committee meetings to provide background and context on matters relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Directors and other colleagues in the Group, but do not attend when their own remuneration or contractual terms are discussed.
No Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration or contractual terms.
During 2004, the Committee met on seven occasions and the attendance of Committee members is as shown below: Brian Ivory Chairman seven meetings Sir Ronald Garrick seven meetings Coline McConville seven meetings Philip Yea four meetings of a possible four meetings This frequency of meetings enables the Committee regularly to review, for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues, overall reward and the components thereof, in relation to the absolute performance and the relative competitiveness of the Group.
The performance of the Committee is evaluated as part of the overall evaluation of the performance of each Non-executive Director, as set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 56-58.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee During 2004, Ian Goodwin, an internal reward consultant, acted as Secretary to the Committee and provided advice to it.
Harry Baines, the Company Secretary, also provided advice to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee sought independent external advice on remuneration matters.
The Committee does not retain advisors but uses organisations best suited to undertake specific projects from time to time.
During 2004, the Committee took advice, directly or indirectly, from: Watson Wyatt LLP, in relation to pension issues: this organisation also advises the Group and the trustees of various Group pension plans on a range of pension issues: Hay Group, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt LLP, in relation to remuneration issues: these organisations also advise the Group on a range of remuneration issues: New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report: this organisation also provides general advice to the Group on remuneration issues and independent performance measurement results for grants under the long term incentive plan which applies to most senior colleagues: and Linklaters, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report: this organisation also provides legal advice to the Group on remuneration and other issues.
In the opinion of the Committee, there were no conflicts of interest during 2004 in relation to these organisations advising both the Group and the Committee.

Compliance with the Combined Code Full details of the Groups approach to Corporate Governance, including compliance with original and revised versions of the Combined Code, are included in the Corporate Governance Report on page 55.
The Board has followed and complied with both the original and the revised versions of the Combined Code as well as the Regulations in preparing this Report and in designing performance-related incentive plans for senior colleagues.
Service contracts The arrangements relating to the provision of the services of the Chairman of the Group are covered by a contract which extends to 30 June 2005.
If the contract is terminated by the Group prior to the expiry of the term, contractual compensation equivalent to the balance of the fees payable during the balance of the term subject to a maximum compensation equivalent to one years fees may, in certain circumstances, be payable.
As announced on 28 February 2005, the Group has invited Dennis Stevenson to serve a further term as Chairman following the expiry of his current appointment on 30 June 2005.
He has accepted that invitation and, subject to his re-election being approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, will therefore serve as Chairman for a further three years commencing on 1July 2005.
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which can be terminated by the Group on one years notice or by the Director on six months notice.
If any contract is terminated by the Group prior to the expiry of the term, contractual compensation up to the equivalent of one years basic salary may, in certain circumstances, be payable.
There is no contractual compensation entitlement for any of the Directors beyond this.
Executive Directors are expected to make reasonable efforts to mitigate for any loss arising from early termination of their contracts.
It is the Committees policy to design service contracts for any newly recruited Executive Directors in a comparable form to the contracts of existing Executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors are appointed by letter for an initial term of three years with an expectation that in most cases, and subject to satisfactory performance, they will be invited to serve a second three-year term.
In exceptional circumstances, where the Board is satisfied that it is in the interests of the Group and its shareholders, a Non-executive Director may be asked to serve a third three-year term.
Notwithstanding these three yearly terms, appointments of Non-executive Directors can be terminated on one months written notice given either by the individual Director or by the Group.
External appointments The Group recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Group.
Provided that it does not impact materially on their executive duties, Executive Directors are generally encouraged to accept one such appointment.
They may retain any resulting fee.
In certain circumstances, two such appointments may be permitted.
The fees payable in respect of any second appointments will be donated to charity.
Share ownership The Group believes that share ownership by colleagues throughout the Group enhances their alignment with shareholders interests.
Therefore colleagues in the Group are able to acquire shares as a result of: the sharesave plan: short term incentive plans.
All colleagues can opt to take the whole or part of their annual incentive in shares rather than in cash.
Those who take their annual incentive in shares, retain them for three years and remain with the Group for that period or rank as qualifying leavers receive a 50% enhancement of such shareholding this facility is termed sharekicker : long term incentive plans.
Share grants of varying percentages of salaries were made to senior colleagues about 160 in all effective from the start of 2004.
Share options equivalent to 20% of salary were made to all Group colleagues, other than the most senior colleagues about 50 in all, early in 2004: and personal purchase using the Groups, or other, sharedealing facilities.
These arrangements assist colleagues throughout the Group to acquire shares.
They form a key element of the Groups commitment to creating a competitive, flexible and performance-oriented reward structure.
The Group requires all of its Directors including the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors, together with other senior colleagues, to acquire and retain significant numbers of shares relative to base salaries or fees.
In the case of each Director the value of the shareholding is required to be at least 100% of base salary or base fee within three years of appointment or, based on average personal shareholdings, by 2006, whichever is the later.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues To deliver its objective of creating real increases in shareholder value relative to the finance sector, the Group needs to attract and retain the most capable and committed people and create the right employment conditions and reward opportunities for them.
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their most senior colleagues is aligned with this objective.
Accordingly, the focus of remuneration policy is not simply on salary but is on incentive plans that are aligned with the delivery of both operating plans and increases in shareholder value.
Therefore, for 2005 and subject to review for 2006, as was the case for 2002, 2003 and 2004: salary policy is set at around market median for the financial services sector: short term incentive plans are based on the delivery of annual operating plans: and long term incentive plans are focused on the creation of relative additional shareholder value.
Participants do not receive any shares under the main plan unless the Groups relative total shareholder return is above that of the finance sector as measured using the weighted average total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies.
This long term plan is highly geared so that average performance or worse generates no reward but outstanding performance generates a high level of reward.
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS plc 63 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 3:47 pm Page 64 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Other than as set out in Sections 10.3 and 10.4, there are no definitive plans, at present, to make any changes to this remuneration policy for 2005 and beyond.
We have, however, committed to review our long term incentive plans in 2005 and we will review overall remuneration policy in the light of organisational needs, market positioning and the impending legislative pension changes.
In broad terms, for every 100 of target reward for Executive Directors, about 49 is guaranteed and 51 is performance contingent.
Sustained exceptional performance can result in a further 59 of reward.
Of the performance element of reward, between 25% and 35% is based solely on annual performance with the rest based on triennial performance or retention.
For remuneration purposes, roles in HBOS fall into one of ten Levels, 1-8, the HBOS Executive and the Executive Directors.
The newly formed group of the HBOS Executive, together with the Executive Directors, comprises the most senior colleagues in the Group, about 25 colleagues in all, and is involved directly in major decisions taken by the Group and, in particular, the development of the Groups strategy.
This report covers colleagues who fall into Level 8 and above, about 50 colleagues in all, but with emphasis on Directors.
Appendix 2 gives broad details of remuneration arrangements for those in Levels 1-7.
10.1 Salary Salary benchmarks are reviewed annually, taking account of information from independent sources on salary rates for comparable jobs in the finance sector and in other selected major listed companies.
Actual salaries are normally reviewed annually in May but can be reviewed at any time.
There is no automatic annual salary increase.
The benchmarking process is both extensive and rigorous.
It is designed to ensure that the median salary policy adopted by the Committee demonstrably applies in practice.
Specifically, the Committee considers data sourced from Hay Group, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt LLP: as well as data sourced from annual reports and accounts of other relevant companies.
These include the FTSE15 - seven companies bigger than and seven companies smaller than HBOS - together with other major banks, insurance companies and retailers.
Base salaries of the Executive Directors after the most recent review with effect from May 2004, and at 31 December 2004, were: James Crosby 825,000, Mike Ellis 560,000 retired 31 December 2004, Phil Hodkinson 440,000, Andy Hornby 610,000, Colin Matthew 440,000 and George Mitchell 565,000.
At the date of his appointment on 30 April 2004, and at 31 December 2004, Mark Tuckers base salary was 560,000.
At 31 December 2004, the average salary for those in the HBOS Executive and Level 8 was 239,400: the upper quartile was 270,000 and the lower quartile was 200,000.
10.2 Incentive plan philosophy The purpose of the incentive plans is to provide a direct link between each individuals remuneration and three components of performance, namely their own, that of the division they work in and that of the Group, both annually and over the longer term.
All Executive Directors and a substantial majority of other senior colleagues participate in incentive plans which are Group-wide.
Performance targets and levels of participation differ in order to align overall individual remuneration with the Groups policy objectives outlined earlier.
Different, market specific, arrangements exist for a small number of senior colleagues within the Group.
Payment of incentives, for Executive Directors and certain other individuals, is subject to the approval of the Committee.
Except in certain circumstances in respect of initial periods of employment, it is the Committees policy that no Executive Director should have a contractual right to an incentive.
Incentive arrangements to apply during 2005 are set out below.
10.3 Short Term Incentive Plans The levels of incentive payments are dependent on the extent to which participants achieve their operating plan objectives.
In 2005, for Executive Directors, payment of the target incentive will require the achievement of targets which include earnings per share EPS and return on equity ROE and the attainment of a certain level of profit before tax and exceptional items PBTE.
Examples of benchmark payment levels which apply for 2005 are as follows: Category Incentive as a % of salary Target Maximum Executive Directors 75 112.5 HBOS Executive 75 112.5 Level 8 60 90 64 HBOS plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 4:47 pm Page 65 The Committee, in setting targets for EPS, ROE and PBTE for 2005, will take account of the new International Financial Reporting Standards.
EPS, ROE and PBTE outcomes are reviewed by the Audit Committee for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
The levels of incentives shown in the table on page 64 require participants to take their annual incentive in shares the sharekicker facility referred to in Section 9 rather than in cash: to retain their shares for three years: and to remain in Group employment or to rank as a qualifying leaver during the three year period.
The Committee believes that this feature clearly aligns the interests of participants and shareholders by encouraging participants to be both long term colleagues and long term shareholders, having first achieved stretching performance targets in relation to their operating plans.
Participants may take their annual incentive in cash in which case the incentive is released at two-thirds of the level which would normally apply were the incentive taken in shares.
These incentive levels are higher than applied excluding the special short term incentive in 2004 when, for Executive Directors and Level 8 colleagues, the targets were 60% and 52.5% and the maxima were 90% and 78.75%, respectively.
The Committee increased ongoing incentive levels to maintain HBOSs competitive remuneration position in the financial services sector, in order to help attract and retain the most capable and committed Executive Directors and their most senior colleagues.
In relation to 2004, the outcomes for EPS, ROE and PBTE were, taken overall, slightly ahead of what were deliberately stretching targets set at the start of the year: and short term incentive outcomes were, therefore, slightly ahead of target levels.
10.4 Long Term Incentive Plans Participants are granted conditional shares shortly after the start of the financial year equal to the number of shares secured by a percentage of the participants salary and based on the price of the Groups shares, using the average market price in the last ten business days of the previous financial year.
For awards in 2005, grant levels will be as follows: Category Conditional share grant as a % of salary Executive Directors 100 HBOS Executive 66.67 Level 8 66.67 The number of shares ultimately released to participants under the plan is dependent on the Groups annualised Total Shareholder Return TSR defined as the gross overall return on ordinary shares of HBOS after all adjustments for capital actions and re-investment of dividends or other income over three year periods, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies: Alliance & Leicester, Aviva, Barclays, Bradford & Bingley, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland and Royal & Sun Alliance, over equivalent periods.
For awards in 2005, any releases early in 2008 will be as follows: Groups relative Amount released as TSR performance a % of share grant 0% p. a. or below 0 3% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 Intermediate positions will be determined by interpolation.
If the relative TSR performance does not exceed 0% p. a. after three years, the conditional share grant lapses.
There is no retest in this or any other circumstance.
The Committee believes that TSR is an appropriate performance measure because it is a robust and transparent measure of the creation of shareholder value: that a relative measure is more motivational and competitively appropriate than an absolute one: and that a weighted average group made up of the biggest domestic banking and insurance companies is the most valid comparator and gives a more effective performance test than a traditional ranking-based league table.
Calculations of TSR performance are performed independently of the Group by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
If the weighted average TSR of the comparator companies is at least 0% p. a. HBOS shareholders will enjoy additional return equivalent to at least 6.36bn over 2005-2007 for share grant participants in 2005 to enjoy maximum releases early in 2008.
The estimated face value of conditional share grants for 2005 is about 17.1m in respect of about 200 participants.
Maximum releases would amount to about 34.2m plus share growth plus dividends.
The Executive Directors and colleagues who are in the HBOS Executive or Level 8 have never been granted share options with HBOS and will not be granted share options in 2005.
There are no plans to grant share options to these individuals in future years.
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues will, however, participate in the free share scheme to be introduced for all eligible UK colleagues in 2005, under the Share Incentive Plan legislation.
That legislation, in broad terms, requires all such employees to be included in the scheme, up to the free share limit of 3,000 p. a.
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS plc 65 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 4:47 pm Page 66 Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues may participate in the sharesave plan.
This is a standard tax-approved scheme available to all colleagues, with no performance conditions.
These overall incentive levels are broadly the same as those which applied in 2004.
In relation to 2002-2004, the outcome for TSR was 7.44% p. a. ahead of that of the comparator group and long term incentive outcomes will, therefore, be at maximum levels.
10.5 Benefits Each senior colleague is provided with benefits, which principally comprise a company car or cash in lieu, pension arrangements, paid leave, healthcare cover and preferential terms for some Group products.
Individuals are generally included in membership of tax-approved final salary pension arrangements and, for certain individuals who joined the Group after 1989, for membership of separate final salary pension arrangements.
These arrangements, taken together, provide a personal pension benefit based on salary only, with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary in broad terms, the last 12 months salary at normal retirement age age 60, subject to the necessary pensionable service.
The arrangements also provide a lump sum life assurance benefit of four times salary and pension benefits for spouses dependants and qualifying children.
Recent recruits have been, and future recruits will be, included in tax-approved money purchase pension arrangements or separate arrangements of equivalent value.
These arrangements also provide a lump sum life assurance benefit of four times salary.
All tax-approved benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Pension entitlement is based on salary only.
During 2005, the Committee will review pension policy in the light of the legislative changes which are being introduced from April 2006.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman The remuneration policy for the Chairman recognises that, whilst the Chairman was independent of the organisation when he joined it, he is not now regarded as independent.
The Chairman plays a key role in influencing the strategic direction of the Group and ensuring performance delivery.
It is therefore appropriate that the Chairmans reward arrangements are based on a mixture of guaranteed pay and performance-related long term incentive.
The base fee of the Chairman after the most recent review with effect from 1 July 2004, and at 31 December 2004, was 550,000.
In addition, as has been the case in HBOS since 2002, the Chairman is included in a long term incentive plan equivalent to that described in Section 10.4 and therefore receives an annual conditional grant based on 100% of his fee and subject to the same performance conditions as apply to Executive Directors.
The Committee established the long term incentive plan for the Chairman through a separately constituted scheme, for two reasons.
Firstly, so that shareholders could vote on this scheme quite separately from any vote on the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
Secondly, for legal reasons, because the Chairman is not an employee of the Group and cannot therefore be included in the share-based long term incentive plan described in Section 10.4 as that plan is available to employees only.
In practice, however, the scheme which applies for the Chairman is a mirror image of the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
There is no short term incentive plan and there are no benefits car, pension, paid leave, healthcare for the Chairman.
The Chairman is reimbursed for a proportion of his office expenses.
The Chairmans overall remuneration is about 40% of that of the Chief Executive, with a slightly lower proportion of such remuneration dependent on performance.
The Committee does not slavishly cross-reference reward to a particular time commitment: in practice the Chairman has always been available as required by the Group and, in broad terms, spends about half his working time on HBOS business.
Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors Remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists solely of fees.
There are no short term incentive plans or long term incentive plans or benefits car, pension, paid leave, healthcare for Non-executive Directors.
The current base Board membership fee for each Non-executive Director after the most recent review, effective from 1 May 2004, is 45,000.
In addition, fees are paid for services on committees and for directorships of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Fees are set based on comparisons with other non-executive director fees and time commitments in comparable companies.

The target cash incentive was 60% of salary and the maximum cash incentive was 90% of salary.
Annual cash incentive figures exclude potential sharekicker enhancements for any element of the incentive taken in shares.
Details of potential sharekicker enhancements from earlier years are set out in Table 5.
The deferred share incentive amounts, approved by the Committee, relate to the release of the additional shares under sharekicker as set out in Table 5.

Note 5 The salaries shown for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are the amounts of salary they would have received had they not given up 19,006, 1,606 and 11,696, respectively, as additional pension contributions.
Short term incentives, long term incentives and pension entitlements have been calculated by reference to salaries prior to the reductions for additional pension contributions.
Note 6 Certain Executive Directors are non-executive directors of other companies.
Their roles and fees were as follows: James Crosby was a Non-executive Director of ITV plc throughout 2004.
The annual rate of fee which he retains is 50,000.
James Crosby was appointed a Non-executive Director of the Financial Services Authority from 15 January 2004.

The annual rate of fee which he retains is 35,000.
In addition, the annual rate of share-based fee which he retains is 2,500 ordinary shares in GUS plc, equivalent to 23,450 based on the market price of GUS plcs ordinary shares at 31 December 2004.
Note 7 Unlike all other Executive Directors, Mark Tucker is not included in final salary pension arrangements.
His contract provides for other arrangements to a value of 25% of salary per year.
The nature of this remuneration element has not yet been established and so it does not appear in Table 1a.
Note 8 The annual cash incentives for 2004 may be applied, if participants so choose, to buy shares in March 2005 under the arrangements described in Section 13.3.
The deferred share incentives for 2001 are the values of additional shares released in 2004, if participants chose to buy shares in March 2001 with their annual cash incentive under the arrangements described in Section 13.3.
Note 9 Taxable benefits comprise the benefits in kind values of company cars, healthcare, additional life assurance and concessionary rate mortgages.
13.2 Pension benefits Details of each Executive Directors pension and lump sum life assurance entitlement, and the annual contributions as percentages of pensionable salaries required to meet the costs of providing those benefits, are as follows: Table 2 Normal Pension as Lump sum Cost of retirement a % of life benefits age final salary assurance as a % of as a multiple salary of salary James Crosby 60 66.7 4 52 Mike Ellis 60 66.7 4 55 Phil Hodkinson 60 55.3 4 52 Andy Hornby 60 66.7 4 45 Colin Matthew 60 66.7 4 26 George Mitchell 60 66.7 4 26 Mark Tucker 60 n a 4 26 68 HBOS plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 4:47 pm Page 69 Notes to Table 2 Note 1 Pension is generally based on retirement from service at normal retirement age age 60 and is based on final salary disregarding, where relevant, the earnings cap as defined in the Finance Act 1989.
Pension and lump sum life assurance is provided from the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme the Scheme, for Colin Matthew and George Mitchell, and from the Halifax Retirement Fund the Fund, for James Crosby, Mike Ellis, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby, to the extent permitted by legislation, and otherwise from separate arrangements with the Group.
The overall pensions shown generally accrue at rates of one sixtieth of salary for each year of service for members of the Scheme and one thirtieth of salary for each year of service for members of the Fund.
Note 2 Costs are based on estimates, by the actuaries to the Scheme and to the Fund, from Watson Wyatt LLP, of the costs to the Group over the future service periods of the Executive Directors using attained age rates.
Costs are calculated on funding assumptions adopted for actuarial valuations of the Scheme and the Fund and do not distinguish between the costs of providing benefits from the Scheme and the Fund and the costs of providing benefits from separate arrangements.
The costs exclude those covered by personal contributions from Executive Directors but include allowance for the current cost of self-insuring the risk benefits for death in service and ill-health retirement.
Note 3 On death after retirement or after leaving service, a spouses pension equal to 50% of the members pension for the Scheme and 66.7% of the members pension for the Fund may be payable.
Childrens benefits may also be payable.
Under the Scheme, Executive Directors require the consent of the Company before retiring early.
Under the Fund, Executive Directors have a contractual right to retire at age 55 or above with a non-reduced pension and at age 50 or above but below age 55 with a reduced pension.
Pension increases after retirement are a mixture of guaranteed and discretionary.
Scheme pensions in respect of service before 6 April 1997 are not guaranteed to increase.
Scheme pensions in respect of service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices Index, subject to a maximum of 5% p. a.
The Fund guarantees to increase pensions in line with the Retail Prices Index, subject to a maximum of 5% p. a. and a minimum of 3% p. a. no minimum for pensionable service after 31 March 2004.
There is an established policy of reviewing pensions on a discretionary basis taking account of increases in the Retail Prices Index.
Allowance is made in transfer values on leaving in respect of the guaranteed and discretionary increases outlined above.
Note 4 The potential pension arrangements for Mark Tucker are not included in Table 1a but are set out in Note 7 to Table 1a.
Their value is currently included in Table 2 opposite.
The pension entitlements of the Executive Directors included in final salary defined benefit schemes are set out in the table below: Table 3 Increase in Transfer value at Increase in Accrued accrued transfer value pension pension less at during Directors 31.12.04 2004 31.12.03 31.12.04 contributions Name Age 000 p. a.

Note 2 The increase in accrued pension is the accrued pension at 31 December 2004 less the accrued pension at 31 December 2003.
The amount shown in square brackets is calculated on the basis of the disclosure methodology under the requirements of the Listing Requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Note 3 The transfer values are based on the accrued pensions at 31 December 2003 and at 31 December 2004 and are calculated as at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 respectively based on factors supplied by the actuaries, from Watson Wyatt LLP, of the relevant pension schemes.
The transfer values are the notional lump sums which would have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the Director had he left service at the respective dates.
It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the Director personally.
The arrangements for George Mitchell currently provide for some of his benefits to be paid on an unreduced basis only from age 65 and, in these circumstances the transfer values 000 at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 are 2,981 and 3,507 but he has a right, shortly before age 60, to elect that all his benefits are paid on an unreduced basis at age 60.
The transfer values shown in the table for George Mitchell assume that all of his benefits would be taken on an unreduced basis at age 60.

No personal contribution is required under the terms of the Scheme.
The contributions for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are aggregates of the personal contributions required under the terms of the Fund, subject to the statutory limit, together with the amounts of salary they gave up as additional pension contributions as outlined in Note 5 to Table 1a.
Members of the Groups pension schemes have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in Table 3.
Note 5 Mark Tucker is not included in any defined benefit scheme of the Group.
There were no other contributions by the Group to any money purchase pension arrangements in respect of any Director during 2004.
1 Shares The beneficial interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the ordinary shares of the Group are set out below: Table 4 Number Number of shares of shares at 31.12.04 at 31.12.03 01.01.04 Chairman Dennis Stevenson 221,726 166,541 Executive Directors James Crosby 279,407 184,280 Mike Ellis 275,786 168,833 Phil Hodkinson 112,919 28,806 Andy Hornby 252,640 174,759 Colin Matthew 88,032 72,366 George Mitchell 90,562 72,622 Mark Tucker Nil Nil Non-executive Directors Charles Dunstone 100,000 100,000 Sir Ronald Garrick 19,611 17,306 Anthony Hobson 6,500 5,500 Brian Ivory 7,000 11,000 Coline McConville 2,070 2,070 John Maclean 5,000 5,038 Kate Nealon 8,198 Nil David Shearer 10,000 Nil or date of appointment, if later.
Notes to Table 4 Note 1 James Crosby, George Mitchell, Brian Ivory and John Maclean all have a non-beneficial interest as at 31 December 2004 over 2,217,507 ordinary shares of the Group 2003 - 4,514,752 as Trustees of the Bank of Scotland Profit Sharing Stock Ownership Scheme.
Brian Ivory has a non-beneficial interest over 4,500 ordinary shares 2003 - 4,500.
Note 2 Certain Directors will receive further interests in the ordinary shares of the Group arising out of the short term incentive plans and, potentially, the long term incentive plans as set out in Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Note 3 No Director had any interest in the preference shares of HBOS or in the loan or share capital of any Group undertaking at the beginning or during or at the end of the financial year.
No options to subscribe for shares in other Group companies are granted to Directors of the Group.
Neither James Crosby nor Phil Hodkinson, who are both Non-executive Directors of St. Jamess Place Capital plc, nor their immediate families had any interest in the ordinary shares of that company throughout 2004.
Note 4 There has been no change in the share interests as set out in the table between the end of the financial year and 1 March 2005, the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts.
2 Short Term Incentive Plan HBOS Directors and former Halifax Directors Certain Executive Directors have conditional entitlements to shares arising from the annual incentive sharekicker.
Where the annual incentive for 2000 and or 2001 and or 2002 and or 2003 was taken in shares and these shares are retained in trust for three years, additional shares may also be transferred to the Directors.
The basic shares shown below which have already vested are also included in Table 4.
The additional shares shown opposite arise as a result of sharekicker.
Note 3 Because the basic shares are shown net of each participants original income tax and National Insurance liability, the additional incentive shares are shown in a like manner.
In practice, the value of the grossed-up equivalent additional shares inclusive of associated income tax and National Insurance will be shown in Table 1a at the time of release, as is the case with those released in the year on 3 March 2004.
Those released in 2004 represented the basic shares purchased by the Directors own annual cash incentive in March 2001 plus the additional shares arising as a result of sharekicker.
Note 4 Following his retirement on 31 December 2003, Gordon McQueen retains interests under the short term incentive plan through grants of basic and additional shares of 18,406 and 9,203, respectively effective from March 2003 and 17,128 and 8,564, respectively effective from March 2004.
These remain subject to the same plan rules as apply to existing Executive Directors.

3 Long Term Incentive Plan and Special Long Term Incentive Plan HBOS Directors and former Halifax Directors Details of the shares which have been conditionally awarded to Directors under the plans are set out below.
The performance conditions relating to these conditional awards are set out in the notes below the table.
Normal grant levels would have been 25% of salary in respect of three months service in 2001 and 100% of salary, respectively.
These higher grants have no value unless HBOS outperforms the relevant comparator company weighted average, as set out in Section 10.4.
The grant effective from January 2004 for Mark Tucker, over shares having a value equal to 200% of salary, was necessary to facilitate his recruitment in April 2004.
The normal grant level would have been 67% of salary in respect of eight months service in 2004.
This higher grant has no value unless HBOS outperforms the relevant comparator company weighted average, as set out in Section 10.4.
Following his retirement on 31 December 2003, Gordon McQueen retains interests under the plan through grants of 45,625 and 61,718 shares effective from January 2002 and January 2003, respectively.
Note 3 Awards are not pensionable.
Note 4 The performance period for the January 2001 grant ended on 31 December 2003.
HBOSs and previously Halifaxs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 13.45% p. a. so a maximum 200% of share grants have been released to grant recipients.
Without a maximum payout limit of 200%, the plan would have released 336% of share grants.
The shares granted in January 2001 vested on 1 March 2004.
The closing market price of the Groups ordinary shares on that date was 7.34.
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares have been released to grant recipients as set out in the table and as provided for under the rules of the plans.
The dividend reinvestment shares are the additional shares which would have accrued on the overall share grants actually released had dividends due during the performance period been reinvested in shares.
The shares received by the Executive Directors and the Chairman from those grants are, after any sales to discharge their personal tax and National Insurance liabilities on such shares, retained by them or on their behalves for at least an additional two years and are included in Table 4.
Note 5 Subject to performance, the shares granted under the long term plan effective from January 2002 will be released to most individuals shortly after the three-year anniversary of the grant date.
As explained in last years Report, for the 2002 and 2003 grants, all participants can choose to take any shares released after three years based on the three-year performance outcome or can continue to participate in the plan for a further two years and take shares at that point based on the better of the three-year and the five-year performance outcomes.
This design feature seeks to motivate participants continually to sustain strong performance or to improve lesser performance for their benefit and the benefit of shareholders.
This feature does not apply for the 2004 grants and will not apply for any grants in subsequent years, to reflect the preference on retesting expressed by most major institutional investors.
Note 6 In the case of the Chairman, it is not possible to include him in the standard Long Term Incentive Plan.
Nor is it possible to include him in such an arrangement where the grant is denominated in shares.
He is therefore included as the sole participant in the Special Long Term Incentive Plan where the grants are awards of notional shares.
He will become entitled to the cash value of any notional shares on vesting but has agreed that this value will, subject to any withholdings for income tax or National Insurance, be applied in acquiring shares on his behalf.
Note 7 The number of shares to be released to participants is dependent on the Groups TSR over a three year period, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies over an equivalent period.
For the grants effective from January 2002 and January 2003, a five year period can also apply.
This basket of companies comprises:- for the January 2001 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland: and for the January 2002, 2003 and 2004 grants: Abbey National, Aviva, Barclays, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland, but with Abbey National replaced by Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock with effect from 1 July 2004.
The Committee decided retrospectively to remove Abbey National from the comparator group, in respect of the January 2002, 2003 and 2004 grants, effective from the end of June 2004 immediately before bid activity started : and replace it with Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock effective from the start of July 2004.
This revised group of companies will comprise the comparator group for the January 2005 grant.
For the period for which it was an independent entity.
Shares have been or will be released as follows: Groups relative Amount released as a TSR performance % of share grant 2001 grants 0% p. a. or below 0 4% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 Intermediate positions are determined by interpolation.
As shown as granted in the table.

HBOSs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 7.44% p. a. as illustrated in Chart 1, so a maximum 200% of share grants will be released to grant recipients, subject to Note 5 on page 73.
Without a maximum payout limit of 200%, the plan would have released 248% of share grants.
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares will be released to grant recipients as provided for under the rules of the plans.
Full details concerning these shares, which will be released to the Chairman and the Executive Directors in March 2005, will be set out in the 2005 Annual Report and Accounts.
In respect of this January 2002 grant, the Committee decided retrospectively to remove Abbey National from the comparator group of companies with effect from the end of June 2004, immediately before bid activity started and to replace them with Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock from the start of July 2004.
Had Abbey National been replaced at November 2004 the date when the Company ceased to be independently listed, the plan would still have released a maximum 200% of share grants to grant recipients.
The performance periods for the January 2003 and January 2004 grants where there have been equivalent adjustments in respect of Abbey National do not end until 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006, respectively.
So far, HBOSs TSR over the two year and one year elapsed periods exceeds the weighted average of the comparator group by 9.55% and 4.91%, respectively.

Early in 2003, the Committee became aware of activity, principally from the retail sector, to secure Andy Hornbys services.
Specifically, he had received an approach to become Group Chief Executive of a major FTSE company.
The Committee decided that, at that point in time, it would clearly be in the interests of shareholders to secure Andy Hornbys continued services but to do it on a basis where additional reward was performance contingent.
The Committee therefore decided to introduce a special incentive arrangement which gives Andy Hornby the opportunity to receive up to 260,000 shares in April 2005, dependent on growth in the profitability of the Retail division over 2002 to 2004.
In broad terms, the maximum release under this special arrangement is delivered in April 2005 subject to an increase of at least 60% in the profitability of the Retail division, using a like for like comparison, over the three year period, and provided that Andy Hornby is in the service of the Group at 31 March 2005 having not given notice on or before that date.
The Committee established that the incentive would accrue in three equivalent tranches based on profitability performance to the ends of 2002, 2003 and 2004.
At the time of establishment of the incentive, the satisfaction of performance criteria to the end of 2002 established an immediate retention feature within the scheme.
Since then, performance criteria to the ends of 2003 and 2004 have also been satisfied.
Full details concerning these shares, which may be released to Andy Hornby in April 2005, will be set out in the 2005 Annual Report & Accounts.
If Andy Hornby were to leave employment as a qualifying leaver or in the event of a change of control before April 2005, the accrued shares would vest.
If he were to leave in certain other circumstances, he would not receive any shares.
Changes to certain key terms of the arrangement, in future, will require shareholder approval.
The special incentive is not pensionable.
At maturity in April 2005 it will be eligible for the 50% sharekicker enhancement, which will be released if Andy Hornby retains the shares and remains in the service of the Group until 31 March 2008 or ranks as a qualifying leaver before that date.
Taken overall, this special incentive increases the maximum annual overall reward value for Andy Hornby by about 25% in each of the three years to the end of 2004 and by about 12.5% in each of the subsequent three years to the end of 2007.

4 Long Term Incentive Plan - Former Bank of Scotland Directors Approved share options granted between 1995 and 2000 under Bank of Scotlands plans were subject to a performance pre-condition that options were not capable of being exercised unless growth in diluted earnings per share exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Index over a period of at least three consecutive financial years by not less than 2% p. a.
No performance target applied in respect of unapproved share options following the third anniversary of grant, as agreed by Bank of Scotland stockholders at the time of the merger with Halifax.
The performance target in respect of approved share options was satisfied on 31 December 2002 for all grants and consequently all options are exercisable in accordance with the rules of the plans.
No further share options have been or will be granted under any of these plans.
Note 2 On 23 February 2004, Gordon McQueen, who retired as an Executive Director on 31 December 2003, exercised options over 29,777, 35,000 and 40,000 shares granted effective from October 1998, May 2000 and October 2000, respectively: on 1 March 2004 he exercised options over 48,000, 45,000 and 32,000 shares granted effective from October 1995, October 1996 and October 1997, respectively: and on 2 June 2004, he exercised options over 5,223 shares granted effective from October 1998.
He has no remaining options under the plan.
The closing market prices on the dates of exercise were 7.555, 7.34 and 7.12, respectively.
Full details of these options were set out in last years Report.
Note 3 Details of the market price of the Groups ordinary shares during 2004 are given in Section 13.3.
5 Sharesave Plan The sharesave plan is available to most Group colleagues.
The plan allows colleagues to save a fixed amount of money on a monthly basis.
At the end of a pre-determined period, of three, five or seven years, colleagues have the right, if they so choose, to use the funds accumulated to purchase shares in the Group at a fixed price, based on a market price on or an average market price determined shortly before the effective grant date and discounted by up to 20%.
There are no performance conditions.

6 Interest in shares under Trusts Certain Executive Directors, together with certain other colleagues, are deemed to have or have had an interest or a potential interest as potential discretionary beneficiaries under: the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trusts.
As such, they were each treated as at 31 December 2004 as being interested in the 5,298,695 ordinary shares 31 December 2003 - 9,884,870 ordinary shares held by the trustees of these Trusts.
The shares held in the Trusts will be used to satisfy share awards under the former Halifax Short Term and Long Term Incentive Plans and the HBOS Short Term and Long Term Incentive Plans.
The relevant Executive Directors specific individual interests are shown in Tables 5 and 6: and the Groups Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust.
As such, they were each treated as at 31 December 2004 as being interested in the 8,260,555 ordinary shares 31 December 2003 10,154,710 ordinary shares held by the trustee of this Trust.
The shares held in the Trust will be used to satisfy entitlements of colleagues arising on the exercise of options under the Sharesave Schemes operated by HBOS plc.
The relevant Executive Directors specific individual interests are shown in Table 8.
All of the Groups share plans empower new issue shares to be allotted to satisfy share requirements.
The Groups past practice has generally been to purchase shares in the market in relation to the plans described in Sections 13.3.
3 and to issue new shares in relation to the plans described in Sections 13.3.
5 and the Groups share option scheme.
This practice is under review, and any changes to the methods of satisfying awards or grants under the Groups various share plans will be set out in the Annual Report and Accounts 2005.

asp 78 HBOS plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 4:47 pm Page 79 Appendix 2 Remuneration in HBOS generally Principal features This section outlines the structure of remuneration in HBOS for the vast majority of colleagues.
Each role in HBOS is positioned in one of ten Levels, 1-8, the HBOS Executive and the Executive Directors.
The level of a role is determined by the knowledge required to do it, the challenge of delivering the required job outputs and the accountability which the role carries.
The level then, in broad terms, determines the salary range which can apply for the role: the short term and long term incentive structures: and the range of benefit and product offerings available.
Details of the remuneration arrangements which apply to those in Level 8, to the HBOS Executive and to Executive Directors are given in the main body of the report.
The table below sets out the number of colleagues and full-time equivalents FTE in other levels and the typical inter-quartile full-time equivalent salary range applying to colleagues in each such level.
Different ranges apply to different groups of colleagues depending on role specialism and geographic location.
Remuneration is, for all colleagues, generally made up of four elements, namely salary, short term incentives, long term incentives and benefits.
HBOS is increasingly seeking to adopt a total reward approach so that colleagues appreciate the totality, the flexibility and the performance drivers of their reward package.
Salary HBOS salary policy is to manage salaries in aggregate, by Level, around the appropriate medians.
Whilst finance sector generic medians establish baseline positions, businesses benchmark according to role specialism and to geographic location.
The alignment of practice with policy is one we aspire to deliver by matching average salaries with the market median position, whilst managing actual salaries generally within an 80%-120% window of the median, reflecting personal skills, experience, performance and business vulnerability.
Short term Incentives HBOS has annual incentives which are operating plan aligned, generally team based and built around line of sight issues.
Participants know that these incentives give a real chance of a zero outcome and, equally, a real chance of a maximum outcome which, in cash terms, may be equivalent to 20% of salary, or more.
The cash incentive levels for 2005 are generally as follows:- Incentive as percentage of salary Level Minimum Target Maximum 1-4 0% 10%-12% 20%-30% 50% 17.5% 35% 60% 25% 50% 70% 32.5% 48.75% Long term Incentives Almost every colleague in HBOS enjoys three for one Level, four long term incentive propositions, each share-based.
Colleagues who choose to buy shares with their net cash incentive get 50% more shares after three years provided they remain in the service of the Group or rank as a qualifying leaver.
Colleagues who choose to save up to 250 per month are given the option, at the end of three, five or seven years, to buy shares based on the share price at the start of the savings period, discounted by up to 20%.
Thirdly, share options free shares.
In 2002, 2003 and 2004, colleagues were given share options over 20% of salary: and these can be crystallised after a minimum of three and a maximum of six years.
In 2005, share options will be replaced by free shares based on 5% of salary maximum 3,000 p. a. : and these will crystallise after a minimum of three years.
Colleagues in Level 7 were given share grants over 33.33% of salary in 2002, 2003 and 2004.
The same arrangements will apply in 2005.
The level of grant released is conditional on relative TSR performance against a weighted finance sector basket, generally over a three year period with no grant released for performance which matches or is worse than the average and with twice the grant released for outperformance of 6% p. a. or more intermediate positions being determined by interpolation.
Benefits Our key benefits are pensions, holidays, cars, healthcare and mortgage arrangements.
We increasingly seek to package them as an overall flexible benefits proposition and a comprehensive product offering.
Many existing colleagues have defined benefit pension arrangements.
All new colleagues are eligible for defined contribution pension arrangements.
Both include death and ill health benefits.
