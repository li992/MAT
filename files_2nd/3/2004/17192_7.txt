corporate governance The Board is fully committed to achieving the highest standards of corporate governance and supports fully the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code, published in July 2003, which applied to the Company with effect from 1st January 2004.
This report, together with the Directors Remuneration Report, where applicable, describes how the Board has applied the main and supporting principles of the Code.
The Board considers that throughout the year ended 31st December 2004 the Group has complied with the main and supporting principles of the Code.
The Board also considers that throughout the year under review the Company has complied with the Codes provisions as set out in Section 1 with the exception that for the first part of the year the Company did not comply with provision A.
This states that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent.
Following an evaluation of the Companys requirements and in order to enable compliance with the provisions of the Code, executive recruitment consultants were appointed in late 2003 to identify appropriate candidates.
Upon the appointment of Mr A J Giles and Mr I P Lough and the retirement of Mr A Greasley and Mr T G Neiland the Company complies with this requirement of the Code.
The Board The Board currently comprises the Chairman, Mr D W Wilson, four other Executive Directors and five independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors are Mr I Robertson Group Chief Executive, Mr G M Brown Group Finance Director, Mr N H Richardson Managing Director of Wilson Bowden Developments and Mr N J Townsend Group Legal Director.
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the Company.
A list of Directors is included on pages 26 and 27 of the Annual Report, together with their biographies and details of their committee memberships.
The Board is satisfied that this balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors is appropriate for the requirements of the business.
During the year, Mr A J Giles and Mr I P Lough joined the Board as independent Non-Executive Directors on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.
Brief biographies of the new appointees are detailed on page 27 of the Annual Report.
The Board is satisfied that both Mr A J Giles and Mr I P Lough have sufficient time to fulfill their roles as Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Board has determined that each Non-Executive Director is independent in character and judgement and that they meet the independence criteria set out in the Code.
This requires the Board to be satisfied that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or appear to affect, their judgment.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years subject to compliance with Code requirements.
Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve two three-year terms and may be invited to serve for an additional term.
The Companys Articles of Association require that all Directors seek election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and that one third of the Directors shall retire by rotation each year but, if at the start of an Annual General Meeting they have been in office for more than three years since their last appointment or re-appointment, they shall retire.
Details of the Directors who will be standing for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting are set out in the Directors Report on pages 28 and 29.
To achieve maximum effectiveness, the Board accepts that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive need to be separated and clearly defined.
Accordingly, the Board has adopted a policy statement which defines the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board and creating the conditions for ensuring that the Board and each individual Director performs effectively both inside and outside the boardroom.
The Chief Executive is responsible for implementing the strategy agreed by the Board and overseeing the Groups day-to-day operations.
As Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Dr A D Portnos principal responsibilities are to provide independent advice to the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive: to facilitate communications between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors: and to ensure that the views of the Non-Executive Directors are given due consideration.
He is available to shareholders if they have concerns which have not been resolved through the normal channels of contact with the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director, or to address their concerns for which such contact is inappropriate.
The Board has a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, which combined with the way the Groups management is structured, ensures that the decision making process is not concentrated with any one individual or small group of individuals.
Upon appointment to the Board, Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme and are provided with relevant information on the Company.
During their induction programme, new Directors have the opportunity to meet with key executives below Board level and other employees in order to obtain a sound knowledge and understanding of the Group and its business operations.
As required by the Code, the Board conducts a rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance.
The process adopted during the year under review was closely based on the guidance set out in the Higgs Suggestions for Good Practice and involved the completion of a questionnaire by all members of the Board.
The results of the process were analysed and evaluated by the Chairman and the Company Secretary.
The conclusion drawn from the process was that the Board performed effectively.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in seeking to ensure the integrity of information supplied to shareholders in relation to the Groups financial performance.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the Groups system of internal financial controls and risk management, and for reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups internal audit function.
In so doing, the Committee reviews the scope and planning of the Group Internal Audit Managers programme and considers the findings and recommendations of his reports.
The Committee has regular access to the Group Internal Audit Manager as and when required.
The Committee meets with the external auditors to review the interim statement and the full year annual report and accounts.
During the year under review the Committee met on one occasion with the external auditors without the Executive Directors being present.
The Committee holds responsibility for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the Groups external auditors.
The Committee regularly considers the external auditors independence, objectivity, and also discusses with them the proposed nature and scope of their work before the audit commences.
The Committee regularly monitors fees paid to the external auditors in respect of non-audit services.
In addition, the Committee assesses the external auditors compliance with UK ethical guidance regarding the rotation of the engagement partner.
The external auditors attend the Committees meetings and may request that a meeting be convened.
The external and internal auditors are provided with the opportunity to raise any matters or concerns that they may have, in the absence of the Executive Directors, at separate meetings with the Audit Committee or its Chairman.
Nominations Committee The Nominations Committee is chaired by Mr D E Brill and comprises the five independent Non-Executive Directors together with Mr D W Wilson.
Mr A J Giles and Mr I P Lough were appointed to the Committee on 5th October 2004.
The Nominations Committee is responsible for leading the process of nominating individuals for senior appointments in the Group and for making recommendations to the Board to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience are maintained on the Board and elsewhere in the Group.
The Nominations Committee meets as and when required and met on one occasion during the year under review.
Before making an appointment, the Committee satisfies itself that the candidate will be able to devote sufficient time to discharge his or her responsibilities effectively.
The Committee has access to such information and advice from within the Group and from external sources, as deemed appropriate, at the Companys expense.
Internal control The Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal controls and for confirming that they are operating effectively.
The Board confirms that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company has been in place throughout 2004, and up to the date on which the 2004 annual report and accounts were approved.
This process, which addresses financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, is regularly reviewed by the Board and is in accordance with the Turnbull guidance.
In conducting these reviews, the Board has taken into consideration the following key internal control processes used across the Group: Each business unit prepares risk assessments that encompass operational, compliance, financial and business risks.
These assessments are updated on an ongoing basis by business unit senior management, who seek input from operational staff as appropriate, to fully reflect those risks currently being faced.
A risk assessment is similarly prepared for the Group that addresses central functions and strategic risks.
The Audit Committee at its meetings periodically reviews these risk assessments.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 35 corporate governance continued A detailed system of budgeting, reporting and forecasting for the Groups operations is in place, with particular focus on cash flow and profitability.
This is updated monthly and provides appropriate, timely information on the performance of the business as well as projections and sensitivity analysis for the outlook period.
This information is monitored in the local operations and also centrally.
The Groups key financial control functions are centralised, which allows for high-level input and provides control over the Groups diverse operations.
The Group operates a centralised Treasury function, which operates under specific, clearly defined guidelines established by the Board, to whom it reports regularly.
All significant breaches of internal controls are reported to both the Audit Committee and to the Board.
The Group has formulated a Whistleblowing policy, details of which have been circulated to all employees and appear on the Groups intranet.
The policy offers the names of the Group Chairman, the Group Human Resources Director and the Company Secretary as contacts for persons wishing to use the procedure to raise concerns on a confidential or anonymous basis.
The Committee has ensured that arrangements are in place such that concerns raised through the Whistleblowing procedures are proportional and independently investigated and that, if appropriate, follow up action is taken.
The Internal Audit department has an established audit plan that is approved, regularly reviewed and updated by the Audit Committee.
The work of the department includes the detailed review of systems and controls, the prior review of significant changes to systems and controls, the review of risk assessments, value-for-money investigations and other ad hoc projects as deemed appropriate across all areas of the Group.
The findings arising from this work are reported to the Audit Committee at each of its meetings and to the Groups external auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports on the outcome of the Committees meetings to the Board, which is also provided with all minutes of the Committees meetings.
As part of the bi-annual review of internal controls, senior management within individual business units complete self-certifications in which confirmation is given that, as far as possible, controls and safeguards are being operated in line with established procedures and standards.
In addition, the Board receives collective assurance from the Boards of David Wilson Homes and Wilson Bowden Developments.
These processes are supplemented by the required inclusion of current internal control issues in reports to management at both plc and subsidiary level.
This ongoing focus seeks to embed internal control and risk management into the operations of the business, as well as to provide timely opportunity for the Board to deal with areas of improvement that come to its attention.
Whilst acknowledging its overall responsibility for the Groups internal controls framework and for the effectiveness of its operation, the Board strongly believes that, as a result of the Groups commercial and geographical diversity, senior management within individual business units should also contribute in a substantial way to the ongoing process of identifying, evaluating, managing and transferring risk.
Responsibility for ensuring that current controls are reviewed and that appropriate controls are established is also devolved to operational management.
The Groups risk management process is designed to ensure adequate stewardship of assets, the provision of relevant, accurate and timely information to run the business and the maintenance of proper accounting records.
Internal control procedures are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve these objectives and can only provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Where appropriate the risk management process will include the purchase of appropriate insurance cover.
The Groups control and monitoring procedures are subject to regular review and the Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls to ensure that they are keeping pace with operational and organisational change and the business environment in which the Group operates.
Relationship with the external auditors The Audit Committee keeps under regular review the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and has established a policy for the award of non-audit work to the external auditors.
The policy distinguishes between those services which the external auditors would normally be engaged to provide: those which they may provide but where the Group also uses other suppliers of such services: those which can only be provided after prior approval by the Audit Committee and where additional safeguards may need to be implemented: and those which they are prohibited from undertaking.
Details of the non-audit services provided by the external auditors during the year under review are set out in note 3 to the financial statements on page 50.
The external auditors report to the Audit Committee on the procedures they apply to satisfy all professional and regulatory requirements together with best practice guidelines in order to ensure their independence from the Company.
