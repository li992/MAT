This contract relates primarily to European DVD manufacturing and distribution.
An exceptional charge of 23.1m, comprising an impairment charge of 18.0m, onerous lease provisions of 3.8m, and other costs of 1.3m, was recorded in the first half.
Deluxe Media Services also incurred an exceptional charge of 4.0m in respect of the VHS restructuring announced at the time of the 2003 year-end results in February 2004.
These charges relate to the closure of VHS manufacturing facilities in Germany, Italy and Portugal.
At Hard Rock, following a detailed review, it was decided to relocate a number of key cafes, starting with New York, to close the Vault, a rock and roll museum in Orlando, and to write down a number of underperforming units.
The effect of these actions has meant that an exceptional charge of 31.0m has been included in the 2004 results.
As set out in the Chief Executives review, the Board has decided to separate Deluxe Media Services from the rest of the Group by means of a sale.
As a result of this decision, a 104.7m provision for loss on disposal has been recorded in the second half of 2004.
In addition, 76.7m goodwill, which had previously been written off to reserves, has been charged through the profit and loss account.
A 4.1m exceptional loss has also been recognised principally on the disposal of the RLMS business at the start of 2004.
The total cash cost associated with all exceptional items is 19.0m.
The Rank Group Plc 34 Operating and Financial Review continued Cash ow 2004 2003 as restated m m Cash inow from operating activities Before Deluxe contract advances 242.4 309.2 Deluxe contract advances, net of repayments 17.8 17.3 260.2 291.9 Capital expenditure 115.6 111.4 Fixed asset disposals 7.3 9.4 Operating cash flow 151.9 189.9 Interest, tax and dividend payments 115.6 172.8 Free cash flow 36.3 17.1 Acquisitions and investments 74.7 123.6 Disposals including sale and leaseback transactions 29.9 4.1 8.5 102.4 Issue of Blue Square convertible loan stock 65.0 Cash outflow 8.5 37.4 including 65.0m of Blue Square debt in 2003 as restated for UITF 38 The Group generated 36.3m of cash before acquisitions and disposals but after interest, tax and dividends 2003 17.1m.
This reflects a much reduced net outflow on interest, tax and dividend payments following the redemption of the 226m cumulative redeemable preference shares, the refinancing of certain financial instruments, and a net tax repayment of 11.9m.
Operating cash flow was 38.0m lower than 2003 due to lower operating profits and an adverse movement in working capital, largely within Deluxe Media Services.

This largely reflects an increase in Gaming, following the acquisition and development of new properties in Bolton and Stoke-on-Trent, as well as the relocation of a number of bingo clubs.
