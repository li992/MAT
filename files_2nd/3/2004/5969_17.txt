Corporate Governance Statement The Combined Code on Corporate Governance The Board supports the highest standards of corporate governance.
During the year the Financial Reporting Council approved a revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance which became effective for companies financial periods beginning on or after 1 November 2003.
For the year ended 31 May 2004 the directors confirm that the company has been in compliance with the provisions of section 1 of the Combined Code effective for that accounting period except in respect of Professor J D Rhodes combined role as Chairman and Chief Executive officer.
Professor John Roulston will be appointed as Chief Executive officer on 6 September 2004 and from that date the company will be compliant with section 1 of the code.
Internal control The Board has adopted the published guidance by the Turnbull Committee on the implementation of the internal control requirements of the Combined Code and accepts that the Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining the companys system of internal control.
Internal control systems are designed to be relevant to the company and the risks to which it is exposed and by their nature can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key procedures established by the directors with a view to providing effective internal control are as follows: a Control environment and monitoring systems The Board meets each month and has adopted a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it for decision, thus ensuring that it maintains full and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly dened lines of responsibility and delegation of authority.
Additionally, the Board has established an Executive Management Board which is responsible for operational matters within the company.
The audit committee, which comprises all of the non-executive directors, reviews the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the companys annual financial statements.
They test the system of internal financial control and the information contained within the annual report and financial statements to the extent necessary for expressing their opinion.
b Major information systems The directors have delegated to executive management implementation of the system of internal control throughout the company.
This includes financial controls which enable the Board to meet its responsibilities for the integrity and accuracy of the companys accounting records.
The Board approves, in aggregate, budgets and other performance targets, the components of which form the financial objectives for individual operating units.
Performance against these targets is reported monthly.
Financial forecasts are updated and reviewed monthly and include cash ow forecasts.
c Main control procedures In addition to matters reserved for Board decisions, the company has established a system whereby authority to take decisions is distributed throughout the company.
This distribution of authority defines procedures for authorisation and approval and sets appropriate levels of responsibility.
An accounting policies and procedures manual sets out the companys declared statement of policy in all financial areas and establishes the control procedures, including segregation of duties, to ensure that these policies are implemented.
d Identication and evaluation of business risks The company has clear principles and procedures which are appropriate to a multinational electronics business.
These principles are designed to provide an environment of central leadership but with devolved operating responsibility as the framework for the exercise of accountability and control by the Board, its committees and executive management.
The Board directs activities in and allocates resources to the key areas of business development, product strategy, research and development, manufacture and financial practice.
The Board has appointed a Technology Advisory Board to provide strategic technical advice to the company.
This board comprises leading, internationally respected electronics experts together with outstanding engineering talent from within the company.
Through these ongoing procedures, the Board is able to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks which the group faces from time to time.
Filtronic plc Annual Report 2004 47 Corporate Governance Statement The Board confirms that it has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control as it operated during the year.
The Board undertakes, on an ongoing basis, a review of all aspects of the companys internal control procedures, and is able to report that the company has complied fully with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee during the financial year ending 31 May 2004.
This review is undertaken by the Board through the receipt and consideration of regular monthly and other reports prepared by management on operational, strategic, organisational and financial issues.
A system of financial internal audit has been established whereby a programme of internal audit work is carried out at the companys various locations by staff employed at other locations.
The programme is designed to focus on key controls and procedures in the financial system.
Additionally, areas of operations other than finance are audited periodically either by external agencies or through peer review to ensure compliance with group policies.
