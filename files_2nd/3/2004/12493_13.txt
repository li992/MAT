The accrued final salary pension shown at 1st February 2004 is the combined figure for the UK Scheme and US Plan defined benefit accruals and is the amount that the Director would be entitled to from normal retirement age if he left service at the end of the year.
The increase in final salary pension during the year is the increase over the figure disclosed in last years accounts both including and excluding an allowance for inflation during the year.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the Directors final salary pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore they cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The table above shows transfer values at the beginning and the end of the year.
As the transfer values are linked to investment market conditions, the improvement in equity markets over the year will have been a significant factor in the increase in transfer values which is shown.
Members contributions paid during the year were paid into the money purchase arrangement within the UK Scheme and as such are not included in the transfer value.
