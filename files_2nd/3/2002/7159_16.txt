Hays plc 33 Corporate Governance INTERNAL CONTROL The Directors are responsible for the Groups system of internal controls and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness.
A review has been completed for the year ended 30 June 2002 in accordance with the recommendations of Turnbull.
The Groups systems and controls are designed to safeguard the Groups assets and to ensure the reliability of information used within the business and for publication.
Systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the internal control systems, which operated throughout the period covered by the financial statements and to the date of signing the accounts, are described below.
Day-to-day responsibility for the management and operations of the business has been delegated to Divisional Boards.
This ensures that the businesses obtain maximum leverage from sector-specific skills.
Clear lines of authority exist between the Groups executive management and the Divisional Boards.
As far as possible subsidiaries are given autonomy, whilst operating within an established internal control environment as set out in the Group Policies and Procedures Manual.
The Manual is designed to ensure that significant risks, investment decisions and management issues are escalated to Group Board level at the earliest opportunity.
The Group Policies and Procedures Manual has been comprehensively reviewed and updated during the year.
Certain specific administrative functions are controlled centrally by the Group.
These include taxation, treasury, property, insurance and litigation.
These functions report directly to the Board via the Group Finance Director.
Procedures are clearly defined to ensure that the activities of these functions reduce the risk profile of the organisation.
An overview of the Groups treasury policy is set out on page 23.
The Group has an embedded process for the identification, evaluation and reporting of major business risks.
Policies and procedures have been laid down for the regular review and management of issues arising.
Progress on the management of key issues is reported through the management structure to executive management and to the Board.
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system.
Annual budgets are reviewed and approved at business, Divisional and Group level.
This process includes the identification and quantification of significant risks relating to markets and operations.
Monthly performance is reported against budget and prior year.
The monthly management accounts analyse and explain variances against plan and report on key indicators.
In addition, progress against the annual budget is comprehensively reviewed on a quarterly basis, with detailed explanations for variances and movements in forecast provided to the Board.
The Group has an internal Operational Review department and the resources of this department are augmented with independent expert external resources, wherever necessary, to review risk and monitor compliance with Group procedures.
Regular reviews of the most important controls are undertaken to ensure that key control objectives are achieved.
Reports on the effectiveness of operational and financial controls are regularly presented to executive management and to the Audit Committee and recommendations are agreed upon and implemented.
The focus of the Operational Review department is increasingly non-financial.
The monitoring of control procedures is achieved through management review by executive management reporting to the Board.
This is supplemented by reviews undertaken by the Operational Review department on the controls in operation in each individual business.
AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit Committee has written terms of reference requiring it to examine all financial statements and preliminary announcements, consider the appropriateness of accounting polices adopted and to consider whether the financial statements give a true and fair view.
The Audit Committee considers the appointment of external auditors and the scope, materiality and results of their work.
It also oversees the risk and operational review function and considers compliance with legal, regulatory, ethical and other issues.
Mr C S Taylor, an independent non-executive Director, chairs the Audit Committee.
Mrs Knox and Messrs Danon and Wallace, also independent non-executive Directors, are members of the Committee.
The external Auditors normally attend Audit Committee meetings and, at the request of the Audit Committee, the Group Finance Director and other senior financial managers will attend.
COMPLIANCE The Directors consider that the Company has complied throughout the accounting period with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code except for the following matters: The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are combined A.
All executive Directors have service contracts terminable by the Company on two years notice and in the opinion of the Board these are required to retain executives of the appropriate calibre B.
Not all non-executive Directors are appointed for specific terms A.
Non-executive Directors comprised less than one third of the Board for 19 days of the year A.
GOING CONCERN The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis since the Directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
