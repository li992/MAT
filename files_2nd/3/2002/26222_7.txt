long term business strategy OUTPERFORMING THE MARKET Providing better products and services to our customers, at prices they can afford this has been our long-term strategy and its working.
DIANE BUCKLEY, CORPORATE BUSINESS DIRECTOR Virtuous Circle Our business strategy is formulated on the principle of the Virtuous Circle.
This is our blueprint for delivering shareholder value.
By offering to the market good value products, quality service and a choice of ways to buy, we seek to achieve above-market growth.
The extra efficiencies generated by that growth can then be partly reinvested in more competitive products and partly used to reward shareholders for the risks they bear.
These more competitiveproducts in turn generate further above market growth and the Virtuous Circle begins again.
