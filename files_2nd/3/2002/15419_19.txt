Corporate governance The board is committed to good corporate governance and supports the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, issued by the Financial Services Authority the Combined Code.
During 2002, the group complied with all of the provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code, except to the extent that the notice period in the service contract of Mike Kirkham, the Chief Executive, is two years, as explained in the remuneration report.
Composition of the board The board comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, as well as four non-executive directors.
The non-executive directors, with their broad range of experience, bring an important independent perspective to board decision making.
In addition to the board members, the company has five associate directors who are invited to attend board meetings.
They do not have a right to vote at such meetings, however, it does allow them the opportunity to participate in key discussions whilst providing all board members with access to the senior managers responsible for the operation of the business.
Tony Cowling chairs the board and Mike Kirkham is Chief Executive.
The board has agreed their respective roles and responsibilities, to ensure they are clearly defined and that there are appropriate checks and balances in place.
Rob Rowley has acted as senior independent director since 1 January 2003, following the retirement of Nick Hodges on 31 December 2002.
Biographical information on each of the directors is given on page 54.
Function of the board The board is accountable to shareholders for the groups business operations and affairs.
It participates in the establishment of the groups strategy and then oversees its implementation: the presence of the associate directors at board meetings assists in this process.
The board is also responsible for monitoring the groups financial and operational performance, ensuring that appropriate risk management is in place and is being adhered to.
In addition, the board ensures that appropriate corporate governance procedures are established in order to protect the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.
There is a schedule of matters specifically reserved for consideration by the board that includes approval of financial statements, transfer of company assets, major acquisitions and disposals, expenditure authority levels and treasury and risk management procedures.
The full board met nine times during 2002.
Retirement by rotation In accordance with the companys articles of association, executive directors retire by rotation and submit themselves for re-election every three years and non-executive directors every two years.
Information and advice Board members are regularly briefed on matters affecting the groups activities, such as significant industry developments, as well as changes to the legal and regulatory environment in which the group operates.
Board reporting is designed to ensure that all information relevant to board decisions is submitted by the executive to board members in a timely manner prior to each board meeting.
There is an agreed procedure whereby all members of the board may obtain independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties.
Such advice was not sought by any director during 2002.
All directors also have access to the services of the Company Secretary.
Board committees The board has established three committees to assist in fulfilling its duties: an audit committee, a nomination committee and a remuneration committee.
Terms of reference have been adopted in respect of each committee.
The audit committee consists of non-executive directors only, as shown on page 54, and is chaired by Dr Neil Cross.
Its responsibilities include monitoring internal control, approving the groups accounting policies, reviewing the interim and annual financial statements before their submission to the board and keeping under review the scope and costs of audit and the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the auditors.
The external auditor attends all audit committee meetings and has direct access to the committee chairman.
The committee is entitled to take independent professional advice and has full independent powers of investigation and access to information.
The audit committee met twice during 2002.
The nomination committee comprises all non-executive directors, the group Chairman and the Chief Executive and is chaired by Dr Stephan Buck.
The role of the nomination committee is to devise criteria for board membership and review candidates for directorships, both executive and non-executive.
The nomination committee met three times during 2002. www.
com 59 Corporate governance continued The composition and responsibilities of the remuneration committee, together with an explanation of how it applies the principles of the Combined Code in establishing director remuneration, are included in the remuneration report on pages 62 to 66.
The remuneration committee met seven times during 2002.
Internal controls The board is responsible for ensuring the group has an appropriate system of internal controls.
Within the groups regional sector structure, day to day management of those controls is delegated to senior management of the relevant operating units.
Each year all operations perform an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls in place in their business through an internal control questionnaire and report their findings to the group.
In March 2002, a formal business review function and process were approved by the audit committee and board.
Under the review, a number of group businesses are subject to a detailed review, on the basis of a risk assessment, including financial, operational and compliance controls.
Recommendations for change are agreed with local management and the findings are reported to the executive committee and ultimately to the audit committee and the board.
During 2002, five such reviews were performed.
By these mechanisms the board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the groups system of internal controls for the year ended 31 December 2002.
The groups system of internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The executive committee, the composition of which is shown on page 55, is responsible to the board for the overall implementation of the strategy in the day to day running of the business.
It has set out a procedure for risk management that is reviewed regularly and on which it reports to the board.
The executive committee has reviewed the key business, financial, operational and compliance risks facing the group, prioritised their significance and assessed the current procedures and processes in place to detect and address them.
Initiatives have been put in place to address the key risks, which supports the group in achieving its strategy.
The board is of the view that there are appropriate on-going procedures for identifying and evaluating significant risks faced by the group.
These procedures have been in place for the financial year covered by this report and up to the date the annual report and accounts were approved.
The procedures comply with the Internal Control Guidance for directors on the Combined Code.
Financial controls and reporting The group operates a comprehensive system for financial reporting to the board, based on an annual budget and regular forecasts.
Financial performance is reported and appraised regularly and the operational management team identifies any new business matters, key risks facing the operating units and recent acquisitions in its reports to the board.
The board approves the budget in line with the groups corporate strategy.

In the Netherlands, these are held by Stichting NIPO Pension funds.
