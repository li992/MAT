Non-Executive directors are appointed for three year terms, after which time they may offer themselves for reelection.
Executive directors are not appointed for specific terms, however, in practice each director will normally serve a term no longer than three years due to the required retirement by rotation of one third of the Board at each AGM.

It is the companys policy that the following procedures should be adhered to with respect to AGMs: All proxy votes are counted and read out at the AGM: Separate resolutions are proposed for each separate issue: The Chairman of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available for any questions at the meetings: and It is the companys intention that notice of the forthcoming AGM and related papers will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before that meeting.
Statement of compliance The company complied with the Combined Code Provisions during the year, with the exception of the following: a The Remuneration Committee has not comprised at least three independent non-executive directors, because the board has satisfied itself that the directors who are members of this Committee are those who are best able to contribute to its objectives: and b Prior to Admission to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority, the group granted share options without performance criteria attached to them.
The majority of these options remain outstanding.
Options granted since December 2000 have had performance conditions attached.
The group does not intend to grant further share options to employees without attaching performance conditions to their exercise.
18 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Corporate governance continued Internal control The overall responsibility for easyJets systems of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness rests with the directors of the company.
The responsibility for establishing and operating detailed control procedures lies with the Chief Executive.
However, the internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and by their nature can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Guidance for directors, Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code was published in September 1999, in the form of the Turnbull Guidance.
The company complied with the guidance throughout the year ended 30 September 2002.
A formal on-going process has been established to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks faced by the company and this process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and this has been regularly reviewed by the Board during the period.
An ongoing process for the effective management of risk has been defined by the company directors and has been adopted as follows: On going assurance and risk management is provided through the various monitoring reviews and reporting mechanisms embedded into the business operations.
Key monitoring reviews include those conducted continuously by the Quality Group, in weekly meetings, including Commercial Operations, Marketing and Finance, and in monthly Executive Committee Meetings, where individual department and overall business performance is reviewed.
Control weaknesses or failings are considered by the Board if they arise: The Board considers the significant risks at each of its formal meetings: Management consider significant business risks in formal monthly meetings: Risk reviews form an integral part of specific projects, such as the acquisition of Go Fly and Deutsche BA and aircraft fleet purchases: An annual risk and control identification process, together with control effectiveness testing, is conducted.
The key risks to significant business objectives are identified and the key controls to manage these risks to the desired level are identified.
The controls, which mitigate or minimise the high level risks, are tested to ensure that they are in operation.
The results of this testing are reported to the Board who consider whether these high level risks are effectively controlled: 19 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Corporate governance continued Internal control continued Action plans are set to address any control weaknesses or gaps in controls identified: and A database of all risks has been created forming a key risk register for the company.
The directors reviewed the effectiveness of internal control, including operating, financial, compliance and risk management controls, which mitigate the significant risks identified.
The procedures used by the directors to review the effectiveness of these controls include: Reports from management.
Reporting is structured to ensure that key issues are escalated through the management team and ultimately to the Board as appropriate: Discussions with senior personnel throughout the company: and Consideration by the audit committee of any reports from external auditors.
Internal audit The company does not have an internal audit function.
This is presently considered appropriate given the size of the company and the close involvement of executive directors and senior management on a day to day operational basis.
The Board has considered the need for such a function and will continue to review the need for one from time to time.
Going concern The Directors are satisfied, after due consideration, that the group has sufficient financial resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
On this basis, they continue to adopt the going concern principle in preparing the financial statements.
