Corporate governance Corporate governance The Tibbett & Britten Board is committed to business integrity and professionalism in all its activities.
As part of this commitment, the Board supports the highest standards of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which is appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and the development of best practice.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2002 the Company has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance except that for a short period of time there was an imbalance between executive and non-executive directors, Combined Code Provision A.
However, it is not considered that such a situation has led to a domination of the Board's decision making by any one individual or small group of individuals.
The Companys commitment to achieving a balance of executive and non-executive directors is shown by the fact that during the last year the number of executives has reduced by two whilst the number of non-executives has remained the same at three.
Further commentary relating to internal controls can be found on page 31.
The Board and Board committees The Board comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive, three other executive directors, and three non-executive directors.
Their details appear on pages 18, 19 and 20.
Executive directors have responsibility for making and implementing operational decisions and running the Groups businesses.
The non-executive directors add to the skills and experience of the executive directors, contributing to the formulation of policy and decision-making through their knowledge and experience of other businesses and sectors.
The Board meets at least eight times a year.
The Board has sought to ensure that directors are properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings by establishing procedures for: distributing Board papers one week in advance of meetings: considering the adequacy of the information provided before making decisions: deferring decisions when directors have concerns about the information available to them.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and the continued timelines and quality of information is kept under review.
All directors have access to the advice of the Secretary and independent professional advice is available to directors in appropriate circumstances at the Companys expense.
No non-executive director has been on the Board for more than seven years and none of them has any significant business or other relationship with the Group.
All of them are considered to be independent.
Edward Buchan is the recognised senior non-executive director on the Board.
The Board considers that it has shown its commitment to leading and controlling the Company by disseminating throughout the Group the Groups current strategy and also by introducing periodical breakfast meetings whereby the Chief Executive officer Mike Arrowsmith explains that strategy to senior employees and seeks their comment and input.
Both the executive and non-executive directors make regular visits to the Groups businesses and meet with senior management to facilitate their understanding of the Group.
Directors are also offered appropriate training, especially if they have not previously been appointed to the Board of a listed company.
At each Annual General Meeting, one-third of the directors retire and offer themselves for re-election.
This means that each director stands for re-election at least once every three years.
All directors are now subject to re-election every two years rather than every three years as required by the provisions of the Combined Code.
Board committees Specic responsibilities have been delegated to the Board committees.
The three principal Board committees are: Audit committee Remuneration committee Nominations committee Edward Buchan, Chairman Bill Thomson, Chairman John Harvey, Chairman Bill Thomson Edward Buchan Edward Buchan Robert Wood Robert Wood Bill Thomson The audit committee meets at least three times a year with the Groups senior management, the internal audit team and the external auditors to review, inter alia, the Groups annual and interim financial statements, internal audit and compliance reports and the effectiveness of the Groups systems of risk assessment and internal control.
Periodically, it also approves and reviews the appointment and retirement of the external auditors, as well as their relationship with the Group.
The remuneration committee meets at least twice a year.
Its role is described further in the section on remuneration.
