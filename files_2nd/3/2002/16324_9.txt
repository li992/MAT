Deloitte & Touche Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors Reading 24 February 2003 An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether any changes may have occurred to the accounts since first published.
These matters are the responsibility of the Directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of accounts differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
