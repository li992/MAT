Corporate governance We are very much aware of the concerns surrounding corporate governance both in the US and here in the UK.
It is the Boards strong belief that we should do all we can to reassure both shareholders and stakeholders that the business is run to the highest possible standards of corporate governance.
Accordingly, as well as welcoming the Higgs Report on Non-Executive Directors and the Smith Report on Audit Committees, we have already been examining how we could upgrade our performance in the areas of corporate governance and social responsibility to provide further comfort, in anticipation of the publication of these reports.
Our Audit Committee has for some years now adopted many of the practices suggested by Sir Robert Smith.
Nonetheless we are actively considering what further measures we can take in line with the thrust of the Smith Report to further improve our performance.
We have also always sought to ensure that both our Executive and Non-Executive Directors are fully armed with the maximum amount of information possible, and we see it as our duty to ensure they are in a position to carry out their role fully.
In the area of social responsibility we continue to be very sensitive to the environmental impact of our product and our operations.
Accordingly we issued a separate Environmental report for the first time in 2002 and, as mentioned therein, we are now developing identifiable measures and benchmarks for our environmental performance both on site and in our offices with a view to reporting on these later this year.
On health and safety we have restructured our management processes to bring added weight to our efforts in this area, and the Group Board has undertaken its first detailed annual review of our processes and performance in this area.
While we will continue to strive for improvement it is encouraging to note that our performance in this area is significantly better than the industry average.
This statement sets out how the Company applies the relevant principles contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code appended to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The Board consider that throughout the year the Group has complied with the provisions of the Code as set out in Section 1 of the Code.
Board structure and reporting Throughout 2002, the Board comprised five Executive Directors and five Non-Executive Directors, three of whom the Board regard as independent.
All Directors stand for re-election at least once every three years.
Mr I Robertson has been the Groups Deputy Chief Executive throughout 2002 and will become Group Chief Executive on 1st March 2003, when the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive will be separated.
Mr M J Stansfield, the Chief Executive of the main Housebuilding division, and Mr N H Richardson, who is Chief Executive of both the Commercial Property Development and Wilson Bowden City Homes divisions, are both plc Board Directors and are accountable to the Board for all aspects of operations.
The substantial and strong independent Non-Executive presence, led by Dr A D Portno as senior independent Non-Executive Director, along with the management structure outlined above have ensured that the decision making process is not concentrated with any one individual.
It is also anticipated that the Non-Executive element of the Board will be further strengthened by appointing additional Non-Executive Directors as required.
Accordingly, whilst Mr D W Wilson combined the role of Chairman and Chief Executive during 2002, the Board considers that the requirements of the Code were satisfied throughout 2002 and will be in the future.
The Board will meet on not less than seven occasions during the current year and the Executive Directors also hold regular meetings.
Formal arrangements will be instituted during 2003 for the Non-Executive Directors to meet on their own on at least one occasion.
The Board has identified in writing various matters 38 Corporate governance Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 that are reserved to it for consideration.
All Directors have access, as appropriate, to independent professional advice and training, and also to the services of the Company Secretary.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Companys bonus or share schemes and no pension contributions are made in respect of them.
Shareholders A detailed review of the performance and financial position of the Group is included in the Chairmans statement on pages 6 to 9, together with the operating and financial review on pages 23 to 31.
The Board uses this to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Groups position and prospects.
The Directors responsibilities in relation to the financial statements are described on page 51.
The Company encourages two-way communication with its institutional and private investors based on the mutual understanding of objectives.
All shareholders have at least twenty working days notice of the Annual General Meeting, at which all Directors, including the Chairmen of the Boards Committees, are available for questions.
Board committees Board Committees are in existence to deal with audit, chaired by Mr P J Byrom: remuneration, chaired by Dr A D Portno: and senior executive appointments, chaired by Mr D E Brill.
Details of the composition of the Board Committees are given on pages 34 and 35.
The Committees responsible for remuneration and audit comprise solely three independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee meets as necessary and on at least two occasions per annum and has access to Mr D W Wilson, other Directors and external advisors as necessary.
The Audit Committee meets prior to results announcements and otherwise as required, with management and Executive Directors in attendance if required.
The external auditors may attend any of the Committees meetings, or request that a meeting be convened.
The Committee also has regular access to the Groups Internal Audit Manager.
The Nominations Committee meets as required and comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors and Mr D W Wilson.
Internal control The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control covering operational, compliance and risk management, as well as financial controls in Compliance with Code Provision D. 2.1.
The Directors are able to confirm compliance with the relevant guidance published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, throughout the period from 1st January 2002 until the Board approved the 2002 financial statements.
At each meeting the Board is made aware of any current internal control issues, whilst a more comprehensive review is undertaken twice yearly.
Similar processes are in place at subsidiary board level.
Regular initiatives are undertaken designed to ensure that the businesses maintain their focus on the embedding of internal control and risk assessment into their operations and to deal with areas of improvement that come to the attention of either operating management or the Board.
The Board of Directors acknowledges its overall responsibility for internal control.
However, it believes strongly that, due to the commercially and geographically diverse nature of the Groups business, senior management within the operating businesses should also contribute in a substantial way to the ongoing process of identifying, evaluating, managing and transferring risk.
Responsibility is also devolved to operating management for ensuring that appropriate controls are established and regularly reviewed in the context of the business environment in which the Group is operating.
The Groups systems of internal control are designed around ensuring adequate stewardship of assets, providing appropriate information on a timely basis for the running of the business and ensuring the maintenance of proper accounting records.
These procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Corporate governance 39 Corporate governance continued In carrying out their review of the effectiveness of internal control in the Group the Board have taken into consideration the following key features of our systems of internal control: Each business unit produces a risk assessment incorporating a prioritisation of the Groups exposure to risk.
This assessment encompasses operational, compliance, financial and business risk and is updated on an ongoing basis with a different aspect of internal control reviewed by management each month.
A risk assessment is similarly prepared for the Group covering the central functions and strategic risks.
The Audit Committee at its meetings periodically reviews these risk assessments.
A detailed system of budgeting, reporting and forecasting for the Groups operations is in place with particular focus on cash flow and profitability.
This is updated monthly and provides appropriate, timely information on the performance of the business as well as projections and sensitivity analysis for the outlook period.
This information is monitored in the local operations and also centrally.
The Groups key financial control functions are centralised, which allows for high-level input and provides control over our diverse operations.
The Internal Audit department has an established audit plan, which is regularly reviewed, updated and approved by the Audit Committee.
The work of the department includes audits of systems and controls, reviewing all significant changes to systems and controls, ad hoc investigations, value for money exercises, review of the risk assessments and facilitating the work of the external auditors.
The conclusions stemming from the departments work are reported to the Audit Committee.
As part of the bi-annual review of internal controls a process of self-certification by senior management is operated in order to ensure that, as far as possible, the controls and safeguards are operated in line with established procedures and standards.
Our control and monitoring procedures are subject to regular review and the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of our internal financial controls to ensure that they are keeping pace with operational and organisational change and the business environment in which the Group is operating.
