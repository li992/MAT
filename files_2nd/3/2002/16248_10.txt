CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT COMBINED CODE COMPLIANCE This report describes the manner in which the board has applied the principles of the Combined Code on corporate governance which is appended to the listing rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The board considers that during 2002 the company complied fully with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code.
The company has complied with the internal control provisions by establishing the procedures necessary to implement the guidance issued in September 1999 the Turnbull Committee report and by reporting in accordance with that guidance.
THE BOARD Under the companys articles of association, at each annual general meeting any director then in office who has been appointed by the board since the previous annual general meeting and any director who at the date of the notice convening the annual general meeting had held office for more than 30 months since he was last appointed or re-appointed by the company in general meeting shall retire from office, but is eligible for re-appointment.
During the greater part of 2002 there were eleven board members in total, comprising the chairman part time, chief executive, three other executives and six non-executive directors.
That number was reduced to ten following the retirement of the chairman, Sir Ronald Hampel, on 5 November 2002.
Sir Ronald was succeeded as chairman by Geoff Unwin, who has served as a non-executive director of the company since 1996 and previously chaired the audit committee.
The roles of chairman and chief executive are separate, and the board has nominated John Botts as the senior independent non-executive director.
The board receives regular written reports from all executive directors: the chief executive reports principally on matters of strategy and development, the chief operating officer provides detailed reports on the day to day operations of the groups businesses, the chief financial officer reports on accounting, treasury and tax matters, and reports are also received from the executive director responsible for the groups investments.
The primary function of the board is to set the groups strategy and to oversee the effective implementation of that strategy.
Scheduled board meetings take place approximately seven times a year, with additional meetings being convened if circumstances require.
There is an established agenda of items to be considered at the board meeting and the board also receives presentations from executive directors and from divisional management and other senior executives on specific issues.
The chairman meets separately with the chief executive on a regular basis and other informal meetings and discussions take place between directors as appropriate.
The board has three principal committees, all of which have written terms of reference.
Details of these committees are as follows:- The audit committee was chaired by Geoff Unwin until November 2002 and its other members were John Botts, Sir Ronald Hampel and Adair Turner.
Following Sir Ronald Hampels retirement another non-executive director, Jonathan Newcomb, was appointed as a member of the committee and Adair Turner was appointed chairman of the committee.
All members of the committee are non-executive directors and are considered by the company to be independent.
The committee meets at least four times a year.
Meetings are also attended by the chief financial officer, deputy CFO, head of internal audit, company secretary and external auditors.
The audit committees terms of reference were reviewed during the year in the light of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, US legislation introduced in July 2002 to which the company is subject by virtue of the listing of its ordinary shares on NASDAQ in the form of American Depositary Receipts.
The committee now has authority to appoint, review and remunerate the external auditors and to pre-approve their engagement for both audit and non audit services: it also reviews the independence and objectivity of the auditors and reviews the groups accounting procedures and financial control environment.
The committee has established policy guidelines on the nature of non audit work which may be undertaken by the auditors.
These guidelines identify a number of categories of work where the auditors will not be employed, including financial due diligence assignments on potential acquisitions and financial systems consultancy.
The committee has also put in place procedures for the pre approval of any fees payable to the auditors for those non audit services which fall within the policy guidelines.
It is the companys policy to review its external audit arrangements every five years: during the year the committee carried out such a review, as a result of which Ernst & Young LLP were appointed as auditors to the company in May 2002.
The remuneration committee is chaired by John Botts and its other members are Sir Ronald Hampel until November 2002, Jonathan Newcomb, Christopher Powell, Adair Turner, Geoff Unwin and Fields Wicker-Miurin.
Further details of the committees activities are set out in the directors remuneration report on page 18.
The company was among the first to invite its shareholders to vote on its remuneration policy in 1998 and has done so at all subsequent annual general meetings.
In accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which have now come into effect, shareholders will be given the opportunity at this years annual general meeting to vote on the remuneration report as a whole.
The nomination committee was chaired by Sir Ronald Hampel until November 2002 and is now chaired by Geoff Unwin.
Its other members are Clive Hollick and John Botts.
The committee meets as required to review the structure, size and composition of the board and to identify candidates, both executive and non-executive, whose skills and experience are considered to be of value to the company.
In addition to the principal committees the finance committee, comprising any two directors to include at least one of the chief executive and chief financial officer, approves and facilitates the groups treasury and financial operations within limits established by the board.
The company secretary acts as secretary to all the above committees.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The directors believe that effective corporate governance is strengthened by the presence of a strong independent element on the board.
Of the ten board members, 60 per cent including the chairman are non-executive directors: all are considered by the company to be independent.
Biographies of all of the directors currently in office are set out on pages 16 and 17, and illustrate the range of experience of directors.
The board is considering the recommendations of the Higgs report on the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors which was published in January 2003, and will review its procedures in the light of those recommendations.
