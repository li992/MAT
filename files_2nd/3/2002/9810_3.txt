32 | W&DB Annual report 2002 The annual general meeting, which is regularly attended by approximately 300 shareholders, provides an important forum for communicating directly with shareholders and the opportunity for shareholders to raise questions with the Board.
At the annual general meeting the Chairman announces the results of proxy voting on each resolution after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
Internal control W&DB, as required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, has complied with the Combined Code provisions on internal control.
The Executive Directors examine, and report to the Board as necessary, the procedures required to implement in full the guidance on internal control produced by the Turnbull Committee.
In addition, the Board has taken account of the Association of British Insurers guidelines on socially responsible investment and in this respect has been registered on the FTSE4Good index.
The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal controls and for ensuring that information supplied to shareholders presents a balanced assessment of the Groups position.
It has carried out these responsibilities throughout the year.
There is a weekly review by the Executive Directors, and annually by the Board, of the risks faced by the Group.
These cover financial, operational and risk management issues day-to-day control is implemented by Divisional Management Teams which report to Divisional Managing Directors.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks facing the Group at the weekly Executive Directors meetings and at monthly briefing meetings with the Senior Executive management group.
Risk and litigation issues are also reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
The principal elements of the system of internal control, which is designed to ensure there is an ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage the risks to which the Company is exposed, include: a management structure which clearly defines authority levels, responsibility and accountability: a detailed formal budgeting process for all Group activities with the annual Group budget being formally approved by the Board: and a process to ensure Board approval is given to all major investment and strategic plans including capital expenditure and development programmes.
Significant treasury, cash management and investment matters are received and approved by the Board.
The Groups system of internal controls can only manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can, therefore, only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Health and safety The management of health and safety matters is based on the Health and Safety Executives management system HSG 65.
All areas of the Group have been risk assessed and appropriate control measures implemented.
Regular Safety Committee meetings are held throughout the Group and independent experts such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ROSPA are used.
Auditors  have expressed their willingness to be re-appointed as Independent Auditors of the Group.
Going concern The Directors are confident, having reviewed the Groups budget for the 52 weeks to 27 September 2003 and relevant plans beyond that date, that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operation for the forseeable future.
This review included an analysis of business operating plans, proposed capital expenditure and associated cash flow projections.
It also included a comparison of results and ratios within the Groups committed borrowing facilities.
It is therefore considered appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
