Internal control Introduction The Board has established procedures to implement in full the Turnbull Guidance Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code and to assist the Company to comply with applicable provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and regulations thereunder for the year under review and to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts.
These procedures, which are subject to regular review, provide an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks faced by the Group.
Responsibility The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal control.
A sound system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Control structure There is a defined operating structure with lines of responsibility and delegated authority.
This is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Executive Committee chaired by the Chief Executive Officer.
Written policies and procedures have been issued which define the limits of delegated authority and provide a framework for management to deal with areas of significant business risk.
These policies and procedures are reviewed and where necessary updated.
The Board formally approves the Group Treasury policy, which sets appropriate limits to mitigate treasury risk.
The Board reviews the most significant risks facing the Group, their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence and the control procedures put in place to mitigate those risks.
29 Enodis annual report and accounts 2002 Corporate governance Control environment The Groups operating procedures include a comprehensive system for reporting information to the Directors.
This system is documented and regularly reviewed.
Budgets are prepared by operating company management and subject to review by both Group management and the Directors.
Forecasts are revised during the year and compared against budget.
When setting budgets and forecasts management identifies, evaluates and reports on the potential significant business risks.
Monthly reports of operating performance, with commentary on variances against budget, forecasts and prior year, are prepared at operational and Group levels.
Key performance indicators are monitored.
The acquisition of any business requires a rigorous analysis of the financial implications of the acquisition and key performance figures.
A sensitivity analysis takes place of the key assumptions made in the acquisition case.
Post investment appraisals of the Groups investments are conducted on a periodic and timely basis.
A treasury report, with details of treasury borrowings and investments, is distributed to corporate management on a monthly basis.
The Audit Committee reviews a quarterly report detailing any significant legal actions faced by Group companies.
Monitoring and review activities There are clear processes for monitoring the system of internal control and reporting any significant control failings or weaknesses together with details of corrective action.
A formal annual self assessment is provided by the presidents and controllers of each Group company detailing the operation of their control systems and highlighting any weaknesses.
Regional management, the Audit Committee and the Board review the results of this assessment taking action as appropriate.
Group risk management issues are reviewed by a Group Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and comprising cross functional representatives from across the Group.
The Committee reports to the Board, or in the case of internal financial controls, to the Audit Committee, on all risk management matters.
Reports from management and the external auditors, Deloitte & Touche, on certain internal controls and relevant financial reporting matters are presented to the Audit Committee and management.
Where, as a result of these reviews, issues are identified in the internal control environment, prompt corrective actions are taken.
Review of effectiveness The Directors believe that the Groups system of internal control provides reasonable but not absolute assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately.
The Directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control through the monitoring process set out above for the year under review and to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts.
Compliance statement The Listing Rules require the Board to report on compliance with the Code throughout the accounting period.
The Company has complied throughout the accounting period ended 28 September 2002 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code save in respect of one provision in the employment contract of D S McCulloch.
In certain particular circumstances, which are set out on page 30, he is entitled to 24 months compensation on termination of employment by the Company.
Board remuneration report Remuneration policy The remuneration arrangements for senior executives are designed to enable the Company to recruit and retain executives of the calibre needed to achieve Enodis goal to become the clear world leader in food service equipment.
The Remuneration Committee has established an overall framework for the remuneration of executives throughout the Group, governed by seven principles that executive compensation should:- be determined by reference to external markets be seen throughout the business to be fair and equitable be based on total compensation be supportive of key business strategies be affordable be aligned with shareholder value be understandable.
In forming its remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to the principles in Section B of the Code.
Elements of executive Directors remuneration Certain details of Directors contracts, remuneration and interests in the Companys securities, including share options, are set out on pages 30 to 32.
30 Enodis annual report and accounts 2002 Corporate governance The remuneration arrangements for the executive Directors consist of: Base salary Base salaries are determined by reference to those of similar positions in international businesses of broadly comparable size and structure, taking account of turnover, market value, business sector, number of employees and international involvement.
Independent consultants are used to provide comparative information for the Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonus Annual cash bonuses are based on performance targets.
The principal measures for senior executives for the period were Group operating profit and cash flow.
The Remuneration Committee approved certain other incentive arrangements for executive Directors during the year in recognition of the particular circumstances prevailing during the period.
These were primarily focused upon cash generation and net debt reduction, as well as personal objectives relating to implementation of strategically important initiatives.
The Remuneration Committee may add other corporate or job-related measures as it considers appropriate.
Long-term incentives: executive share option schemes Options are outstanding under the Enodis 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, which uses new shares, and the Enodis 1993 Executive Share Option Scheme, which uses shares purchased by an employee share trust.
Additionally, there is in existence the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme.
No further options can be granted under these schemes.
In the year ended 28 September 2002, options have been granted under the Enodis 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme.
In normal circumstances, the value of shares under options which an executive may receive in any year may not exceed twice base salary using the face value method, i. e. number of shares multiplied by exercise price, in any financial year.
Following his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, A J Allner was awarded a greater value of options reflecting the increase in his responsibilities and exceptional circumstances.
Exercise of options by all executives will be subject to meeting challenging performance conditions.
The performance condition attached to the grants during the period at 147p was that prevailing in the financial year ended 29 September 2001, as they were awarded pursuant to a promise to grant made that year.
The performance condition requires that options will be exercisable in full only if the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR is ranked in the upper quartile relative both to other Mid 250 companies excluding Investment Trusts and to a group of about 20 other quoted companies in the UK and overseas with analogous businesses.
Options will be exercisable on a sliding-scale basis if the Companys TSR falls between the median and upper quartile levels, as compared with the two comparator groups.
The performance conditions were changed for the year ended 28 September 2002.
The performance condition attached to the grants during the period at 85.5p is based on the Companys TSR compared with the companies comprising the FTSE Mid 250 excluding investments trusts at the date of grant excluding companies that have ceased to be listed.
Options granted over shares with a value of up to one times base salary will be exercisable in full if Enodis TSR is greater than that of the median ranked company.
Options awarded in excess of one times base salary in any particular year will be exercisable as to 35% if Enodis TSR is greater than that of the median ranked company, and exercisable in full if Enodis TSR is at least as great as that of the upper quartile ranked company, with pro-rata exercisability between these two points.
Long-term incentives: share matching scheme No awards have been made under the share matching scheme under which executives may be awarded matching free shares linked to the deferral of their annual cash bonus and the Board has decided not to operate it for the time being.
Other benefits Executive Directors are provided with a fully expensed company car or an allowance in lieu thereof, medical insurance, disability insurance and other benefits in line with practice in other listed companies of similar size.
Pension Andrew Allner, the only UK resident executive Director, has opted not to belong to the Companys pension arrangements and therefore instead receives a salary supplement of 27% of base salary.
Service contracts and compensation Service contracts will normally contain a notice period to the Director of one year with consideration being given to two years in exceptional circumstances.
The Company is entitled to terminate A J Allners employment on 12 months notice.
If the termination is without cause or if he resigns within 12 months after a change of control, he is entitled to a payment equal to a 95% of his annual base salary, b 95% of his salary in lieu of membership of Company pension arrangements, c 95% of annual on target bonus only if termination occurs before 31 May 2003 or on change of control in addition to any pro rated bonus entitlement up to the date of termination of employment, d one years car allowance, and e continuation of other benefits for one year.
The service contract with D S McCulloch a US executive contains provisions, which were in place some time before his appointment to the Board, whereby the contract is terminable by a Group company without cause on payment of 24 months base salary in the event of termination on or before 31 March 2003, or in the event of a change of control.
In the event of termination without cause after 31 March 2003, payment will be of an amount in accordance with the Companys then severance policy for senior executives currently 12 months base salary.
The change of control amount remains unchanged at 24 months, however.
