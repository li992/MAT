51 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2002 All participants are able to opt to take their annual incentive in shares rather than in cash.
Those who do and retain their shares for three years and remain in employment or rank as a qualifying leaver receive a 50% enhancement of their shareholding.
As outlined in the letter from the Remuneration Committee at the start of this report, the Committee believes that this feature clearly aligns the interests of participants and shareholders by encouraging participants to be both long-term colleagues and long-term shareholders, having first achieved stretching performance targets in relation to their operating plans.
There is no short-term incentive plan for the Chairman or the Non-executive Directors.
2 Long-term Incentive Plans There are two plans.
Participation is determined by an individuals Level.
Participants in the first plan are granted conditional shares shortly after the start of the financial year equal to the number of shares secured by a percentage of the participants salary and based on the price of the Groups shares, using the average market price in the last ten business days of the previous financial year.
For awards in 2003, grant levels will be as follows:- Conditional share grant 1 Category as a % of salary Executive Directors and Chairman 100 Level 8 66.67 Level 7 33.33 1 or aggregate annual fees payable in respect of the services of the Chairman, in the case of the Chairman.
The number of shares ultimately released to participants under the plan is dependent on the Groups annualised total shareholder return TSR defined as the gross overall return on ordinary shares of HBOS after all adjustments for capital actions and re-investment of dividends or other income over three year periods, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies Abbey National, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland, Aviva, Legal & General, Prudential and Royal & Sun Alliance over equivalent periods, as follows:- Groups relative Amount released as TSR performance a % of share grant 0% p. a. or below 0 3% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 Intermediate positions are determined by interpolation.
For technical reasons Dennis Stevenson will become entitled to the cash value of the relevant shares on release.
This value will, subject to any withholdings for tax or National Insurance, be applied in acquiring shares on his behalf.
Participants can choose to take any shares released after three years or can continue to participate in the plan for a further two years and take shares at that point based on the better of the three year and the five year performance outcome.
The performance test over five years is significantly more demanding than that over three years because participants have to sustain the same level of annual outperformance for a longer period.
This design feature seeks to motivate participants continually to sustain strong performance or to improve lesser performance for their benefit and for the benefit of shareholders.
As outlined in the letter from the Remuneration Committee at the start of this report, the Committee believes that this feature clearly aligns the interests of participants and shareholders by only rewarding participants for producing above average shareholder performance.
Calculations of TSR performance are performed independently of the Group by New Bridge Street Consultants for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
Participants in the second plan are granted share options shortly after the start of the financial year equal to the number of shares secured by a percentage of the participants salary and based on the price of the Groups shares using the average market price around the date of grant.
Grant levels are dependent on the performance of the Group over the previous financial year and over the longer term.
For awards in 2003, grant levels will be as follows:- 1 Category Share option as a % of salary Executive Directors and Chairman nil Level 8 nil Level 7 20 1 or aggregate annual fees payable in respect of the services of the Chairman, in the case of the Chairman.
Participants can exercise their options after three years but not more than six years.
There is no long-term incentive plan for the Non-executive Directors.
