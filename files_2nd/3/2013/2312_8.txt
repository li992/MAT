Accounting Policies The Committee reviewed the suitability of the Groups Accounting Policies and changes to regulatory requirements.
There were no changes to accounting standards that are significant to the Groups results for the year.
The Committee noted that for the next financial year the Group will adopt revisions to IAS 19, Defined Benefit Plans, which require recognition of a net return on the excess of pension fund liabilities over assets in the Income Statement, with differences going to Other Comprehensive Income, and a consequential reduction in reported earnings per share, which will require restatement of comparative information.
Judgemental Areas Key risk and judgement areas are reviewed in assessing the external auditors plan, their areas of audit focus and the internal audit plan.
In advance of approval of each set of published financial statements, the Committee considers the key assumptions and judgements made and reviews these with the Group Finance Director.
These potential alternative treatments are discussed with the external auditor.
The Committee also examines the impact of sensitivities around future cash flows and other risks in considering the appropriateness of the going concern assumption.
This year, particular attention was paid to accounting for the acquisition of Makro, property provisions, taxation and the assumptions underpinning the pension valuation.
Internal Controls The Committee discussed the control environment with the Group Finance Director and received reports from the internal auditors.
This included steps taken to ensure the effective implementation of new systems in the growing business in India.
Whistleblowing Programme The Group has a whistleblowing programme in all of its operations whereby employees can, in confidence, report on matters where they feel a malpractice is taking place, or if health and safety standards are being compromised.
Additional areas that are addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to the environment.
The programme allows employees to raise their concerns with their line manager or, if that is inappropriate, to raise them on a confidential basis.
An externally facilitated confidential helpline and confidential email facility are provided to protect the identity of employees in these circumstances.
Any concerns are investigated on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department and or the Company Secretary and feedback is given to the person making the complaint as appropriate via the confidential email facility.
An official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and reported to the Committee.
Internal Audit The Committee approves the appointment of the Head of Internal Audit who has open access to the Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee also routinely meet alone with the Head of Internal Audit.
During the year the Committee reviewed the focus of the internal audit team, its skills and resources and approved its annual plan.
Compliance with the plan and findings from internal audit reports are regularly reviewed.
The Committee also sought further controls over timely implementation of recommendations made.
19 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued Non-audit services The Committee recognises the potential for any non-audit services to compromise auditor independence and the external auditor is not permitted to conduct any assignment which may affect objectivity or independence.
Subject to this, where it is helpful to the Group for KPMG to provide assistance, the Committee monitor the services provided and fees charged.
In view of their knowledge of the Groups ways of working and the importance of efficient integration of the acquired business, KPMG were asked to provide due diligence and reporting accountant services in respect of the acquisition of Makro.
It is rare and relatively inefficient for other than the Companys external auditor to perform the role of the reporting accountant.
The aggregate fee for this amounted to 645,000.
Other non-audit work comprised small assignments to assist with tax compliance and other matters for aggregate fees of 87,000.
The Committee believes that there are sound commercial and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the external auditor and that it is not of a nature which would affect their independence as auditors.
As a result of their role as reporting accountants, the aggregate non-audit fees paid to the external auditor during the year were relatively high at 732,000.
Nonetheless the Committee are satisfied that the external auditors independence was not affected by this work or level of fees.
Appointment and independence of external auditor At its first meeting after the year end audit, the Committee regularly reviews the quality and efficiency of the previous year-end procedures and audit.
This year the Committee have been assisted by a letter from the Audit Quality Review Team of the Financial Reporting Council who review the audits of a sample of major companies as part of their statutory duty.
Conclusions of the Committees review are taken up the following year and enable the Committee to be confident in recommending reappointment of the external auditors.
The Committee also reviews the auditors annual plan, paying particular attention to the proposed areas of audit focus, the continuity and experience of the audit team and their independence.
KPMG has been the Companys external auditor since 2005.
To ensure the external auditors independence is safeguarded, the lead audit partner is changed at least every five years which last occurred in 2010.
The Committee reviews the relationship the Company has with KPMG annually and for the year ended 29 March 2013, the Committee was satisfied with the performance, objectivity and independence of KPMG as the external auditor.
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board and to shareholders that KPMG should be re-appointed as the Companys auditor at the AGM on 10 July 2013 and KPMG has signified its willingness to continue in office.
Committee performance and effectiveness The Board undertook an annual review of the Committees performance and effectiveness and concluded that the Committee operated effectively.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 May 2013.
