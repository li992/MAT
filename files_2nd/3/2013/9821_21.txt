CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CHAIRMANS MESSAGE ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Dear Shareholder Having recently been appointed as Chairman I can see that we as a Board, and a Company, take corporate governance very seriously, and consider that good conduct is the basis of good performance.
The Board sets the tone for the rest of the Company.
Developing the skills of colleagues and providing opportunities for career advancement is central to our thinking.
The Board also strives to improve its own performance.
The Board evaluation is a key component of this and the assessments and outputs from this years externally facilitated evaluation will further the development of the Board and improvements to performance.
Lord Hodgson has announced his intention to retire from the Board following the AGM and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank him for his contribution during the last 11 years, particularly as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and as the Senior Independent Director.
Neil Goulden will take up the role of Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Neil will remain a member of the Audit Committee but Nick Backhouse will be appointed as Chairman of that Committee.
Both changes will be effective from the conclusion of the AGM.
Further details on the Boards composition are given at page 32.
In this report we provide an overview of our corporate governance practices, describing how the main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code are applied throughout the year.
Information about the Board, its members and committees, and an overview of the Companys internal controls are all explained.
