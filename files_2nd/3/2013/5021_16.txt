Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information Letter from the Chair of the Nominations Committee We have continued to focus on Board composition and refreshment during the year.
Marion Sears Chair of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder, We have continued to focus on Board composition and refreshment during the year with the aim of creating the right diversity of skills and mix of tenure amongst the Non-Executive Directors.
This means that, for a while, we will have a larger Board due to overlap of tenure as we seek to maintain continuity whilst managing succession.
We were pleased to appoint Liz Doherty as a new Non-Executive Director in May.
Liz brings a broad range of operational and financial experience to the Board and she is also an experienced Non-Executive Director.
We are fully compliant in terms of Board balance between Executives and Independent Directors, and also in terms of Committee membership.
However, we think continually about the future needs of the business and about how the Board can help to preserve our culture throughout the organisation, whilst at the same time ensuring the calibre of Board necessary to support our ambitions for growth.
The executives have made some important senior management appointments during the year to support these ambitions and all senior positions have well developed succession plans in place.
Store management teams have been reorganised in a clear and transparent way to ensure all colleagues have the opportunity to see a path for internal promotion.
Looking forward, we will continue to work on Board composition and refreshment with the aim of achieving smooth succession of Directors over the next few years.
Yours sincerely, Marion Sears Chair of the Nominations Committee 12 September 2013 Dunelm Group plcAnnual report and accounts 2013 57
