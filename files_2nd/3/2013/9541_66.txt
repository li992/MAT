01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 Other policy provisions in relation to Directors pay Flexibility, discretion and judgement We believe that the remuneration of the Executive Directors should reflect their performance in delivering the Companys strategy.
No remuneration policy and structure, however carefully designed and implemented, can ever pre-empt every possible scenario.
As a result, the application by the Committee of flexibility, discretion and judgement is crucial in achieving fair outcomes.
Flexibility is necessary in designing each years remuneration within the approved three-year policy, for example in devising appropriate metrics for the annual bonus plan to support short-term business imperatives.
Discretion is needed, amongst other things, in determining whether mechanistic or formulaic outcomes are fair, in context, and can be applied in an upward or downward manner.
For example, the assessment of the Balanced Scorecard may generate pay outcomes that need to be adjusted to reflect broader socio-economic realities or the Companys financial position and prospects.
Judgement is vital in setting individual targets and goals, for example in the Balanced Scorecard, which will be seen as reasonable by shareholders at threshold and realistically achievable by executives at stretch or in the detailed design or interpretation of performance conditions.
English company law requires us to state the extent of discretion available to the Committee on any aspect of the Directors remuneration policy.
In addition to the above, while noting that there are three distinct concepts, the Committee has discretion as follows: Annual Bonus The Committee has discretion 1 to invite participants into the bonus programme, and determine the percentage of their salary which can be earned as a bonus at target and stretch subject to the plan rules, 2 to design performance measures and set targets for each financial year to incentivise business outcomes which are aligned with the strategic imperatives facing, or likely to be facing, the Company and to allocate weightings between these as it judges appropriate, 3 during each financial year, to amend the design of the Balanced Scorecard where material external factors render the original design inappropriate or inadvisable, 4 in assessing the formulaic outcomes of the Balanced Scorecard for the year, to apply its discretion upwards or downwards to ensure that the resulting bonus payment is fair a between shareholders and the Executive Directors and b between the Executive Directors, 5 in relation to leavers as provided for in the table set out on page 75, 6 on a change of control of the Company, to determine the amount, or a minimum amount, of bonus for that year taking into account such factors it considers appropriate, including performance and time-apportionment, the timing of payment and any additional terms which may apply to such payment, and 7 whether to settle bonus awards in cash or in shares.
ASAP The Committee has similar discretions as under the Annual Bonus in relation to participation, award level, performance measures, targets and weightings, and amendments to the plan.
In addition, the Committee has discretion 1 to determine the form of awards whether a conditional allocation, restricted shares or nil-cost option and, in relation to options, the exercise period and whether any amount need be paid in order to exercise, 2 in relation to leavers as provided for in the table set out on page 76, 3 to determine whether awards vest on a restructuring of the Company, 4 to pay dividend equivalents on vested shares either in cash or in additional shares, and 5 to apply malus adjustments to all or part of any award in the circumstances set out in the table on page 76.
LTIP The Committee has discretion 1 to determine who is to participate in the plan and the levels of award to be made, 2 to set the performance measures and targets, and the weightings between them, to determine the vesting of awards, 3 in relation to leavers as provided for in the table set out on page 77, 4 on a change of control of the Company, to determine the level of vesting of awards taking into account performance and such other factors as the Committee believes to be relevant, 5 to pay dividend equivalents on vested shares in cash, and 6 in relation to awards made after the 2014 AGM, to apply malus and or clawback to all or part of any award in the circumstances set out in the table on page 77.
Shareholding obligation The Committee may opt to vary the length of the periods within which shareholdings are acquired, in appropriate circumstances.
com 82 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 Other policy provisions in relation to Directors pay continued Approach to remuneration of Directors on recruitment When determining the remuneration of a newly-appointed Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will apply the following principles: offer a package which is sufficiently competitive in terms of both fixed and performance-related remuneration to attract, retain and motivate candidates of suitable calibre and experience, but without over-paying, relative to London-listed companies or, where relevant, mining companies in South Africa or another market from which the individual is being recruited of equivalent size, complexity and risk: design the package such that the amount of performance-related remuneration offered by way of annual bonus and participation in any long-term incentive plans incentivises the individual to deliver value-creating outcomes, but does not create a perverse incentive for the individual to pursue excessively risky strategies: in determining what is appropriate remuneration, the Committee will take all relevant factors into consideration, including but not limited to the impact on other existing remuneration arrangements and internal pay relativities: the candidates current location and role, and their skills, knowledge and experience: the nature of the role they are being recruited to fulfil and the desired outcomes the individual will deliver: and external market influences generally including any competing offers the individual may be considering: design the package such that high levels of reward will only result from performance and or the delivery of value to shareholders that justifies such pay, and that the relationship between pay and performance creates fairness between the new Director and shareholders: and ensure that there is fairness between the terms and conditions of employment of the new and existing Directors.
Where promotion to an Executive Director role is from within the Company, any performance-related pay element arising from their previous role will generally continue on its original terms.
All of the components of pay set out in the policy table would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package, and the maximum values set out in that table would apply in respect of elements of variable remuneration.
Where the appointee has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the value foregone, either as an award under an existing share plan or a bespoke award under the Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose.
The face and or expected values of the award s offered will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award s foregone, and would normally follow the same vesting timing and form cash or shares save that the Committee may award the whole of the value in Lonmin shares, at its discretion.
The application of performance conditions would be considered and, where appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back or malus in appropriate circumstances.
The Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead of committing to make any such sign-on awards and a full explanation of any amounts awarded, an explanation of why this is necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made would be announced to the markets at the time of granting.
In accordance with the policy table on page 80, new Non-executive Directors would be paid a base fee for their appointment as a Director, plus fees for their participation on any board committees, time-apportioned in the first year as necessary.
In certain cases, equivalent amounts may be invoiced by their employing companies.
No sign-on payments are offered to Non-executive Directors.

These contracts place the following obligations on the Company which could give rise to, or impact on, remuneration payments or payments for loss of office: to provide pay inclusive of Directors fees, contributions to a defined contribution pension arrangement or a cash supplement in lieu and benefits whether in cash or kind as specified in the contract, and to reimburse expenses incurred by the Director in performing their duties: to give the Director eligibility to participate in discretionary shortand long-term incentive plans: to provide 25 working days plus bank public holidays paid holiday per annum, or pay in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday on termination of employment: to provide sick pay as specified in the contract: subject to the termination, garden special leave and suspension provisions of the contract, to provide continued employment in the role to which the individual has been appointed: and to terminate the contact only on the expiry of 12 months written notice save in the event of a repudiatory breach of contract or in certain other very limited circumstances, or to make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the value of the base salary, pension contributions and benefits in kind that would have been payable for the period of contractual notice subject to exercising the Companys discretion to make phased payments.
The treatment of shortand long-term incentives on termination is dealt with in the next section of this policy report.
There are no relevant contractual provisions imposing an obligation on the Company which could give rise to or impact on remuneration payments or payments for loss of office specific to an individual Director.
It is not currently intended that future service contracts for Executive Directors would contain terms differing materially from those summarised above and in the policy table.
In addition to the contractual rights to a payment on loss of office, any employee including Executive Directors will have statutory and or common law rights to certain additional payments, for example in a redundancy or retrenchment situation.
The Non-executive Directors have each entered into a letter of appointment with the Company and Services Agreements have been entered into with the respective employers of three Non-executive Directors.
These do not require any period of notice of termination, regardless of the circumstances, and have no provisions for compensation on termination.
The Executive Directors service contracts and the Non-executive Directors letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
Policy on payment for loss of office The Companys policy on the setting of notice periods for Executive Directors is driven by the need to protect shareholders interests.
The service contracts of the current Executive Directors are terminable on the expiry of: six months notice from the Director this means that, where no in-house successor has been identified, the Company would have time to replace the Executive Director through an orderly external recruitment process, and ideally have a period of handover: or twelve months notice from the Company this makes the individual a less attractive candidate for a prospective employer, given the time that will elapse before they could be sure of taking up their new employment, and also provides the Company with the ability to place a Director joining a competing employer on a lengthy period of garden special leave so that the information they possess becomes out of date.
The principles on which the determination for payments on termination will be approached are as follows: Calculation of each component of payment save in circumstances where the Company is entitled to terminate employment summarily, the Executive Directors service contracts legally oblige the Company to either continue to pay salary and pension allowance and maintain all contractual benefits for any unworked period of notice or, at the option of the Company, to make a payment in lieu of such notice comprising base salary that would otherwise have been paid.
The service contracts do not oblige us to pay short-term incentives for that proportion of the bonus year worked by the Director, but it is our custom and practice and a requirement of the plan rules to do so, based on an assessment of personal and corporate performance to the date of exit, and time apportionment.
As policy, the Committee will not pay bonus for any unworked period of notice, even though this is permitted in the plan rules.
In circumstances where the role fulfilled by the Executive Director is declared redundant or retrenched, then the individual may have a legal right to either statutory redundancy pay, or to a payment under the Companys normal severance arrangements applicable to employees generally.
com 84 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 Other policy provisions in relation to Directors pay continued Policy on payment for loss of office continued In cases of poor performance, contractual termination payments may generate undue and potentially excessive reward.
In such circumstances, the Committee would consider terminating employment other than on the terms of the contract and then seeking to apply mitigation when calculating the damages payable.
However, an action of this nature would need to be considered carefully in its broader context, particularly given the effect such a precedent could have on the morale of other executives, and the loss to the Company of the benefit of the restrictive covenants contained in the service contract.
The Company also has the discretion in the service contracts to determine, in accordance with prevailing best practice, that a payment in lieu of notice should be phased in monthly or quarterly instalments over a period of no longer than 12 months and that any payment should be reduced in accordance with the duty on the part of the executive to mitigate his loss.
The Companys various incentive plans are governed by formal rules, all of which have been approved by shareholders.
Directors have no contractual rights to the value inherent in any awards held under these plans, whose rules make provision for vesting in different leaver scenarios and the table below illustrates how entitlements under these plans will be managed on termination: Good leaver being broadly redundancy or retrenchment, retirement, injury, ill-health or disability, death, the sale of the Company or that part of the business in which the Plan Director was employed Other leaver scenarios The Balanced Scorecard The Committees policy is that, as provided for in No right to a bonus under the BSC but the Bonus Plan BSC the rules of the BSC, the bonus will be calculated Committee has discretion to treat other leavers after the usual year end audit and assurance in the same manner as good leavers.
This processes and time-apportioned for the discretion will not be exercised in the case of proportion of the financial year worked, although summary dismissal.
the Committee has the discretion to determine the bonus amount as of the date of leaving, taking into account such additional factors to the above as it considers appropriate.
Annual Share Award Plan An award is not forfeit.
Our current policy is to The Committee may determine that an award allow the award to be exercised within six months will not be forfeit in which case our current policy of the vesting date being the third anniversary is to allow the award to be exercised within of the date of grant.
six months of the vesting date being the third anniversary of the date of grant.
In the case of summary dismissal awards will lapse.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards vest at the time and to the extent Awards lapse unless the Committee exercises determined by the Committee after taking into its discretion to preserve and vest the award on account the extent to which applicable any terms it thinks fit.
performance conditions have been met and time apportionment.
Except in cases of death-in-service, the Committees policy is not to vest any long-term incentive awards for leavers earlier than their normal vesting date.
Where leaver entitlements require an assessment of performance conditions, this will be at the end of the performance period in the usual way, and time-apportionment then applied.
In our experience, Directors can leave employment for a wide range of reasons which do not fall within the prescribed category of good leaver, encompassing a vast range of individual situations.
The Committee must retain discretion to approve payments to individuals falling into this middle ground to create sufficient differentiation, taking the Directors performance in office and their circumstances of their exit into account.
In doing so, the Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing Executive Director, as well as the interests of the remaining and departing Directors.
Where awards which are permitted to vest are subject to performance conditions, these would only be assessed at the end of the relevant period s and any resulting reward then subject to time-apportionment.
