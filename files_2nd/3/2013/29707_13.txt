The suitability and adequacy of training that is made available to Directors isassessed as part of the performance evaluation process.

Performance evaluation The Board performance evaluation at the end of 2012 identified that the Boards focus should move away from reviewing strategy and on to implementing the approved strategy.
During the year, the Board oversaw the commitments to Permira V, The Fifth Cinven Fund and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, Fund IX.

This year, the evaluation process was completed and reviewed by the Board in November 2013.
The process was led by Andrew Sykes.
The process involved compiling a discussion guide which covered designated topics, including board operation, strategy, corporate governance and risk management.
A written report was produced by the Chairman, and sent to Board members and discussed at the following Board meeting.
Overall the evaluation process confirmed that the composition and operation of the Board was satisfactory.
The evaluation process specifically addressed diversity, including gender, within the Board.
The Board was in agreement that it had an appropriate level of diversity, but that this should be kept under review.
The Board has considered carefully whether the evaluation of its performance should be externally facilitated at least once every three years.
It was decided that internal evaluation was appropriate in 2013, given the recent changes in composition of the Board and the size of the Board.

The roles of the Board committees should be reviewed inlight of this change of ownership in ASVG.
It was agreed that a detailed analysis of the risks of outsourcing should be undertaken.

Following this sale, the Company has no control ofpayments to Mrs Fordham or any other former employees of the Group.
Accordingly, the Committees role is limited to reviewing the level of fees payable to non-executive Directors and operating the Companys Share Award Schemes as they relate to historic awards.
The Board considers each member of the Committee to be independent.
To discharge its duties, the Committee metformally once during the year ended 31 December 2013 to approve the annual bonus proposals and long-term incentives for LynnFordham and key staff based on performance levels within the organisation in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012.

Relations with shareholders The Board believes that the maintenance of good relations with both institutional and retail shareholders is important for the prospects ofthe Company.
It has, since its launch, sought engagement with investors.
The Chief Executive and Chairman and other Directors, where appropriate, discuss governance and strategy with major shareholders and the Chairman ensures communication of shareholders views to the Board.
The Board also undertakes shareholder perceptions research from time to time.
The Board believes that the Annual General Meeting provides an appropriate forum for investors to communicate with the Board, and encourages participation.
The Annual Report and Accounts is, when possible, sent to shareholders at least 20 business days before the Annual General Meeting, which is normally attended by the full Board of Directors.
There is an opportunity for individual shareholders toquestion the chairmen of the Board, Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Details of proxy votes received in respect of each resolution are made available to shareholders at the meeting.
The Board believes that the Companys policy of reporting to shareholders as soon as possible after the Companys year end is valuable.
The notice of AGM at page 98 sets out the business of the meeting.
Going concern The Groups activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chairmans statement on pages 12 and 13, the Chief Executives report on pages 14 and 15 and the Strategic Report on pages 1 to29.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review onpage17.
In addition note 29 to the financial statements includes details of the Groups financial instruments and its risk profile.
Adescription of the Groups risks and risk management framework are also outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 29.
The Group finished the year with net cash of 115.2 million and has access to an additional 250.0 million through the Revolving Credit Facility to December 2015.
This adequately covers the 316.0 million of uncalled commitments to the investment portfolio.
In light of the Groups financial resources, the Directors believe that the Group is well positioned to manage its business risks within the Groups risk appetite and tolerance successfully despite the continuing uncertain economic outlook, and, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Liquidity and solvency risks are monitored on an ongoing basis via the Companys risk management framework.
This includes formally defining the ASVG personnel responsible for assessing and monitoring risks, defining an appropriate level of risk assessment rigour to be applied, formal reporting on the Companys residual retained risk status, a formal process to define the level of independent assurance onthe risk assessment process and representations and Board oversight of the risk management framework for solvency and liquidity risk.
