56 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS External audit Policy on non-audit services The Committees responsibility to monitor and review the objectivity The Committee places great importance on ensuring that high standards of quality and effectiveness are maintained within the and independence of the external auditor is supported by a policy in relation to the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor.
It considers a number of areas in relation to the external auditors: their performance in discharging the audit Taking into account relevant ethical guidance this policy precludes a number of non-audit services including services relating to the and interim review of financial statements, their independence and objectivity, and their reappointment and remuneration.
accounting records and financial statements, internal audit, IT consulting, legal and investment services and other services deemed Consideration of the effectiveness of the external auditors also forms by regulators to be precluded.
The policy is reviewed and financial limits for the provision of non-audit services, including audit-related part of the Audit Committees performance evaluation questionnaire and is discussed regularly with management to enable prompt fees, tax-related fees and other fees, are set on an annual basis 2013 feedback to be given.
Any amounts in excess of this limit must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee.
The Companys external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP EY, provided the Committee with their plan for undertaking the year end audit at Requests for approval of any permitted non-audit service are reviewed the Committee meeting in November 2013.
This highlighted the and, if necessary challenged by the Company Secretary, who reports to proposed approach and scope of the audit for the year and identified the Committee all non-audit services undertaken at each Committee the areas of significant risk and other financial statement risk, meeting so that it can monitor the types of services being provided and including the audit approach for these areas in some detail.
The areas the fees incurred.
Details of the fees paid to the external auditor for of significant risk were primarily identified as issues of judgement non-audit services can be found in Note 5 to the consolidated financial and complexity and included revenue recognition and tax accounting.
The Committee considers that notwithstanding the The Committee reviewed and appropriately challenged the basis for non-audit services provided during the year totalling $0.2 million 2012 these before agreeing the proposed approach and scope of the $0.4 million, EYs objectivity as external auditor was not impaired.
EY prepared a detailed report of their audit findings, which was presented to the Committee at its meeting in February 2014.
The findings were reviewed and discussed in detail by the Committee, in particular in relation to the areas that had been highlighted at the planning stage.
As part of the review, the external auditor was questioned and challenged Ian Brindle by the Committee about the work undertaken, its findings and what key Chairman of the Audit Committee assumptions had been made during the audit, especially with regard to 27 February 2014 the key areas of audit risk identified.
Prior to recommending their re-appointment as external auditors, the Committee considers EYs independence and objectivity in the light of relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements, specifically in the light of the Competition Commissions investigation into the market for statutory audit services for large companies and also the EUs review of the audit services market.
EY have been the Companys external auditors for more than 25 years and the audit has not been tendered during that time, although it was noted that as a result of EYs policy on rotating audit partners there had been a new Audit Partner in 2011.
The Committee determined that given the developing nature of the regulations relating to audit tendering provisions from the Competition Commission and the EU, and that there are no contractual obligations that restrict the Companys current choice of external auditor, it would not be appropriate to instigate a tender process at the present time.
