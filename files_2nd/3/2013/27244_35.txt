Mr Frewen is resident in the UK and prevented by the Companys Articles from attending board meetings from the UK.
It is not deemed cost effective for the Company for him to travel to Guernsey for the regular meetings to approve dividends in line with the Companys dividend policy: he does however attend all quarterly board meetings.
Board Committees The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Management Engagement Committee and a Remuneration and Nomination Committee with defined terms of reference and duties.
Further details of these committees can be found in their reports on pages 17 to 30.
