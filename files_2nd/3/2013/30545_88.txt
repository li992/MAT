Our relationship with the RHS Witan Investment Trust has enjoyed a fruitful relationship with the Royal Horticultural Society RHS for more than 15 years.
Over this time Witan has helped the RHS to redevelop a number of new gardens at Wisley including the Walled Garden West, the Herb Garden and most recently the Bowes-Lyon Rose Garden.
