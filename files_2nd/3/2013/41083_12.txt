BOARD AND COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE In the previous financial year, we conducted our annual evaluation of the Board and Committee performance through an independent external consultancy.
This year, the evaluation was conducted by me with support from the Company Secretary.
The process covered Board, Committee and personal performance and the output was reviewed by the Board.
The process confirmed that the Board and its Committees continued to work effectively.

During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration structure in place at Workspace.

These were discussed with the Companys largest shareholders.
When the Company announces its annual and half year results, the Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer make presentations to institutional investors and analysts and hold one-to-one briefings with key shareholders.
In addition, I am available to meet with shareholders if they wish to raise any matters separately.
