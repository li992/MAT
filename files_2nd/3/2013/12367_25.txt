Expected life, years 2.6 for the First date, 3.6 for the Second date Fair value per share US Dollars 16.97 Both basic and diluted loss earnings per share were calculated by dividing loss profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares before after dilution respectively.
The calculation of the weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows: 34.

Share-based payment expenses in relation to the New LTIP are therefore expected Short-term loans provided to equity method investments 190 11,792 to be recognised in 2014.
Long-term loans provided to equity method investments 1,017 5,469 The fair value of the awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2010, was estimated using a twostage Monte-Carlo Total loans provided to related parties 1,207 17,261 model.
The fair value determined was then recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Use of two-stage MonteShort-term loans provided by Nomos-Bank 9,305 9,172 Carlo option pricing requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
The following Long-term loans provided by Nomos-Bank 7,882 16,643 assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value: Long-term loans provided by equity method investments 2,152 Expected forfeitures.
This assumption is estimated using historical trends of executive Director and employee turnover.
Total loans provided by related parties 17,187 27,967 As the Group typically only grants awards to senior employees and the turnover rate for such employees is minimal, the Accounts receivable from related parties 164 4,717 Group has estimated expected forfeitures to be 5%.
Estimated forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period Interest receivable from related parties 242 836 to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates.
Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognised in the period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognised in future periods.
Carrying values of other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 Expected volatility.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on an analysis of the historical stock price volatility approximate their fair values.
Details of the significant terms of the loans provided by related parties are disclosed in Note 26. of the JSC Polymetal GDRs from February 2007, when the JSC Polymetal GDRs became publicly traded.
