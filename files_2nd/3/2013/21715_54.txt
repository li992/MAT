Audit Committee Report INTERNAL CONTROL We considered the Risk Assessment and Review of Internal Controls prepared by the Administrator and ensured that the controls exercised by the Administrator in controlling the Companys affairs were adequate and were properly implemented.
In November 2013 the Companys appointed Administrator, Anson Fund Managers Limited, was acquired by JTC Group Limited and the Administrator changed its name to JTC Fund Managers Guernsey Limited.
The Audit Committee has made due enquiry of the purchaser about the implications of this acquisition on the systems and controls affecting the administration of the Companys affairs.
We were informed that, for the foreseeable future, the same staff, systems and controls will be used in the continuing administration of the Companys affairs.
In December 2012 and in March 2014 we met with the key operations staff of the manager of the funds underlying the Companys investment in AllBlue in order to evaluate the control environment at BlueCrest.
In addition we received an annual report, in the form of an ISAE 3402 Type II Service Auditors Assurance Report, prepared by EY concerning the investment management services controls system for processing customers transactions at BlueCrest.
Having reviewed the scope of the engagement we felt able to place reliance on this report and hence the internal controls operated by BlueCrest regarding the processing of the transactions of the funds that they manage.
