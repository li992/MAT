In the following pages you will find the formal disclosures we are required to make in the report and additional detail to help our shareholders better understand how we link remuneration to the performance of the Company, its strategic objectives and risk management.
We have made a number of changes in recent years to the structure of the pay packages for our Executive Directors and other senior executives, most recently last year introducing a new share plan the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan and increasing the limit for Performance Share Plan awards in the ordinary course.
We made these changes to ensure that our Directors, who have, in our view, delivered consistent, strong share price growth for shareholders over many years, are appropriately rewarded for delivering that performance and incentivised to continue it.
We are not this year proposing any changes to our overall remuneration structure or to our existing remuneration policy.
That policy, as explained in the Committees report last year, and which was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders, is to provide remuneration arrangements that are fair both to executives and shareholders are weighted towards variable performance-related pay do not require base pay to be at median or above are capable of delivering upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance and are consistent with and supportive of the Boards focus on the strategic development of the Group and risk management.
The Committee has carried out a detailed review as to whether the remuneration packages for its Executive Directors are currently implementing that policy successfully.
In that review the Committee identified that the considerable growth of the Company over the last few years has meant the executive teams base pay has fallen significantly below market rates c 20%25% below median for the Companys size.
This being so, the Committee concluded that the implementation of remuneration policy was not being fully achieved in that base salaries at this level were no longer considered fair and, importantly, when taken together with the variable performance related pay structures, might not be capable of appropriately rewarding upper quartile performance if such performance is achieved.
Moreover, the Committee was concerned that maintaining base pay at these levels would pose a real risk for the Boards strategic development and succession planning agenda by making more difficult than need be the recruitment and retention of senior executives essential to the delivery of that strategy and the mitigation of succession risk.
The Committee has shared these concerns with some of the Companys leading shareholders and has taken the decision to increase base pay for Directors by 9%, effective 1 April 2013.
These increases leave base pay below median, in line with the stated policy.
Further details about these changes can be found in the policy implementation section on pages 84 and 85.
The Committee also reviewed the performance targets that it intends to apply to the 2013 PSP, CSOP and DBMP matching awards to ensure they remain challenging but appropriate in the economic climate at the time of grant.
Details of these targets were shared with our leading shareholders, and are also provided within the implementation report on page 90.
We have no hesitation as a Committee in commending these changes to shareholders, not only based on the need to deliver on our policy, but also in the light of the performance of the senior executive team in developing the business, both organically and by successful acquisitions, which has delivered excellent returns for shareholders on a sustained basis over many years.
By way of putting that in context the following table shows the performance and growth of your Company over the last five to ten years: Babcock International Group PLC 75 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Babcock FTSE 350 1 10 year Total Shareholder Return 1470% 177% 1 5 year Total Shareholder Return 118% 40% 1 1 year Total Shareholder Return 40% 17% 2 Market Capitalisation 31 March 20133,772m n a 31 March 2012 2,690m 31 March 2008 1,282m 31 March 2003 144m 1.
3-month average Whilst the new regulations governing shareholder approval of and reporting of executive rewards do not apply to the Company until 2014, we have incorporated a number of the changes to the Remuneration report this year, where practical to do so, whilst still remaining compliant with the current Regulations.
In summary, this report is now divided into two sections: the first section outlines Babcocks forward looking remuneration policy, sets out components of pay, how they are linked to the business strategy, and reward opportunities for the Executive Directors.
The second section reviews how the policy was implemented in the year to 31 March 2013, and includes a table showing a single figure of total remuneration for Executive Directors.
This single figure shown on page 84 relates to remuneration earned in relation to performance periods ending on 31 March 2013 and includes the value of long-term incentives that will vest in July 2013, being three years from the date of grant.
This table has been prepared in accordance with the latest draft guidelines from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS.
The current Regulations that govern this report require us to present an emoluments table as shown on page 99 which provides the same information for fixed and short-term pay but which excludes the value of any long-term incentives.
As in previous years, and in accordance with the current Regulations, the details of all outstanding long-term incentives are included in the detailed tables in pages 95 to 98.

For the fair-value scenario, the chart is based on the following assumptions: annual bonus fair values including the mandatorily deferred share element of 71% of salary for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame who have a 150% maximum bonus opportunity and 59% of salary for Archie Bethel, Kevin Thomas and John Davies who have a 125% maximum bonus opportunity : the maximum self-investment opportunity is taken-up under the DBMP, with a fair value of the matching award of 67% of salary for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame and 62% of salary for Archie Bethel, Kevin Thomas and John Davies: and PSP fair values of 70% of salary for the Directors other than Peter Rogers, and 93% of salary for Peter Rogers reflecting his higher 200% award.
The fair value of an incentive is its long-run average outcome.
This takes into account the difficulty of achieving the associated performance conditions.
It also takes account of factors such as volatility, time value of money, risk of forfeiture, correlation between the value of a share and the performance conditions.
The stretch scenario assumes maximum bonus, the maximum self-investment opportunity is taken-up under the DBMP and full vesting of awards under both the PSP and the DBMP.
Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.
The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal and or spousal holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least twice the Directors annual base salary.
The guidelines also state that normally and subject to the Committees discretion to allow a dispensation an Executive Director is expected to retain at least half of any shares acquired on the exercise of a share award that remain after the sale of sufficient shares to cover tax and national insurance triggered by the exercise and associated dealing costs until the guideline level is achieved and thereafter maintained.
The Executive Directors other than John Davies currently meet these guidelines, as shown in the table on page 95.
John Davies only became subject to the two times salary guideline on his appointment as a Director on 1 January 2013.
Prior to that date the guideline shareholding for an executive at his level was one times base salary, with which he was complying.
Remuneration of senior executives below the Board The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Board is consistent with that for the Executive Directors.
Senior executives participate in the same long-term incentives as the Executive Directors with the same performance measures applied.
Babcock International Group PLC 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Details of Directors service contracts and exit payments The following table summarises the key terms excluding remuneration of the Directors service contracts or terms of appointment: Executive Directors Name Date of service contract Notice period Peter Rogers Chief Executive 31 July 2003 amended by letters dated 5 May 12 months from Company, 2004 and 3 April 2006 6 months from Director Bill Tame Group Finance Director 1 October 2001 amended by letters dated 12 months from Company, 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 6 months from Director Archie Bethel Chief Executive, 21 April 2010 12 months from Company, Marine and Technology 6 months from Director Kevin Thomas Chief Executive, 20 April 2010 12 months from Company, Support Services 6 months from Director John Davies Chief Executive, 20 December 2012 12 months from Company, Defence and Security 12 months from Director The Companys policy is that Executive Directors service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company on not more than 12 months notice.
Each of the Directors service contracts entitles the Company to terminate their employment by making a payment of pay in lieu of notice.
In the case of Executive Directors other than John Davies such a payment, if this right is exercised by the Company, would be by way of a lump sum payment on termination.
In the case of John Davies, his contract allows the Company in these circumstances to choose to make the payment in lieu by monthly instalments.
If it does, he would be obliged to seek alternative sources of income in a comparable role during what would have been his notice period.
If he fails to use, in the Committees reasonable opinion, reasonable efforts to secure such an alternative source of income, the Committee may decide to reduce or discontinue further instalments.
If he does secure such alternative remuneration the Committee may reduce the instalments by the amount of the alternative income being received.
If the Company terminates a Directors service contract, the Company will, to the extent it is free to do so, have regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount of compensation, including as to the scope for mitigation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination.
The agreements for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame but not the agreements for Archie Bethel, Kevin Thomas and John Davies contain provisions which provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control, each may terminate his employment forthwith.
If he exercises this right, he is entitled, for a 12-month period, to be paid on a monthly basis his base salary plus 40% compared to a maximum entitlement under the annual bonus scheme of 150% in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements.
From this there is to be deducted any amount that the Director receives by way of income, if it exceeds 10% of his Babcock salary, from other sources that he would not have been able to earn had he continued in employment with the Company.
The agreements for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame but not the agreements for Kevin Thomas, Archie Bethel and John Davies also provide that if the Company terminates their appointment within 12 months of a change of control, they would be entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of annual salary plus 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits.
For leavers, the Committee has the discretion to determine the level of PSP, CSOP, DBP and DBMP Basic and Matching award vesting.
A good leaver as determined under the relevant rules will, as regards performance-based awards under the PSP, CSOP and DBMP matching awards as a minimum be entitled to retain a time pro-rated proportion, which remains subject to outstanding performance conditions.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, PSP, CSOP, DBP and DBMP awards will generally vest immediately, and, for performance-related awards, will as a minimum be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance conditions.
The Committee has discretion to allow awards held by leavers to vest immediately and or in full or for a good leaver or on a change of control at a higher proportion than strict time-apportionment if it considers this to be appropriate.
In deciding whether and how to exercise its discretion the Committee will take account of all the circumstances arising including, in the case of a leaver, the reasons for and circumstances of the termination of employment, the leavers length of service, level of responsibility and business impact, individual performance during their tenure, exceptional contribution to the business and the extent to which that contribution is expected to still have an impact during the remainder of the applicable performance period.
The Committee may also make any favourable exercise of its discretion subject to conditions.
An individual would generally be considered a good leaver if they leave the Groups employment by reason of injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or retirement in each case evidenced to the Committees satisfaction.
The treatment of share awards held by Directors who leave on other grounds is entirely at the discretion of the Committee and in deciding whether and the extent to which it would be appropriate to exercise that discretion the Committee will have regard to all the circumstances.

The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work carried out in the year under review totalled 135,000 including VAT.
How often it met In total there were eight meetings in the year to 31 March 2013.
Details of each members attendance at these meetings are set out on the table on page 82.
The Committee plans to meet at least six times in the current financial year.
Principal areas of focus for the Committee during the year to 31 March 2013 Performance measures and targets for annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes The Committee considered at length the appropriate financial conditions and non-financial objectives to attach to annual bonus awards for 2012 13 and for 2013 14 and the financial targets to attach to share awards in those years to ensure they continue to be: i relevant to our strategic objectives and aligned with shareholders interests mindful of risk management: and ii fair by being suitably stretching whilst realistic.
Further details on the measures we propose to use for the 2013 14 annual bonus schemes and for performance-related share awards to be made in 2013 are set out in the following pages of this report.
Other matters The Committee also considered other matters during the year, including: The Committees terms of reference: Executive remuneration policy and philosophy and any changes that might be needed: The making of share awards under the Companys share plans: The level of vesting of PSP and CSOP share awards granted in 2009: The vesting of DBP awards made in 2010: The level of annual bonuses for the year to 31 March 2012: Annual pay reviews for Executive Directors and other senior executives for the year to 31 March 2014: The level of take up of all-employee share plans and how it might be improved: A review of the Chairmans fee: Trends in executive remuneration, remuneration governance and investor views: The Committees approach to payments on termination of employment and the consequences of termination for share awards: The extension of matching awards under the DBMP to executives below Board level: Policy on the effect of share disposals and the granting of matching awards under the DBMP: and The performance and continued appointment of the Committees remuneration consultants.
Internal relativity As noted above, when reviewing Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee takes note of proposals for pay in the wider Group.
Each business within the Group determines its own pay structures and remuneration in light of its own position and the employment market in which it operates.
The overall average salary increases for employees generally for the year to 31 March 2014 is expected to be in the order of 3% with individual increases significantly above this amount in some cases dependent on business and personal performance and local market conditions.

Summary of the structure of Executive Directors remuneration Based on the Committees policy, the principal elements of the remuneration arrangements other than pension benefits or supplements in lieu of pension benefits for Executive Directors in the year to 31 March 2013 and for the year to 31 March 2014 are summarised in the table below.
Further details on the annual bonus schemes, share awards, and pension schemes and pension benefits are to be found in the following pages of this Remuneration report.

John Davies was appointed as a Director on 1 January 2013.
Salary reflects that he receives car and fuel benefits.
Babcock International Group PLC 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Base salary Executive Directors base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes usually taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee believes that a key driver of Babcocks performance has been the Companys effective use of variable remuneration to focus and incentivise its staff and senior management on delivering value for shareholders.
Towards the end of the financial year, the Committee conducted a detailed review of the Companys remuneration policy and practice, and concluded that whilst the policy and structure of remuneration are appropriate, the considerable growth of the Company over the last few years has meant the executive teams base pay has fallen significantly below market rates c 20%25% below median.
Whilst the Companys policy is not to chase a median, the Committee is keen to ensure that salaries remain sufficiently attractive to allow us to attract and retain top talent and capable of working with variable pay elements to deliver superior rewards for superior performance.
The Committee felt that this disparity was not consistent with its policy and objectives and, as a result, approached its leading shareholders with proposals to address this.
As part of its evaluation, information on market pay data is considered by the Committee.
Market data for pay benchmarking is based on two reference groups for the CEO and FD: i companies of similar size market cap to Babcock, and ii companies operating in a similar sector to Babcock, for the Divisional Chief Executives total remuneration was benchmarked against FTSE350 companies with Divisional or regional heads on the Board.
With respect to the sector peers, and the peer group for the Divisional Chief Executives, pay data takes into account the disparity in size of the peer companies, some of whom are significantly bigger, or significantly smaller, than Babcock.
A summary of the market pay data is provided below: Summary of fair value benchmarking Director CEO FD Divisional Chief Executives Fair Value of Total Fair Value of Total Fair Value of Total Salary Salary Salary remuneration remuneration remuneration k k k k k k Benchmark median 730 2,240 440 1,270 380 1,050 Benchmark lower quartile 650 1,940 410 1,180 310 800 Babcock 2012 13 561 1,926 355 1,136 309 937 Compa ratio to median 77% 86% 81% 89% 81% 89% The fair value of total remuneration at Babcock and the comparator companies is taken as actual base pay, allowance in lieu of pension and or pension benefits as applicable, target bonus with long-term incentives valued based on long-run average outcome taking into account the difficulty of achieving the associated performance conditions, and factors such as volatility, time value of money, risk of forfeiture, and the correlation between the value of a share and the performance conditions.
For matching plans, the valuation assumes a two-thirds take-up of any voluntary investment opportunity.
As discussed in the Summary Statement on page 74, the Committee has decided to award the following basic salary increases for the year to 31 March 2014: Salary Salary 2012 13 2013 14 % Director increase Peter Rogers 561,350 611,871 9% Bill Tame 355,350 387,331 9% Archie Bethel 309,000 336,810 9% Kevin Thomas 309,000 336,810 9% 1 John Davies n a 321,810 n a 1.
John Davies was appointed as a Director with effect from 1 January 2013.
The difference in salary between him and the other Divisional Chief Executives, Kevin Thomas and Archie Bethel, reflects that he receives car and fuel benefits, in lieu of an element of salary.
The salary increases outlined above would result in the Executive Director salaries remaining below market but would move the fair value of total remuneration within 15% of median, and would help support the remuneration policy of allowing for the possibility of upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance.
It also assists the Company in retaining and attracting the necessary executive talent to continue to deliver strong performance for shareholders.
It is not anticipated that a further significant salary increase will be required in the near future.
Accounts and other information Governance Performance and Risk Operating review and KPIs Strategy and Business model Overview Babcock International Group PLC 86 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Remuneration report continued Pensions audited The Executive Directors, other than John Davies, did not participate in a Group pension scheme or otherwise receive pension benefits from the Group for service during the year to 31 March 2013.
These Executive Directors received a cash supplement equal to 25% of their base salary in lieu of pension benefits.
John Davies is a member of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme.
During the year to 31 March 2013, he received a cash supplement equal to 36,000 in lieu of pension benefits on that part of his base salary as exceeded the applicable scheme earnings cap.
Supplements paid in lieu of pension do not count for pension, share award or bonus purposes.
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme the Scheme audited Bill Tame was a member of the senior executive tier of the Scheme until 30 September 2011.
Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas were members of the executive tier of the Scheme until 31 March 2012.
All three Directors are no longer active members of the Scheme.
Whilst still members of the Scheme, Bill Tame accrued benefits at the rate of one-thirtieth, and for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas at the rate of one-forty-fifth, of pensionable salary for each year of service.
John Davies is a member of the VT Upper Section Ex-Short Brothers section of the Scheme.
He accrues benefits on earnings up to the Scheme earnings cap currently 137,400 at the rate of one-sixtieth of pensionable salary for each year of service.
Pension entitlements under the Scheme defined benefit for the year to 31 March 2013 are set out in the following table: Increase in Transfer accrued benefits value of increase excluding in accrued Change in Transfer Increase in Accrued inflation during accrued benefits value at Transfer benefits less transfer value pension at the year ended after allowing for 1 April value at Directors less Directors 31 March 2013 31 March 2013 inflation 2012 31 March 2013 contributions contribution Director p. a.
Transfer values do not represent amounts that a Director is entitled to receive, they are an actuarial calculation of the cost of providing for the potential benefits.
Changes in transfer values reflect both additional pension earned and changes in valuation factors such as stock market performance, bond values and discount rates.
Inflation has been taken as 3% for Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas and 2.2% for John Davies the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned reflecting the relevant deferred revaluation rates.
The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with regulations 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values regulations 1996, and is stated after deducting members contributions.
The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme.
The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the earnings cap.
In calculating the above figures no account has been taken of any retained benefits that he may have from previous employments.
No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997.
Directors also benefit from life assurance cover of 4 times base salary.
The cost of providing that life assurance cover was: 2013 2012 Director 000 000 Bill Tame 3 3 Archie Bethel 2 2 Kevin Thomas 2 2 John Davies appointed 1 January 2013 0.5 Babcock International Group PLC 87 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Other pension arrangements audited Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS for Bill Tame in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with him making contributions into the Companys pension scheme on his full uncapped salary.
Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 13 Annual bonus For our Executive Directors annual bonus schemes in 2012 13, as in previous years, a mix of financial and non-financial measures was used.
The nonfinancial measures were principally based on the key themes that are of central importance to the continued success of the Company, including: reputation protection: setting the building blocks for developing and underpinning future growth: executive succession and talent management planning and gaining wider employee engagement in the Companys success.
Maintaining a satisfactory health and safety and environmental performance is always an overriding bonus objective.
The financial measures were focused on delivery of budget profitability, cash management and growth in earnings.
The table below sets out the annual bonus schemes in place for the Executive Directors and the outturn under them in 2012 13.

Accounts and other information Governance Performance and Risk Operating review and KPIs Strategy and Business model Overview Babcock International Group PLC 88 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Remuneration report continued 2013 14 Annual bonus For our annual bonus schemes for 2013 14 we are continuing to use the approach and structure adopted in 2012 13 as set out in the table above.
The weighting of the elements of bonus is kept under review and, in particular, the weighting for non-financial objectives for the annual bonus scheme for 2014 15 and future years is a matter the Committee will be considering during the current financial year.
Annual bonus deferral into shares To ensure that a substantial part of the Directors annual bonus is exposed to the longer term impact of decision-making and to further align their interests with shareholders, 40% of any annual bonus earned by Executive Directors and other senior executives must be deferred into Babcock shares.
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan applicable to deferred bonus awards made to Directors before 2012 the deferral period was two years.
From 2012 deferred awards have been made to Directors under the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan.
In addition to mandatory deferral of 40% of bonus the DBMP allows for Directors to be invited to make a voluntary additional investment including by way of accepting deferral of extra amounts of bonus of an amount equal to up to 40% of salary.
Both mandatorily deferred and voluntary investments are eligible for matching share awards of up to a 2 for 1 match.
The DBMP has a deferral period for both mandatory and voluntary deferral of bonus awards of three years.
The Committee granted performance-related matching awards under the DBMP to Directors on the amount of bonus for 2011 12 mandatorily or voluntarily deferred into shares under that scheme.
The performance conditions relating to matching awards made in 2012 and those proposed for matching awards to be made in 2013 are shown on pages 89 and 90.
Bonuses mandatorily deferred into shares in 2010 and 2011 did not have any associated matching share awards.
Long-term incentive schemes PSP and DBMP PSP awards made in 2012 In 2012, PSP awards were made to each of the Executive Directors.
Awards were made over shares having a total value on grant equal to 200% of basic salary for Peter Rogers and 150% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
The performance targets attached to those awards split equally between TSR performance relative to the peer group and real EPS growth are illustrated in the charts below: EPS element TSR element 50% of award 50% of award 100% 100% 75% 75% 50% 50% 25% 25% 16.7% 16.7% 0 4% 12.5% 0 Median Median 9% Note: real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the retail prices index.
TSR comparators are the companies comprised in the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts and financial services companies.
Threshold vesting 16.7% of this element for the EPS element was set at real growth of 4% per annum and maximum vesting at real growth of 12.5% per annum.
We believe that real growth of 12.5% would represent exceptional performance.
For the comparative TSR element, threshold vesting of that element 16.7% of this element would be for performance in line with the median of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts and financial companies and maximum vesting would be for 9% p. a. outperformance of the median, representing upper quartile performance.
% of EPS element % of EPS element Babcock International Group PLC 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Deferred Bonus Matching Plan awards made in 2012 Following approval of the DBMP at the Annual General Meeting in July 2012, matching awards were made to Executive Directors in respect of their deferred annual bonus awards and voluntary investment by way of extra voluntary deferral of bonus under the DBMP.
The DBMP allows the Committee to make matching share awards of up to 2 times the deferred bonus shares 40% of bonus and any additional shares or extra bonus deferral self-invested under the scheme by the Director of an amount equal to up to 40% of salary.
The matching share award is performance-related and only vests to the extent that the performance criteria are met in respect of the three-year performance period.
For the 2012 cycle, the performance period runs from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015, the same as for PSP awards made in 2012.
The performance targets attached to those awards split equally between TSR performance relative to the peer group, real EPS growth, and average return on capital employed ROCE over the period are illustrated in the charts below: EPS element TSR element ROCE element 33% of award 33% of award 33% of award 2x 2x 2x 1.5x 1.5x 1.5x 1x 1x 1x 0.5x 0.5x 0.5x 0.25x 0.25x 0.25x 0x 4% 12.5% 0x Median Median 0x 17.5% 20.5% 9% The target for maximum vesting is ROCE of 20.5% and for threshold vesting it is 17.5%.
The maximum match is 2 for 1 on any shares held under the deferred bonus plan: 0.25 matching shares would be released for each such share at threshold vesting.
Therefore for each measure, threshold vesting would be a 0.25 3 for 1 match 4.2% of maximum and maximum vesting would be a 2 3 for 1 match 33% of maximum.

The TSR performance measure is tested by reference to the Companys relative long-term share price performance against suitable peers.
The use of relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders interests by incentivising management for the delivery of above market returns.
The TSR calculation would normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period.
The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the announcement of results and payment of dividends.
A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put all companies on an equal footing.
The use of an EPS growth performance measure focuses management on continued strong financial performance and is heavily dependent on the Companys success in achieving its strategic goals.
ROCE reinforces the focus on returns for shareholders and encourages capital discipline.
It also provides good line of sight for management.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions to be attached to share awards prior to the start of each cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
No material reduction in targets would be made without prior consultation with shareholders.
PSP and DBMP awards for 2013 The Committee intends to grant awards under the PSP and DBMP with the same maximum opportunities as in 2012.
As referenced in the Summary Statement on page 74, the Committee has discussed three-year performance targets with the Companys major shareholders, and intends to amend the EPS performance targets for the 2013 PSP awards, and the EPS and ROCE performance targets for the 2013 DBMP matching awards to ensure they remain stretching but achievable, and remain appropriate and challenging in the economic climate at the time of grant.
The changes are: i to reduce the top-end EPS target for the 2013 PSP and DBMP awards from RPI 12.5% p. a. over three years to RPI 11% p. a. over three years.
ii to increase the three-year average ROCE targets for the 2013 DBMP from 17.5% to 21.5% at threshold, and from 20.5% to 23.5% for full vesting.
The performance period for the awards will be the three years to 31 March 2016.
Sourcing of shares Shares needed to satisfy share awards for Directors are either fresh issue shares issued to the Groups employee share trusts to meet share awards or shares purchased in the market by trusts using funds advanced by the Company.
The source selection is finalised on or before vesting, the choice being based on what the Board considers to be in the best interests of the Company at the time, and what is permissible within available headroom and dilution limits.

This group was chosen after careful review due to the fact that Babcocks closest peers straddle multiple sectors, not just support services, and the broader group makes the calibration more robust.
Other information The awards are not subject to re-testing.
Participants will be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR element only to the extent the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
EPS is adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise in respect of any item, is after exceptional items.
Real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the retail prices index.
The awards carry the right to receive on vesting any dividends in the period between grant and vesting but this right applies only to the shares that actually vest under the award.
CSOP and PSP awards are linked so that in aggregate the holder cannot get more value from them than a standalone PSP award of shares equal to the relevant award multiple of the Directors base salary.
Exercise periods commence not less than three years from actual or nominal award grant date.
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares under unvested awards may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control, but of not more than a timeapportioned proportion and then only having regard to the Companys performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released.

The number of shares into which bonus has been mandatorily deferred may be reduced by the Committee if the accounts by reference to which the bonus was calculated have to be materially corrected or if, in the opinion of the Committee, there is evidence that performance against performance conditions in the bonus year or the impact of that performance on the Group in respect of future financial years was or will be materially worse than was believed to be the case at the time of the original assessment.

Further details about these plans and, where applicable, performance conditions attaching to the awards listed are to be found on pages 88 to 92 above.
The PSP, DBP, DBMP and L-TIP awards are structured as nil priced options.
DBP awards and DBMP basic awards represent the amount of the annual bonus mandatorily deferred and DBMP voluntary deferral awards represent the amount voluntarily deferred by the Director, in each case converted into shares at their value at the award date.
Subject to the rules of the scheme concerned, including as to meeting performance targets for PSP, LTIP, CSOP and DBMP Matching Awards.
Where this date is less than ten years from the date of award, the Committee may extend the expiry date on one or more occasions, but not beyond the tenth anniversary of the award.
The vesting of the CSOP award is subject to performance measures that are identical to those for the PSP award granted on the same date.
When a CSOP award is granted at the same time as a PSP award, the PSP award has two parts.
The CSOP and PSP awards are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of the two awards is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards and after deducting any exercise price payable on exercise of the CSOP award equal to the relevant grant multiple of the Directors base salary at the date of the awards the Limit.
This is achieved by making the level of vesting of Part B of the PSP Award accord to the level of vesting of the linked CSOP award: the actual number of vested Part B award shares that can be exercised is then limited according to the exercise price on the day of exercise such that the total value of Part B PSP award shares so exercisable does not then exceed the exercise price payable on exercise of the vested CSOP award.
If there is less than full vesting, it is possible for the Director to choose to exercise the CSOP to its fullest extent within the Limit and then to exercise the PSP award to the extent of any balance left within the Limit.
The actual number of shares capable of being exercised under Part B of the PSP award can only be determined on the exercise date as explained in note 5 above.
The PSP awards and any associated CSOP awards made to the Directors in 2010 are expected to vest overall in July 2013 as to 78.4% based on the performance measures attached to them in the case of Directors other than Peter Rogers and as to 58.8% overall for him.
All awards shown in the table for John Davies were made prior to his appointment as a Director, which took effect on 1 January 2013.

Accounts and other information Governance Performance and Risk Operating review and KPIs Strategy and Business model Overview Babcock International Group PLC 100 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Remuneration report continued Performance graphs The graphs below were prepared by Kepler Associates.
They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Companys shares for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts and the FTSE 350 Support Services sector.
The calculation of the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase additional equity.
This FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts is a broad index that allows comparison of the Companys performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole: Support Services is the sector in which the Companys share price is reported.
Over the five-year period, the Company has significantly outperformed both indices.
An investment of 100 in the Company on 1 April 2008 would have been worth assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares 212.80 at 31 March 2013.
This compares to an investment in each of the indices of 100 which, on the same basis and over the same period, would have been worth 156.69 FTSE 350 Support Services Index and 112.38 FTSE 350 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
