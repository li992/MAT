Payments were made monthly, subject to mitigation, and continued to June 2012. ii 2012 13 annual bonus The Committee reviewed the levels of bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors for the 2012 13 financial year in the light of the challenging trading environment and concluded that it would be appropriate to retain the percentage of salary payable for maximum at 100% of salary.
The performance targets for 2012 13 were set by reference to budgeted levels of underlying profit before tax.
The targets for the UK and the Group were partly achieved, but targets were not achieved for the Rest of Europe.
The bonus for Andy Corden and Claire Balmforth, the Operations Directors for the Rest of Europe and the UK respectively, both of whom stepped down from the Board in May 2012 but retain their executive responsibilities, was based as to 50% on the Rest of Europe and UK performance respectively and 50% on Group performance.
The bonus for the other Directors was based exclusively on Group performance.
Consequently a bonus will be paid in 2013 2012: nil to the Executive Directors who served during the period.
Where bonuses are paid, they are paid in cash and do not form part of the Directors pensionable earnings.
The Group targets for the 2012 13 financial year were set such that no bonus would be paid unless the underlying profit before tax exceeded that achieved in the prior financial year by 50%.
The Group targets were as follows, with straight-line vesting between a Group underlying profit before tax of 6m and 20m: Underlying profit before tax Proportion of maximum bonus Less than 6m 0% 6m 10% 20m 100% The targets for the Rest of Europe and the UK are commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed.
As a result of the performance achieved in the year bonuses of between 14% and 42% of salary will be paid in 2013 2012: nil to the Executive Directors who served during the period.
These bonuses will be paid in cash and do not form part of the Directors pensionable earnings.
This award was made under rule 9.4.
The share price used was the same share price as was used for the awards made in September 2011 and the terms are identical to those of the 2011 awards.
The 2010 awards are measured by reference to a percentage growth in underlying EPS.
This translates to none of the 2010 awards vest if underlying EPS is less than 51.3p in the financial year 2012 13.
If underlying EPS is 51.3 then 25% of the award vests and if EPS is 77.7p all of the award vests.
For growth between these two points between 25% and 100% vests on a sliding scale.
The 2011 awards are measured by reference to a percentage growth in underlying EPS.
This translates to none of the 2011 awards vest if underlying EPS is less than 21.1p in the financial year 2013 14.
If underlying EPS is 21.1p then 25% of the award vests and if EPS is 24.0p all of the award vests.
None of the 2012 awards vest if underlying EPS is less than 21.1p in the financial year 2014 15.
Andy Cordens award in 2010 was made on a phantom basis such that a payment will be made based upon the market value of a share, rather than receiving shares.
Neither the 2010 conditional award nor the 2011 conditional award is currently expected to vest.
