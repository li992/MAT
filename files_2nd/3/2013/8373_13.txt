The calculation is based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period Trade and other receivables 13.7 0.5 13.2 6.0 6.0 and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.

Total consideration 108.5 41.4 The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to long-term growth rates and discount rates.
Long-term growth rates predict growth beyond the Groups planning cycle, and range from 2.1% to 3.5% 2012: 2.5% to 3.9%.
The discount rate for each Goodwill CGU reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the CGU.

There was an increase of nil to goodwill inrespect from 10.1% to 13.4% 2012: 8.5% to 11.1%.

The total cash consideration paid for the acquisitions in the year was 108.1m 2012: 39.6m.
Management considers that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.
Contribution of acquisitions to revenue and profits In total the acquisitions made during 2013 contributed revenues of 14.3m and profit after tax of 2.7m from their respective dates of acquisition to 31 December 2013.
The Group revenue and profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 would have been 2,235.0m and 221.2m respectively if all the acquisitions were assumed to have been made on 1 January 2013.

Total 764.4 916.1 63.1 9.4 40.0 499.8 303.8 Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage the risk to the business from movements in interest rates, and to provide stability and predictability of the near term 12 month horizon interest expense.
Under the Groups Treasury policy, management may fix the interest rates on up to 80% of the Groups debt portfolio for the period of the current and succeeding financial year.
The Groups debt portfolio beyond this period is to be managed within the range of a 30% 70% fixed to floating rate ratio.
To do this the Group uses hedging instruments where considered appropriate.
Sensitivity At 31 December 2013, it is estimated that the impact on variable rate net debt of a general increase of 3% in interest rates would be a decrease in the Groups profit before tax of approximately 4.2m 2012: 5.1m.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
Foreign currency risk The Groups objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Groups financial assets from economic loss due to fluctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate.
