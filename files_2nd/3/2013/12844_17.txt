50 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Report on Corporate Governance The Board is committed to meeting the standards of good corporate governance as established by the Financial Reporting Council from time to time.
In respect of the year ended 31 May 2013, the UK Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010 the Code applied to the Company although the Board has also been cognisant of the changes introduced by the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code which will apply to the Company with effect from the year ending 31 May 2014.
The Code is publicly available on the Financial Reporting Councils website www.
This report, together with the Report on Directors Remuneration in respect of remuneration matters, describes how the Board applied the Code during the year under review.
Board evaluation Composition and independence The size of the Board allows individuals to communicate openly and to make a personal contribution through the exercise of their individual skills and experience.
As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors has nine members comprising the Non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, two other Executive Directors and five other Non-executive Directors.
The names of the Directors together with their biographical details are set out on page 36.
During the year, John Pantelireis and Derek Lewis each retired from the Board.
The Non-executive Directors have been appointed for their specific experience and expertise and are all considered to be independent ofmanagement and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment.
Mr Harvey is a Non-executive Director of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Plc, which acts as insurance broker to the Company, but the level of fees payable to Jardine Lloyd Thompson Plc is not material and Mr Harvey does not participate in any way in the provision of services on which basis the Board is wholly satisfied that it is appropriate to designate Mr Harvey as independent.
In addition, in order thathis independence is not compromised, if at any time the Board or a Committee of the Board is considering any matter concerning Jardine Lloyd Thompson Plc, it has been agreed that Mr Harvey will withdraw from that meeting until such matters have been dealt with.
Mr Steel is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director having assumed this role upon the retirement from the Board on 19 September 2012 of Mr Lewis and in this capacity he is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Finance Officer has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors may serve on the boards of other companies provided that this does not involve a conflict of interest and that the appointment does not restrict their ability to discharge their duties to the Company in any way.
The Executive Directors service contracts and the letters setting out the terms of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting.
Diversity The Company supports the Code provision that Boards should consider the benefits of diversity, including gender, when making appointments and is committed to ensuring diversity not just at Board level but also across the Companys senior management team, notleast because it believes that business benefits from the widest range of perspectives and backgrounds.
The Companys aim as regards the composition of the Board is that it should have a balance of experience, skills and knowledge to enable each Director and the Board as a whole to discharge their duties effectively.
Whilst the Company agrees that it is entirely appropriate that it should seek to have diversity on its Board, it does not consider that this can be best achieved by establishing specific quotas and targets and appointments will continue to be made based wholly on merit.
Further details on diversity within the business are set out in the CSR report on page 33.
Performance evaluation Effectiveness reviews of the Board and its committees are carried out annually.
The 2013 review has been facilitated by the Company Secretary who, in conjunction with the Chairman of the Board, prepared a detailed questionnaire relating to the composition, governance and performance of the Board for completion by the Directors.
The results of the 2013 review have been reviewed by the Chairman of the Board or of the relevant Board Committee, discussed in a formal meeting and the recommendations recorded and acted upon.
The review process which was undertaken during the year concluded that all Directors continue to contribute effectively and with proper commitment, devoting adequate time to carry out their duties.
The performance of the Non-executive Directors is evaluated separately by the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee reviews Executive Directors performance with guidance from the Chief Executive other than in respect of his own position.
The Board is committed to the Code principle that evaluation of the Board should be externally facilitated at least every three years.
Thelast such external review was conducted in 2011 by Boardroom Review Limited: the Board has engaged Boardroom Review Limited tocarry out a fresh review later this year and will report on the conclusions next year.
