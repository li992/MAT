The Committee also noted that shareholders generally approved of the spirit of the changes to remuneration, namely, an increased focus on long-term performance and a reduction in volatility of remuneration.
In addition, shareholders generally welcomed the introduction of strategic measures, the increased shareholding guidelines, the introduction of a bonus cap and the introduction of clawback.
