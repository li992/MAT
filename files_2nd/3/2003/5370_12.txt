As the Group manages funding sources as well as the maturity of the funding a negative working capital position overall this is a useful available.
In March 2003 we successfully launched a form of additional funding to have at the Groups disposal.

We stated last year that our policy with respect to dividends was that the Groups dividend would be broadly led As at the year end the Group had net debt of 211m by earnings per share growth.
In addition we set a target 2002 277m with pro-forma headroom of 739m range for dividend cover the ratio of normalised earnings available for use, although this will be reduced following per share to the dividend per share of between 2.0 times the cancellation of part of the revolving credit facility and 2.5 times over the course of a normal business cycle.

This is covered in the next section.
Taking all of this into account, your Board is proposing At the end of the most recent financial year Euro debt to increase the full year dividend for the financial year just makes up approximately 78% 2002 56% of the Groups ended by 11% to 21.6p 2002 19.5p, which we feel net debt position with Sterling making up the large majority is good reward for our shareholders in a year when the of the balance.

Therefore the levels of cover have been kept over-leverage itself, we have set ourselves two internal relatively high, mainly via xed rate derivatives such as financial covenants.
The first is that we maintain the ratio interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.

Hedging levels were therefore maintained in excess of 90% for Euro debt, Interest cover times while Sterling hedging was removed in anticipation of Increased interest cover lower debt and lower interest rates.
As at 31 March 2003, 62% of our forecast Euro denominated debt has been 12.0 hedged for 2003 04 and 50% for 2004 05.
At present we have not hedged any Sterling positions as, absent any acquisitions, we expect the Group to be cash positive in Sterling during the current scal year.
In aggregate 6.6 we are therefore 72% hedged in total against potential interest rate increases for the current year 2003 04.

With respect to paper purchasing we are currently examining the options available to the Group to hedge paper prices, potentially using the derivatives market.

From a treasury perspective we maintain an active policy of keeping the Groups weighted average cost 1.5 of capital WACC up to date.
This ensures we have an appropriate hurdle rate to apply when appraising 1.0 investment projects.
