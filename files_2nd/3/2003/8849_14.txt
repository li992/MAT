In its reporting to shareholders, the board aims to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the groups financial position and prospects.
The groups organisational structure is focused on its four divisions.
These entities are all separately managed, but report to the board through a board director.
The executive management team receive monthly summaries of financial results from each division through a standardised reporting process.
The group has in place a comprehensive annual budgeting process including forecasts for the next two years.
Variances from budget are closely monitored.
The board has overall responsibility for the groups system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The internal control systems are designed to meet the groups needs and address the risks to which it is exposed.
Such a system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
31 Johnson Matthey CORPORATE GOVERNANCE There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the company which has been in place during the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts.
The board regularly reviews this process.
The assessment of group and strategic risks is reviewed by the board and updated on an annual basis.
At the business level, the processes to identify and manage the key risks are an integral part of the control environment.
Key risks and internal controls are the subject of regular reporting to the Chief Executives Committee.
The Group Control Manual, which is distributed to all group operations, clearly sets out the composition, responsibilities and authority limits of the various board and executive committees and also specifies what may be decided without central approval.
It is supplemented by other specialist policy and procedures manuals issued by the group, divisions and individual business units or departments.
The high intrinsic value of many of the metals with which the group is associated necessitates stringent physical controls over precious metals held at the groups sites.
The internal audit function is responsible for monitoring the groups systems of internal financial controls and the control of the integrity of the financial information reported to the board.
The Audit Committee approves the plans for internal audit reviews and receives the reports produced by the internal audit function on a regular basis.
Actions are agreed with management in response to the internal audit reports produced.
In addition, significant business units provide assurance on the maintenance of financial and non-financial controls and compliance with group policies.
These assessments are summarised by the internal audit function and a report is made annually to the Audit Committee.
The directors confirm that the system of internal control for the year ended 31st March 2003 and the period up to 31st May 2003 has been established in accordance with the guidance Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code issued in September 1999 and that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
Auditors The performance of the auditors is reviewed by the Audit Committee on a regular basis, including a formal review of the external auditors every three years.
Both the board and the external auditors KPMG Audit Plc have for many years had safeguards to avoid the possibility that the auditors objectivity and independence could be compromised.
Our policy in respect of services provided by the external auditors is as follows: Audit related services the external auditors are invited to provide services which, in their position as auditors, they must or are best placed to undertake.
It includes formalities relating to borrowings, shareholders and other circulars, various other regulatory reports and work in respect of acquisitions and disposals.
Tax consulting in cases where they are best suited, we use the external auditors.
All other significant tax consulting work is put out to tender.
General consulting in recognition of public concern over the effect of consulting services on auditors independence, our policy is that the external auditors are not invited to tender for general consulting work.
Non-Compliance with the Combined Code The item in the Code with which the group did not comply in full throughout the period together with the appropriate Code reference is stated below: Two of the executive directors were employed on contracts subject to two years notice at any time, which the MDRC previously considered appropriate in the overall context of the executive directors terms of employment.
The notice period in these service contracts has now been reduced, without compensation, to twelve months.
1.7 Corporate Social Responsibility Measures to ensure ethical conduct and the identification and assessment of risks associated with social and environmental matters are managed in conjunction with all other business risks and reviewed at regular meetings of the board and the Chief Executives Committee.
A summary report on the groups policies and targets for corporate social responsibility is set out on pages 22 to 25.
A full version of the report is available on the companys website.
Environmental risks are identified and assessed by the Environment, Health and Safety Committee EHSC, which meets every two months.
This is chaired by the Director of Environment, Health and Safety EHS and reports to the Chief Executives Committee.
All divisional directors are members of the EHSC.
Performance is monitored using monthly statistics and detailed site audit reports.
The Audit Committee considers risks associated with EHS and monitors performance through the annual control self-assessment process conducted by the internal audit function.
Risks from employment and people issues are identified and assessed by the Executive Development Committee, which meets every two months.
This is chaired by the Chief Executive and is attended by all divisional directors and the Director of Human Resources.
Employment contracts, handbooks and policies specify acceptable business practices and the groups position on ethical issues.
The Group Control Manual and security manuals provide further operational guidelines to reinforce these.
Going Concern The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have, therefore, adopted the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
