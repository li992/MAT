Remuneration Policy Financial Statements Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder This is the second year for which we will be seeking approval for the HBOS Remuneration Committee Report from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
Following the first such report and the advisory vote at our AGM in April 2003, the Committee received valuable input from stakeholders on our remuneration policy and practice and on the way in which we communicate with shareholders in this area.
In addition, we have met with over 20 of our major shareholders in late 2003 and early 2004, specifically to discuss remuneration issues.
These shareholders, collectively, represent about one third of the HBOS equity.
These meetings have assisted us in addressing a number of issues on reward policy and practice and sought to improve the clarity of our report.
The disclosure regulations mean that the focus of this report is on Directors and, to a lesser extent, their most senior colleagues.
In reality, the Committees focus extends to all our 67,500 colleagues in the HBOS Group: we believe that it is important to have consistent remuneration principles across the Group regardless of business area and seniority.
More specifically: our salaries are managed around median levels in the financial services sector: our annual incentives have performance targets consistent with those in our operating plan: are generally team based: and focus on issues for which each team has prime accountability.
Annual incentives are a material part of reward and all colleagues know that there is a distinct possibility of zero payments as well as possibilities of high rewards where targets are significantly exceeded: our longer-term incentives allow most of our colleagues to enjoy a share in success of HBOS: and for our most senior colleagues, the longterm arrangements are strongly driven by the Groups relative performance against key comparator companies.
Rewards are only paid if the Groups performance is better than the average of the key comparator companies: wherever possible, our annual and longer-term incentives are denominated in shares rather than in cash so that our colleagues are also our shareholders.
The Committee has also set out clear requirements for all Directors to own shares in the Group: our benefits offering is positioned at the market median and gives colleagues as much flexibility over their choice of benefits as possible: and we have an extensive colleague product offering so that our colleagues are also our customers.
This reward philosophy has applied in HBOS since inception, did not change during 2003 and will continue to apply in 2004 and beyond.
However, at a more detailed level, it is clear that some aspects of our reward policy in 2002 for our most senior colleagues broadly the 45 colleagues whose salary levels generally exceed 175,000, including all our Executive Directors did not align in some respects with shareholders expectations and so we have made a number of changes, or clarified our existing practice for 2004, as a result of the feedback we received.
More detail is contained within the full report, where necessary, but the key features are: we have removed the option to re-test performance under long-term share incentive plans starting in 2004 and beyond: we have clarified the role of the Chairman who was independent of the organisation at the time of appointment but plays a key role in influencing the strategic direction of the Group.
It therefore remains entirely appropriate that his reward structure includes a long-term incentive plan equivalent to that applying to the Executive Directors: we have made it clear that share options will not be granted at the most senior levels during 2004 and, if they are granted in future years, they will be subject to appropriate performance conditions.
Sharesave will still be available at these levels: we have restructured the annual incentive scheme for our most senior colleagues so that it is denominated in shares which are subject to a three-year deferral, with a significant discount in the value of this reward element applying to those who wish to take immediate cash instead of shares: we have confirmed our requirement for our most senior colleagues to hold shares in the Group to a value of one years salary fee: and we have specified how the Committee would deal with interests under our various share schemes in the event of a change in control where, other than in exceptional circumstances, the Committee would take account of performance delivered up to the time of the change in control in determining the amount, if any, of the value of existing interests to be released.
A number of new issues were also addressed by the Committee during 2003.
More detail is contained within the full report.
Shareholder interests are central to our decision making process on reward, and we believe that it is important to explain any key changes in our remuneration arrangements.
In 2003 there were three such changes: firstly, salary increases for Executive Directors.
We have implemented salary increases for all the Executive Directors, two such increases being significant for the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Executive of our Retail Division, and for two reasons.
First, reports commissioned from a number of advisors confirmed our internal assessment that these salaries generally, and two particularly, had fallen well below the medians of other comparable financial services companies.
Our second, and more important, reason for making these increases is to ensure that salaries for our top team are consistent with our stated policy, given the great deal that has been achieved over the last two to three years.
The Committee had chosen, both at the time of merger and in 2002, not to make significant salary increases simply because the Group was substantially larger than either of its predecessors, but to defer such increases until it could be clearly displayed to shareholders that the merger was working: secondly, a special retention incentive.
To counter specific attempts by others to employ the Chief Executive of our Retail Division and, in particular, a very attractive approach for him to become Group Chief Executive of a major FTSE company, we have implemented a HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 55 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued performance related retention package.
The package is designed to retain his services until at least 2008 with significant rewards, contingent on growing profitability of the Retail Division by at least 60% over the three-year period to December 2004: and thirdly, severance arrangements.
We have clarified terms on employer instigated severance in relation to mitigation and staged payments, so that it is very clear as to how we would deal with termination, particularly in circumstances of inadequate performance where naturally there are no rewards for failure.
In the full report which follows, we have provided transparent and extensive technical details, as we did last year.
We welcome questions and feedback from all shareholders on both the report content and the report transparency.
We believe our reward policy is right for our colleagues and right for our shareholders and we encourage all shareholders to support the resolution.

Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board.
Your Board believes that a properly constituted and effective Remuneration Committee is key to ensuring that Executive Directors and other colleagues remuneration is aligned to shareholders interests and that it motivates Executive Directors and other colleagues to enhance the absolute performance and the relative competitiveness of the Group.
The Committees terms of reference are summarised in Appendix 1.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee during 2003 were all independent Non-executive Directors, as shown below: Brian Ivory Chairman Sir Ronald Garrick Coline McConville Philip Yea At the invitation of the Chairman, the Groups Chairman and the Chief Executive attend Committee meetings to provide background and context on matters relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Directors and other colleagues in the Group, but do not attend when their own remuneration is discussed.
No Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration or contractual terms.
During 2003, the Committee met on seven occasions and the attendance of Committee members is as shown below: Brian Ivory Chairman 7 meetings Sir Ronald Garrick 7 meetings Coline McConville 6 meetings Philip Yea 7 meetings 5.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee During 2003 the Head of Group Reward & Recognition acted as Secretary to the Committee and provided advice to it, as did the Company Secretary.
The Committee also sought independent external advice on remuneration matters.
The Committee does not retain advisors but uses organisations best suited to undertake specific projects from time to time.
During 2003, the Committee took advice, directly or indirectly, from: Watson Wyatt, in relation to pension issues: this organisation also advises the Group and the trustees of various Group pension plans on a range of pension issues: Hay Group Management and Towers Perrin, in relation to reward issues: these organisations also advise the Group on a range of reward issues: New Bridge Street Consultants, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report: this organisation also provides independent performance measurement results for grants under the long-term incentive plan which applies to most senior colleagues: Linklaters, in relation to various policy issues and in relation to the preparation of this report: this organisation also provides legal advice to the Group in relation to remuneration and other issues.
In addition, during 2003, the Committee asked New Bridge Street Consultants to undertake a wholly independent review of reward practice in comparison with reward policy, in relation to Executive Directors.
The consultants confirmed that, taken overall, the reward practice position was a wholly appropriate one.
Compliance with the Combined Code Full details of the Groups approach to Corporate Governance, including compliance with original and revised versions of the Combined Code, are included in the Corporate Governance Report on page 52.
The Board has followed and complied with both the original and the revised versions of the Combined Code as well as the Regulations in preparing this Report and in designing performance-related incentive plans for senior colleagues.
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 57 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued 7.
Service contracts The arrangements relating to the provision of the services of the Chairman are covered by a contract which extends to June 2005.
If the contract is terminated by the Group prior to the expiry of the term, compensation up to the equivalent of one years fees may be payable.
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which can be terminated by the Group on one years notice and by the Director on six months notice.
If any contract is terminated prior to the expiry of the term, contractual compensation up to the equivalent of one years basic salary may be payable.
There is no contractual compensation entitlement for any of the Directors beyond this.
Executive Directors are expected to make reasonable efforts to mitigate for loss arising from early termination of their contracts.
It is the Committees policy to design service contracts for any newly recruited Executive Directors in a comparable form to the contracts of existing Executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years with an expectation that in most cases, and subject to satisfactory performance, they will be invited to serve a second three-year term.
In exceptional circumstances, where the Board is satisfied that it is in the interests of the Group and its shareholders, a Non-executive Director may be asked to serve a third three-year term.
External appointments The Group recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Group.
Provided that it does not impact materially on their executive duties, Executive Directors are generally encouraged to accept one such appointment.
They may retain any resulting fee.
Only in exceptional circumstances will two such appointments be permitted.
Share ownership The Group believes that share ownership by colleagues throughout the Group enhances their alignment with shareholders interests.
Therefore colleagues in the Group are able to acquire shares as a result of: the Sharesave plan: short-term incentive plans.
All colleagues can opt to take the whole or part of their annual incentive in shares rather than in cash, with those who take their annual incentive in shares, retain them for three years and remain with the Group receiving a 50% enhancement of their shareholding: long-term incentive plans.
Share grants of varying percentages of salaries were made to the 150 most senior colleagues effective from the start of 2003.
Share options equivalent to 20% of salary were made to all Group colleagues, other than the 45 most senior colleagues, early in 2003: and personal purchase using the Groups sharedealing facility or by other means.
These arrangements assist the vast majority of colleagues throughout the Group to acquire shares.
They form a key element in the Groups commitment to creating a competitive, flexible and performance-oriented reward structure.
The Group expects all of its Directors including the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors, together with other senior colleagues, to acquire and retain significant numbers of shares relative to base salaries or fees.
In the case of the Directors the value of the shareholding is expected to be at least 100% of base salary or base fee within three years of appointment or by 1 January 2006 whichever is the later.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues To deliver its objective of creating real increases in shareholder value relative to the finance sector, the Group needs to attract and retain the most capable and committed people and create the right employment conditions and reward opportunities for them.
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their most senior colleagues is aligned with this objective.
Accordingly, the focus of remuneration policy is not primarily on salary but is on incentive plans that are closely aligned with the delivery of both operating plans and increases in shareholder value.
Therefore, for 2004, as was the case for both 2002 and 2003: salary policy is set at around market median for the financial services sector: short-term incentive plans are based on the delivery of annual operating plans: and long-term incentive plans are focused on share grants.
Participants do not receive any of these shares unless the Groups relative total shareholder return is above that of the finance sector as measured using the weighted average total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies.
This long-term plan is highly geared so that average performance generates no reward but outstanding performance generates relatively high levels of reward.
There are no plans, at present, to make any changes to this remuneration policy in 2005 and beyond.
We have, however, committed to review our long-term incentive plans in 2005.
In broad terms, for every 100 of target reward for Executive Directors, about 52 is guaranteed and 48 is performance contingent.
Sustained exceptional performance can result in a further 59 of reward.
Of the performance element of reward, between 20% and 30% is based solely on annual performance with the rest based on triennial performance or retention.
For remuneration purposes, roles in HBOS fall into one of nine Levels, 1-8 and the Executive Directors.
This report covers Directors and other senior colleagues who fall into Level 8, about 45 colleagues in all.
Appendix 2 gives broad details of remuneration arrangements for those in Levels 1-7.
58 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Remuneration Policy 10.1.
Salary Salary benchmarks are reviewed annually, taking account of information from independent sources on salary rates for comparable jobs in the finance industry and in other selected major public companies.
Actual salaries are normally reviewed annually but can be reviewed at any time.
There is no automatic annual salary increase.
The benchmarking process is both extensive and rigorous.
It is designed to ensure that the median salary policy adopted by the Committee demonstrably applies in practice.
Current base salaries of the Executive Directors after the most recent review with effect from May 2003 February 2003 in respect of Andy Hornby are: James Crosby 775,000, Mike Ellis 540,000, Phil Hodkinson 400,000, Andy Hornby 575,000, Colin Matthew 390,000, George Mitchell 540,000.
At the date of his retirement on 31 December 2003, and from May 2003, Gordon McQueens base salary was 410,000.
Incentive Plans The purpose of the incentive plans is to provide a direct link between each individuals remuneration and his or her performance, that of the business he or she works in and that of the Group, both annually and over the longer term.
All Executive Directors and a substantial majority of other senior colleagues participate in incentive plans which are Group-wide.
Performance targets and levels of participation differ in order to align overall individual remuneration with the Groups policy objectives outlined earlier.
Different, market-appropriate, arrangements exist for a small number of senior colleagues within the Group.
Payment of incentives, for Executive Directors and certain other individuals, is subject to the approval of the Committee.
Except in certain circumstances in respect of initial periods of employment, no Executive Director has a contractual right to an incentive.
Incentive arrangements to apply during 2004 are set out below.
Short-term incentive plans The levels of incentive payments are dependent on the extent to which participants achieve their operating plan objectives.
In 2004, for Executive Directors, payment of the target incentive will require the achievement of targets which include earnings per share EPS and return on equity RoE and the attainment of a certain level of profit before tax PBT.
Examples of benchmark payment levels which apply for 2004 are as follows: Category Incentive as a % of salary Target Maximum Executive Directors 60 90 Level 8 52.5 78.75 EPS, RoE and PBT outcomes are reviewed by the Audit Committee for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
The levels of incentives shown in the table above require participants to take their annual incentive in shares rather than in cash: to retain their shares for three years and remain in Group employment: or to rank as a qualifying leaver during the three-year period.
The Committee believes that this feature clearly aligns the interests of participants and shareholders by encouraging participants to be both long-term colleagues and long-term shareholders, having first achieved stretching performance targets in relation to their operating plans.
Participants may take their annual incentive in cash in which case the incentive is released at two-thirds of the level which would normally apply were the incentive taken in shares.
In overall terms, these incentive levels are the same as applied in 2003.
Long-term incentive plans Participants are granted conditional shares shortly after the start of the financial year equal to the number of shares secured by a percentage of the participants salary and based on the price of the Groups shares, using the average market price in the last ten business days of the previous financial year.
For awards in 2004, grant levels will be as follows: Category Conditional share grant as a % of salary Executive Directors 100 Level 8 66.67 The number of shares ultimately released to participants under the plan is dependent on the Groups annualised total shareholder return TSR defined as the gross overall return on ordinary shares of HBOS after all adjustments for capital actions and re-investment of dividends or other income over three-year periods, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies: Abbey National: Aviva: Barclays: Legal & General: Lloyds TSB: Prudential: Royal Bank of Scotland and Royal & Sun Alliance, over equivalent periods.
For awards in 2004, the releases early in 2007 will be as follows: Groups relative TSR performance Amount released as a % of share grant 0% p. a. or below 0 3% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 59 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Intermediate positions are determined by interpolation.
If the relative TSR performance does not exceed 0% p. a. after three years, the conditional share grant lapses.
The Committee believes that TSR is an appropriate performance measure because it is a robust and transparent measure of the creation of shareholder value: that a relative measure is more motivational and competitively robust than an absolute one: and that a weighted average group made up of the biggest domestic banking and insurance companies is a robust comparator and gives a more effective performance test than a traditional ranking-based league table.
Calculations of TSR performance are performed independently of the Group by New Bridge Street Consultants for the purposes of determining outcomes under the plan.
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues who fall into Level 8 have never been granted share options with HBOS and will not be granted share options in 2004.
Currently, there is no intention to grant share options to these individuals in future years.
The Executive Directors and other senior colleagues may, however, participate in the Sharesave plan.
This is a standard tax-approved scheme available to all colleagues, with no performance conditions.
These overall incentive levels are the same as applied in 2003 except that there is now no retest under the conditional share grant arrangements.
Benets Each senior colleague is provided with benefits, which principally comprise a company car or cash in lieu, pension arrangements, paid leave, healthcare cover and preferential terms for Group products.
Individuals are generally eligible for membership of tax-approved final salary pension arrangements and, for certain individuals who joined the Group after 1989, for membership of separate final salary pension arrangements.
These arrangements, taken together, provide a personal pension benefit based on salary only, with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary in broad terms, the last 12 months salary at normal retirement age age 60, subject to the necessary pensionable service.
The arrangements also provide a lump sum life assurance benefit of four times salary and pension benefits for spouses dependants and qualifying children.
All tax-approved benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Pension entitlement is based on salary only.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman The remuneration policy for the Chairman recognises that, whilst the Chairman was independent of the organisation when he joined it, he is not now regarded as an independent Director.
The Chairman plays a key role in influencing the strategic direction of the Group and ensuring performance delivery.
It is therefore entirely appropriate that the Chairmans reward arrangements are based on a mixture of guaranteed pay and performance-related long-term incentive.
The current base fee of the Chairman after the most recent review, effective from July 2003, is 525,000.
In addition, the Chairman is included in a long-term incentive plan equivalent to that described in section 10.4 and receives an annual conditional grant based on 100% of his fee and subject to the same performance conditions as apply to Executive Directors.
The Committee established the long-term incentive plan for the Chairman through a separately constituted scheme, for two reasons.
Firstly, so that shareholders could vote on this scheme quite separately from any vote on the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
Secondly, for legal reasons because the Chairman is not an employee of the Group and cannot therefore be included in the share-based long-term incentive plan described in section 10.4 as that plan is available to employees only.
In practice, however, the scheme which applies for the Chairman is a mirror image arrangement of the scheme applying to Executive Directors.
There is no short-term incentive plan and there are no benefits for the Chairman.
The Chairmans overall remuneration is at about 45% of that of the Chief Executive with a similar proportion of such remuneration dependent on performance.
The Committee, however, does not slavishly cross-reference reward to a particular time commitment: in practice the Chairman is always available and, in broad terms, spends about half his working time on HBOS business.
Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors Remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists solely of fees.
There are no short-term incentive plans or long-term incentive plans or benefits for Non-executive Directors.
The current base Board membership fee for each Non-executive Director after the most recent review, effective from May 2003, is 40,000.
In addition, fees are paid for services on committees and for directorships of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Fees are set based on comparisons with other Non-executive Director fees and time commitments in comparable companies.

The target cash incentive was 40% of salary and the maximum cash incentive was 60% of salary.
Annual cash incentive figures exclude potential Sharekicker enhancements for any element of the incentive taken in shares.
Details of potential Sharekicker enhancements from earlier years can be found in Table 5.
Note 2: Sir Peter Burt retired as Executive Deputy Chairman very shortly after the end of the 2002 financial year.
His retirement arrangements were fully disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for 2002 including the cost of waiving the actuarial reduction of 614,000.
Gordon McQueen retired as an Executive Director on 31 December 2003.
As was the general practice in relation to early retirement under the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme, Gordon McQueens pension was based on accrued benefits with no actuarial reduction for early payment.
The cost of waiving the actuarial reduction for Gordon McQueen was 270,000.
Note 3: The fee payment to Dennis Stevenson comprises payments made to him personally in respect of the provision of his services as Chairman of the Group of 510,000 2002 472,500.
Note 4: From 1 May 2002 the basic Board membership fee payable to Non-executive Directors was at a rate of 35,000 p. a. and from 1 May 2003 it was increased to a rate of 40,000 p. a.
The basic Board membership fee covers the range of duties and responsibilities associated with Nonexecutive directorship, including Board meetings and the Annual General Meeting.
The figures shown in the table above also include fees for services on committees of the Board, details of which are set out in section 4 of the Corporate Governance Report.
The levels of fees for some Non-executive Directors reflect the significant time spent by them on such committee duties.
The figures shown also include fees for services as directors of subsidiaries and joint ventures: and for services on other committees.
The fees in relation to these committees, subsidiaries and joint ventures were as follows: HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 61 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Table 1b 2003 2002 000 000 Charles Dunstone 12 12 Sir Ronald Garrick 15 Anthony Hobson 46 15 Brian Ivory 38 54 Coline McConville 12 9 John Maclean 38 32 Sir Bob Reid 6 6 Louis Sherwood 65 65 Lord Simpson 5 Philip Yea 6 6 Total 223 219 Note 5: The salaries shown for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are the amounts of salary they would have received had they not given up 19,980, 315 and 5,398 respectively as additional pension contributions.
Short-term incentives and long-term incentives have been calculated by reference to salaries prior to the reductions for additional pension contributions.
Note 6: Certain Executive Directors are Non-executive Directors of other companies.
Their roles and fees were as follows: James Crosby was a Non-executive Director of Granada plc throughout 2003.
The annual rate of fee which he retained was 30,000.
He was also appointed a Non-executive Director of ITV plc on 3 December 2003.
Granada plc became a subsidiary of ITV plc on 2 February 2004.
The annual rate of fee from ITV plc which he retains is 50,000 effective from 20 October 2003 and inclusive of the fees from Granada plc from that date.
James Crosby was appointed a Non-executive Director of the Financial Services Authority from 15 January 2004.
The annual rate of fee which he will donate to charity is 20,000.
Andy Hornby was appointed a Non-executive Director of GUS plc from 21 January 2004.
The annual rate of fee which he will retain is 30,000.
In addition, the annual rate of share-based fee which he will retain is 2,500 ordinary shares in GUS plc.
Gordon McQueen was a Non-executive Director of the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust plc throughout 2003.
The annual rate of fee which he retained was 16,000.
Note 7: Taxable benefits principally comprise the benefits in kind values of company cars, healthcare, additional life assurance and concessionary rate mortgages.
13.2 Pension benets Details of each Executive Directors pension and lump sum life assurance entitlement, and the annual contributions as percentages of pensionable salaries required to meet the costs of providing those benefits, are as follows: Table 2 Lump sum Pension as life assurance Cost of Normal a % of as a multiple benefits as a retirement age final salary of salary % of salary James Crosby 60 66.7 4 56 Mike Ellis 60 66.7 4 60 Phil Hodkinson 60 55.3 4 56 Andy Hornby 60 66.7 4 49 Gordon McQueen 60 50.0 4 27 Colin Matthew 60 66.7 4 26 George Mitchell 60 66.7 4 26 Notes to Table 2 Note 1: Pension is generally based on retirement from service at normal retirement age age 60 and is based on final salary disregarding, where relevant, the earnings cap as defined in the Finance Act 1989.
Pension and lump sum life assurance is provided from the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme the Scheme and from the Halifax Retirement Fund the Fund to the extent permitted by legislation, and otherwise from separate arrangements with the Group.
The pension shown generally accrues at a rate of one thirtieth of salary for each year of service for members of the Fund and one sixtieth of salary for each year of service for members of the Scheme.
Note 2: Costs are based on estimates, by the actuaries to the Scheme and to the Fund, of the costs to the Group over the future service periods of the Executive Directors using attained age rates.
Costs are calculated on funding assumptions adopted for actuarial valuations of the Scheme and the Fund and do not distinguish between the costs of providing benefits from the Scheme and the Fund and the costs of providing benefits from separate unfunded arrangements.
The costs exclude those covered by personal contributions from Executive Directors but include allowance for the current cost of self-insuring the risk benefits for death in service and ill-health retirement.
62 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Remuneration Policy Note 3: On death after retirement or after leaving service, a spouses pension equal to 50% of the members pension for the Scheme and 66.7% of the members pension for the Fund may be payable.
Childrens benefits may also be payable.
Under the Scheme, Executive Directors require the consent of the Company before retiring early.
Under the Fund, Executive Directors have a contractual right to retire at age 55 or above with a non-reduced pension and at age 50 or above but below age 55 with a reduced pension.
Pension increases after retirement are a mixture of guaranteed and discretionary.
Scheme pensions in respect of service before 6 April 1997 are not guaranteed to increase.
Scheme pensions in respect of service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices Index, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
The Fund guarantees to increase pensions in line with the Retail Prices Index, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum and a minimum of 3% per annum no minimum for pensionable service after 31 March 2004.
There is an established policy of reviewing pensions on a discretionary basis taking account of increases in the Retail Prices Index.
Allowance is made in transfer values on leaving in respect of the guaranteed and discretionary increases outlined above.
The pension entitlements of the Executive Directors are set out in the table below: Table 3 Accrued Increase in Transfer value at Increase in pension at accrued transfer value 31 December pension 31 December 31 December less Directors 2003 during 2003 2002 2003 contributions Name Age 000 p. a.
Note 2: The increase in accrued pension is the accrued pension at 31 December 2003 less the accrued pension at 31 December 2002.
The amount shown in square brackets is calculated on the basis of the disclosure methodology under the requirements of the Listing Requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Note 3: The transfer values are based on the accrued pensions at 31 December 2002 and at 31 December 2003 and are calculated as at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 respectively based on factors supplied by the actuaries of the relevant pension schemes.
The transfer values are the notional lump sums which would have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the Director had he left service at the respective dates.
It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the Director personally.
The arrangements for George Mitchell currently provide for some of his benefits to be paid on an unreduced basis only from age 65 and, in these circumstances the transfer values 000 at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 are 2,093 and 2,981 but he has a right, shortly before age 60, to elect that all his benefits are paid on an unreduced basis at age 60.
The transfer values shown in the table for George Mitchell assume that all of his benefits would be taken on an unreduced basis at age 60.
Note 4: The Directors contribution is the personal contribution required under the terms of the Fund.
No personal contribution is required under the terms of the Scheme.
The contribution for James Crosby, Phil Hodkinson and Andy Hornby are aggregates of the personal contributions required under the terms of the Fund, subject to the statutory limit, together with the amounts of salary they gave up as additional pension contributions as outlined in Note 5 to Table 1a.
Members of the Groups pension schemes have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
There were no contributions by the Group to any money purchase pension arrangements in respect of any Director during 2003.
Note 5: The figures for Gordon McQueen ignore the additional cost of awarding a pension without actuarial reduction on retirement on 31 December 2003 of 270,000.

1 Shares The beneficial interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the ordinary shares of the Group are set out below: Table 4 Number Number of shares of shares at 31.12.03 at 31.12.02 Chairman Dennis Stevenson 166,541 97,096 Executive Directors James Crosby 184,280 96,969 Mike Ellis 168,833 73,514 Phil Hodkinson 28,806 10,524 Andy Hornby 174,759 40,781 Gordon McQueen 73,115 54,709 Colin Matthew 72,366 54,084 George Mitchell 72,622 48,092 Non-executive Directors Charles Dunstone 100,000 100,000 Sir Ronald Garrick 17,306 9,799 Anthony Hobson 5,500 2,000 Brian Ivory 11,000 11,000 Coline McConville 2,070 2,070 John Maclean 5,038 5,036 Sir Bob Reid 29,496 28,195 Louis Sherwood 2,000 2,000 Philip Yea 10,044 9,529 Notes to Table 4 Note 1: James Crosby, Brian Ivory, John Maclean, George Mitchell and Sir Bob Reid all have a non-beneficial interest as at 31 December 2003 over 4,514,752 ordinary shares 2002 7,830,342 as Trustees of the Bank of Scotland Profit Sharing Stock Ownership Scheme.
Brian Ivory has a nonbeneficial interest over 4,500 ordinary shares 2002 4,500.
Note 2: Certain Directors will receive further interests in the ordinary shares of the Group arising out of the short-term incentive plans and, potentially, the long-term incentive plans as set out in Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Note 3: No Director had any interest in the preference shares of HBOS or in the loan or share capital of any Group undertaking at the beginning or end of the financial year.
No options to subscribe for shares in other Group companies are granted to Directors of the Group.
2 Short-term Incentive Plan HBOS Directors and former Halifax Directors Certain Executive Directors have conditional entitlements to shares arising from the annual incentive Sharekicker.
Where the annual incentive for 2000 and or 2001 and or 2002 was taken in shares and these shares are retained in trust for three years, additional shares will also be transferred to the Directors.
The basic shares shown below which have already vested are also included in Table 4.
The additional shares shown below arise as a result of Sharekicker.
Note 3: Because the basic shares are shown net of each participants original income tax and National Insurance liability, the additional incentive shares are shown in a like manner.
In practice, the tax liability on the grossed-up equivalent additional shares will be shown in Table 1a at the time of release.
HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 65 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued 13.3.
3 Long-term Incentive Plan and Special Long-term Incentive Plan HBOS Directors and former Halifax Directors Details of the shares which have been conditionally awarded to Directors under the plans are set out below.
The performance conditions relating to these conditional awards are set out in the notes below the table.
The grants effective from January 2001 and January 2002 for Phil Hodkinson include 53,435 shares and 43,750 shares, respectively, which are related to his joining arrangements.
Note 3: Awards are not pensionable.
Note 4: The performance period for the July 1999 grant ended on 31 December 2002.
HBOSs and previously Halifaxs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 5.55% p. a. so 138.75% of the share grant has been released to the grant recipient.
The performance period for the January 2000 grant ended on 31 December 2002.
HBOSs and previously Halifaxs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 9.02% p. a. so 200% of share grants have been released to grant recipients.
The shares granted in July 1999 and January 2000 vested on 3 March 2003.
The closing market price of the Groups ordinary shares on that date was 6.68.
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares have been released to grant recipients as set out in the table and as provided for under the rules of the Plans.
The dividend reinvestment shares are the additional shares which would have accrued on the overall share grants actually released had dividends due during the performance period been reinvested in shares.
The shares received by the Executive Directors and the Chairman from those grants are, after any sales to discharge their personal tax and National Insurance liabilities on such shares, retained by them or on their behalves for at least an additional two years and are included in Table 4.
Note 5: Subject to performance and subject also to a minimum release of 60% of the grant, as agreed by Halifax shareholders at the time of the merger, the shares granted under the long-term plan effective from January 2001 will be released to most individuals shortly after the three-year anniversary of the grant date.
However, the shares receivable by the Executive Directors and the Chairman from those grants will, after any sales to discharge their personal tax and National Insurance liabilities on such shares be retained by them or on their behalves for at least an additional two years.
For the 2002 and 2003 grants, all participants can choose to take any shares released after three years based on the three-year performance outcome or can continue to participate in the scheme for a further two years and take shares at that point based on the better of the threeyear and the five-year performance outcomes.
This design feature seeks to motivate participants continually to sustain strong performance or to improve lesser performance for their benefit and the benefit of shareholders.
This feature will not apply for the 2004 grants or for any grants in subsequent years.
Note 6: In the case of the Chairman, it is not possible to include him in the standard Long-term Incentive Plan.
Nor is it possible to include him in such an arrangement where the grant is denominated in shares.
He is therefore included as the sole participant in the Special Long-term Incentive Plan where the grants are awards of notional shares.
He will become entitled to the cash value of the relevant shares on vesting but has agreed that this value will, subject to any withholdings for tax or National Insurance, be applied in acquiring shares on his behalf.
Note 7: The number of shares to be released to participants is dependent on the Groups TSR over a three-year three and a half year in respect of the grant effective from July 1999 period, compared to the annualised weighted average TSR of a basket of comparator companies over an equivalent period.
For the grants effective from January 2002 and January 2003, a five-year period can also apply.
This basket of companies comprises: For the July 1999 and January 2000 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, NatWest, Northern Rock, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance, Royal Bank of Scotland and Woolwich : For the January 2001 grants: Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Britannic Assurance, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland: For the January 2002 and 2003 grants: Abbey National, Aviva, Barclays, Legal & General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance and Royal Bank of Scotland.
For the periods for which they were independent entities.
Shares will be released as follows: Groups relative TSR performance Amount released as a % of share grant 1999, 2000 and 2001 grants 0% p. a. or below 0 4% p. a.
100 6% p. a. or above 200 Intermediate positions are determined by interpolation.
As shown as granted in the table HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 67 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Note 8: The performance period for the January 2001 grant ended on 31 December 2003.
HBOSs and previously Halifaxs TSR over the performance period exceeded the weighted average of the comparator group by 13.45% p. a. as illustrated in the chart below, so 200% of share grants will be released to grant recipients, subject to Note 5 above.
In addition, dividend reinvestment shares will be released to grant recipients as provided for under the rules of the Plans.
Full details concerning these shares, which will be released to the Chairman and the Executive Directors during 2004, will be contained in the 2004 Annual Report and Accounts.
Performance of Halifax HBOS for January 2001 awards Note 9: The second grant effective from January 2002 for Andy Hornby relates to a different arrangement which applies only to him.
Early in 2003, the Committee became aware of activity, principally from the retail sector, to secure Andy Hornbys services.
Specifically, he had received a very attractive job approach to become Group Chief Executive of a major FTSE company.
The Committee decided that, at that point in time, it would clearly be in the interests of shareholders to secure Andy Hornbys continued services but to do it on a basis where additional reward was performance contingent.
The Committee therefore decided to introduce a special incentive arrangement which gives Andy Hornby the opportunity to receive up to 260,000 shares in April 2005, dependent on growth in the profitability of the Retail Division over 2002 to 2004.
In broad terms, the maximum release under this special arrangement is delivered in April 2005 only if there is at least a 60% increase in the profitability of the Retail Division, using a like for like comparison, over the three-year period, and provided that Andy Hornby is in the service of the Group at 31 March 2005 having not given notice on or before that date.
The Committee established that the incentive would accrue in three equivalent tranches based on profitability performance to the ends of 2002, 2003 and 2004.
At the time of establishment of the incentive, the satisfaction of performance criteria to the end of 2002 established an immediate retention feature within the scheme.
Since then, performance criteria to the end of 2003 have also been satisfied.
If Andy Hornby leaves employment as a qualifying leaver or in the event of change of control before April 2005, shares will vest by reference to the performance targets and his period of employment during the performance period.
If he leaves in certain other circumstances, he will not receive any shares.
Changes to certain key terms of the arrangement, in future, will require shareholder approval.
The special incentive is not pensionable.
At maturity it will be eligible for the 50% share enhancement described in section 9 if Andy Hornby retains the shares and remains in the service of the Group until 31 March 2008.
Taken overall, this special incentive increases the maximum annual overall reward value for Andy Hornby by about 25% in each of the three years until the end of 2004 and by about 12.5% in each of the subsequent three years until the end of 2007.
4 Long-term Incentive Plan Former Bank of Scotland Directors Share options granted between 1995 and 2000 under Bank of Scotlands plans were subject to a performance pre-condition that options were not capable of being exercised unless growth in diluted earnings per share EPS exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Index over a period of at least three consecutive financial years by not less than 2% per annum.
No performance target applied in respect of unapproved share options following the third anniversary of grant, as agreed by Bank of Scotland stockholders at the time of the merger.
The performance target in respect of approved share options was satisfied on 31 December 2002 for all grants and consequently all approved options are exercisable in accordance with the rules of the plans.
No further share options have been or will be granted under any of these plans.
On 23 February 2004, Gordon McQueen, who retired as an Executive Director on 31 December 2003, exercised options over 29,777, 35,000 and 40,000 shares granted effective from October 1998, May 2000 and October 2000, respectively.
The closing market price on the date of exercise was 7.555.
Gordon McQueen retained ownership of these shares as at the date of this report.
Details of the market price of the Groups ordinary shares during 2003 are given in section 13.3.
5 Sharesave Plan The Sharesave plan is available to most Group colleagues.
The plan allows colleagues to save a fixed amount of money on a monthly basis.
At the end of a pre-determined period, of three, five or seven years, colleagues have the right, if they so choose, to use the funds accumulated to purchase shares in the Group at a fixed price, based on a market price or an average market price determined shortly before the effective grant date and discounted by 20%.
Certain Executive Directors have taken up membership of the plan and the projected numbers of shares which they would be entitled to purchase at the end of the relevant pre-determined periods are set out below: Table 8 Granted G, Grant lapsed L or Initial effective At exercised E At exercise Expiry from 31.12.02 in year 31.12.03 date date James Crosby Sep 2002 2,748 2,748 Jan 2008 Jun 2008 Phil Hodkinson Sep 2002 2,970 2,970 Jan 2010 Jun 2010 Andy Hornby Oct 2000 2,362 2,362 E Oct 2003 Apr 2004 Sep 2003 1,607 G 1,607 Jan 2007 Jun 2007 Gordon McQueen Nov 2000 3,571 3,571 Jan 2004 Jun 2004 George Mitchell Oct 2001 1,723 1,723 Jan 2005 Jun 2005 Notes to Table 8 Note 1: Options under these plans were granted using market prices shortly before the dates of the grants, discounted by 20%, as follows: Effective date of grant Share option price Oct 2000 4.10 Nov 2000 4.7253 Oct 2001 5.62 Sep 2002 5.975 Sep 2003 5.74 HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 69 Remuneration Policy Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Note 2: Sharesave options for Andy Hornby were exercised in October 2003 and he has bought the number of shares under option.
The market price on the date of exercise was 7.165.
Note 3: In 2002, Sharesave options over 2,980 shares were exercised by both James Crosby and Mike Ellis in October 2002 and December 2002 respectively.
The market prices on the dates of exercise were 5.65 and 6.265 respectively.
Note 4: Details of the market price of the Groups ordinary shares during 2003 are given in section 13.3.
6 Interest in Shares under Trusts Certain Executive Directors, together with certain other colleagues, are deemed to have or have had an interest or a potential interest as potential discretionary beneficiaries under: the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trust.
As such, they were each treated as at 31 December 2003 as being interested in the 9,884,870 ordinary shares 31 December 2002 8,606,603 ordinary shares held by the trustee of this Trust.
The shares held in the Trust will be used to satisfy share awards under the former Halifax Short-term and Long-term Incentive Plans and the HBOS Short-term and Long-term Incentive Plans.
The relevant Executive Directors specific individual interests are shown in Tables 5 and 6: the Groups Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust.
As such, they were each treated as at 31 December 2003 as being interested in the 10,154,710 ordinary shares 31 December 2002 14,626,075 ordinary shares held by the trustee of this Trust.
On 12 June 2002 HBOS plc purchased the shares held by the Halifax plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust for a consideration of 1,000 and on the same day HBOS plc issued the same number of new ordinary shares, at their nominal value of 25p per share, to the Trust.
The transaction, which was approved by shareholders at the 2002 Annual General Meeting, resolved an outstanding matter from the corporate restructuring of Halifax plc in 1999 and the subsequent merger of Halifax Group plc and Bank of Scotland in 2001.
The Trust was established to satisfy the exercise of rights granted under the HBOS Sharesave Scheme and to satisfy entitlements of employees of Halifax plc arising on the exercise of options under the Sharesave schemes operated by HBOS plc.
The relevant Executive Directors specific individual interests are shown in Table 8: and the Groups Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust previously the Bank of Scotland Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust.
However, as the Trust was not pre-funded, they were each treated as at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 as having no interest as a consequence of this Trust.
The Trust was established to satisfy the exercise of rights granted under the former Bank of Scotland S. A. Y. E. Stock Option Schemes.
The relevant Executive Directors specific individual interests are shown in Table 8.
All of the Groups share plans empower new issue shares to be allotted to satisfy share requirements.
The Groups current practice on releases in relation to share grants, namely conditional share awards for senior colleagues and both colleague financed and Group matched shares under the Sharekicker arrangement, is to purchase shares in the market.
For share interests through the Groups share option and Sharesave plans, new shares are issued.
7 General The market price of the Groups ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 was 7.235.
The market price of the Groups ordinary shares at 31 December 2002 was 6.55.
The range during the year was 5.38 to 8.12.
Other than as disclosed in the notes to Table 7, there has been no change in the Directors interest in shares or options granted by the Group between the end of the financial year and 24 February 2004, the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts.
8 Statutory Performance Graph The following graph illustrates the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR performance compared to that of a broad equity market index since the Groups inception on 10 September 2001.
As HBOS has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 since inception and as performance against sector companies is illustrated in the chart on page 68, the Group believes that the FTSE 100 is a suitable comparator index to use for the purposes of this graph to satisfy regulatory requirements.

HBOS plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 71 Financial Statements Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice continued Appendix 2 Remuneration in HBOS generally This section outlines the structure of remuneration in HBOS for the vast majority of colleagues.
Each role in HBOS is positioned in one of nine levels, 1-8 and the Executive Directors.
The level of a role is determined by the knowledge required to do it, the challenge of delivering the required job outputs and the accountability which the role carries.
The level then, in broad terms, determines the salary range which can apply for the role: the short-term and long-term incentive structures: and the range of benefit and product offerings available.
The table below sets out the number of colleagues and full-time equivalents FTE in each level and the typical inter-quartile full-time equivalent salary range applying to colleagues in such a level.
Different ranges apply to different groups of colleagues depending on role specialism and geographic location.
Remuneration is best described, for all colleagues, in terms of four elements, namely salary: short-term incentives: long-term incentives and benefits.
HBOS is increasingly seeking to adopt a total reward approach so that colleagues appreciate the totality, the flexibility and the performance drivers of their reward package.
Salary HBOS salary policy is to manage salaries in aggregate, by Level, around the appropriate medians.
Whilst finance sector generic medians establish baseline positions, businesses benchmark according to role specialism and to geographic location.
The alignment of practice with policy is one we aspire to deliver by matching average salaries with the market median position, whilst managing actual salaries generally within an 80%-120% window of the median, reflecting personal skills, experience, performance and business vulnerability.
Short-term incentives HBOS has moved away from a one size fits all share in success bonus with relatively modest target and maximum payments to annual incentives which are operating plan aligned, generally team based and built around line of sight issues.
Participants know that these incentives give a real chance of a zero outcome and, equally, a real chance of a maximum outcome which, in cash terms, is a minimum of 20% of salary.
The cash incentive levels are generally as follows: Incentive as a percentage of salary Level Minimum Target Maximum 1-4 0% 10%-12% 20%-30% 5 0% 17.5% 35% 6 0% 25% 50% 7 0% 30% 45% Long-term incentives Almost every colleague in HBOS enjoys three for one Level, four long-term incentive propositions, each share-based.
Colleagues who choose to buy shares with their net cash incentive get 50% more shares after three years provided they remain in the service of the Group.
Colleagues who choose to save up to 250 per month for between three and seven years are given the option to buy shares based on the share price at the start of the savings period, discounted by up to 20%.
Colleagues excluding those at Level 8 and above have been given share options over 20% of salary in both 2002 and 2003, and these can be crystallised after a minimum of three and a maximum of six years.
Colleagues in Level 7 have been given share grants over 33.33% of salary in both 2002 and 2003.
The level of grant released is conditional on relative TSR performance against a weighted finance sector basket, over a three-year or five-year period with no grant released for performance which matches or is worse than the average and with twice the grant released for outperformance of 6% p. a. or more intermediate positions being determined by interpolation.
Benets Our key benefits traditionally fell into the five areas of pensions, holidays, cars, healthcare and mortgage subsidies.
We now package them as an overall flexible benefits proposition and a comprehensive product offering.
Most existing colleagues have defined benefit pension arrangements but all new colleagues are eligible for defined contribution pension arrangements which include death and ill health benefits.
