2003 Statement of directors responsibilities The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the auditors report on page 27, is made to distinguish for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the year, and of the profit or loss, total recognised gains or losses and cash flows of the Group for that period.
In preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2003 the Directors have: i used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied: ii made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: iii ensured that all applicable accounting standards have been followed: and iv prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Groups website is the responsibility of the Directors.
The uncertainty regarding legal requirements in relation to the website is compounded as information published on the internet is accessible in many countries and legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and distribution of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The auditors report on the financial statements set out on page 27 confirms that the scope of their report covers the provisions of the Combined Code that are specified for their review by the Financial Services Authority.
