HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Statement of Directors Responsibilities in Relation to Financial Statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditors statement of their responsibilities set out in their report on pages 231 and 232, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the Auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of HSBC Holdings plc together with its subsidiary undertakings as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for the financial year.
They are also required to present additional information for US shareholders.
Accordingly, these financial statements are framed to meet both UK and US requirements to give a consistent view to all shareholders.
The Directors are required to prepare these financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is not appropriate.
Since the Directors are satisfied that HSBC has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors consider that in preparing the financial statements on pages 233 to 366, HSBC Holdings has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied, save as disclosed in the Notes on the Financial Statements, and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that HSBC Holdings keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of HSBC Holdings and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of HSBC and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
