The increase in the accrued pension entitlement is the difference between the accrued pension entitlement at the year end and that at the previous year end.
The Listing Rules also require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent the sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less Directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued pension entitlement during the year after deducting the Directors personal contributions to the scheme.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued pension entitlement, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued pension entitlement excluding inflation that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in transfer values and thus includes the change in value of the accrued pension entitlement that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value over the year, as well as the value of the additional accrued entitlement earned in the year.
Including Mr Bennetts unfunded arrangement he has an estimated accrued annual pension entitlement at 31 December 2003 of 233,333.
This is based on his total pensionable service of 10 years 2 months and his pensionable service of 19 years 5 months at the rate of accrual of 1 60th per annum and 5 years 1 month at the rate of accrual of 1 36th and his pensionable earnings above the earnings cap.
The contributions cost during the year in respect of this unfunded arrangement amounted to 77,950 for the Company and 12,572 for Mr Bennett.
