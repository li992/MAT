P&O Annual Report 2003 33 Corporate governance Corporate governance In 1998 the London Stock Exchange published the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice the Combined Code which is derived from the work of the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel committees.
The Company has complied with the Combined Code throughout the year.
During 2003, the Financial Reporting Council published a revised Combined Code the New Code implementing the recommendations made in the Higgs Review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors.
The New Code came into effect for the Company for the financial year commencing 1 January 2004.
The Company already complies with most of the New Code and during 2004 intends to achieve compliance in all material respects with the remainder of the New Code.
The following is an explanation of the Companys corporate governance policies in the light of the Combined Code.
Directors The full Board meets at least ten times each year.
Although there is a prescribed pattern of presentation to the Board, including matters specically reserved for the Boards decision, all Board meetings tend to have further subjects for discussion and decision taking.
Board papers, including an agenda, are sent out in advance of the meetings.
Board meetings are discursive in style and directors are encouraged to offer their opinions.
There is a Chairman, a Chief Executive officer and a senior non-executive director.
The non-executive directors are independent of management and have no relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Sir John Collins is a director of NM Rothschild & Sons NMR which provides financial advice to the Company but since Sir Johns role is solely as a non-executive director of NMR on a xed remuneration with no relationship to the income or profits of NMR the Board continues to regard him as independent.
Nonexecutive directors have letters of appointment, but as with executive directors they must seek election at the first available annual general meeting after their appointment and thereafter stand for election at least every three years.
All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is also a director, and independent professional advice at the Companys expense if necessary.
There is a nomination committee which meets when necessary to provide advice and make recommendations to the Board on Board composition.
The following table sets out the number of meetings of the Board, and of the principal committees of the Board, during 2003 together with details of attendance.

Relations with stockholders The Companys practice is to send the notice of the annual general meeting and proxy voting forms to stockholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
The Chairman always sets aside a period of time for questions from the oor by eligible stockholders and the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees are expected to attend.
It is the practice of the Company to indicate the level of proxy voting at general meetings.
Presentations are given to institutional stockholders at the time of the interim and annual results and soundings are taken from them on strategic and management issues.
All press releases and further stockholder information are available on the Groups website, www.
Results presentations and trading updates are made available via webcasts.

This is a continual process, and may be associated with a variety of financial, operational and compliance matters including organisation structures, business strategies, disruption in information technology systems, competition, natural catastrophe and regulatory requirements..
The risks and associated controls are summarised in risk portfolios and are passed to the risk and audit committees for review.. At each year end, divisional and significant joint venture management certify that an assessment of the risk management process is in place and has been conducted throughout their businesses and that appropriate internal control procedures are in place or in hand to manage the risks identied.
These self-certications are made available to the risk and audit committees.. Finance departments across the Group complete a control self-assessment questionnaire.
The results of this questionnaire are subject to review by the Internal Audit department.
Summarised results of this exercise are presented to the audit committee.
