Accountability and Audit Internal Control and Risk Management The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal controls and for reviewing the effectiveness of these systems.
Such systems can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss as they are designed to manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
16 - Taylor & Francis Group plc Corporate Governance continued The Board confirms that the effectiveness of the system of internal controls for the year ended 31 December 2003 and the period up to 2 March 2004 has been reviewed in line with the criteria set out in Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code The Turnbull Report published in September 1999.
In carrying out this review the Board takes account of material developments through reports by the Group Finance Director, the Audit Committee and the Risk Assessment Committee and this is explained further below.
The Group has operated under an established internal control framework which can be described under five headings: Financial reporting The Group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the Board.
Each operating unit prepares monthly results with a comparison against budget.
The Board reviews these for the Group as a whole and determines any appropriate action.
Toward the end of each financial year the operating units prepare detailed budgets for the following year which are consolidated and presented to the Board for review before being formally adopted.
Forecasts are updated at least three times during the year.
Quality and integrity of personnel One of the key requirements of an effective system of internal control is the integrity of personnel.
The Group has policies on personnel selection which utilise procedures including the follow up of references to ensure that staff of suitable calibre and integrity are employed.
Operating unit financial controls The executive directors have dened the financial controls and procedures with which each operating unit is required to comply.
Compliance with these procedures is regularly reviewed by senior management.
Computer systems Much of the Groups financial and management information is processed by and stored on computer systems.
Accordingly, the Group has established controls and procedures over the security of data held on computer systems.
Also, the Group has put in place arrangements for computer processing to continue and data to be retained in the event of the complete failure of the Groups own data processing facilities.
Risk Management The Board has a formalised internal risk assessment procedure in relation to Code Provision D2.1.
As part of the process the Board identied and agreed key high level risks which affect the Group, the acceptable level of such risks and the controls and reporting procedures.
These risks are summarized on a Risk Analysis Document and this has been communicated in an appropriate form to each of the Groups business units.
The Group operates an ongoing process to identify and evaluate significant risks affecting the business.
Managers throughout the Group are encouraged to notify an executive Board member if they become aware of any major factors that may adversely affect the business either from a control view point or from factors in the wider business environment.
Any such matters are then immediately referred to the Group Finance Director who notes these into the Risk Register which is maintained at head ofce.
Managers are also formally required, twice each year, to re-evaluate and report on the business environment and any risks that may be present.
All urgent issues are dealt with either immediately or referred to a standing Risk Assessment Committee consisting of the Chief Executive Chair and the three other Group executive directors.
In any event the Risk Assessment Committee meets twice a year to review progress on issues identied in the Risk Register and to consider the major risk categories identied in relation to the business and the Risk Register.
In the review process the Risk Assessment Committee considers contributing factors and recommends appropriate early warning systems and actions.
Taylor & Francis Group plc - 17 Corporate Governance continued Audit Committee and Auditors The Audit Committee, comprising of three independent non-executive directors, has specic terms of reference which deal with its authority and duties and comply with the Code.
It meets at least twice a year with the external auditors attending.
The Committees duties include the review of the Groups accounting policies, financial reporting procedures, audit fees including remuneration received by auditors for non-audit work and the Groups internal controls, including a review of the Risk Register and the Risk Analysis Document.
Part of each meeting of the Audit Committee is held between the non-executive directors and the external auditors in private.
Internal Audit The Board, through the Audit Committee, introduced a Group internal audit function during 2003.
The function operates under a Charter of Group Internal Audit, including adherence to the Code of Ethics, Standards and Guidelines of the Institute of Internal Auditors.
Going Concern Basis The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group will continue in business.
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
This statement also forms part of the Operating and Financial Review.
