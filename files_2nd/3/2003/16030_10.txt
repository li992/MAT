TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Nominations committee report For the year ended 31 December 2003 The Nominations Committee was established in July 2003, board appointments having previously been dealt with by a combined Remuneration & Nominations Committee.
Its principal role is to identify and nominate for board approval, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise.
It is required to prepare a description of the role, and capabilities required, for any appointment, and to maintain contact with major shareholders about appointments to the board.
It also reviews the induction process for newly appointed directors, reviews annually the time required of nonexecutive directors, keeps the structure, size and composition of the board under review, and considers board succession planning for both executive and non-executive directors.
During the year, the committee members were Tim Stevenson chairman, together with Peter Maydon and Charles Fisher, the first two of whom are independent non-executive directors.
It is anticipated that Charles Fisher will retire from the board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, following which it is intended that Ted Adams and Chris Bunker will become members of the committee.
During the year, the committee formulated a recommendation to the board for the appointment of a further non-executive director, following which Chris Bunker was appointed on 14 January 2004.
A description of the capabilities required for this appointment was agreed by the committee.
Recruitment consultants, Ian Jones & Partners, were engaged to assist the committee and a number of candidates were identified by them, and interviewed by the committee and by other directors.
The chairman of the Nominations Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work of the committee.
