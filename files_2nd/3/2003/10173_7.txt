Taxation on profits on ordinary activities continued continued c Factors affecting future taxation charges Provision has not been made for taxation on unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as the earnings are continually reinvested and, accordingly, no taxation is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
In the overseas jurisdictions where the Group currently operates, tax rates are generally higher than those in the UK.
Taxation on profits on ordinary activities Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 3.9m 2002: 2.8m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are a Analysis of charge in period available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
2003 2002 As a result of recent changes in tax legislation, the Company expects to obtain a deduction for corporation tax purposes when the Restricted 000 000 Share Scheme vests in 2004.
Based on the price of Michael Page shares at 31 December 2003, the deduction to UK taxable profits would 6,236 UK Corporation tax at 30% for year 9,964 be approximately 27m which, at the UK corporation tax rate of 30%, would reduce the tax charge in 2004 by 8.1m.
