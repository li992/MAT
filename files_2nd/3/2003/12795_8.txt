20 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Corporate Governance continued Internal control The Board is responsible for the Companys system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of those systems.
Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve the Companys strategic objectives.
It should be recognised that such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Combined Code requires the Directors to review the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls.
This relates to all controls, covering financial, operational, compliance and risk management matters.
The Company has processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
These processes have been in place for the whole of the financial year and have continued up to the date of this report.
The processes are in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee.
The key procedures which the Directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are as follows: Regular Board meetings to consider a schedule of matters reserved for Directors consideration.
An annual review of corporate strategy, which includes a review of risks facing the business.
A risk management process which identifies the key risks facing the business and how these risks are monitored and managed on an ongoing basis.
An established organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority.
Documented and enforced policies and procedures.
Appointment of staff of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities.
Comprehensive budgets and forecasts, approved by the Board, reviewed and revised on a regular basis, with performance monitored against them and explanations obtained for material variances.
A detailed investment approval process, requiring Board approval for major projects.
Post investment appraisals are conducted and are reviewed by the Board.
An Audit Committee of the Board, comprising Non-executive Directors, which considers significant financial control matters as appropriate.
The appointment of an internal auditor to perform continuous assessments of the quality and effectiveness of risk management and control.
Relations with shareholders Communications with shareholders are given high priority and the Company aims to provide as much information as is commercially sensible to both existing and potential investors, recognising that transparency is the best way to develop understanding of the Companys strategy, performance and growth potential.
The Company encourages two-way communication with both its institutional and private shareholders and responds quickly to all enquiries.
The Strategic & Operational Review on pages 4 to 8 and Financial Review on pages 12 to 13 include a detailed review of the business and future developments.
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders as well as presentations after the Companys preliminary announcement of the year end results and at the half year.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation.
It is our policy for all Directors to attend the AGM whenever possible.
The Chairman aims to ensure that the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees and the senior independent Non-executive Director are available at the Annual General Meeting and are available to answer relevant questions.
Shareholders will be asked this year to vote on the Report on Directors Remuneration as required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Non-audit services provided by the external auditors In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non-audit services can be provided by the Companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value added benefits to the Company.
The Audit Committee monitors the level of non-audit fees paid to the external auditors.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
