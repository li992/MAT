Statement of Directors Responsibilities in relation to the Financial Statements Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the net revenue of the Company for that period.
In preparing those Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
