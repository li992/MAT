Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements 15 METALS AND MINERALS PRODUCTION 736505 1070 13 16 2 22 04 5:11 PM Page 16 Metals and minerals production continued Production data notes a Mine production figures for metals refer to the total quantity of metal produced in concentrates or dor bullion irrespective of whether these products are then refined onsite, except for the data for iron ore and bauxite which represent production of saleable quantities of ore. b Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at the end of 2003 and has applied over the period 20012003 except for those operations where the share has varied during the year and the weighted average for them is shown below.
The Rio Tinto share varies at individual mines and refineries in the others category and thus no value is shown.

16 Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements METALS AND MINERALS PRODUCTION 736505 1080 17 21 2 23 04 11:14 AM Page 17 Ore reserves Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources in this report for Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, September 1999 the JORC Code as required by the Australian Stock Exchange ASX.
Codes or Guidelines similar to JORC with only minor regional variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, US, UK, Ireland and Europe and together these represent current best practice for reporting Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
The JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long term commodity prices, in calculating reserve estimates.
However, during 2003 the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that for US reporting, historical price data should be used.
Only certain operations are affected by this guidance and resulting changes to reserves are shown on page 147.
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource information in the tables below is based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by JORC, or recognised overseas mining professionals as defined by the ASX, most of whom are full time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies.
Each has had a minimum of five years relevant estimation experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics.
Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears.
A register of the names of the Competent Persons who are responsible for the estimates is maintained by the company secretaries in London and Melbourne and is available on request.
The ore reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2003.
Summary data for year end 2002 are shown for comparison.
Metric units are used throughout.
The figures used to calculate Rio Tinto's share of reserves are often more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.

i Rio Tinto completed the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kaltim Prima Coal on 10 October 2003. j Kennecott Energy has a partnership interest in the Colowyo mine, but, as it is responsible under a management agreement for the operation of the mine, all of Colowyos reserves are included in Rio Tintos share shown above.
Reserves at Colowyo have decreased following the reclassification of all material outside the current production area as measured resources.
k Rio Tinto Coal Australia was previously known as Pacific Coal.
l Production at Hail Creek commenced in July 2003: reserves are now reported in the operating mines section rather than in the other undeveloped reserves section.
Reserves have increased as a result of a major strategic review and the development of a new life of mine plan.
m The term other undeveloped reserves is used here to describe material that is economically viable on the basis of technical and economic studies but for which mining and processing permits have yet to be requested or obtained.
There is a reasonable, but not absolute, certainty that the necessary permits will be issued and that mining can proceed when required.
n Marketable reserves at Mount Pleasant have increased as a consequence of additional project studies which led to the development of a new resource model, and indicated higher yields as a result of improved processing methods and the planned mining of higher quality seams.
o Marketable reserves at Valeria have been reclassified as measured resources following a revision of economic parameters.
p Rio Tinto completed the sale of its 25 per cent interest in Minera Alumbrera together with its wholly owned Peak Gold Mine on 17 March 2003. q Reserves at Escondida Norte are declared for the first time.
r Rio Tinto completed the sale of its 100 per cent interest in the Fortaleza nickel mine on 16 January 2004. s Rio Tinto is entitled to a share in metal production from Freeports Grasberg operations due to its direct shareholding in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold FCX.
In addition, under the terms of a joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto and FCX, Rio Tinto is entitled to a direct 40 per cent share in reserves discovered after 31 December 1994.
Rio Tintos share of reserves due to these two entitlements are shown separately.
t Reserves at Neves Corvo have decreased following development of a new resource model and revised mine plan that takes into account revised cutoff grades for different mining methods and the exclusion of additional safety pillars.
u The depletion in ore reserves at Northparkes is mainly due to the reclamation of material from stockpiles.
v Open pit mining at Palabora was completed in November 2003.
In addition stockpile reserves at Palabora have been reclassified as measured resources in order to meet more accurately the requirements of the JORC code.
w Reserves at Argyle have increased as a result of the development of a new resource model and revised mine plan which includes additional open pittable material and underground reserves for the first time.
x The increase in reserves at Cortez reflects the inclusion of the Cortez Hills deposit for the first time, and the transfer of material from mineral resources.
y Proved reserves at Kelian, Lihir and Ranger #3 include 9.95, 33.3 and 6.9 million tonnes respectively stockpiled at the end of December 2003 for future treatment.
At Kelian, open pit mining ceased in April 2003, stockpiled ore is now being processed.
At Lihir, additional drilling led to remodelling of the Kapit and Lienitz deposits: this together with a review of the life of mine plan has led to an increase in reserves.
z At Rawhide, mining operations have ceased and processing of stockpiled ore was completed in May 2003.
Reclamation activities are now underway.
aa Reserves of talc have decreased as a result of a decision to close several of the North American mines.
bb Comprises reserves at QIT-Fer et Titane Rio Tinto 100 per cent and Richards Bay Minerals RBM Rio Tinto 50 per cent.
cc At Rssing the significant reduction in reserves has resulted from a major change in the planned mining strategy which may result in mine closure when the current pit is mined out.
Material outside of the current final pit has been transferred back to resources.
dd These operations have different reported reserves when SEC reporting guidelines are applied see page 147.
Rio Tinto 2003 Annual report and financial statements 21 ORE RESERVES 736505 1090 22 24 2 21 04 9:55 AM Page 22 Mineral resources As required by the Australian Stock Exchange, the following tables contain details of other mineralisation that has a reasonable prospect of being economically extracted in the future but which is not yet classified as Proved or Probable Reserves.
This material is defined as Mineral Resources under the JORC Code.
Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors.
While in the judgement of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.
Resources are stated as additional to the reserves reported earlier.
