The salary review for the UK workforce as a whole was between 1% and 5% and on average 2.5%.
Where relevant, the Committee also considers external market data on salary and total remuneration and the Committee applies judgement when considering such data.
The Executive Directors salary increase for the 2018 review was 3% 2.5% for 2017.
Ian Griffiths is stepping down from the Board on 28 June 2018.
The amount received in 2017 18 includes payment in respect of Senior Independent Director fee of 7,500 per annum and Chairman of the Audit Committee feeof 11,000 from 1 August 2017.

The amount received in 2017 18 includes payment in respect of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee fee of 11,000 from 1 August 2017.
From 1 August 2018 this fee was increased to 13,500 per annum.
Variable pay The Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the Executive Directors package is performance-related and that theperformance conditions support the delivery of the Groups strategy and the long-term sustainable success of the Company.
The remuneration policy encourages long-term performance by setting challenging targets linked to sustainable growth for the variable pay, which consists of the annual bonus and the longer-term PSP.
The Remuneration Committee can use discretion to retrospectively adjust the targets, for example after a substantial restructuring, and would disclose and fully explain if it had.
Performance targets An explanation of the performance conditions for the annual bonus and PSP are set out below.
Total shareholder return TSR TSR is the increase or decrease in the value of a notional investment in a share in the Company and each of the companies in the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 350 Index over the three-year PSP performance period, taking account ofshare price movement and the value of dividends which are deemed to be re-invested over that period.
Adjusted earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS is disclosed in the Companys annual report and accounts and is the portion of the Groups adjusted after tax profit allocated to each outstanding share.
Adjusted EPS is an indicator of the underlying performance of the DS Smith Group.
The extent to which a PSP award subject to this performance condition vests, depends on the Companys average adjusted EPS performance over thethree financial years prior to vesting.
Adjusted return on average capital employed ROACE ROACE is disclosed in the Companys annual report and accounts.
It is dened as operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items divided by average capital employed and is a measure of the efficiency and profitability of the Companys assets and investments.
The performance period for the annual bonus is measured over one year.
The performance period for the PSP is measured over three years with targets based on the average of the three financial years prior to vesting.
Adjusted earnings before tax and amortisation EBTA EBTA is adjusted earnings before taxation and amortisation after the eect of pension interest but does not include the results of our investments in associates.
74 Governance Annual bonus audited Bonus earned in 2017 18 The Executive Directors targets for the 2017 18 bonus were based on budgeted financial targets set out in the tables below, with annual bonus payments determined by reference to performance over the financial year ended 30 April 2018.
Achievement is calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and between target and maximum.
The table below shows the target ranges set, the business outturn and the bonus outcomes achieved.
Targets Threshold Target 1 Financial measure 0% of maximum 50% of maximum Maximum Achieved Adjusted EBTA 378.2 million 398.1 million 418.0 million 414.2 million Adjusted ROACE 14.0% 14.7% 15.4% 15.2% Outcomes % of performance target achieved Miles Roberts Adrian Marsh Adjusted EBTA 45 50 45 50 Adjusted ROACE 43 50 43 50 Total as a proportion of the maximum opportunity 88 100 88 100 Maximum bonus opportunity as a % of salary 200% 150% Value of bonus paid in cash 648,120 305,423 Value of bonus deferred into shares 648,120 305,423 2 Overall award level 1,296,240 610,846 1.
The targets for threshold and maximum are set - 5% of the target.
There was a reduction in the ROACE target from 15.4% in 2016 17 to 14.7%.
This reduction reflected the 2016 17 investment activity in a number of individually small acquisitions in Portugal, Denmark and the UK, which had a dilutive impact overall of 0.9%, taking the baseline to 14.5%.
There was therefore an underlying increase in the ROACE target from 2016 17 to 2017 18 of 0.2%.
The annual bonus for the financial year 2017 18 will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in deferred shares with a vesting period of three years.
The only qualifying condition for the deferred bonus awards to vest is for the Executive Director to remain in the employment of the Company at the vesting date and not serving notice.
Performance is assessed on a constant currency and consistent basis and therefore the actual published results have been restated for bonus purposes using budgeted exchange rates and adjusted for the impact of unbudgeted acquisitions.
The policy applied to the latter is to take into account only the upside or downside in earnings versus the acquisition business plan for the period post-acquisition.
This ensures that management are only rewarded or penalised for business performance above or below the business plan which supported the acquisition price.
For the 2017 18 bonus the reported EBTA of 468.1 million has been reduced by 53.9 million to 414.2 million 44.5 million in relation to the acquisition business plans, thereby only accounting for the performance above the acquisition plans, and 9.4 million to remove the favourable currency eect.
Reported ROACE of 14.1% calculated as 529.5 million EBITA divided by 3,753.2 million capital employed has been adjusted by 1.2% for the removal of the acquisition business plans EBITA of 57.2 million and capital employed of 655.6 million and -0.1% for the favourable currency eect.
The resulting 15.2% ROACE is the bonusable outcome andmeans management are rewarded for outperformance above the acquisition business case.
The improvements in earnings over and above the acquisition business plans, which impacts both EBTA and ROACE, primarily reflects signicantly accelerated synergy benets and cost savings above the Board approved plan for the Interstate Resources acquisition.
The annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is operated as shown above.
Bonus results are determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets.
Bonus awards are measured against the achievement of the Groups objectives.
Maximum bonus opportunity for 2017 18 is shown above for the Executive Directors and is generally between 60% and 110% for the other senior executives.
Implementation for 2018 19 Implemented in line with the policy.
The annual bonus will remain at a maximum opportunity of 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 150% for the Group Finance Director.
It remains based on EBTA and ROACE, each with equal weighting.
In the event of an acquisition in the year, the Committee will assess how the financial performance of the acquired company should be included.
In the opinion of the Committee, the annual bonus measures and targets for 2018 19 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are notdisclosed.
These will be disclosed next year in the Directors remuneration report, so that achievement against those targets will be visible, in retrospect.
com 75 Remuneration Committee report continued Awards vesting based on performance in the three-year period to 2017 18 The PSP award granted on 24 July 2015 is based on performance over the three years to 30 April 2018.
The 2015 PSP awards were based on equal weighting of TSR, EPS and ROACE performance conditions.
An explanation for these performance conditions is on page 74.
The TSR, ROACE and EPS performance conditions attached to these awards and actual performance against these conditions are set out in the table below.
The Committees policy is that no adjustments for exchange rate movements are made to EPS or ROACE over the three-year performance period as the Committee feels that these are of a long-term nature and fluctuations are more likely to average out over the three years.
In calculating the average adjusted ROACE for the performance period the Committee reviewed the impact of the acquisitions made during the year.
The Committee considered it appropriate to recognise an element of dilutive impact due to the scale of the acquisitions.
As a consequence the 2017 18 Group reported ROACE of 14.1% has been adjusted by 0.4% to 14.5% in the calculation of the three-year average.
