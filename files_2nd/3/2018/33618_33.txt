Supports the Board in applying theCode and complying with listingobligations.
The Groups CEO, Ivn Arriagada, is not a director.
This is consistent with practice in Chile where local law prohibits CEOs of public companies from being directors of those companies.
Despite this, interaction between the Board and executive management is as you would expect between Non-Executive Directors and management in a typical UK-listed company.
The CEO and CFO are invited to attend all Board meetings, the CEO is also invited to attend all Board Committee meetings and there is regular formal and informal dialogue between management and the Board.
The Board considers that there are considerable benefits associated with having a Board comprising exclusively Non-Executive Directors.
Not only does it provide a broad range of perspectives, but also encourages robust debate with, and independent oversight of, the Groups executive management.
Ramn Jara provides advisory services to the Group.
Andrnico Luksic C is the brother of Jean-Paul Luksic, the Chairman of the Company, and is Chairman of Quienco SA and Chairman or Director of Quiencos other listed subsidiaries.
Jean-Paul Luksic and Gonzalo Menndez are also Non-Executive Directors of Quienco and some of its listed subsidiaries.
Like Antofagasta plc, Quienco is controlled by a foundation in which members of the Luksic family are interested.
Gonzalo Menndez, Ramn Jara, Juan Claro and William Hayes have served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of their first election.
