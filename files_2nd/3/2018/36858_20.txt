Directors remuneration policy summary Policy Overview The Hunting PLC Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy, was approved by shareholders on 18 April 2018, following a comprehensive review of the Directors Remuneration framework in 2017.
The full Policy can be found at www.
The Policy reflects evolutionary changes consulted on with shareholders including simplification of the Annual Bonus Plan through the removal of the personal performance adjustor, and the introduction of best practice features such as annual bonus share deferral and a holding period on vested HPSP shares.
The Policy is designed to comply with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006 regarding remuneration and to ensure that the Company can attract, retain and motivate talented executive Directors to promote and deliver long-term success for the Group.
The package comprises fixed and variable incentives and is structured to link total reward to both corporate and individual performance.
The remuneration structures of the Chief Executive and Finance Director are based on externally benchmarked data aimed at providing them with competitive levels of remuneration.
The Chief Executives remuneration is benchmarked to global peers who are mostly headquartered in the US, while the Finance Director is benchmarked to UK listed companies of similar size.
Non-executive Director fees are set at levels that take into account the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
Given the small size of the Hunting Board, each non-executive Director is required to give an above average time commitment to Group matters.
The non-executive Directors do not receive cash bonuses or other variable emoluments.
The fees are benchmarked to other companies of a similar size, profile and profitability and are reviewed annually by the executive Directors.
The Chairmans fee is set by the Remuneration Committee.
The Policy tables which follow below provide an overview of each element of the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Remuneration Committee Discretion The Committee has defined areas of discretion within the Directors Policy framework.
Where discretion is applied, the Committee will disclose the rationale for the application of discretion.
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and HPSP in accordance with the relevant plan rules and this Policy.
The Committee retains discretion as to the operation and administration of these plans as follows: Annual Bonus Discretion to adjust the amount of any bonus to reflect any fact or circumstance that the Committee considers to be relevant, and to ensure that the outcome is a fair reflection of performance.
The assessment of part-year performance in the event of the exit of a Director, including but not limited to, reviewing forecast financial performance of the Group and the outlook of the business in the context of wider market conditions.
Bonus awards for good leavers will generally be pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period completed.
The Committee may apply discretion to vary the percentage of an award settled in cash or shares.
HPSP Selection of the TSR comparator group for the HPSP.
The Committee reviews the comparator group annually ahead of each grant made to the executive Directors under the HPSP.
The Committee also retains the discretion to make adjustments to the comparator group for subsisting awards if it believes that a constituent of the comparator group has distorted the vesting outcome if, for example, a constituent company has been subject to a material corporate action.
The Committee may amend the performance conditions applying to an award in exceptional circumstances if the new performance conditions are considered fair and reasonable, and are neither materially more nor materially less challenging than the original performance conditions when set.
The oil and gas industry is a highly cyclical industry, where sentiment is driven by oil and gas commodity prices and activity levels across the industry.
Given that these market conditions are outside managements control, the Committee retains the discretion to partially adjust the performance targets of the performance conditions adopted for the HPSP, to align with the general market outlook, while continuing to be a demanding and stretching incentive.
Any upward discretion would be subject to prior shareholder consultation.
Other The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments that are not in line with the Policy outlined above where the terms of the payment were agreed either: before the Policy came into effect: or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
Relevance to Employee Pay The Policy tables summarise the remuneration structure that operates within Hunting and which also applies to senior executives of the Group.
While bonus and pension arrangements are in place for most of the Groups employees, lower aggregate remuneration operates at below the executive Director and senior manager level, with total remuneration driven by market comparatives and the individual responsibilities of each role.
Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the general basic salary increases for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases for the executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Companys senior executive remuneration policy.
Other Information Details of the terms of employment of the Directors, including Service Contracts, Letters of Appointment, New Director Recruitment and Leaver Policies are located in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts and on the Companys website at www.
Jim Johnson and Peter Rose have a one-year notice period contained within their respective Service Contracts.
Further, while Mr Johnson and Mr Rose do not hold any external directorships, the shareholder approved Directors Remuneration Policy makes provision for them to retain any fees for such directorships.

Role, Membership and Attendance The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive Directors and the Company Chairman.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration of the Finance Director and designated senior management.
Where appropriate, the Chairman and other Directors are invited by the Committee to attend meetings, but are not present when their own remuneration is considered.

Jim Johnson was appointed Chief Executive on 1 September 2017, with an annual base salary of $700,000.
During 2018, Mr Johnsons base salary remained unchanged.
On 1 April 2018, Mr Roses base salary was increased by 3% to 325,532 $434,032 in line with salary increases implemented across the Group.
The average :$ exchange rate in the year was 1.3333 2017 1.2877. ii.
Benefits include the provision of healthcare insurance, a company car and fuel benefits.
Jim Johnsons and Dennis Proctors single figure pension remuneration represents Company contributions payable to their US pension arrangements.
Peter Roses pension figure represents a cash sum in lieu of Company pension contribution, which is set at 25% of his annual base salary.
As noted in the Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, the operation of the annual bonus was revised during 2018, following approval of the new Directors Remuneration Policy in April 2018.
The financial targets for the bonus were set in December 2017 as part of the Annual Budget process, and the personal performance targets were confirmed with the executive Directors in January 2018.
Given the strong performance of the Company during 2018, and as noted below, all targets set with the executive Directors were met, leading to a maximum vesting of the annual bonus.
Jim Johnson was therefore awarded a bonus of $1.4m, and Peter Rose was awarded $651k.
Under the revised rules of the Annual Bonus Plan, 25% of the post-tax value of the bonus is to be delivered to the executive Directors in Hunting shares.
v. In the year, Jim Johnson received a bonus totalling $466,690, reflecting his period of service as Chief Executive from 1 September 2017 and Peter Rose received a bonus totalling $610,466.
Dennis Proctors bonus reflected a maximum payout, pro-rated for his period of service to 1 September 2017, totalling $1,047,467.
The share awards granted in 2016 under the HPSP had a three-year performance period to 31 December 2018.
The awards were measured on this date against the performance conditions, with a 100% vesting recorded for the EPS performance condition and a nil vesting for the ROCE performance condition.
The TSR performance condition was measured by Kepler in line with the HPSP rules, which resulted in a 100% vesting of this portion of the award.
As an executive Director on the date of grant, Peter Rose will receive 111,328 Ordinary shares based on a 66.7% vesting.
Jim Johnsons award was made when he was Chief Operating Officer and incorporated a fourth performance condition based on the Groups internal manufacturing reject rate.
This performance condition has also vested in full, therefore Mr Johnsons 2016 award will vest at 75.0% and he will receive 179,745 shares.
For the purposes of the single figure calculation, the average mid-market closing price of 6.16 during Q4 2018 has been applied to the number of vested shares and converted to $ using the average :$ exchange during Q4 2018, being $1.2865.
Further, a cash payment equalling the dividends paid during the vesting period has been added to the single figure calculation, totalling 8.0 cents per vested share.
The vesting date of the 2016 award is 11 March 2019, when the final values of the awards will be determined.
The 2015 awards under the HPSP had a three-year performance period to 31 December 2017.
The awards were measured on this date against the performance conditions, with a nil vesting recorded for the EPS and ROCE performance metrics.
The TSR performance condition was measured by Kepler in line with the HPSP rules, which resulted in a 49% vesting of this portion of the award granted.
On this basis, Jim Johnson received 24,733 shares: Peter Rose received 17,234 shares and Dennis Proctor received 47,579 shares.
The vesting date of the 2015 award was 30 April 2018.
The market price of a Hunting PLC Ordinary share on 30 April 2018 was 8.00 and converted to $ using the spot rate of $1.3527.
Further, a cash payment equalling the dividends paid during the vesting period was added to the single figure calculation, totalling 30.9 cents per vested share.
The value of Jim Johnsons 2015 HPSP award included in the single figure table has been pro-rated for his time as an executive Director being 1 September 2017 to the date of vesting.
The 2017 single figure table has been restated to reflect the actual values of the awards made to the executive Directors.
Following Dennis Proctors retirement from the Group on 1 September 2017, a payment of $1,688,350 was made reflecting a payment in lieu of notice and other legal entitlements due under US employment law.
Annell Bay was appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee from 30 August 2018, with her 2018 fees increasing to reflect this additional responsibility.

Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 79 Annual report on remuneration continued Annual Performance-Linked Bonus Plan audited Following the Companys Annual General Meeting in April 2018, the executive Director annual performance-linked bonus plan was amended, as noted in the introduction of this report.
The revised operation of the bonus plan is therefore: Proportion of award Performance metric 60% Underlying Profit before Tax 20% Underlying Return on Capital Employed 20% Personal Performance Objectives Delivery of Financial Objectives The financial performance targets for the 2018 annual bonus were as follows: Threshold vesting Target vesting Maximum vesting Actual result Underlying Profit before Tax $39.2m $49.0m $58.8m $104.0m Underlying Return on Capital Employed 3% 4% 5% 9% The financial elements of the annual bonus start to accrue when 80% of the Annual Budget targets are met, increasing on a straight-line basis up to 120% of the budget target.
The Target Vesting values are the basis of the 2018 Annual Budget agreed by the Board in December 2017.
In 2018, the Group delivered an underlying profit before tax of $104.0m and an underlying return on capital employed of 9%.
Based on this outcome, the financial targets exceeded 120% of the Annual Budget target, resulting in a maximum vesting of these components of the annual bonus award.
Delivery of Personal Objectives The Personal Performance objectives agreed by the Committee with the executive Directors with effect from January 2018 were as follows: Jim Johnson Chief Executive Peter Rose Finance Director Strategic Planning Strategic Planning Portfolio optimisation including an M&A framework Implementation of Investor Relations Plans Development and implementation of the succession planning Implementation of systems and process standardisation plans process with agreed development plans for key individuals across business units with timetables and milestones During the year, the Committee was updated on the progress of the objectives noted above and for the year ending 31 December 2018 noted the following outcomes: Strategic Planning and Portfolio Optimisation In December 2017, the Board was presented a Strategic Plan by the Groups leadership team, which focused the direction of Hunting on targeted efficiencies and growth objectives.
The main pillars of the Strategic Plan included focusing the Group on key product areas, which delivered proprietary and high value technologies, higher facility utilisation and the removal of historic business silos, to drive higher margins to increase profitability.
A restructuring of the Groups organisation was also undertaken to improve the alignment of management with these Strategic priorities.
As noted in the Corporate Governance Report, an Executive Committee of the Board was formed, comprising the regional managing directors of the Group, which enabled further alignment and efficiencies to deliver the business strategy.
In addition, elements of the Strategic Plan presented to the Board in December 2017 were delivered ahead of schedule, creating a greater focus on key product lines and geographies, which included rationalisation of the Groups Africa operations, including the closure of facilities in Cape Town and Mombasa: and a performance review of the Groups business and products portfolio, to enhance capital allocation.
These initiatives contributed to the following outcomes: a.
Gross margin improvement of six percentage points to 30%: c. Strong levels of net cash increasing $30.9m in the year: d. Disciplined capital investments: and e. Restoration of dividends 9.0 cents per share declared.
Succession Planning Mr Johnson delivered a plan to the Board, which identified key personnel for leadership development and succession.
A Chief HR Officer was recruited to enhance the management development process, including alignment to the Strategic Plan.
Investor Relations The executive Directors delivered an Investor Relations programme, which broadened the Groups investor marketing initiatives.
An international investor plan was implemented, with greater focus on the US and key European investor communities.
Process Standardisation Mr Rose restructured the Groups financial management and reporting information, delivering efficiencies with better information flows and transparency to the Board and the investor community.
80 Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Further, the Committee noted the strong performance of the executive Directors through the year, following the leadership changes in 2017, providing stability to the senior management group and the re-inforcing of the strategic direction of the Group and the corporate values, which led to a successful performance in 2018.
The Committee concluded that all Personal Performance objectives had been met during the year.
Based on this outcome the following bonus awards were made to the executive Directors: Proportion of annual bonus available Performance metric Proportion of annual bonus awarded 60% Underlying Profit before Tax 60% 20% Underlying Return on Capital Employed 20% 20% Personal Performance Objectives 20% Mr Johnson was therefore awarded a bonus of $1.4m 200% of base salary and Mr Rose was awarded a bonus of $651k 150% of base salary.
In line with the revised operation of the Annual Bonus Plan rules 25% of the post-tax value of the bonus is delivered in Hunting shares, to be held for two years.
The value of Mr Johnsons shares is c. $212,275 and Mr Roses shares is c. $86,258, with the balance being delivered in cash.
In 2017 the annual bonus awards to the executive Directors were as follows: Mr Johnson $466,690 and Mr Rose $610,466.
2016 HPSP Vesting audited On 31 December 2018, the 2016 awards under the HPSP were measured against the performance conditions following completion of the three-year performance period.
The executive Director performance metrics were based on underlying diluted EPS: underlying ROCE: and relative TSR against a comparator group of 14 companies.
A summary of the three-year EPS and ROCE performance is detailed below: 2015 Reported three-year Required threshold Required maximum % Vesting Base year 2016 2017 2018 performance vesting target vesting target outcome Underlying diluted EPS 3.1c -45.3c 8.0c 49.6c 152% 4.0% 15.0% 100% Underlying ROCE n a -7.7% 1.1% 9.3% Average 0.9% 10.0% 17.0% Nil The EPS performance condition records a 100% vesting, based on the growth in underlying diluted EPS during the performance period.
The average ROCE across the performance period was below the threshold vesting target, resulting in a nil vesting.
The Total Shareholder Return performance condition was measured by Kepler in January 2019, following completion of the three-year performance period.
Huntings TSR performance against the 14 comparator companies was then ranked, resulting in an top quartile position corresponding to 100% vesting of the TSR portion of the 2016 HPSP award.
Given the full vesting of the EPS and TSR portions of the 2016 grant, the total vesting of the 2016 award is 66.7% based on these three performance conditions.
Peter Rose, as an executive Director across the whole performance period, will receive 111,328 shares.
As noted in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair, Mr Johnsons 2016 award was made when he was Chief Operating Officer and not an executive Director, with his award subject to a fourth performance condition based on the Groups recorded average internal manufacturing reject rate across the performance period.
The three-year outcome for this performance condition was 0.4%, with a threshold vesting target of 1.2% and a maximum vesting target of 0.6%.
Based on this recorded performance, a 100% vesting has been recorded, equating to a 75.0% vesting for Mr Johnsons 2016 award.
On the vesting date, Mr Johnson will therefore receive 179,745 shares.
A cash equivalent of dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period, totalling 8.0 cents per vested share, will be added to the award on the vesting date.
The 2016 HPSP vesting has been calculated as follows: Value of vested shares at Value of dividends 31 December at 8.0 cents No.

2015 HPSP Vesting audited On 31 December 2017, the 2015 awards under the HPSP were measured against the performance conditions following completion of the three-year performance period.
The performance metrics were based on underlying diluted EPS: underlying ROCE: and relative TSR against a comparator group of 32 companies.
