The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group had available 100.4m 2017 133.4m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Transaction risk The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling, Thai Baht and Malaysian Ringgit.
The Group seeks to hedge between 0% to 100% of transaction-related exposures mainly on a rolling 15 to 18-month forward basis, but in some cases for periods of up to 60 months and applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship.
Based on the net of the annual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to Group profit after hedging in existence at 31 December 2018 are immaterial.
The impact on equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the US dollar against the Pound Sterling, Thai Baht and the Malaysian Ringgit would have decreased or increased equity by 13.5m, 1.8m and 0.7m, respectively.
Interest rate risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long-term in fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
Occasionally a portion of fixed debt interest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
As at year end 2018, the percentage of debt at fixed interest was 90% 2017 92%.
The following sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk in 2018 has been retrospectively determined based on the exposure to applicable interest rates on financial assets and liabilities held throughout the financial year, with all other variables held constant such as foreign exchange rates.
If variable interest rates had been 0.5% lower or higher, the Groups profit before tax would have increased or decreased by 0.1m.
Any fixed interest debt is held to maturity and not fair value adjusted through the Consolidated Income Statement.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the market interest rate for the fixed rate debt held up to maturity would have decreased or increased the fair value of the Groups borrowings by 4.4m.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has remained broadly consistent with prior period due to the high proportion of fixed debt.

TAX BALANCE SHEET Fair values Current tax The following table presents an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels The current tax receivable of 2.7m 2017 1.0m includes excess tax paid to tax authorities that is expected to be recovered within 12 months by 13 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: way of offset against future tax liabilities orrefund as well as research and development tax credits receivable.
Level 1 those fair values derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: The majority of the Groups taxable profits arise in countries, including the US, where the estimated tax liabilities are paid in on-account instalments during the year to which they relate and are largely paid at the Balance Sheet date.
The current tax liability of 21.5m 2017 21.2m represents Level 2 those fair values derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 3.9m 2017 3.6m tax due on profits of the current and prior years as well as 17.6m 2017 17.6m provisions for tax uncertainties that represent directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and amounts expected to be paid but by their nature, there is uncertainty over timing and eventual settlement.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of tax for items which are considered to have a range of possible tax outcomes.
The outcomes considered by the Board include a range of estimates Level 3 those fair values derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market that could increase those liabilities by 14.1m.
These uncertainties exist due to a number of factors including differing interpretations of local tax laws data unobservable inputs.
and the determination of appropriate arms length pricing in accordance with OECD transfer pricing principles on internal transactions and financing There has not been any transfer of assets or liabilities between levels.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
Level 2 fair values are arrangements.
In calculating the carrying amount of provisions, management estimates the tax which could reasonably be expected to become derived from future cash flows, of open forward contracts at 31 December, translated by the difference between contractual rates and observable payable as a result of differing interpretations and decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes forward exchange rates.

39.8 32.7 If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.
At the Balance Sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 29.5m 2017 33.5m available for offset against future profits and a deferred Ineffectiveness is recognised on a cash flow hedge where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the hedging instrument tax asset has been recognised in respect of nil 2017 6.5m of such losses.

At the Balance Sheet date, a deferred tax liability of 0.2m 2017 0.1m has been recognised in respect of the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
No temporary difference has been recognised in respect of 49.1m 2017 34.4m of undistributed earnings, which may be subject to a withholding tax, as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the Balance Sheet date, the Group had 5.0m 2017 5.0m of surplus Advanced Corporation Tax ACT, previously written off, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is unlikely to be recovered in the foreseeable future due to the UK earnings profile.
The Group also has 18.0m 2017 16.6m of unused capital losses, as reduced by gains rolled over, available for offset against future capital gains for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as no such capital gains are anticipated to arise in the foreseeable future.

financial 16.6 4.1 0.1 20.6 7.6 3.6 11.2 Actuarial losses The investment strategy for the UK Plan is decided by the Trustee in consultation with Senior plc.
The primary investment objective is for the plan to demographic 1.9 0.5 2.4 3.2 0.4 3.6 be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due.
The UK Plans average duration is around 16 years and benefits are expected to be paid for the next Benefits paid 14.5 2.2 16.7 11.6 2.3 13.9 60 to 70 years.
These cash flow payments are expected to reach a peak around 2028, and gradually decline thereafter as the membership matures.

The primary At 31 December 278.7 52.5 8.0 339.2 301.8 54.3 7.9 364.0 investment objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a linear fide-risking approach.
Under this approach, the schemes current asset strategy of 70% invested in low-risk matching assets, such as liability driven investments LDI and bonds, and 30% in higher-risk The UK Plan past service cost of 2.4m in 2018 relates to the UK Guaranteed Minimum Pensions see Note 9. return seeking assets, such as equities, is expected to be linearly moved into 100% matching assets over the period from April 2021 to April 2036.
LDIs help to mitigate investment risk for the UK Plan by minimising the fluctuations in the UK Plans funding levels due to changes in the value of the liabilities.
This is achieved through hedging movements in the funding liabilities caused by changes in interest rates and inflation expectations.
The Trustee continues to review its investment strategy and has also implemented a switching mechanism to secure any outperformances of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
While the UK Plan was in a deficit position of 37.4m as at 5 April 2016 when measured on the Trustees funding basis, the UK Plan is in a surplus position of 30.9m as at 31 December 2018 2017 19.4m surplus, 2016 4.0m surplus when measured on an IAS 19 basis.
The difference between the triennial funding and annual IAS 19 valuation relates to the assumptions used.
For example, the funding discount rate is based on the UK Plans stated investment strategy, as opposed to the yields available on corporate bonds for the IAS 19 discount rate.
