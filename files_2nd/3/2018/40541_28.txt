qxp 08 06 2018 14:20 Page 53 Statement of directors responsibilities in relation to the Group financial statements The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Strategic Report, the Directors Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they have elected to prepare both the group and the parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: l make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable: l state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: l assess the group and parent companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern: and l use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement Each of the directors listed on page 33 confirms that to the best of their knowledge: l the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: and: l the Annual Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Trust, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces: and l the accounting records have been properly maintained: and l the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the companys position and performance, business model and strategy.
