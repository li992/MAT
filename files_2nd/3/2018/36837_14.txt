h Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net cash and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report 152 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 153 Independent auditors report to the members of Howden Joinery Group Plc REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement Opinion Going concern In our opinion: We have reviewed the directors statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they We confirm that we have the financial statements of Howden Joinery Group plc the parent company and its subsidiaries the group give a true considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and nothing material to report, and fair view of the state of the groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 29 December 2018 and of the groups add or draw attention to in their identification of any material uncertainties to the groups and companys ability to continue to profit for the 52 weeks then ended: respect of these matters.
