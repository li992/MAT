DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT Formation, role and responsibilities The Nominations Committee was formed during the year ended 31 March 2018 and, up until the date of approval of this Annual Report, has met once, in July 2018, with all members attending the meeting.
It is intended that the Nominations Committee will formally meet at least once during each financial year in future.
Additional meetings will be held when necessary.
The primary role of the Nominations Committee is to develop and maintain a formal procedure for making recommendations on Board appointments.
The Board and the Nominations Committee recognise the growing emphasis placed on criteria such as diversity and gender but continues to believe that appointees should be selected primarily on the basis of a full, balanced range of criteria considered to be key to the management of the Group, without any forced emphasis.
Membership The three members of the Nominations Committee are Mr B S E Freshwater Chairman, Mr S B Benaim and Mr S Srulowitz, all of whom were appointed when the committee was formed.
Main activities since formation The Nominations Committee considered the composition of the Board and concluded that the directors have the requisite skills, knowledge and experience to deliver the Groups strategy and deal with changes in the business environment.
No new appointments were made to the Board between the date the Nominations Committee was formed and the date of approval of this Annual Report.
