Following last years externally facilitated review, this year the review was facilitated internally by the Group Company Secretary, who is well placed as an independent sounding board to the process.
The approach we took was to explore some of the themes from last years action plan and design a questionnaire to understand where improvements had been made and where further focus is needed.
The responses to the questionnaire were supplemented with a one-to-one meeting between each Board member and the Chairman, with additional input from the Senior Independent Director.
These meetings took place during November and December 2018.
The key themes were shared with the Board along with a 2019 action plan.

Work to improve the quality of the management reporting to the Committee will continue to be an area of focus in 2019 Board Risk Overall, the Committee is viewed as managing risk in a sensible and diligent manner.
It was acknowledged that there is Committee a requirement for the Committee to consider a number of regulatory matters.
While the quality of the reporting to the Committee has continued to improve, there remains a need for continued focus on the level of detail and volume of reporting to the Committee so as to assist it in effectively discharging its responsibilities Board Financial The Committee has continued to be successful in discharging its responsibilities.
The geographical representation and Crime Risk diverse background of the three adviser members provides valuable input and allows for different perspectives to Committee be considered The main observation is that the Committee is operating well and that there is a healthy and open atmosphere which Governance and Nomination promotes honest discussion.
Three themes arising from the feedback concerned ensuring greater exibility within the agenda: maintaining sufficient time for effective discussion: and delivering agreed outputs swiftly Committee The Committees discussion provided a number of positive observations and suggestions for further enhancing its Brand, Values and Conduct operations: these included increased focus on the Groups sustainability agenda: and expanding the Committees remit to ensure effective reporting of the workforce policy requirements in the new 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code Committee Remuneration Overall, it is recognised that the Committee is operating effectively, demonstrating strong leadership.

81 DIRECTORS REPORT Corporate governance Interaction with management The Committee is mindful of the need to hold management directly accountable when issues have arisen and have been reported by the Group Chief Risk officer.
Senior management has attended Committee meetings for deeper discussions in such instances.
Interaction with regulators As Committee Chair, David Conner meets periodically with one of the Groups UK lead regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.

The purpose of such meetings is to enable a discussion between the Committee and the PRA concerning prudential focused topics.
Interaction between Board committees on risk related issues In the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other Board committees where the remit of these other committees clearly covers risk related matters.
For example, the Audit Committee has oversight of the Groups internal financial controls and regulatory compliance: the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee has oversight of the responsibilities in relation to financial crime compliance matters: and the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee has oversight of the mechanisms by which reputational risk is managed.
The interaction assists the Committee in ensuring that it is well informed on discussions held, and the close collaboration of the committee chairs helps to ensure that there are no gaps and any potential for unnecessary duplication is avoided.
Risk function resourcing The Committee has sought and received assurance that the Risk function is adequately resourced to perform its function effectively.
