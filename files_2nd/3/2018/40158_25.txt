As part of the 2018 review of Risk Appetite, emphasis was placed on leading indicators and inherent risk metrics to support a more informed risk decision-making process.
New metrics were proposed to and approved by the Committee for Capital and Liquidity to capture Interest Rate Risk in the banking book, double leverage and minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities As Financial Risk Appetite metrics are now considered more mature and well embedded within the Group, greater focus was given to developing metrics for nonfinancial Principal Risk Types to align with the roll out of the Groups new Risk Type Frameworks and to take into account increased regulatory scrutiny on operational resilience and heightened Information and Cyber Security risks New inherent risk metrics were proposed and approved for Information and Cyber Security, Operational Risk to focus on operational resilience associated with system obsolescence and critical third-party risks, Compliance to provide insight to material regulatory actions and adverse regulatory relationships and for Financial Crime to measure the level of concentration to higher-risk-rated clients Monitored actual exposures relative to Risk Appetite limits using regular risk information reports provided by management Tracked a wide range of risk metrics that are periodically reported to the Committee Further details of the Groups Risk Appetite are set out on page 194 Principal Risk Types The Groups Principal Risk Types are reported on at each scheduled Committee meeting through a Board Risk Information Report which accompanies the Group Chief Risk Of cers Report.

The ERMF Effectiveness Review process will provide the Committee with an objective baseline against which progress can be measured over the coming years Output from Enterprise Risk Management Forum The Enterprise Risk Management Forum provides an integrated platform for all the Risk Framework Owners and the regional and client-business Chief Risk Of cers to discuss the key themes relevant to the Groups Principal Risk Types.

regarding the work of the Committee.
81 DIRECTORS REPORT Corporate governance Interaction with management The Committee is mindful of the need to hold management directly accountable when issues have arisen and have been reported by the Group Chief Risk Of cer.
Senior management has attended Committee meetings for deeper discussions in such instances.
Interaction with regulators As Committee Chair, David Conner meets periodically with one of the Groups UK lead regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
In addition, and on an annual basis, the Committee meets with the PRA without members of management being present.
The purpose of such meetings is to enable a discussion between the Committee and the PRA concerning prudential focused topics.
Interaction between Board committees on risk related issues In the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other Board committees where the remit of these other committees clearly covers risk related matters.
For example, the Audit Committee has oversight of the Groups internal financial controls and regulatory compliance: the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee has oversight of the responsibilities in relation to financial crime compliance matters: and the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee has oversight of the mechanisms by which reputational risk is managed.
The interaction assists the Committee in ensuring that it is well informed on discussions held, and the close collaboration of the committee chairs helps to ensure that there are no gaps and any potential for unnecessary duplication is avoided.
Risk function resourcing The Committee has sought and received assurance that the Risk function is adequately resourced to perform its function effectively.
The Committees discussions included an overview of the changes to the Risk function in 2018 and managements forward-looking view of the Risk function over the next five to 10 years.
