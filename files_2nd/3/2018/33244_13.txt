The Half Yearly Report was not audited, as is customary for investment trusts.
In January 2019, the Committee received a report and supporting presentation from the external auditor on its audit of the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2018.
In addition, the Secretaries reported on the preparation of the financial results and other relevant matters.
The Committee considered these reports in detail and took further comfort from the internal control and risks review covered below.
The Chair of the Committee had previously discussed the outcome of the audit process and the Annual Report with the audit partner without representatives of Aberforth Partners being present.
As part of its review of the financial statements, the Committee considered the following significant issues.
Significant Issue How the issue was addressed Ownership and valuation of The Committee reviewed the Managers control framework which includes controls over the investment portfolio as valuation and ownership of investments.
The appointed Depositary is responsible for at 31 December 2018 holding and controlling all assets of the Company entrusted for safekeeping.
The Committee has reviewed internal control reports from the Companys Custodian.
The valuation of the portfolio is undertaken in accordance with the accounting policy for investments as stated in Note 1 to the financial statements.
Revenue recognition including The Committee reviewed the Managers control framework which includes controls over dividend completeness and revenue recognition.
The Committee reviewed actual revenue against forecast and the the accounting treatment of accounting treatment of all special dividends.
each special dividend recognised during the period Investment Trust Status The Committee confirmed the position of the Company in respect of compliance with investment trust status at each meeting with reference to a checklist prepared by the Secretaries.
The position is also confirmed by the external Auditor as part of the audit process.
Calculation of The Committee reviewed the Managers control framework which includes controls over management fees expenses, including management fees.
The Committee reviewed management fees payable to the Manager.
The external auditor independently recalculated the management fees as part of the audit and no exceptions have been reported.
Alternative Performance The Committee discussed the disclosure of APMs in the Annual Report, including the Measures APMs additional information on these contained in the Glossary.
The Committee read and discussed this Annual Report and concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable.
It provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, objective and strategy.
Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements be approved for publication.
Going Concern and Viability The Committee received reports on going concern from the Secretaries in July and January.
The content of the investment portfolio, trading activity, portfolio diversification and the existing debt facility were also discussed.
After due consideration, the Committee concluded it was appropriate to prepare the Companys accounts on a going concern basis and made this recommendation to the Board.
The relatively high level of liquidity of the portfolio was the main factor that led to this conclusion.
The Committee also assessed the viability of the Company.
The Committee agreed that it was appropriate to provide a Viability Statement for a five year period for the reasons set out in the Statement on page 5.
In January 2019, the Committee reviewed a series of stress tests that considered the impact of severe market downturn scenarios on Shareholders funds, the debt facility, investment income and also the impact of losing investment trust status.
The outcome of this activity led the Committee to recommend the Viability Statement to the Board.

In October the risks and controls were addressed in more detail.
The Committee enhanced the content of the Matrix during the year and believes that it continues to reflect accurately the Companys principal risks.
These risks, which are detailed on page 5, have not changed significantly during the year.
Also in October the Committee received the Managers report on internal controls, including the assurance report issued by  LLP PwC on the nature and effectiveness of the control framework that has been established by the Managers.
A representative of PwC attended the meeting.
In addition, the Committee received internal control reports from the Custodian, Northern Trust, and the Registrar, Link Asset Services.
The Committee reviewed these reports and concluded that there were no significant control weaknesses or other issues that needed to be brought to the Boards attention.
The Committee continues to monitor closely the increasing risk arising from cyber threats, notwithstanding that the Company outsources all of its activities to external parties.
In July 2018, the Committee reviewed cyber security reports from both the Depositary and the Registrar.
In October 2018, the Committee received presentations from Aberforth Partners and their external service provider for cyber security, covering the measures that are in place to protect the Managers systems and the Company information that they contain.
The Committee noted the assurances that have been given about the effectiveness of control measures.
It concluded that, although cyber-attack represents an increasing threat to companies and public bodies worldwide, the Company has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate protection measures are in place.
Nevertheless this particular threat will continue to be monitored closely.
External Auditor, Audit Planning and Audit fees Deloitte was appointed as the Companys Auditor on 17 April 2013 following a formal tender process and this appointment has been renewed at each subsequent AGM.
The Committee reviews the reappointment of the auditor every year and the need to put the audit out to tender.
Based upon existing legislation, another tender process will be conducted no later than 2023.
The Company is therefore in compliance with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Mandatory use of competitive tender processes and audit committee responsibilities Order 2014 as issued by the Competition & Markets Authority.
The audit partner needs to be rotated every five years and Chris Hunter is the new audit partner.
The Chair met him in April 2018 and he presented the Deloitte audit plan to the Committee in October in advance of the 2018 audit.
The plan set out the scope of the audit, the principal risks that would be addressed as detailed in the Independent Auditor's Report, the timetable and the proposed fees.
These amounted to 20,700, excluding VAT, for the year 2017: 20,100.
There were no non-audit activities carried out by Deloitte.
Evaluation of the Auditor Following the completion of the audit in January 2019, the Committee reviewed the Auditors effectiveness.
The Committee acknowledged that the audit team comprised staff with appropriate levels of knowledge and experience.
The Committee noted positive feedback from the Secretaries on Deloitte's performance on the audit.
Additionally Deloitte had provided confirmation that they have complied with the relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements on independence.
Taking these factors into account, the Committee is satisfied that the external audit was carried out effectively.
It has therefore recommended the re-appointment of Deloitte as the Company's Auditor for the 2019 financial year.
The Board has given its support and a proposal will be put to Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Committee Evaluation A formal internal review of the Committees effectiveness, using an evaluation questionnaire, was undertaken during the year.
The outcome was positive with no significant concerns expressed.
In 2016, a formal external review was facilitated by Lintstock Limited and it was agreed to utilise external facilitators every three years in future.
