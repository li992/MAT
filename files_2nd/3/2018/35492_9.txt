The Board has considered the principles and recommendations of the latest AIC Code of Corporate Governance AIC Code by reference to the AIC Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies AIC Guide.
The AIC Code, as explained by the AIC Guide, addresses all the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code UK Code, as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues that are of specific relevance to investment trusts.
The AIC Code is available from the Association of Investment Companies www.
The UK Code is available from the Financial Reporting Council website www.
The Company has complied with the recommendations of the AIC Code and the relevant provisions of the UK Code, except the provisions relating to: the role of the chief executive: executive directors remuneration: and the need for an internal audit function.
For the reasons set out in the AIC Guide, and as explained in the UK Code, the Board considers these provisions are not relevant to the position of The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc, being an externally managed investment company with no executive employees.
It considers an internal audit function unnecessary as the relevant issues are covered by the Managers internal audit function.
The Company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions.
