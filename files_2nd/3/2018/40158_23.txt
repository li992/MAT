Following last years externally facilitated review, this year the review was facilitated internally by the Group Company Secretary, who is well placed as an independent sounding board to the process.
The approach we took was to explore some of the themes from last years action plan and design a questionnaire to understand where improvements had been made and where further focus is needed.
The responses to the questionnaire were supplemented with a one-to-one meeting between each Board member and the Chairman, with additional input from the Senior Independent Director.
These meetings took place during November and December 2018.
The key themes were shared with the Board along with a 2019 action plan.

Work to improve the quality of the management reporting to the Committee will continue to be an area of focus in 2019 Board Risk Overall, the Committee is viewed as managing risk in a sensible and diligent manner.
It was acknowledged that there is Committee a requirement for the Committee to consider a number of regulatory matters.
While the quality of the reporting to the Committee has continued to improve, there remains a need for continued focus on the level of detail and volume of reporting to the Committee so as to assist it in effectively discharging its responsibilities Board Financial The Committee has continued to be successful in discharging its responsibilities.
The geographical representation and Crime Risk diverse background of the three adviser members provides valuable input and allows for different perspectives to Committee be considered Governance and The main observation is that the Committee is operating well and that there is a healthy and open atmosphere which promotes honest discussion.
Three themes arising from the feedback concerned ensuring greater exibility within the Nomination Committee agenda: maintaining suf cient time for effective discussion: and delivering agreed outputs swiftly Brand, Values The Committees discussion provided a number of positive observations and suggestions for further enhancing its operations: these included increased focus on the Groups sustainability agenda: and expanding the Committees remit and Conduct Committee to ensure effective reporting of the workforce policy requirements in the new 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code Remuneration Overall, it is recognised that the Committee is operating effectively, demonstrating strong leadership.
