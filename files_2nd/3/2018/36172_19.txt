What the Executive Directors Were Paid in 2018 Executive Directors Single Total Remuneration Figure Audited The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the 2018 financial year for each of the Executive Directors and compares this figure to the prior year.
Insured benefits include life assurance, private medical insurance and amedical screen.
2 Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension, which is shown in the Pension column.
3 Bonus earned includes the 25% of the Core Bonus element which is deferred into Company shares.
4 All awards under the Company Milestone element are made in shares deferred for three years.
5 The value of the PSP is determined by the number of awards vesting in relation to performance in the period ended 30 June 2018. Dividend equivalents are not added to awards made under the PSP.
The value shown for 2018 is based on the average share price for the final three months of the 2018 financial year which was 2,523p.
6 The 2017 values shown as estimated in the previous Annual Report have been restated to reflect the actual value at vesting.
The share price was 2,200p on 20 November 2017 when awards vested for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
How the Bonuses for 2018 Were Calculated Annual Bonus: Core Bonus Element The 2018 bonuses for Executive Directors were calculated by reference to performance against a challenging sliding scale of profit, cash flow and personal targets.
Targets were set by the Committee to exclude the costs of gene editing.
This was a decision by the Committee as was the case in 2017 to ensure that managements reward was not unfairly affected by making the right long-term investment decisions on behalf of the business.
The following results were achieved for each element of the annual bonus incentive.
Proportion of salary Actual 2018 Extent to which targets were met 1 Bonus target Strategic objective maximum performance Threshold Target Stretch % Adjusted profit Year-on-year profit 80% 66.7m 59.9m 65.8m 68.8m 63.9% 2 before tax growth Generation of Generate cash 20% 24.3m 18.6m 21.6m 24.6m 94.4% free cash flow for reinvestment anddividend Personal To build 25% See Chief Executive 90% objectives the foundation for page 72 Group Finance Director 90% future growth 1 The financial elements of the bonus are payable on a straight-line basis between each threshold, target and stretch level.

The maximum opportunity under the Company Milestone element of the bonus was an award of shares deferred for three years and worth up to 75% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Group Finance Director.

How the Performance Share Plan Figure was Calculated in the Single Total Remuneration Table Karim Bitars and Stephen Wilsons PSP awards granted on 14 September 2015 were subject to a performance condition, based on the growth in adjusted earnings per share from 2015 to 2018.
The range of targets applicable to the awards, which had a value of 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of salary for the Group Finance Director, was as follows: % of award 1 Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share vesting Less than 6% per annum Nil 6% per annum 20% 20% per annum 100% 1 Straight line vesting between the points in the above table.
The Committee exercised discretion to calculate the long-term award after excluding gene editing costs incurred during the performance period, to avoid an unintended impact on the Executives remuneration whilst making long-term decisions in support of value creation.
This is consistent with the approach previously communicated to shareholders and taken in 2016 and2017.
The adjusted 2018 earnings per share after the cost of share-based payments and adjusting for costs relating to gene editing was 75.4p.
This represents an average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 12.3% compared to the comparable 2015 adjusted earnings per share figure after the cost of share-based payments.
The resulting level of vesting is therefore 56% of 1 maximum for both the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
Karim Bitars award was over a maximum of 78,850 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 44,156 shares and these will vest on 14 September 2018.
Stephen Wilsons award was over a maximum of 46,753 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 26,182 shares and these will vest on the same date.
The Companys average share price for the period from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018 was 2,523p, meaning that the values shown for these awards within the single figure table are 1,114,056 for Karim Bitar and 660,564 for Stephen Wilson.
1 The average annual earnings per share growth including gene editing costs after share based payments was 8.4% and the associated vesting level would have been 33.7% of maximum.

We will retrospectively disclose performance against these targets.
Bonus deferral Of the 125% Core Bonus element, one quarter of the total award will be deferred by way of shares for three years and will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain good leaver circumstances.
Malus and clawback The Committee can apply malus to deferred bonuses and claw back any element of paid bonuses that should not have been awarded or paid, in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups annual results.
Annual Bonus: Company Milestone Element Value of bonus The Company Milestones element allows for awards of deferred shares of up to 75% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
Performance Company Milestones represent pivotal and significant events in the Companys development, which measures reposition the Company as an agricultural biotechnology pioneer.
Such events would be significant strategic achievements and long-term value creating.
The Committee has determined that this element of the annual bonus will be included for 2019 for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
Due to commercial sensitivity the target and achievement against it including any resulting award will be disclosed retrospectively.
Bonus deferral For achievement of the Company Milestone element, any award will be deferred into shares for three years and will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain good leaver circumstances.
Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 76 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT SECTION D: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 2.
What the Executive Directors Can Earn in 2019 continued Long-Term Incentives Awards to be granted in 2019 will be granted in line with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders and under the 2014 PSP.
The Chief Executive will be granted an award over shares worth 200% of salary and the Group Finance Director will be granted an award over shares worth 175% of salary.
These awards are in line with those awarded in 2016, due to vest in 2019.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2019 will primarily relate to average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share, measured over three years and excluding gene editing costs.
The same approach will govern awards due to vest in 2019.
The range of targets for the 2019 awards is as follows: 2 Vesting 1 Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share % award Less than 5% per annum 0% 5% per annum 20% 15% per annum 100% 1 Growth in adjusted earnings per share over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share-based payments and excluding gene editing costs.
2 Straight-line vesting between performance points.
The Committee remains convinced that using adjusted earnings per share is the correct approach and is consistent with awards made in 2018.
The Committee believes the above targets are appropriately challenging, that they incentivise Executives to deliver the Companys growth strategy and are therefore aligned with shareholders interests.
They also adhere to the principles of transparency and simplicity, to maximise the incentive provided to participants by the 2014 PSP.
As with awards currently granted under the 2014 PSP, the Committee will be able to scale back vesting based on earnings per share performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Companys strategy during the performance period.
This is considered appropriate to broaden the Executive teams focus beyond financial performance.
2014 PSP awards granted in 2019 will continue to require the Executives to retain the after-tax number of shares vesting in 2022 for two years.
Clawback and malus provisions may be applied at the Committees discretion, if the Companys results are found to have been materially misstated within three years of vesting.
The Process the Committee Followed to Arrive at These Decisions The Committee complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
It makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT.
The Committees full terms of reference are available on the Companys website at www.

None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director attend meetings at the Committees invitation but are not present when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee is supported by the Group HR Director, Group Reward Director, Finance and Company Secretariat functions.

How Shareholders Views are Taken into Account We consulted with shareholders ahead of proposing a revised Remuneration Policy to shareholders at our 2016 AGM.
We were pleased with the constructive dialogue with shareholders and for their time and feedback on the proposed policy changes.

The Group HR Director facilitates this process, presenting to the Committee on the pay structures across the organisation and how they fit the Groups Remuneration Policy.
The process includes a staff engagement survey that includes questions on pay, as well as consulting employees informally on their views of the current overall Remuneration Policy.
This forms part of the feedback provided to the Committee and is used by the Group HR Director to assess the Remuneration Policys ongoing effectiveness and the changes that should be made.
When setting the Executive Directors base salaries, the Committee compares the salary increases proposed for each Executive Director within those proposed for employees in their geographical location, as well as considering the typical increase proposed across our UK business and the wider Group.

There are no proposed changes to the Policy this year and therefore there will be no resolution seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM.
We will continue to review the effectiveness of our Policy during the year ahead of presenting an updated Policy for shareholder approval in 2019.
We will continue to have the annual resolution seeking shareholder approval of how we have implemented the Remuneration Policy.
The table summarising the Remuneration Policy is shown below for information.
Full details of the Remuneration Policy can be found in our 2016 Annual Report which is available from our website at www.
Directors Remuneration Policy Report The key objectives of the Remuneration Policy are that: pay should be competitive, so we can attract and retain the best people: fixed pay base salary, pension and benefits should take account of appropriate external benchmarks both in the UK where we are listed and globally and pay for our other employees: short and long-term incentive pay should provide the opportunity to earn upper quartile total remuneration, subject to delivering our above-market long-term growth aspirations: we can recognise significant biotechnology and strategic Company Milestones: incentive pay should be directly linked to the Groups strategy, with targets relating to our key performance indicators using non-financial input measures and or output measures such as earnings per share and should be stretching, in light of our strategic plan: incentive structures should be simple, reward long-term sustained growth and key strategic milestones, rather than volatile performance: the policy should be clearly aligned with shareholders interests, take due account of current best practice and not encourage undue risk taking: and policy principles for Executive Directors should apply to GELT members with appropriate tiering through the wider workforce.
