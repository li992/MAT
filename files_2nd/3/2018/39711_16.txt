Division of Responsibilities The roles of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are distinct and separate and their roles and responsibilities are clearly established.
The Chairman leads the Board and has particular responsibility for the effectiveness of the Groups governance.
In promoting a culture of openness he ensures the effective engagement and contribution of all Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
To help ensure a proper dialogue with all Directors, the Chairman meets periodically with the Directors individually and the Non-Executive Directors as a group and without the Executive Directors.
The Group Chief Executive has responsibility for all Group businesses and acts in accordance with the authority delegated by the Board.
There are a number of areas where the Board has delegated specific responsibility to management, including responsibility for the operational management of the Groups businesses as well as reviewing strategic issues and risk matters in advance of these being considered by the Board and or its Committees.
The Senior Independent Director, Tim Freshwater acts as intermediary for other Directors, if needed, and is available to respond to shareholder concerns when contact through the normal channels is inappropriate.
The Board considers that throughout the year the Company was in full compliance with the Code.
Time commitment and conflicts The Board is satisfied that the Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors committed sufficient time during the year to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors of the Company.
The Companies Act 2006 places a duty on each Director to avoid a situation in which he or she has or can have a direct or indirect interest which conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the Company.
A Director will not be in breach of that duty if the relevant matter has been authorised by the other Directors in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The Board has adopted a set of guiding principles on managing conflicts and approved a process for identifying current and future actual and potential conflicts of interest.
The Board, or the Nomination & Governance Committee on its behalf, reviews actual and situational conflicts of interest at least annually and as necessary if and when a new potential situational conflict is identified or a potential conflict situation materialises.
During 2018, the actual and situational conflicts of interest that were identified by each Director were subsequently authorised by the Board, subject to appropriate conditions in accordance with the guiding principles.
Procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue to operate effectively and the Boards authorisation powers continue to be exercised properly in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
50 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Indemnification of Directors In accordance with the Companys Articles of Association, and to the extent permitted by law, the Directors and the Group Legal Director & Company Secretary are granted an indemnity, in respect of any liabilities incurred as a result of their holding office.
Such indemnities were in force during the financial year to 31 December 2018 and up to the date of this Report.
The Company also maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against its Directors and Officers.
BOARD ACTIVITY Meetings The Board and Committee meetings are structured to allow open discussion.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, each Director receives appropriate and timely information.
Board papers are circulated electronically via a secure portal, giving Directors sufficient time to consider and digest their contents.
When unable to be present in person, Directors may attend by audio or video conference.
When Directors are unable to attend a Board or Committee meeting, their views on the key items of business to be considered at that meeting are relayed in advance to the Chairman of that meeting in order that these can be presented at the meeting and be considered in the debate.
Regular attendance at Board meetings by the Heads of Principal Businesses on matters of significance ensure that the Board has the opportunity to discuss business risks and opportunities with leaders from across the Group.
The Group Legal Director & Company Secretary provides the Board with updates and reports covering legal developments and regulatory changes.
The Chairman, together with the Group Legal Director & Company Secretary, ensures that the Directors receive management information, including financial, operating and strategic reports, in advance of Board meetings.
At its meetings during the year, the Board discharged its responsibilities and received updates on the Groups financial performance, key management changes, material new projects, investment proposals, financial plans, and legal and regulatory updates.
