2017 18 2016 17 Scope 1 tonnes CO2e 787 684 Scope 2 tonnes CO2e 4,239 4,481 Total tonnes CO2e 5,026 5,165 Tonnes CO2e per sq metre 0.071 0.075 Tonnes CO2e per 000 of revenue 0.023 0.033 We have used the methodology described in the Environmental Reporting Guidelines from DEFRA to identify our GHG inventory of Scope 1 direct and Scope 2 indirect global CO2 emissions.
We have considered the six main GHGs and report in CO2 equivalent.
Our data includes all manufacturing, warehousing, office and retail sites controlled globally by Games Workshop for the 53 weeks to 3 June 2018.
All calculations have used the 2018 DEFRA conversion factors.
Scope 1 covers activities owned or controlled by Games Workshop that release emissions straight into the atmosphere - gas boilers, vehicle operation, air conditioning.
Scope 2 covers activities that are not owned or controlled by Games Workshop but which create emissions as a result of our activities - electricity consumption.
October 2017 saw the completion of the installation of a 400kW solar panel system at the Nottingham site.
This has currently generated 173 MWh of electricity and is in line to meet or exceed the design output.
