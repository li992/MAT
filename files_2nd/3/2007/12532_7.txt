Oil and gas proven and probable booked reserves increased to 212 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe 2006: 152 mmboe.
We also increased our contingent resources by a net 20 mmboe bringing total reserves and resources to 369 mmboe 2006: 289 mmboe.
Significant reserve additions included the acquisition of the Scott field interest and an additional 25 per cent equity in North Sumatra Block A.
Reserves associated with our development project in the Natuna Sea Gajah Baru which commercialises previous exploration successes have been booked for the first time.
A major achievement in 2007 was the progress made in advancing new projects both technically and commercially.
Agreement with gas customers in Singapore, Batam and North Sumatra has been reached on attractive terms.
These projects are scheduled for final investment approval during 2008, together with our oil development in Vietnam.
Our exploration programme in 2007 delivered four successes from 11 exploration and appraisal wells.
The Chim So formerly Blackbird sidetrack, drilled early in 2007, encouraged us to move into the development stage for that project.
We are returning to Vietnam to drill the Chim So North appraisal well in March 2008 and continue a potentially high-impact programme for a further three wells.
Altogether we plan around 13 exploration and appraisal wells and 18 development wells in 2008.
We also continue to build our programmes for future years with new licence awards in Norway and Vietnam, seismic surveys under way in Norway, Vietnam and Indonesia and a two-well exploration programme planned for Congo in late 2008 or early 2009.
Our efforts on improving our health, safety and environmental performance standards have again resulted in us beating our internal targets.
We seek continued improvements year-onyear in this area.
For the first time our policies will include a focus on carbon emission targets.
Our 2007 Social Performance Report will be published in April 2008.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 03 A major achievement in 2007 was the progress made in advancing new projects both technically and commercially.
Shareholder returns During 2007, Premier shares increased in value by 6 per cent, contributing to an increase of 352 per cent over the five year period to 31 December 2007.
This strong performance and the attractive returns expected from our investment programme have reinforced our policy to reward shareholders principally through share price growth and to utilise cash flows within the business.
Board changes We were pleased to announce the appointments of David Lindsell and Michel Romieu as non-executive directors in January 2008.
Both have had distinguished careers in their respective fields and will provide invaluable input to the Board.
Two non-executive directors, Scott Dobbie and Ron Emerson, will retire in June 2008 after combined service of 14 years on the Board.
We are enormously grateful for their outstanding contributions over a long period of time.
Outlook Current production has exceeded 40,000 boepd during the early months of 2008.
Significant milestones have already been achieved on our key development projects.
We have commercialised previous exploration successes and added to our booked reserve base.
This gives us increasing confidence that our production target of 50,000 boepd by the end of 2010 will be achieved.
Further significant progress will be made on these projects during 2008.
2008 also offers potential to add a new generation of projects with drilling campaigns in Vietnam, Norway and Congo being planned and executed.
This combination of exploration, appraisal and development projects offers shareholders a wide portfolio of growth opportunities which our strong financial position allows us to pursue.
Sir David John KCMG Chairman Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements Simon Lockett 04 Chief Executive CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW Proved and Production and reserves probable reserves 2007 has seen key milestones in a number of our development projects.
These are material steps forward in achieving, at a minimum, our production target of 50,000 boepd by end mmboe 250 2010 and in growing our portfolio of four regional businesses.
Working interest production for 2007 averaged 35,750 boepd.
Comparable production 200 from 2006 was 33,000 boepd.
Production comprised 34 per cent liquids and 66 per cent gas, with Pakistan and Indonesia accounting for 36 per cent and 34 per cent of the total 150 respectively, the UK 28 per cent and West Africa the remainder.
On an entitlement basis, group production for the year was 31,450 boepd 2006: 28,900 boepd.
This represents a 39 per cent increase in net proven and probable reserves since 31 December 2006.
Proven and Reserves and probable reserves contingent resources mmboe mmboe Start of 2007 152 289 Production 13 13 Net additions and revisions 73 93 End of 2007 212 369 At year-end, reserves comprised 18 per cent liquids and 82 per cent gas.
The equivalent volume on an entitlement basis amounted to 183 mmboe 2006: 132 mmboe.
Booked reserve additions and revisions include an increase in booked reserves in Indonesia West Natuna Sea Block A resulting from an additional Gas Sales Agreement GSA, and the North Sumatra Block A gas development for which a GSA has been signed with the PIM Fertilizer Plant.
Significant reserve additions also included the acquisition of the Scott field interest.
There were reserves increases on the Kakap field in Indonesia and the Zamzama field in Pakistan.
In the UK, a reduction in Wytch Farm reserves was offset by increased reserves on the Kyle field.
Contingent resource bookings have increased to include the Banda gas discovery in Mauritania, the Kuala Langsa gas discovery in North Sumatra Block A, the Bream discovery in Norway and the Chim So oil field in Vietnam where an Outline Development Plan was submitted.
These volumes, together with others in the process of being commercialised, give increased total reserves and contingent resources of 369 mmboe 2006: 289 mmboe.
"Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 05 ""Premier is extremely well placed to meet its stated production target of 50,000 boepd by end 2010 from existing assets."
Our focus is turning to the next phase of growth through exploration, appraisal and acquisition.
Exploration and appraisal Premier has continued to drill up and expand its exploration portfolio during 2007.
It has participated in 11 exploration and appraisal wells giving four successes: eight of these wells have been drilled by Premiers operations team.
It has acquired new seismic data, and reprocessed old data, to generate new prospects for 2008 and subsequent drilling, and it has sought out and signed new licences in Norway and Vietnam.
Exploration spend on drilling and seismic in 2007 was US$104.7 million pre-tax post-tax and recoveries: US$77.5 million.
Costs of the exploration programme were reduced from original estimates by prudent farm-outs in the UK, India and Guinea Bissau.
A focus of exploration effort in 2007 was in Vietnam on our Block 12W Production Sharing Contract PSC : our Chim So sidetrack, drilled early in 2007, confirmed the down-dip 2 extent of the 2006 Chim So discovery.
Subsequently a large 3D survey 1,600km was acquired over the block, enabling us to confirm several other prospects that are to be drilled in our 2008 programme.
Premiers farm-in to the adjacent block, the 07 03 formerly Block 7&8 97 PSC, was ratified by the Vietnamese authorities during the year, allowing us to assume operatorship and to accelerate the exploration of this large, under-explored block: a 2D survey is planned in 2008 with drilling planned for 2009.
We have been actively building up our Vietnamese knowledge and have been granted another, previously underexplored, licence Block 104-109 05, formally signed in February 2008.
Premier also had an active year in Indonesia, with two discoveries, Pancing and Ibu Lembu, the signing of two new blocks, the Tuna and Buton PSCs, and the purchase of additional equity in our North Sumatra Block A acreage.
These new blocks provide an exciting set of exploration prospects, and in the case of the North Sumatra acreage will in addition include appraisal of earlier discoveries.
In Pakistan we participated in the successful Qadirpur Deep-1 well, targeting hitherto undrilled reservoir zones below the Qadirpur field.
A similar well, targeting sands below the Badhra field was spudded in January 2008.
Premier also drilled some high-potential but high-risk exploration wells during the year: in advance of drilling we prudently reduced our financial exposure by farming out the well costs on favourable terms.
These wells included Masimpur-3 in India, Peveril in the UKCS, two wells offshore Guinea Bissau and the Anne-1 well offshore Pakistan.
In the North Sea region we evaluated new opportunities and subsequently acquired new exploration licences: five in Norway and one in the UK.
Looking ahead to 2008, the exploration focus will be in South East Asia, where we plan to drill several exploration wells in Vietnam Block 12W that, if successful, will enhance and extend our Chim So development hub.
We will acquire 2D seismic surveys in the contiguous Block 07 03 in Vietnam and Tuna in Indonesia, defining prospects for a 2009 drilling campaign.
We will be active with the drill-bit in the North Sea where we will be targeting a shallow oil prospect in Block 23 22b in the UK having farmed-out the well costs on favourable terms, and in Norway where an appraisal well will be drilled on the Bream oil discovery.
In West Africa we have firmed up large prospects in the Congo Marine Block IX permit and are in the early stages of planning our first well to be drilled in late 2008 or early 2009 depending on rig availability.
Planned spend on exploration and appraisal drilling and seismic in 2008 is US$110.0 million pre-tax post-tax and recoveries: US$75.0 million.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 06 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Asia Indonesia Premiers core asset in Indonesia is in the West Natuna Sea, where it operates the Anoa India field in Block A 28.67 per cent interest and is a partner in the Kakap field 18.75 per cent interest.
These fields supply gas under a long-term sales contract to Singapore.
In 2007, Premier sold an average of 137 billion British thermal units per day BBtud gross from Vietnam the Anoa field and a further 66 BBtud gross from the non-operated Kakap field, under Philippines this agreement.
Gross oil and condensate production from these two fields averaged 2,498 barrels of oil Indonesia per day bopd for Anoa 2006: 2,581 bopd and 7,977 bopd for Kakap 2006: 6,998 bopd.
Anoa is showing a slow natural oil decline as it matures, but has the potential for further drilling in 2009 to reverse this trend.
Kakap meanwhile has benefited from the drilling of the Jangkar well in 2006 and enjoyed improved performance and a full years net production in 2007 of 1,495 bopd 2006: 1,312 bopd.
Overall net production from Indonesia increased to 12,000 boepd in 2007 Anoa contributing 8,190 boepd and Kakap 3,810 boepd, compared with 11,550 boepd in 2006.
The improvement is attributable to increased gas demand from Singapore and increased oil production on Kakap.
On the Gajah Baru development, Premier met its 2007 goal to have definitive agreements in place for further gas sales from Natuna Sea Block A and retains its target to start producing this gas in 2010.
Heads of Agreement were signed with Sembcorp Gas Pte Ltd for supply of gas to Singapore and with PT Palayanan Listrik Nasional Batam and PT Universal Batam Energy for domestic supply of gas to Batam.
Engineering work confirmed the development concept for the three fields supplying the gas Gajah Baru, Naga and Iguana and a draft Plan of Development was submitted to the government.
Negotiations with the Singapore buyer were completed on 29 February 2008 and the current focus is on conclusion of ancillary agreements.
Formal government approval of field development plans and the award of major construction contracts are expected later in 2008.
2007 saw three exploration wells drilled in Indonesia.
In Natuna Sea Block A, the Ibu Lembu-1 well was drilled to prove the hydrocarbon potential in the adjacent up-dip structure to the 2006 Lembu Peteng-1 discovery.
The well encountered gas in the primary target but following the running of an extensive data acquisition programme was plugged and abandoned as sub-economic.
The second well, Gajah Sumatera-1 was drilled to appraise a potential extension to the Gajah Puteri field in Natuna Sea Block A.
While the well encountered some gas shows while drilling, wireline logs indicated that no significant hydrocarbons were encountered and the well was plugged and abandoned.
Further technical studies are being carried out in the area to define the hydrocarbon-bearing sand distribution proven by adjacent wells.
The Pancing-1 well was drilled in the Kakap Block to test a deep structure close to existing infrastructure.
The well flowed oil although at subeconomic rates, however the wells results are significant in encountering hydrocarbons in an under-explored play in the area, raising the possibility of further exploration potential.
2008 exploration activities within Natuna Sea Block A will focus on maturing and highgrading the existing prospects and leads for an anticipated 2009 drilling programme.
Premier completed the joint acquisition with Medco of ConocoPhillips 50 per cent share of North Sumatra Block A in January 2007, bringing our interest to 41.67 per cent.
Negotiations to sell gas from the undeveloped Alur Siwah, Alur Rambong and Julu Rayeu fields progressed well through the year culminating in a December signing of a Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement with two fertilizer plants owned by PT Pupuk Iskandar Muda PIM, a state-owned entity, for the delivery of 110 BBtud gross for seven years.
A second gas sale to Palayanan Listrik Nasional PLN for local electricity generation is progressing well with an expectation of completing agreements in the first quarter of 2008.
Development studies were ongoing through the year with a Plan of Development submitted in December.
Project sanction is anticipated by mid-2008.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 07 Technical studies including field mapping and sampling took place on the Buton PSC on the south-eastern side of Buton Island, Sulawesi, with the aim of firming up multiple leads originally identified from satellite imagery.
Towards the end of the year a contract was awarded for the acquisition of 265km of 2D seismic data across the block.
The survey commenced in January 2008 and is expected to take approximately six months to complete.
The data will help to high-grade the acreage and focus on identifying a high-impact drilling opportunity for 2009.
Premier has a non-operated 30 per cent equity interest in the block.
In March, Premier was awarded a 65 per cent operating equity interest in the Tuna PSC in 2 the North East Natuna Sea.
The block covers 4,992km and lies south of Premiers operated Block 07 03 and Block 12W in Vietnam and to the east of the Natuna Sea Block A and Kakap PSCs in Indonesia.
The Tuna PSC represents an under-explored area in the middle of a region in which Premier has a strong technical understanding.
Multiple leads have been identified which will be followed up in 2008 with the acquisition of new seismic data leading to the drilling of two wells on the block.
Vietnam Following the discovery of the Chim So and Dua oil fields in 2006, Premier acquired and interpreted 3D seismic data in the first half of 2007.
The development plan is to produce first oil in 2010 from two wellhead platforms on the Chim So field with production from a third wellhead platform on the Dua field following in 2011.
Oil will be processed and stored on a leased FPSO facility located between the fields.
During December, Premier submitted reserve reports and development plans for these fields to the Government of Vietnam.
The Reserve Assessment Report was approved on 4 March 2008.
Approval of the development plan is targeted for mid-2008.
During 2007, Premier and the Government of Vietnam agreed the merger of Block 12E into Block 12W and extension of the exploration period of the merged PSC until late 2009.
Detailed interpretation of the 3D seismic data acquired in 2007 defined several exploration prospects.
These will be drilled with the Wilboss jack-up rig: drilling will commence in mid-March 2008 with a well in the northern part of the Chim So field.
The rig will then drill three exploration wells including the Chim Ung Falcon well, which will test a prospect on trend with Chim So, and the high-impact Chim Cng Peacock prospect.
The programme will target reserves in excess of 200 million barrels mmbbls with the ability to tie-back discoveries into the core Chim So development.
Premier operates a 37.5 per cent exploration working interest in Block 12W.
During 2007, Premier assumed the operatorship of Block 07 03 with a 45 per cent exploration working interest.
A comprehensive interpretation of the existing seismic data identified several potentially high-impact prospects over which further seismic will be acquired in 2008.
Premier is actively seeking a drilling unit to drill exploration wells in Block 07 03 during 2009.
India Discussions continue with the Government of India to resolve outstanding issues with respect to the Ratna field development.
The Ratna fields lie in shallow water offshore Mumbai and are estimated to contain around 80 mmbbls.
Premier has a 10 per cent carried interest and is the operator.
The Masimpur-3 well in Cachar was successfully drilled with costs being carried in part.
The well did not flow commercial gas or oil volumes during testing and was plugged and abandoned.
The PSC will now terminate since no commercial discovery has been made during the exploration period.
Philippines Premier entered 2007 holding a 42.5 per cent operated participating interest in Philippines Licence SC43 located in the Ragay Gulf area of SE Luzon.
During the course of the year Premier farmed-out the operatorship of SC43 and a 21.5 per cent participating interest, leaving Premier with a 21 per cent participating interest.
In exchange for this consideration all of Premiers costs relating to the Monte Cristo-1 exploration well, which is expected to be drilled in the first half of 2008, will be carried.
In the fourth quarter of 2007 a 371km 2D marine seismic survey was carried out on the same licence over a prospective trend in the Panaon Limestone formation.
This data is currently being processed.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 08 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Middle East-Pakistan Pakistan Production in 2007 surpassed the previous record levels achieved in 2006.
Production net Pakistan to Premier in 2007 was 12,700 boepd, an increase of 5 per cent on last year 2006: 12,150 boepd.
This additional volume was due to increased gas demand and was primarily met through additional supply from the Zamzama field.
Qadirpur produced an average of 3,980 boepd from Premiers net interest of 4.75 per cent 2006: 3,866 boepd.
The project to enhance Qadirpur plant capacity from 500 million Egypt standard cubic feet per day mmscfd to 600 mmscfd continued during 2007 and first gas from that increased capacity is expected by the end of April 2008.
In addition to the above, negotiations are ongoing with the existing gas buyer for an additional supply of 75 mmscfd permeate gas equivalent to 40 mmscfd processed gas for subsequent use in power generation.
The Qadirpur Deep-1 well was drilled to a depth of 4,681 metres in 2007 encountering hydrocarbons in several zones.
The well was suspended following higher than anticipated temperatures and pressures.
Specialised equipment has since been ordered and testing of the well is expected to resume in the second quarter of 2008.
On Kadanwari, the K-18 well was drilled and tested successfully during 2007, and brought onstream in February 2008.
Additional production from K-18 will more than compensate for the natural field decline in 2008.
In 2007 the field produced an average of 1,260 boepd 2006: 1,200 boepd from Premiers 15.79 per cent net interest.
An additional well is planned to be drilled in the second half of 2008.
Zamzama produced an average of 4,620 boepd in 2007 2006: 4,140 boepd from Premiers 9.37 per cent interest.
Work continued in 2007 on the Zamzama Phase 2 development project, to produce gross 150 mmscfd High Calorific Value HCV gas for sale, but plant problems mean that only Medium Calorific Value MCV gas can currently be supplied.
HCV deliveries are expected to be achieved later in 2008.
Bhit production was 2,840 boepd in 2007 2006: 2,944 boepd from Premiers 6.00 per cent working interest.
The slight fall in production in 2007 was due to an extended shut down for Phase 2 tie-in work.
Work on the Phase 2 project to enhance Bhit plant capacity to 315 mmscfd is now complete allowing accelerated Bhit field production and delivery of first gas from Badhra reserves.
The Badhra South-1 well spudded in January 2008 to prove additional reserves in the Mughalkot reservoir.
In the event of success, the well will be deepened to test three identified sand lobes.
The well is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2008.
On Zarghun South, negotiations on the Pipeline Tariff Agreement were concluded with the gas buyer a condition precedent for the already agreed GSA.
First gas is planned for the first quarter of 2010.
Premiers interest of 3.75 per cent in this asset is carried by the operator during the development and production phases of the field.
Egypt In September 2007 Premier reduced its equity in the North West Gemsa Concession from 37.5 per cent to 10.0 per cent resulting in a reimbursement of some previous costs from the operator.
During the latter part of the year, the operator conducted geological studies to define the SE Al Amir prospect which is scheduled for drilling in March 2008.
Abu Dhabi Shareholder agreements were executed in December with Emirates International Investment Company LLC EIIC, forming two new joint venture companies.
These companies will pursue the acquisition of upstream oil and gas assets across the Middle East and North Africa, and will be headquartered in Abu Dhabi.
The first joint venture, to be known as PREMCO, will be owned 49 per cent by Premier and 51 per cent by EIIC and will hold all joint venture assets which are acquired in the U.
A. E. In the event of a change of control of Premier, EIIC will have a pre-emptive right to purchase Premiers 49 per cent of this joint venture at fair market value.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 09 The second joint venture, to be known as PREMBV, will be owned 50 per cent by Premier, 50 per cent by EIIC, and will hold all joint venture assets which are acquired in the Middle East and North Africa excluding the U.
A. E. At the formation of the joint ventures, there will be no assets or profits attributable to these new entities.
Future acquisitions of new assets by each joint venture will be funded by Premier and EIIC in accordance with their relevant percentage holding.
This joint venture partnership will enable Premier to access acquisition opportunities across the Middle East and North Africa via EIICs relationship networks, whilst EIIC will benefit from Premiers industry expertise and operating capabilities.
North Sea During 2007, Premier continued with its stated strategy of building the North Sea Norway exploration portfolio to seek high-impact exploration drilling opportunities while maximising the value from existing production and development assets.
UnitedKingdom UK Production in the UK amounted to 9,850 boepd 2006: 6,850 boepd representing 28 per cent of the group total 21 per cent in 2006.
The increase, compared to 2007, is due to a combination of improved field performance across most of the producing assets and the impact of the Scott field acquisition completed on 17 May 2007.
The Wytch Farm oil field contributed 2,960 boepd net production to Premier, down 8 per cent on last year.
Production was adversely impacted by problems with the M19 well, offset by an A08 sidetrack well which was drilled and completed in September.
Drilling is continuing on the M20 water injection well, to be completed in 2008 as part of the Phase 1 water handling project.
Seawater injection service was also reinstated after a prolonged outage.
The shortfall in production due to the drilling problems was partly compensated by better than expected production rates from the remaining wells and successful workover activities.
Net production from Kyle was 2,470 boepd, an improvement of 26 per cent on last year from better well performance.
The gas lift project was completed for all four production wells resulting in a substantial boost in production with initial gross rates around 9,000 boepd.
The K-16 well has been delayed until at least 2009 pending further evaluation.
Premier completed the purchase of an additional 20.05 per cent equity in the Scott field in May 2007 adding an average of 5,240 boepd net over the remainder of the year.
As a result of this transaction, Premiers working interest has become 21.83 per cent.
The Scott field gross production for the year was 27,750 boepd: this amounted to a full year average of 3,630 boepd net to Premier at the combined equity levels.
Telford produced slightly below expectations during 2007 following disappointing results from the Marmion well: gross field production averaged 9,560 boepd 70 boepd net to Premier.
2007 saw the completion of a substantial infill drilling programme consisting of six wells on Scott and one well on Telford.
Future targets are being evaluated for a further campaign starting in the fourth quarter of 2008.
In the Fife Area, Premiers net production amounted to 720 bopd, below expectation due to major integrity issues with the flexible risers.
The operator has made a recommendation to suspend production in May 2008 and remove the Uisge Gorm floating production unit.
Premier has retained the right to redevelop the area with an alternative facility.
Premier operated the Peveril prospect well, located only 10km south of the Fife field, which was completed within budget at no cost to Premier.
The Peveril well encountered an unexpectedly thick interval Kimmeridge Clay and no target Fife reservoir sands.
th In the UK 24 Licensing Round, Premier was awarded a split portion of 15 24a.
The firm work programme includes seismic reprocessing and study work.
In February 2008, agreement was reached with Oilexco for a well to be drilled on the Sparrow prospect, on P1181.
This will be spudded mid-March 2008.
Oilexco will carry Premier through the well and Premier will retain a 25 per cent interest post completion.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 10 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Norway On the Fry field in Norway, development planning is progressing.
Following concept selection in September, lease purchase bids were sought for the jack-up production drilling storage and offtake unit.
These show significant increases on previous budgetary estimates submitted by suppliers: the operator has been requested to implement a major cost reduction exercise to bring investment down to an acceptable level.
The operator is also investigating third-party business opportunities and exploration upside to improve the robustness of the project as well as tackling other key issues such as contract guarantees.
The partnership issued a Declaration of Continuation at the beginning of January: submission of the Plan of Development is expected during 2008 provided viability of the chosen concept can be confirmed.
Premier was awarded a further five licences in the APA Licensing Round in January 2007.
Building on the APA 2005 portfolio, Premier was successful in capturing two of the most sought after blocks in the 2006 APA round: the Bream appraisal licence and the adjacent Bream exploration licence, PL407 and PL406 respectively.
The Bream field was initially discovered in 1971 but no development decision was reached.
Interpretation of the 2005 PGS 3D dataset across the structure suggests that between 6080 mmbbls reserves may be present.
The planning for the commitment appraisal well is at an advanced stage and is scheduled to be drilled in the first half of 2008.
The exploration licence adjacent to Bream is Premiers first operated licence in Norway.
This has the potential to add between 100250 mmbbls reserves to the proven Bream 2 accumulation.
Premier will be acquiring 500km of new 3D across the PL406 licence in March 2008 using PGSs Ramform Sovereign vessel with a firm well on PL406 planned for mid-2009.
The three other licences Premier was awarded were PL418 and PL419, down-dip from the Gjoa discovery and PL417 adjacent to our existing licence PL378.
West Africa Mauritania SADR Chinguetti production averaged 14,800 boepd 1,200 boepd net to Premier in 2007.
Drilling of the Chinguetti-18 well was completed in the first quarter of 2007, in line with Mauritania expectations, and a work-over was conducted on Chinguetti-14.
Operational planning was progressed for the Phase 2B development of Chinguetti in 2008 comprising two new production wells and three work-overs.
Congo High resolution 3D seismic surveys were recorded over the Chinguetti and Tiof areas in 2007.
Integration of newly acquired data into existing field models is currently being finalised.
A 4D seismic survey was also recorded over the Chinguetti field, which greatly assists selection of production well locations for the Phase 2B development programme.
In 2007, Premier terminated discussions with a preferred bidder for its Mauritanian operations.
In late 2007, Petronas acquired Woodside Energys assets, and operatorship, in Mauritania PSC A, PSC B and Chinguetti.
Opportunities and development options on PSCs A and B continue to be evaluated with the new operator.
The PSC B joint venture plans to drill the Banda-NW well in April 2008 with the objective of further defining Banda gas and oil resources, and to assess its commercial viability.
In addition, Tiof will be re-evaluated with the integration of 2007 high resolution 3D seismic data with an expectation of progressing this discovery to a development decision.
The joint venture will re-assess the exploration potential of the blocks during 2008.
The Atwood Hunter drilling rig has been contracted for the Chinguetti Phase 2B and Banda-NW appraisal programme, which is expected to commence in April 2008 and to be concluded by August 2008.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 11 Guinea Bissau Premier operated a two-well exploration programme during the first half of the year, using the Global Santa Fe jack-up rig Baltic.
The wells were completed within budget and without incident.
Premier reduced its exposure to the drilling costs by farming out some of its interests.
The Espinafre-1 well was plugged and abandoned on 23 March 2007 after encountering hole stability problems.
The Eirozes-1 well was plugged and abandoned on 24 April 2007.
This well encountered a significant reservoir section but no hydrocarbons.
Following post-well analyses and re-assessment of the remaining prospectivity of the Sinapa and Esperana Permits, Premier effectively withdrew from both concessions in Guinea Bissau in December 2007.
Gabon The Themis Permit non-operated is located in the Gamba play fairway, offshore southern Gabon.
The Themis PSC joint venture commenced drilling the Themis Admiral Marin-1 THAM-1 well in December 2007: the well was plugged and abandoned with hydrocarbon shows on 13 January 2008.
The Dussafu Permit non-operated is located south of Themis, adjacent to the Congolese border.
The PSC was extended to a Second Exploration Term effective May 2007, with a 2D seismic commitment.
In December 2007, Premier signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with a qualified party to acquire Premiers 25 per cent participating interest in the Dussafu PSC.
The transaction was completed on 8 March 2008.
Congo Significant progress has been made in the evaluation of the deep water Marine Block IX exploration acreage.
Premier, as operator, has conducted a detailed evaluation of Albian raft prospectivity, the characteristic proven play in the area.
This has identified the Frida and Ida prospects, both in excess of 250 mmbbls gross potential.
The joint venture is also mapping the potential of Tertiary channel sands that have proven productive in the adjacent Haute Mer Concession.
Premier and its joint venture partner are actively progressing planning for a discretionary drilling programme of up to two wells in late 2008, or early 2009.
Completion of this programme is subject, among other issues, to rig availability.
Premier is in advanced discussions with a party to farm-in to Premiers equity interest in Marine Block IX in return for a carry of its costs.
SADR The companys exploration rights in the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic SADR remain under force majeure, awaiting resolution of sovereignty under a United Nations mandated process.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements Tony Durrant 12 Finance Director FINANCIAL REVIEW Operating profit Economic environment 2007 was another year of record oil and gas commodity prices, approaching US$100 per $ million 250 barrel bbl towards the end of the year.
The Brent oil price, which began the year at US$60.1 bbl, averaged US$72.7 bbl, reaching a peak of US$95.8 bbl during November.
Gas 200 prices worldwide were also boosted according to the degree of linkage with crude oil.
The early part of 2008 has seen increased volatility in commodity prices.
The fragile health of the 150 global economy has put downward pressure on average 2008 prices but this has been more than offset by supply concerns and average 2008 prices are currently above US$90 bbl.
100 The sustained period of stronger commodity prices and increased industry activity levels 50 have put further pressure on both operating and development costs.
Rig rates and other drilling service costs are at historically high levels.
Shortages of experienced staff and 0 longer lead times for development equipment added further cost pressures on the industry.
2005 2006 2007 The industry is responding to cost and availability issues by optimising the use of available resources, innovative resource-sharing and focussing on fast track development solutions.
Income statement Production levels in 2007, on a working interest basis, averaged 35,750 boepd compared to 33,000 boepd in 2006.
On an entitlement basis, which allows for additional government take under the terms of our PSCs, production was 31,450 boepd 2006: 28,900 boepd.
Realised oil prices averaged US$72.3 bbl compared with US$64.9 bbl in the previous year.
Gas production averaged 135 mmscfd 23,500 boepd during the year, or approximately 66 per cent of total production.
Average gas prices for the group were US$5.60 per thousand standard cubic feet mscf 2006: US$5.11 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, which are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil HSFO, have moved broadly in line with crude pricing, averaging US$11.30 mscf 2006: US$9.43 mscf during the year.
Following the groups decision to terminate discussions with a preferred bidder, the financial results for Mauritanian operations are no longer required to be presented separately.
The corresponding amounts for 2006 have been re-presented accordingly.
During the year, the group also restructured its business in Pakistan by fide-merging interests from the Premier-KUFPEC Pakistan joint venture and now fully consolidates its share of operations in Pakistan.
This restructuring had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Total sales revenue from all operations was 44 per cent higher than 2006 at US$578.2 million 2006: US$402.2 million as a result of higher production and commodity prices.
Cost of sales was US$267.5 million 2006: US$179.2 million after including a cost of US$26.8 million for inventory acquired with the Scott field acquisition.
The year-end inventory position moved from a stock overlift to an underlift position, driven by the timing of liftings around each year-end, and resulted in a charge to cost of sales of US$27.3 million 2006: credit of US$22.4 million.
After excluding the effect of inventory movements, underlying unit operating costs were higher at US$9.0 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2006: US$7.1 boe due to one-off cost increases in Indonesia and increased production from the Scott field in the North Sea.
Unit amortisation amounted to US$8.2 boe 2006: US$7.9 boe.
Exploration expense and pre-licence exploration costs amounted to US$65.3 million 2006: US$21.8 million and US$8.3 million 2006: US$21.8 million respectively, after taking into account a US$25.7 million write-down of costs in Guinea Bissau.
Administrative costs were stable at US$17.7 million 2006: US$16.8 million.
This included a charge of US$4.7 million 2006: US$5.7 million in respect of current year and future provisions for long-term incentive plans.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 13 Total sales revenue from all operations was 44 per cent higher than 2006 at US$578.2 million 2006: US$402.2 million as a result of higher production and commodity prices.
Operating profits were US$219.4 million, a 35 per cent increase from the prior year.
Finance charges net of interest income totalled US$7.5 million 2006: US$4.0 million.
Pre-tax profits were US$147.0 million 2006: US$156.6 million.
This included a significant non-cash item relating to mark to market revaluation of the group's oil and gas hedges totalling US$64.9 million pre-tax.
Such accounting losses arise as oil and gas prices increase, however, given the current range of spot and forward prices it is not expected that the hedging programme will have any material cash flow impact on the group.
The tax charge totalled US$108.0 million 2006: US$89.0 million due to underlying higher taxable profits.
Basic earnings per share amounted to 47.6 cents 2006: 82.6 cents.
Cash flow from Cash flow operating activities Cash flow from operating activities, before movements in working capital, amounted to US$408.1 million 2006: US$310.8 million.
After working capital items and tax payments, $ million 300 cash flow from operating activities amounted to US$269.5 million 2006: US$244.8 million.
Capital expenditure was US$261.2 million after inclusion of asset acquisition costs of 250 US$88.6 million.

Exploration costs of US$104.7 million take into account savings of US$30.9 million due to farm-outs in Guinea Bissau, the UK and India.
Net cash position Net cash at 31 December 2007 amounted to US$79.0 million 2006: net cash of US$40.9 million following the successful completion of a US$250 million convertible bonds issue in June.
This funding provides seven-year fixed rate debt at a cash coupon of 2.875 per cent and, together with our undrawn bank facilities, contributes substantially towards the financing of Premier's significant development programme over the next three years.

Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 14 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Net cash debt Hedging and risk management The Boards policy remains to lock in oil and gas price floors for a portion of expected $ million 100 future production at a level which protects the cash flow of the group and the business plan.
Such floors are purchased for cash or by selling calls at a ceiling price when market 80 conditions are considered favourable.
All transactions are matched as closely as possible 60 with expected cash flows to the group: no speculative transactions are undertaken.
40 During 2007 zero cost collar oil hedges for a further 2.4 mmbbls were entered into by 20 extending the maturity of the collars to the end of 2012.
This increased the average floor price from US$38.55 bbl to US$39.3 bbl whilst maintaining the cap at US$100.0 bbl.
0 During 2007 hedges for 1.8 mmbbls matured for which no cash settlement under the terms -20 of the collars was made.
At the end of 2007 a four and a half-year physical off-take -40 agreement for the sale of certain oil production was entered into with effect from 1 July 2005 2006 2007 2008.
This agreement for 8.1 mmbbls incorporates the parameters of existing oil collars and effectively replaces the equivalent amount of hedging.
In addition, zero cost collars for a further 150,000 metric tonnes mt of HSFO were entered into which raised the average floor price from US$245 mt to US$250 mt whilst maintaining the cap at US$500 mt.
During 2007 hedges for 120,000 mt matured for which a small payment under the terms of the hedges was made during the year.
At the end of 2007, a total of 642,000 mt of HSFO was hedged approximately 120,000 mt per annum representing approximately one third of Indonesian gas production, until June 2013.
Under International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS zero cost collar hedges are required to be marked to market at the balance sheet date.
The aggregate valuation is a US$65.2 million liability 2006: US$0.3 million liability generating a US$64.9 million non-cash pre-tax charge in the 2007 income statement.
The entry into the physical off-take agreement for oil production from 1 July 2008 will reduce the volatility of mark to market revaluations on the income statement.
The existing US$37.9 million provision in respect of oil hedges will be written back to the income statement over the life of these hedges.
Since the group now reports in US dollars, exchange rate exposures relate only to Sterling receipts and expenditures, which are hedged in dollar terms on a short-term basis.
The group recorded a loss of US$0.4 million on such hedging at year-end.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits, AAA managed liquidity funds and A1 P1 commercial paper subject to Board approved limits.
The group undertakes an insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with its exploration and production activities.
In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields.

Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 15 SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW Introduction Premier aspires to be an industry leader in social performance, which we define as covering the areas of social responsibility, health and safety, and environmental impact.
We set targets for these areas with reference to our historical performance, that of our peer group and the standards set by external agencies.
It is our stated policy to ensure that the risks and impacts of our activities are reduced to as low as reasonably practicable ALARP at all times.
We continue to publish a Social Performance Report every two years, and from now on in intermediate years will prepare a Communication on Progress, both of which will be available on our website.
Our Social Performance Report is prepared in line with the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2005.
The report also takes full account of the requirements of other key organisations such as the United Nations Global Compact UNGC principles, FTSE4Good, the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the International Finance Corporation Equator Principles.
Social responsibility Premier is keenly aware of its responsibilities as a corporate citizen.
Backed by a strong Board-level commitment, we have designed and implemented a coherent set of policies that lay down the principles by which we manage our relationships with communities, the health and safety of our people and our impact on the environment.
During 2007, we continued to work closely with local communities, business partners and regulatory authorities to make a positive difference within the localities where we operate.
Community and society We continue to actively support social and community projects in the areas that we work.
In Indonesia, we have been pleased to see delivery of projects identified by our Community Development Baseline Study, developed in close collaboration with BPMIGAS the Indonesian oil and gas regulator and the local community, on Matak and surrounding islands.
Projects included construction of two community halls in Terempa Siantan Island and Payalaman Matak Island and the supply of clean water to five villages on Palmatak Island.
Within these communities we have maintained our support for local education and welfare, including the completion of two kindergarten buildings, the sponsorship of a maternal and child health training programme and local paramedic training.
We handed over management of the Anoa Kindergarten to the local community, after eight years of Premier management.
We remain committed to supporting the school and have provided additional assistance through support of a pre-school teacher training programme with the aim of establishing three more schools.
We have also maintained our support for the Natuna Malay Art Revitalisation Programme to preserve and promote this culture.
Two local arts students were also sponsored to study a four-year course at the Institut Kesenian Jakarta.
In Vietnam, we sponsored the construction of four bridges in the Mekong Delta to reduce the safety risk to local people who were previously crossing on unsafe wooden structures.
We also supported the relief efforts following severe typhoon damage in the Vung Tau region.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 16 SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW CONTINUED In India, we supported local charities aiding cancer patients in Delhi and the Tamanna School Project which provides free education to Delhis street children.
In the Cachar district, close to our 2007 well operations, we also supported projects in two villages to provide clean water, sanitation and waste management, and a fish farming project in conjunction with the local government.
We also donated emergency equipment when the area suffered extensive flooding.
Employment practices We aim to attract, develop and retain talented and committed people in order to maintain the capability of the group to deliver our business objectives.
Premiers policy is to ensure equal opportunity in career development, promotion, training and reward for all our employees.
We aim to ensure that all our employees understand our business goals and our values.
As an international group we believe that our workforce should reflect the communities in which we operate and so it is important that we increase the quality and experience of our local employees.
We also actively encourage employee exchanges between different offices and nationalities.
Our objective at all times is to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics in all of our activities.
We recently conducted an employee satisfaction survey, in which employees generally expressed a high level of satisfaction with respect to their working lives and a belief that social performance issues were very relevant to their work.
Health and safety It is our stated policy to ensure that the risks to our employees, and contractors working on our behalf, are reduced to ALARP.
We strive to continually improve our performance in the areas of both occupational health and safety, and process safety.
Occupational health and safety 2007 was a year of high activity for Premier particularly with respect to exploration drilling.
We conducted an offshore seismic survey in Vietnam, drilled five operated offshore exploration wells, drilled a major onshore exploration well in India, and maintained a high level of offshore drilling and production activity at the Anoa field in Indonesia.
We report our safety performance in terms of significant injuries including fatalities, lost time injuries, and restricted workday cases.
During the 2007 work programme we incurred seven such incidents.
Four involved relatively minor injuries, two were lost time injuries and one was a contractor fatality.
The resultant combined significant injury frequency was 1.8 per million man-hours for the year.
We have consistently set ourselves improving safety targets over the past five years reducing from 3.4 to 1.9.
We have set our target for 2008 at 1.7 significant injuries per million man-hours.
2007 2006 Number of lost time injuries LTIs 3 4 Number of restricted workday cases RWDCs 4 Man-hours worked millions 3.8 3.3 Target LTI RWDC frequency per million man-hours worked 1.9 2.1 Actual LTI RWDC frequency per million man-hours worked 1.8 1.3 We benchmark our health and safety performance by contributing our data to an industry database compiled and published by the Association of Oil and Gas Producers OGP and our safety performance has been in line with or better than the OGP average over the past three years.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 17 In 2007 we enhanced our improvement processes by focusing on high-potential incidents: near miss or minor incidents that could potentially have had serious consequences.
This was done throughout the business by involving senior management in the review of highpotential incidents and by issuing safety alerts focusing on the lessons learnt.
After embedding this process in 2007 we have now included a high-potential incident frequency target as a key performance indicator in 2008.
We underwent a number of independent Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Service OHSAS 18001 assessments and surveillance audits on our worldwide operations to confirm compliance of our health and safety management systems with this standard.
Our global drilling function retained the certification it had first achieved in June 2004 though our Indonesian production operations have further assessment ongoing.
We are seeking to improve the health and wellbeing of all our employees and therefore all persons working offshore or in remote areas must undertake fitness for work health examinations.
We have introduced a travel risk assessment process to ensure all business travellers are made fully aware of any specific or new health risks and appropriate contingency measures.
Process safety Premier aims to utilise best industry practice wherever we operate.
In Indonesia, although not a local requirement, we have adopted the UK Safety Case regime for our operated production facilities which includes a review every five years to ensure that changes to facilities have been accounted for and that risks to personnel remain ALARP.
Premier will ensure that a similar regime is applied to any new operated projects that we develop elsewhere in the world.
In 2007 Premier assessed the implications for our operations of findings on safety culture from recent major incidents on other facilities in the oil industry.
To deliver confidence that process safety systems are fully functional, we are enhancing our maintenance management system to better monitor the performance of safety critical equipment.
We continue to work towards a full, independently assessed verification scheme.
Another area identified for improvement is that of operating staff competence, where we are aiming to introduce new initiatives geared to providing international vocational qualifications to help address this.
In line with our desire for a robust process safety management system we have upgraded our drilling management system to strengthen the requirement therein for an independent assessment of the condition, functionality and maintenance regime of all safety critical equipment on newly contracted rigs.
To capture this new process we reviewed the content of our Health, Safety and Environmental Well Assessment Measurement and have set new targets.
Environmental impact Our environmental policy is to ensure that our environmental emissions and discharges are ALARP.
We will also adhere to the precautionary approach outlined in the UNGC to which Premier is a signatory.
Accordingly, we intend to conduct an ALARP assessment for each operated project activity as part of its environmental aspects analysis.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 18 SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW CONTINUED Premier aims to have its environmental management systems certified to International Organization for Standardization ISO 14001.
In 2006 we achieved this goal for our Indonesian production operations, however, as a result of an audit performed in 2007, this certification was suspended.
We are currently resolving the issues that were raised in order that the certification can be reinstated in 2008.
We have successfully maintained ISO 14001 certification for our global drilling operations since 2004.
We specifically include a requirement to assess risks to biodiversity in our Corporate Health, Safety, Environment and Security Policy and include this assessment as part of our Environmental Impact Assessment EIA process.
We have also maintained our membership of the United Nations Environment Programme Proteus Initiative which seeks to provide the best available biodiversity data wherever practicable.
We continue to engage with local stakeholders to ensure that we have all available data and that this is reflected in our EIAs.
Environmental indicators In line with IPIECA we report environmental performance in the following four core areas: 2007 2006 Oil in produced water parts per million 20 21 Oil spills tonnes 13.7 3.9 Greenhouse gases tonnes per thousand tonnes of production 171 232 Energy use gigajoules per tonne of production 1.8 1.9 For further information please refer to the 2007 Social Performance Report on our website, www.
Spills and discharges There was no significant change in the volume of produced water discharged from our Anoa production facilities from 2006 to 2007.
The concentration of oil in produced water, which improved from 21 to 20 parts per million, remained well within the limits set by the Indonesian Government.
In 2007 there were 15 reported environmental incidents worldwide, down from 29 in 2006.
Most of these incidents involved small spills of hydraulic oil, diesel or chemical to the deck and were not discharged overboard.
We incurred four significant incidents, three of which were from the same drilling rig and involved the spill of 13.7 tonnes of synthetic oil-based mud to sea.
The other significant spill involved the discharge of 28.0 tonnes of water-based mud to sea following a flowline valve failure.
The spills had a very minor effect on the environment and quickly dissipated.
However, three out of four of the incidents were classified as high-potential.
These have been thoroughly investigated and corrective actions taken, including the aforementioned revisions to the drilling management system.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 19 Emissions We calculate our greenhouse gas CO equivalent emissions both in tonnes emitted 2 and in tonnes per thousand tonnes of production for both operated and joint venture operations across our global portfolio.
In 2007 we emitted approximately 222,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas in total.
When based on our net production this equated to 171 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production.
This shows a marked improvement compared with 2006 when we emitted 232 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production.
The improvement is due in part to the efforts we have made to enhance gas compressor reliability at our production facilities.
The consequent decrease in compressor downtime has resulted in a significant reduction in flaring.
We benchmark our environmental performance by contributing our data to an industry database compiled and published by the OGP.
Our greenhouse gas emissions performance has been in line with the OGP average over the past three years.
Resource use The main sources of energy that power our facilities are fuel gas and diesel.
There has been little variation in our energy use over the last few years, and energy use gigajoules per tonne of production in 2007 remained between 1.8 and 1.9.
