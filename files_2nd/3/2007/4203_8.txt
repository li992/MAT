Incentive Plan 2005 253,523 Nil 25 May 2008 to 24 May 2009 With regard to the restructuring provision, significant utilisation has occurred in 2007 and the directors view is that there 2006 203,172 Nil 23 February 2009 to 22 February 2010 will be further significant elements, notably in respect of the termination of distributor agreements, that will be utilised 2006 24,393 Nil 26April 2009 to 25April 2010 in 2008 and that the balance will be largely utilised by 2011.
Based on information currently available and on the detailed 2007 229,901 Nil 22 February 2010 to 21 February 2011 plans established for the restructuring of the Group, this level of provision is considered appropriate by the directors.
Other provisions introduced following finalisation of the fair value exercise relate to the fair value adjustments in respect of onerous Croda International Bonus contracts and fixed asset decommissioning.
These provisions will be largely utilised by 2011.
The Group has considered the Co-Investment Plan 2006 182,156 Nil 26April 2009 impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in 2007 84,777 Nil 27April 2010 a relatively short timescale, the impact is immaterial.
Non cash utilisation of the restructuring provision relates to the write down of fixed and current assets required as a result of restructuring activity.
