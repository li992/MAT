com Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice For the year ended 31 December 2007 Dear Shareholder over the first six full calendar years of HBOS 2002-2007 I am delighted to introduce this, our sixth, HBOS Remuneration there were six triennial TSR LTI maturities.
For the most recent Committee Report for which we will be seeking approval from arrangement covering 2005-2007, for the first time we did shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
It is my first report not outperform our competitors and therefore, in line with our as Chair of the Committee.
Brian Ivory, who had been Chair nowt for nowt remuneration policy, our TSR LTI payment to of the Committee since the establishment of HBOS, retired colleagues will be zero in March 2008. as a Non-executive Director and as Chair of the Committee Our expectation of meaningful HBOS shareholdings by immediately following the Annual General Meeting in April 2007. colleagues is illustrated by the fact that, every year since 2002, Under Brians outstanding leadership, the Committee all incentive outcomes earned by all Executive Directors have, established the remuneration policy for our most senior at their choice, been taken in HBOS shares, rather than in cash.
colleagues now about 240 in all at the start of 2002.
These As regular readers of our reports will know, we construct principles are, we believe, as valid now as they were then and all our incentives so that all our colleagues have a very in broad terms are as follows: clear performance:reward link.
It is one that is increasingly we have a median mid-market salary policy and manage performance focused and longer term in nature as colleague actual salaries broadly up to this position: seniority increases.
we set clear and tough targets linked absolutely to business As we reported a year ago, our suite of incentive schemes plan performance under our short term incentive STI for 2007 for our then top 215 colleagues consisted of two schemes and we inform shareholders of our performance short term incentives the first based on one year operational against those targets and the resulting STI outcomes: performance and the second focused on more sustained operational performance and two long term incentives the first we operate nowt for nowt long term incentive LTI based on the extent to which we improve EPS relative to the RPI schemes: if we do no better than matching our and the second based on the extent to which we outperform competitor average in terms of returns for shareholders our competitors in terms of TSR.
and no better than matching the retail prices index RPI in terms of earnings per share growth EPS, We do not intend to change the fundamental design of our top 240 colleagues get no LTI payments: incentive schemes for 2008 but we do intend to change how we set performance levels and reward opportunities.
we deliver most of our incentive outcomes in HBOS shares and expect senior colleagues to maintain meaningful HBOS Why?
The dislocation in financial markets, prompted by the shareholdings: and sub-prime mortgage financial crisis, which began in the United States, has created changes in many of the economies in which we ensure that we have a clear correlation between overall the Group operates, particularly in the UK.
The Committee must reward, corporate performance and the interests of our ensure that, in what is anticipated to be a lower growth era, our shareholders, in both the short term and the long term.
incentives will continue to assist with the attraction, retention, engagement and motivation of all our colleagues.
We believe that we are at the forefront of our competitors in operating in such a robust and transparent remuneration We are therefore making some changes to the incentive environment.
Under our STI arrangements, we will continue to set really stretching targets but we will As was the case a year ago, the Committee has undertaken increase target incentives by a half.
This greater emphasis an assessment of remuneration policy, on this occasion on short term incentives re ects the challenge of setting over 2002-2007.
Its findings are much the same as a year ago: robust long term performance targets in the current turbulent no need for any change in our remuneration principles: strong financial markets.
Under our LTI arrangements, we will support for our policy and practice from shareholders generally: sustain target incentive payment opportunities but the regular and supportive dialogue with our major shareholders: performance targets for EPS and TSR have been altered so and belief that the incentives we provide create strong alignment as to better align them with market and Group expectations.
with shareholders interests and the Groups performance.

Speci cally on that latter point, looking back over those six The Committee will review these incentive structures again years since the inception of HBOS: before we launch the 2009 schemes, and that review will remain within our established remuneration principles described earlier our EPS has risen by 14% p. a.

In April 2006 service related pension accrual under final salary pension arrangements ceased for those whose pension interest then exceeded the Lifetime Allowance of 1.5m.
In broad 145 terms, this is equivalent to a maximum pension of 75,000 p. a. or such higher amount as had accrued by April 2006.
Similar cessations applied under money purchase pension arrangements.
Affected colleagues receive an annual nonpensionable cash allowance, payable monthly, in lieu of such service related pension accrual or money purchase pension contributions.
This cash allowance will not count as salary for the purposes of the incentive schemes.
Similar cessations took place in April 2007 and will take effect in April 2008 and in each subsequent April as more colleagues pension interests exceed the Lifetime Allowance applicable at that time.
