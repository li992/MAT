Valuation gains were 3.1 per cent for the Group in the first half of the year, offset by a fall of 9.1 per cent in the second half of the year.
Good valuation gains were achieved in the first half of the year in Central Europe in Poland, France and Belgium, driven mainly by development activity and some yield compression, with valuation gains of 9.1 per cent being reported overall.
In the second half of the year, there was a slight softening in valuation yields but development gains enabled us to maintain the portfolio valuation with a 0.2 per cent surplus being reported in Continental Europe.
The UK has experienced significant valuation deficits in the year, which are broadly in line with the monthly IPD UK industrial capital deficit of 9.6 per cent for the year 2006: 11.0 per cent growth.
Valuation gains of 2.1 per cent in the first half in the UK were offset by deficits of 11.3 per cent in H2.
Further analysis of the valuation gains and losses is provided in the Completed Investment Properties table on page 129.
For the first time in 2007 the Group had all its trading properties externally valued as of 31 December 2007.
The trading property portfolio had an unrecognised valuation surplus of 74.3 million at 31 December 2007, which we expect to realise as developments are completed and sold.
An impairment charge of 2.3 million 2006: nil relating to 100 per cent owned trading properties is offset against the profit on sale of trading properties and the remaining impairment provision of 1.6 million is reflected in the share of profits from joint ventures after tax.
