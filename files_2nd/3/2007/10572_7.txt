Legacy plans Long-term incentive plan LTIP Set out below are details of outstanding awards made to executive directors under the Companys LTIP.
No awards have been granted under the LTIP since 2003 and there is no intention to grant further awards.
The awards were conditional upon the Groups TSR performance over a three year period compared with a selected peer group.
Once shares have been allocated to the executive after the three year performance period, the executive is entitled to receive dividends in respect of those shares and to exercise voting rights but may not transfer or otherwise deal in those shares until a further two years have elapsed and he may be required to forfeit the shares if he ceases to be employed by the Company during that period.
After two years they will vest in his name.

This report was approved by the Board of directors and signed on its behalf by: Gill Barr Chair of the Remuneration Committee 19 February 2008 39 2007 DIRECTORS ART.
qxd 28 2 08 20:48 Page 40 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2007 Corporate governance statement Governance framework The Board recognises the importance of high standards of corporate governance and is committed to managing the Groups affairs in accordance with the principles of good governance set out in section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code.
A summary of how the Company has applied the principles of the Code is set out below.
The Board has considered the provisions of the Code and considers that it was substantially in compliance throughout the year ended 31 December 2007, save in respect of Code provision A.
3 which requires that at least half the Board, excluding the chairman, should comprise independent non-executive directors.
Since the retirement of Jack Lovell from the Board on 19 April 2007 this provision has been complied with.
Directors The Board commenced the year with an executive chairman, three further executive directors and four non-executive directors.
All of the non-executive directors were considered by the Board to be independent, with the exception of Jack Lovell.
Jack retired from the Board on 19 April 2007.
On 16 August 2007, Geraldine Gallacher was appointed to the Board.
Geraldine had previously been a non-executive director of the Company, stepping down in September 2004.
Having had no material dealings with the Company since that time, the Board is satisfied in regarding her as independent.
The Board therefore now comprises an executive chairman, three further executive directors and four independent non-executive directors.
The senior independent director is Bernard Asher.
Notwithstanding that Bernard has served on the Board for ten years, the Board is entirely satisfied with his continued independence of character and judgement.
The Board has a separate chairman and chief executive in line with Code provision A.
John Morgan as executive chairman takes responsibility for leading the Board and ensuring that it functions effectively and for the overall strategy of the Group whilst Paul Smith as chief executive is responsible for managing the business and critically assessing Group strategy.
The Board has set out and agreed a schedule that details their individual roles and responsibilities.
The Board considers that the balance of relevant experience amongst its members enables it to exercise effective leadership and control of the Group.
It also ensures that the decision making process cannot be dominated by any individual or small group of individuals.
An executive director may be released to serve as a non-executive director elsewhere provided that the Board is satisfied that the time commitment of such an appointment will not conflict with his duties to the Company.
During the year, the executive chairman assumed a new appointment as non-executive director of Newfound N. V. The articles of association of the Company require all directors to submit for election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting after his or her appointment and to re-election thereafter at least every three years.
Geraldine Gallacher, having been appointed during the year, will be submitting for election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
In addition John Morgan, Paul Whitmore, David Mulligan, Jon Walden and Gill Barr were last re-elected in 2005 and will be standing for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Bernard Asher, having been a non-executive director since 1998, is subject to annual reelection in accordance with the Code and will also stand for re-election.
Unusually, all of the non-executive directors will be standing for election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Geraldine Gallacher was invited back to the Board in particular for her experience of consulting in executive development and people skills, which the directors consider will add significant strength to the Board.
Gill Barr continues to make a valuable contribution to Board discussions, drawing on her retail and marketing background and Jon Walden with his experience, both as a chartered accountant and in roles within listed companies, continues to be an important member of the Board.
Following the annual evaluation of their performance, which included consideration of the fact that Jon Walden has now served for more than six years, the chairman is satisfied with their continued effectiveness and commitment to their roles.
Equally, Bernard Ashers tremendous breadth of experience from the senior positions he holds and has held in a number of listed companies and his wise counsel remains highly valued by the Board.
As required by the Code, the length of his service was considered carefully as part of his evaluation and his continued effectiveness and commitment to the role, as well as his independence of judgement, were established.
Board effectiveness Eleven scheduled meetings of the Board were held during the year.
The key purposes of the scheduled meetings were to review all significant aspects of the Groups activities, supervise the executive management and to make decisions in relation to those matters that are specifically reserved to the Board.
There is a formal schedule of these matters, which includes the approval of the Groups strategic plans, annual budget, significant capital expenditure and investment proposals, major projects, acquisitions and disposals, internal control arrangements and annual and interim results.
Other specific responsibilities are delegated to the Board committees described below and under the Groups delegated authorities.
qxd 28 2 08 20:48 Page 41 Corporate governance statement A formal agenda for each meeting is agreed with the chairman and is circulated well in advance of the meeting to allow time for proper consideration, together with relevant papers including key strategic, operational and financial information.
Attendance of individual directors during 2007 at scheduled Board meetings and at meetings of the remuneration, audit and nominations committees are set out below.

Jon Walden missed one board meeting and one audit committee meeting due to ill health.
Professional development and Board evaluation The Company provides training facilities for directors on first appointment and subsequently as necessary.
In particular, the directors have received guidance on the changes relevant to directors in the new Companies Act 2006.
The executive directors have been participating in a modular development programme being run for senior executives.
In addition, the Board receives regular presentations and briefings from the managing directors of the Groups divisions and the non-executive directors knowledge and understanding of the Groups operations is further developed through visits to the divisions operational sites.
There are agreed procedures by which directors are able to take independent professional advice, at the expense of the Company, on matters relating to their duties.
The directors also have access to the advice and services of the company secretary.
An evaluation was carried out of the Boards performance, and that of its committees and individual directors, during the year.
This took the form of an assessment form to be completed by each director followed by one-to-one meetings between the chairman and each director using the assessment form as the framework for the discussions.
The assessment form focussed on the effectiveness of the Board and scheduled Board and committee meetings and, in relation to individual directors, their continued contribution and commitment to the role.
The individual evaluation of the chairman was carried out by the senior non-executive director.
The chairman summarised the main themes and comments arising from the assessment forms and the meetings at a subsequent Board meeting and a number of actions were agreed.
Relations with shareholders The Company actively seeks to enter into dialogue with institutional shareholders whenever possible and encourages all shareholders to use the annual general meeting as an opportunity for effective communication with the Company.
The executive directors undertake a programme of communication with institutional shareholders at regular intervals and also meet with analysts covering the construction industry.
Written feedback from these meetings is distributed to members of the Board.
The senior non-executive director and the other non-executive directors are available to meet with shareholders to listen to their views.
Details of proxy votes submitted for all resolutions at general meetings, including proxy directions to withhold votes, are distributed at the meeting.
They are also available on the Companys website on the day before the meeting and after the meeting.
