 13 12 07 11:38 Page 22 Corporate Governance Introduction The Board recognises that good governance helps the business deliver its strategy, generate long-term shareholder value and minimise risk.
For the year under review the appropriate governance provisions are as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 the Combined Code.
The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance as set out in the Combined Code provisions, the Turnbull Report on Internal Control and appropriate best practice guidance issued by investor bodies.
Our corporate governance framework is directed in a manner which is responsible and in accordance with high standards of honesty, transparency and accountability.
The Board considers that this statement on governance provides the information to enable shareholders to evaluate how the provisions and principles of the Combined Code have been applied.
Statement by the directors on compliance with the Combined Code The Board is responsible for the policies and controls put in place to discharge the Companys responsibilities under the Combined Code.
These include, for example, a sound system of internal controls and risk management procedures designed to ensure the Companys policies achieve compliance.
Throughout the year ended 30 September 2007 the Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code and the principles of good governance.
The Company has also complied with the Smith Guidance on Audit Committees.
The Workings of the Board and its Committees The Board Role The Board is responsible to the Companys shareholders for the success of the Group and for its overall strategic direction, its values and its governance.
It provides the leadership necessary to enable the business objectives to be met whilst ensuring the obligations to its shareholders are safeguarded.
Composition For the year under review the Board comprised the Chairman, three executive directors and three independent non-executive directors.
The role of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct and separate and clear divisions of accountability and responsibility have been agreed by the Board, are set out in writing and operate effectively.
During the year the Board has again reviewed its composition and has concluded that its composition fully satisfies the requirements of the business and ensures proper governance of the Group.
There were no changes to the membership of the Board during the year.
The Chairman, Mr H V Reid, has primary responsibility for leadership of the Board, sets its agenda and devotes such time to his role as is necessary to properly discharge his duties.
He facilitates the effective engagement of the non-executive directors.
He is responsible, jointly with the Chief Executive, for the effective communication with the Companys shareholders and representation of the Group externally.
The Chief Executive, Mr G E Tuppen, has executive responsibility for executing the Groups strategy and development.
He leads the management of the Company in order to optimise long-term shareholder value by meeting key strategic and financial objectives.
The Board requires that all non-executive directors are free from any relationship with the executive management that could result in any conflict or affect their independent judgement.
The Board recognises that length of service can impact on the independence of a non-executive director and, having considered this, is satisfied that all non-executives remain independent in character and judgement for the purposes of the Combined Code.
The Board membership and that of its Committees is designed to ensure that no one individual or group dominates proceedings and that the wide variety of skills allows effective leadership across the Companys business activities.
22 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2007 14414 06 12 2007 Proof 6 144  13 12 07 11:38 Page 23 Corporate Governance The Board is satisfied that, as non-executive directors seeking re election, Mr A J Stewart and Mrs S E Murray continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment and time to their roles and duties.
In addition, given he is seeking re-election for a third three year term and in compliance with provision A.
7.2 of the Combined Code, the Board has rigorously reviewed the performance of Mr A J Stewart and concluded that his re-election is justified and beneficial to the business.
Biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 13 and 14.
Operation of the Board The Company has an effective Board which leads and controls the Company and is responsible to the shareholders for its proper management and its success.
The Board therefore provides entrepreneurial leadership, sets and monitors the Companys strategic aims, reviews management performance and examines major capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities.
The Board has established, and reviewed during the year, guidelines requiring that specific matters are reserved for a decision by the full Board.
This ensures that the Board maintains control over strategic, major financial and key operational issues.
Such matters include, for example, the approval of financial statements, material acquisitions and disposals of assets, risk management and governance policies.
All meetings of the Board are structured to allow open discussion by all directors and ensure full participation in the decision-making process.
Meetings and Attendance The Board held six scheduled meetings in the past year and is expected to hold a similar number of such meetings over its next financial year.
The Board can convene additional meetings as necessary to consider matters that are time critical.
In addition two separate Strategic Business Reviews are held off site annually at which high level strategic issues, such as future business direction and its financial and operational implications, are reviewed and debated.
These Strategic Business Reviews have a strong operational focus and also give the Board the opportunity to hear contributions from the senior management team.
All of the current directors attended all Board Meetings and the Strategic Business Reviews during the year.
Non-executive directors and the Senior Independent Director The non-executive directors complement the skills and experience of the executive directors and bring an independent judgement to the decision-making process at Board and Committee level.
Their role requires a time commitment in the order of 15 days per annum plus additional time as necessary to properly discharge their duties.
In terms of commitments outside of the Company, any material changes must be reported to and precleared with the Chairman.
The Company has appointed a Senior Independent Director whose role and responsibilities are clearly defined, set out in writing and agreed by the Board.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have any concerns that cannot be resolved through contact via normal channels.
In compliance with the Combined Code the Senior Independent Director met with the other non-executives during the year to discuss matters in a forum that did not include executive directors or the Chairman.
In addition, all of the non-executives including the Chairman met twice during the year without the executive directors being present to discuss in detail the matters which they believed to be relevant for the purposes of the Strategic Business Reviews, including key operational and financial issues, performance of the Chief Executive and overall feedback arising from the performance evaluation process.
Information and Training The Board and its committees are supplied with full and timely information which enables the proper discharge of their responsibilities.
All directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice at the Companys expense.
There is a formal written procedure concerning independent professional advice setting out clear guidelines which have been agreed by the Board.
The Company has arranged appropriate directors and officers liability insurance to provide cover in the event of legal action against its directors.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2007 23 14414 06 12 2007 Proof 6  13 12 07 11:38 Page 24 Corporate Governance The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and its committees and is responsible for advising the Chairman on matters of corporate governance, ensuring the good flow of information to the Board and its committees and between the non-executives and senior management.
The written responsibilities of the Company Secretary are available on the Companys website.
During the year the Board has reviewed the joint roles of Mr D C George as Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary.
As the Deputy Company Secretary reports direct to the Board and Chairman on governance issues, has full day-to-day responsibility for the Company Secretariat function within the Group and provides independent counsel to the non-executive directors, the Board is of the view that given this delegation of responsibilities that there is no compromise to the independence of the Company Secretary.
All new directors receive an appropriately tailored induction programme arranged to develop their knowledge and understanding of the Group and the key business issues, including social, environmental and ethical issues.
The training needs of each director are regularly reviewed and assessed by the Board.
Existing directors undertake such professional development as is necessary for them to carry out their duties as directors.
During the year the directors have, amongst other matters, received appropriate guidance on the material provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the implications for periodic financial reporting under the Transparency Directive.
Re-election of directors The Articles of Association of the Company require that any newly appointed directors will be subject to election at the next following Annual General Meeting and also that at least one-third of directors excluding those appointed to the Board during the year shall retire by rotation each year.
This is applied so that each director will submit themselves for election or re-election at regular intervals and at least once every three years.
The Board has determined that re-election of the Chairman and non-executive directors is not automatic and is subject to formal review and recommendation by the Nominations Committee and approval by Shareholders.
Board Committees In order to ensure effective leadership and governance the Board governs through clearly identified committees which have delegated powers to deal with specific aspects of the Companys affairs.
A summary of the operation of these committees is set out below.
All committees of the Board that are subject to the requirements of the Combined Code are chaired by an independent director or have a majority of independent directors as members.

This Committee comprises two executive directors, one of which must be the Chief Financial Officer.

A separate Monitoring Committee has been established to monitor compliance with UK Listing Principles including a policy based on the Model Code which cover the dealings in securities and applies to directors, persons discharging managerial responsibility and employee insiders.
6 of the Combined Code provides that the Board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors.
During the year the Company has internally undertaken a critical self assessment performance evaluation programme in accordance with this principle and has effectively evaluated the Board, its Committees and its individual directors, including the Chairman.
Board performance evaluation The process was led by the Chairman and all directors completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria.
The results of these questionnaires are compiled into a report by the Deputy Company Secretary and the Chairman presented the findings to the Board.
This years review found that the Boards performance continues to be effective and appropriate for the needs of the business.
In addition, the more operational stance taken at the Strategic Business Reviews provided valuable input into future business development and was welcomed by the Board.
Board Committee performance evaluation For the Board Committee performance evaluation process each Committee Chairman and Committee member completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria.
The results of these questionnaires were compiled into a report by the Deputy Company Secretary and the Chairman presented the findings to the Board.
This years review found that the Committees continued to fully support the Board, were of the right size and structure and concluded that the Committees fully utilised the overall working relationships and discussions between members.
Non-executive director performance evaluation This process was led by the Chairman and all non-executive directors completed a self-appraisal questionnaire in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria.
Each non-executive director then met on a confidential basis with the Chairman to review their questionnaire and to discuss matters in detail including any matters arising from the evaluation of the Board and Committee performance.
In addition, the Senior Independent Director met with the other non-executives without the Chairman being present to review the Chairmans performance.

This includes one-on-one meetings, presentations after the preliminary announcement for the year and the results for the half year and specific analyst presentations with feedback from the Companys brokers as necessary.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring, via the Company Secretary, that views of major shareholders are fed back to the Board on a regular basis.
The effectiveness of how shareholder views are communicated forms part of the annual Board performance evaluation process.
During the year information about the progress of the Company, including reports, regulatory announcements released through the London Stock Exchange and presentations, is made available simultaneously on its website so that shareholders have full access to material information.
Directors regularly receive copies of analyst reports and reports on movements in major shareholdings as well as key broker comments.
The Annual General Meeting, held in January each year, is the principal opportunity to encourage participation by private investors and procedures at such meetings are in accordance with the Combined Code.
The Chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 17 January 2008 can be found in the Notice of the meeting on pages 116 to 119.
The Notice is sent by first class post to Shareholders at least 20 working days before the Annual General Meeting and details of proxy votes for and against are made available after the result of hand votes.
In accordance with the Combined Code the Company has proposed in the Notice separate resolutions on each substantial matter.
Again this year the Company is, in line with relevant guidelines, offering shareholders a facility for electronic proxy voting and voting through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service.
The voting results are announced on the same day to the London Stock Exchange and on the Companys website.
The Company has adopted, pursuant to good investor practice, innovative ways of communicating with shareholders and has given shareholders the opportunity to register and receive shareholder communications, such as the report and accounts, the interim report and notices of meetings, electronically via the Internet rather than in paper form through the post.
In accordance with the new provisions introduced in the Companies Act 2006 and good environmental practice, the Company is seeking shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to expand the use of electronic and website communications in the future.

Internal Control The Board is responsible for the overall system of internal control for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness.
It carries out such a review at least annually covering all material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
An ongoing process on internal control has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the Group.
This process is reviewed regularly by the Board and, with advice from its Audit Committee, is satisfied that this meets the requirements of the guidance Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1999 and the Turnbull guidance.
The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Groups strategic objectives.
It should be recognised that such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
This process has been in place since the start of the financial year and up to the date of approval of the accounts.
The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are as follows: Regular Board meetings to consider a schedule of matters reserved for directors consideration.
The Board carries out an annual review of corporate strategy which includes a review of risks facing the business, and how these risks are monitored and managed on an ongoing basis within the organisation.
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
