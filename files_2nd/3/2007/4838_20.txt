Internal control In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull working party set out in Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, the Group has established and maintained a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control and for confirming that action has been taken to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses that have been identified.
This process, which is reviewed periodically by the Board, was in place throughout the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2007 and to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Regular review of progress against targets was instrumental in identifying the fraud in FotoVista, which related to weaknesses in that companys purchase to pay and supply chain areas, as well as facilitating the creation of actions to remedy the related systems and controls issues.
Responsibility and accountability The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness and the Groups approach to risk management.
The Board delegates to executive management the day to day responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks facing the Groups operations, and for implementing and maintaining internal control systems that manage those risks in an efficient and effective manner, appropriate to their nature and scale.
Senior management is responsible and accountable for internal control and risk management and for ensuring compliance with the Groups policies and procedures.
DSG international plc 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Governance Corporate Governance Report continued Inherent limitations and continuous improvement In determining its policies on internal control, the Board has regard to the materiality of the relevant risks, the likelihood of losses occurring and the costs of control.
The directors are aware that the inherent limitations in any system of control mean that risk cannot be totally eliminated.
It follows that the Groups system of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate, rather than remove, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
The Groups approach to managing and monitoring internal control and risk assessment is regularly reviewed to identify ways in which it can be improved and further embedded throughout the Groups operations.
Where significant weaknesses are identified, these are investigated fully using appropriate internal resources and, where deemed necessary, engaging external expertise.
Detailed plans are drawn to remedy the weaknesses, and progress is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Control environment and control activities In addition to the corporate governance structure described above, the Groups system of internal control and processes for managing risk comprise the following main elements: the Board and management committees meet regularly to monitor progress against the targets set out in the Groups budget and strategic three year plan and to consider the quarterly re-forecasts of the Groups expected financial period end position.
Financial and non-financial performance reports are produced daily, weekly and four weekly to facilitate this review process: the defined lines of authority established by the Board ensure that significant decisions are taken at an appropriate level: these include requirements for the approval and control of both capital and operating expenditure, treasury operations and cash management: each business function has established procedures and controls to minimise the risk of fraud and to safeguard the Groups assets: appropriate controls and procedures have been established over the security of data held on, and functionality provided by, the Groups business systems.
These include disaster recovery arrangements.
The computer systems are periodically tested and reviewed by both internal and external audit functions: the Group appoints individuals who are of a calibre to enable them to discharge the duties and responsibilities of the roles assigned to them.
Established performance review and development mechanisms exist to identify key objectives and areas for improvement for each member of staff.
Succession planning forms an integral part of HR management: Group Treasury operates within established and documented policies and procedures.
The policies are described in the Directors Report on pages 37 and 38 and are reviewed and approved annually by the Group Executive Committee: the Groups programme of insurance covers the material risks to the Groups assets and business and is reviewed annually by the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee: all entities within the Group are required to adhere to common standards of internal control and corporate governance, which are specified in documented guidance: and post completion assessments are carried out following major acquisitions.
Assurance and monitoring Senior management under the direction of the Board is responsible for maintaining the appropriate internal control systems and for managing risk at an operational level.
The Board conducts an annual evaluation of the management of risk and the processes of internal control and has established a monitoring framework consisting of the functions set out below.
Audit Committee The Audit Committee seeks ongoing assurance that the control environment and activities described above are operating effectively and reports regularly to the Board.
The Audit Committees review of the effectiveness of the internal controls is formally reported to the Board on an annual basis.
46 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Governance Internal audit The internal audit department is fully independent of business operations and has a Group-wide mandate.
Their work is driven by a risk-based methodology ensuring that the controls to mitigate the Groups key risks are audited on a regular basis.
Its plans are approved by the Audit Committee, which also receives regular reports on its findings and progress of related actions.
External audit The external auditors provide further independent observations on certain elements of the internal financial controls as part of their audit of the financial statements and their findings are presented to the Audit Committee.
Corporate responsibility The Group operates a Corporate Responsibility CR Committee, chaired by the Group HR Director, which meets at least four times annually.
The Group Finance Director is the Board member with specific responsibility for social, environmental, ethical and other CR-related matters.
The CR Committee assists the Board in identifying reputational and other risks arising from the conduct of the Groups businesses.
It makes recommendations on measurement tools and audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of systems for managing CR-related matters.
All Board members receive regular updates on CR issues, risks and opportunities.
Further information on Corporate Responsibility is given on pages 24 to 29 and on the corporate responsibility section of the corporate website.
Compliance The directors consider that the Company has throughout the period complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
