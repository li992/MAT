Corporate governance report In relation to compliance with the Combined Code this report together with the Directors report states the position at 5 March 2008.
The Combined Code compliance statement The revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code was issued in June 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council FRC and applies for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
Explanations of how the Code principles and supporting principles have been applied are set out in the Governance sections of the report and accounts.
The directors believe the Company was in compliance with Section 1 of the Code throughout the year with the following two exceptions: Independence of the chairman on appointment The chairman did not, on appointment, meet the independence criteria set out in the Code since he had been an employee and executive director of the Company since 1995.
Composition of the Board There are currently 15 directors of which six 40% are independent non-executive directors.
The Code requires that at least half the board excluding the chairman, should be independent non-executive directors.
The number of senior practitioners from within the operating subsidiaries on the Board does result in a sizeable number of executive directors, making the achievement of the Code target difficult.
Board meetings The Board meets a minimum of seven times per annum with one meeting devoted entirely to strategic issues.
In months where no formal board meeting is scheduled, an informal meeting of the non-executive directors and the chairman and chief executive is held.
The non-executive directors have regular, informal meetings without the chairman or chief executive present.
Board membership The Board currently consists of a non-executive chairman, seven executive directors and seven other non-executive directors.
The roles of chairman, Mark Powell, and chief executive, Andy Pomfret, are separated and are clearly defined in writing and agreed by the Board.

The Board considers that six of the eight non-executive directors are independent, the exceptions being Mark Powell as explained above and John May who is a director of a major shareholder, Caledonia Investments plc.
The non-executive directors participate fully with their executive colleagues in Board meetings and have access to any information they need to perform their duties.
They bring an independent judgement to bear on Group policies and strategies as well as management actions and performance, including resourcing and standards of conduct.
The senior independent non-executive director is Giles Coode-Adams.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its attention, which covers key areas of the Groups business.
These include determination of the Groups aims and the strategy to be adopted in achieving those aims, reviews of budgets and financial statements, company acquisitions and disposals, major capital expenditure and the review of decisions taken by the boards of subsidiary companies.
