The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Company for the year.
The Directors consider that in preparing the financial statements on pages 105 to 113 the Company has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards that they consider to be applicable have been followed, subject to any explanations and any material departures disclosed in the notes to the accounts.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records that disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the Company and that enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps, as are reasonably open to them and which they deem appropriate to safeguard the assets of the Company and to seek to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
