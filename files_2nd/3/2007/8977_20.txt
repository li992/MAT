125 Technical description of facilities KAZAKHMYS COPPER ZHEZKAZGAN COMPLEX The Zhezkazgan underground mines continue in normal operation, with mines at Annensky, West, East, South and Stepnoy.
The South mine has fully recovered after operations were affected by water ingress during 2007.
It is planned to extend the life of the oldest mine, West mine, by bringing in additional reserves at the mine fringes.
Equipment and ore handling upgrades are taking place at a number of these mines to maintain operational ef ciency.
All underground mines at the Zhezkazgan Complex utilise fully-mechanised room-and-pillar methods with pillar extraction.
The North group of open pit mines includes the Akchi Spassky mine and the Zhilandy group of small open pits.
Waste stripping continues at Akchi Spassky where production of ore is planned to recommence in 2009.
Site works are being prepared within the pit for a new decline to access Akchi Spassky underground reserves.
Zhilandy ore production is currently being undertaken at the Kipshakpay and the East and West Sary-Oba pits.
Ore production will recommence at the Karashoshak mine early in 2008 where stripping operations are currently under way.
These smaller open pits begin to phase out from 2008 onwards, and a number of underground projects have been designed to continue production from this area.
Construction of a new underground access at East Sary-Oba has commenced.
Waste stripping operations will start at the Itauz pit in early 2008 with ore production beginning later in the year.
Construction of a series of small open pits commenced in November 2007 to reclaim pillars at the defunct Kresto mine, near the South mine.
To the south of Zhezkazgan is the Zhomart underground mine, where mechanised room and pillar mining is employed.
Improvements to the underground ore handling system and mine power supply are taking place.
Near Zhomart is the new Taskura open pit mine where stripping operations commenced at the end of 2007.
Ore production will commence during 2008.
A new rail link is under construction to link Taskura with the existing railway to Zhezkazgan.
Ore from the Zhezkazgan and Zhomart operations feeds the Satpayev and two Zhezkazgan concentrators, the concentrates from which are processed at the Zhezkazgan smelter and re nery to produce copper cathodes.
Re nery slimes, containing precious metals, are sent to the Balkhash Complex for further processing.
Kazakhmys LLC also produces sulphuric acid at its Zhezkazgan Complex.
BALKHASH COMPLEX The Kounrad pit is currently undergoing a waste push back, with only limited amounts of ore are being produced.
It is proposed that the pit will gradually return to increased production levels over the next few years, once a decision has been made to re-equip the operation.
At the Sayak I underground mine, a fully-mechanised multi-lift room and pillar method is in use, with sub-level caving in the more steeply dipping areas.
Ore from the Kounrad and Sayak mines is railed to the Balkhash concentrator.
At Shatyrkul, continuous retreat sub-level caving is in use.
Further mine accesses will be built alongside to enable operations to continue here at current rates of production.
Ore is transported by rail from Shatyrkul to Balkhash, but there are plans to build a small concentrator at the site to reduce transport costs.
The Balkhash concentrator also processes ore from the Nurkazgan open pit operations.
Concentrates from the Balkhash concentrator are processed at the Balkhash smelter and re nery complex to produce copper cathodes and a small quantity of copper wire.
The Balkhash smelter and re nery also process copper concentrates from the East Region operations.
The Balkhash zinc plant treats zinc concentrates from East Region mines.
Design upgrades are planned to enable this plant to produce nished zinc at an increased rate.
Gold and silver-bearing slimes from the re neries tankhouse operations are processed in the Balkhash precious metals plant.
A new acid plant is under construction at Balkhash, which will process waste gases from the smelter.
The plant was expected to be complete during 2007, but a re during commissioning has delayed this project.
Completion is now expected during 2008.
Acid will be sold to third parties and used within the Group.
EAST REGION In the East Region, Orlovsky uses a horizontal cut-andll method with cemented rock ll, enabling full recovery of the ore.
Ore is processed at an adjacent concentrator.
At Artemyevsky, mechanised open stoping is used with cemented ll to enable pillar recovery.
Additional ll plant capacity has been built and hoisting upgrades will further improve operations here.
The smaller Belousovsky, and Irtyshsky mines both employ shrinkage stoping, and in some areas of the Belousovsky mine, mechanised room-and-pillar methods are used.
Ore from these mines is processed at a concentrator adjacent to each site.
At  mine, sub-level caving is used.
Ore from this site is treated at both the Belousovsky and Nikolayevsky concentrators.
Nikolayevsky underground mine has been developed below the open pit.
Ore is being produced from a series of open stopes and a second production level is currently under construction.
An access decline into the adjacent North Nikolayevsky deposit is planned to commence during 2008, prior to a production decision being made.
Artemyevsky and Nikolayevsky ore is trucked and railed to the Nikolayevsky concentrator, with some Artemyevsky polymetallic ore being processed by third parties.
Kosmurun ore is also treated at Nikolayevsky.
Upgrades to the Nikolayevsky concentrator have improved production levels here.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 126 Technical description of facilities continued KARAGANDA REGION At Nurkazgan, operations in the West open pit are due to nish in 2008, and ore mining in the re-established North pit commenced in January 2008.
Both open pits employ conventional truck and shovel operations.
Construction of an underground mine beneath West pit is under way, and new access declines are well advanced.
Construction of new ventilation shaft has commenced.
Ore production will commence during the latter half of 2008 with full production in 2009.
Sub level caving will be used.
Ore from Nurkazgan is currently being railed to Balkhash, but a new concentrator has been built at Nurkazgan and is due for commissioning in the first half of 2008, with full operations in the latter half of the year.
Some ore at Nurkazgan is being stockpiled at site to feed this new concentrator.
The Kosmurun open pit will be completed during 2008, and operations will continue at the nearby Akbastau open pit, where stripping commenced during 2007.
The first ore was mined in January 2008.
Conventional truck and shovel methods are used at both of these pits, and ore is trucked to the Karagaily site.
Kosmurun ore is railed on to the Nikolayevsky concentrator plant, and Akbastau ore is treated at Karagaily.
A new concentrator is planned at the Kosmurun site to treat Akbastau open pit ore and, eventually, ore from the planned underground mine at Kosmurun.
Waste stripping operations took place at the Abyz open pit during 2007, and ore mining recommenced in January 2008.
Ore from Abyz is trucked and railed to the Karagaily concentrator for treatment.
Karagaily copper and zinc concentrates are railed to the Balkhash smelter.
Operations at the Kuu-Chekinsky and Molodezhny open pit coal mines continued normally during 2007.
Equipment upgrades are planned for 2008.
Coal produced is used within Kazakhmys LLC for heating and power generation and is also sold to third parties.
The Boschekul project has reached the pre-feasibility stage, and the study is due by the end of 2008.
The concept is a large open pit mine and concentrator.
The pre-feasibility study for the Aktogay deposit is looking initially at the oxide resources, with a number of treatment concepts under review.
A decision on the mining of the larger sulphide resources will be taken later.
A power line to this site is under construction and is due for completion in 2008.
A railway is also under construction and due for completion in 2008 09.
KAZAKHMYS GOLD Kazakhmys Gold operates three open pit mines in Kazakhstan Mizek, Central Mukur and Zhaima.
All of these mines currently operate conventional shovel and truck open pit mining technology.
The Mizek mine consists of two operational pits.
At Central Mukur, several small open pits are operated, while at the Zhaima mine, two pits are operated.
Heap leaching is used to extract the gold from the ore.
The Mizek mine operates a carbon-in-pulp hydrometallurgical plant, while the Central Mukur mine and Zhaima mine operate resin-in-pulp processes for extracting the gold from the solution.
An electrowinning operation is carried out at the Mizek site for the Mizek mine and electrowinning operations for the Central Mukur mine and the Zhaima mine are located in Semey.
Calcine received from both electrowinning operations is then dispatched to a final re ning stage in Switzerland.
At the Mizek mine a copper extraction plant was commissioned in November 2007 in order to remove copper impurities disturbing the gold leaching process from the solution, and to recover cyanide consumed by copper leaching.
During this cleaning process a copper concentrate is produced as a side product, which is currently being sold to third parties.
Currently all three operating mines of Kazakhmys Gold are mining oxide ores.
For the Mizek mine a pre-feasibility study for mining primary resources located underneath the oxide ore is being prepared.
The study is scheduled to be nished in mid 2008.
Kazakhmys Gold holds licenses for two additional properties, the Akjilga silver project in Tajikistan and the Bozymchak copper-gold project in Kyrgyzstan.
For the Bozymchak project a pre-feasibility study is being prepared and is due for completion in mid 2008.
If the pre-feasibility study demonstrates favourable results, a feasibility study is planned for 2008.
Based on preliminary planning work, the Bozymchak project would be mined with a combination of open pit and underground methods.
The Akjilga project is located in the east of Tajikistan in an area with elevations above 4,000 m. In 2008 there is additional exploration work scheduled.
The Akjilga project would be a predominantly underground operation, if construction goes ahead in the future.

KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 133 Mining reserves and resources KAZAKHMYS COPPER RESERVES AND RESOURCES ESTIMATION METHODS The Republic of Kazakhstan has incorporated by law the classi cation system and estimation methods for reserves and resources established by the Former Soviet Union FSU and later revised in 1981.
In practice, this means that the statements of reserves and resources developed by Kazakhmys LLC and the mining plans to which they relate must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for which adherence to the standardised national system of reserves and resources estimation is mandatory.
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves were prepared by the corresponding National Design Institute and were approved within the national formerly USSR state plan.
The Conditions apply a well-fide ned process of classifying the speci c deposit into one of five major deposit categories, subject to which, the principles for exploration and classi cation of reserves and resources have been established.
The Conditions for Estimation of Reserves for each deposit specify the method of computation of reserve blocks, the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present dif culties.
Reserves and resources have been estimated by Kazakhmys LLC according to the FSU Classi cation and Estimation Methods for Reserves and Resources.
It is apparent that there is now more scope than before for exibility and discussion with state authorities with respect to ore reserve estimation methods.
This has been re ected in the steps taken by Kazakhmys LLC to prepare the records and reserves development plans for the Zhezkazgan mines as  CAD les and to use these as the basis for revised estimation of reserves volumes and to support improved estimation of ore grades.
IMC recognises this as an important step to achieve veri able and internally consistent estimates.
Related initiatives are the current evaluation of a number of industry-standard resource modelling software systems, particularly for the Zhezkazgan operations, and also the resource modelling in progress in conjunction with project design and evaluation for the new major projects in the Balkhash Complex, at Aktogay and Boschekul.
IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statements of Kazakhmys LLC and has restated the reserves and resources in accordance with the criteria required to meet JORC standards.
As a general rule, in situ tonnages quoted as balance reserves under the national system, and which meet criteria for categories of con dence and which can be considered to have the potential for future economic extraction, are assessed as resources.
The Kazakhmys LLC internal reporting system derives from these resources a category designated commercial reserves, on which production planning is based, estimated only from active resources to which modifying factors for losses and dilution are applied: these estimates form the basis for the process of restatement of reserves in accordance with JORC compliant criteria.
All reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution.
Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are inclusive of reserves.
All gures in reserves and resources are in metric tonnes and are dated 31 December 2007.

KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 140 Mining reserves and resources continued KAZAKHMYS COPPER CHANGES IN MINING RESERVES AND RESOURCES The total measured and indicated resources of Kazakhmys Copper have decreased during 2007 to a total of 2,878 MT, as compared with 2,906 MT at 31 December 2006.
Reasons for the changes by Complex Region are shown below.
Changes in reserves and resource totals for the mining operational regions are summarised in the tables below.
Reserves Resources Ore Loss Dilution.
2 Figures quoted as at 31 December 2006 are as per the 2006 Annual Report and do not include subsequent revisions made by Kazakhmys during 2007.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 141 The decrease in total Kazakhmys copper proven and probable reserves of 19.6 MT during 2007 is signi cantly less than the draw-down of reserves generated by the annual production of some 34.0 MT of ore and re ects a signi cant addition to the reserve base during 2007.
This addition is almost exclusively due to the incorporation of new reserves in the Zhezkazgan Complex.
In the other production regions of Kazakhmys LLC decrease in the reserves base is essentially a re ection of depletion in line with production.
In the Zhezkazgan Complex, Kazakhmys LLC has undertaken a detailed re-estimation of resources and reserves linked to the completion during 2007 of the transfer of all reserve estimation plans to electronic format.
As part of this process the two most important changes are the inclusion of a signi cant reserves tonnage in the category of reserves recovered from losses, which refers to pillars previously written off as losses, and also as a separate exercise, a more rigorous system of calculating ore grade from drillhole intersections.
The principal changes in reserves totals for each of the production regions are summarised below.
ZHEZKAZGAN COMPLEX The total of proven and probable reserves shows an increase of 2.3 MT over the year, during which ore production of 24.4 MT is estimated to have caused a corresponding depletion in reserves.
During 2007 there were important increases in the resources and reserves at some individual underground mines in the Zhezkazgan Complex ore eld due to the results of continuing exploration and as in previous years there were exchanges of packages of reserves between adjacent mines.
However, the biggest impact is due to the incorporation of reserves recovered from losses, which have been identi ed as part of the re-estimation exercise.
The largest change in the resource base at individual mines was at the South mine, where the re-estimation exercise upgraded 9.2 MT of resources from inactive to active status and new additional resources comprised 5.8 MT through the inclusion of new areas and the recovery of pillars plus a further 2.1 MT of resources due largely to transfers from Stepnoy mine, such that after allowance for depletion by production in 2007 at 6.2 MT, the year-on-year change of the resource base at the mine showed an increase of 20.1 MT.
The East mine gained 5.1 MT of measured and indicated resources from the inclusion of new areas and the recovery of pillars and after exchanges with adjacent mines, and the re-estimation exercise has restated 1.7 MT of resources to active status and permitted the fide nition of additional 7.2 MT of inferred resources: after allowance for depletion of resources of 6.7 MT due to production in 2007 the year-on-year change of the resource base at the mine showed an increase of 0.8 MT.
Four of the underground Zhezkazgan mines each report resource and reserve tonnages with very little change over the year reserves: Annensky -1.1 MT: East 0.6 MT: Stepnoy 0.2 MT: West -0.1 MT.
This indicates that the net effect of changes in resource and reserve tonnages has been to incorporate new reserves largely equivalent to depletion at these mines due to production.
Exploration of new orebodies continued adjacent to Annensky and East mines, resulting in the incorporation of an additional 1.0 MT of resources at Annensky.
The re-estimation exercise for the underground mines of the Zhezkazgan Complex ore eld has included an improved methodology for the estimation of ore grade from drillhole intersections which weights the grade of an area not only by the drillhole intersections but by the cut-off value of 0.4% at the margin of each area.
This has resulted in signi cantly lower grades attributed to areas of in situ resources, and the revised grades can be seen to minimise the previously recognised discrepancy between actual grades experienced in production and the anomalously high values attributed to resources.
The lowering of the ore grades in reported reserves is most signi cant in the three mines: at the East mine the revised grade of 0.66% copper for the reported reserves, as opposed to 0.91% copper in 2006, gives rise to a fall of 26.7% contained copper in reserves over the year although reserves tonnage increases by 1%: at the Stepnoy mine the revised grade of 0.63% copper, as opposed to 0.76% copper in 2006, gives rise to a fall of 17% contained copper in reserves although tonnage remains unchanged: at the South mine the revised grade of 0.62% copper, as opposed to 0.69% copper is re ected in a rise of 16% contained copper, while the reported reserves tonnage increased 29%.
In contrast, no signi cant change in reported ore grade occurred at the Annensky and West mines.
In the Zhilandy area the resources and reserves for the various underground prospects and the East Sary-Oba mine development have been reviewed and in particular the resource category for tonnage designated a C balance reserve.
It has been considered most 2 appropriate that these should be considered inferred resources under JORC criteria.
This has given rise to a corresponding decrease of 13.6 MT in estimated proven and probable reserves for this group as compared to gures quoted for the previous exercise as at 31 December 2006.
For the North mine operations, Kazakhmys LLCs re-estimation exercise increased the resource base in already known areas by 2.4 MT, including a small amount of previously non-inventory inferred resources: overall this exercise fide ned an increased copper grade across the deposits.
Exploration during 2007 has permitted the fide nition of an additional 1.8 MT of resources, such that after allowance for depletion of 2.4 MT due to production in 2007, the year-on-year change in the resource base of this mining unit showed an increase of 1.8 MT.
With respect to reserves the relatively larger year-on-year increase of 3.1 MT, re ects that resources have been converted to reserves for small open pits in the Zhezkazgan area which previously had been reported in the total for Akchi Spassky Pit.
As in previous estimates, of the very large total of indicated resources for Akchi Spassky Pit, planned for extraction over a long time interval extending beyond 2015, only 50% of the total has been converted to probable reserves, re ecting the level of fide nition of long term planning for this pit.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 142 Mining reserves and resources continued BALKHASH COMPLEX The total of measured and indicated resources for this Complex shows a decrease of 2.3 MT, which is closely correlated to depletion due to production.
However, the total of proven and probable reserves indicates a decrease over the same period of 17.0 MT.
This is due to a more rigorous application of criteria for conversion of resources to reserves at the Shatyrkul and Sayak mines.
In common with what is now standard practice, the mine units present an annual memoir of detailed plans and estimates of resource depletion only for those resources scheduled for extraction in the new annual plan.
A consequence is that there is apparent modi cation or lack of plans for those resources which are least well fide ned and more distant from current operations, corresponding to the C balance reserves 2 under the national system.
Review of proposed production plans for both the Shatyrkul and Sayak operations indicates that it is correct that C balance reserves remain allocated to indicated resources, but that lack of fide nition of commercial production strategy for such 2 resources dictates that they should be excluded from the probable reserves category.
In the process of detailed development planning, no changes to resource and reserves categories for the major Aktogay and Boschekul projects have been formulated with the state authorities.
No changes in resources and reserves totals for these projects have been introduced.
EAST REGION During 2007, the Akbastau mine was re-assigned to the Karaganda Region.
After allowing for the removal of the Akbastau resources and reserves, the overall decrease in measured and indicated resources is 4.0 MT with respect to the restated resource totals as at 31 December 2006.
At Nikolayevsky there has been a re-estimation of reserves resulting in an increased assessment of grade and contained metal and an adjustment of the reserves base attributed as at the beginning of 2007.
The re-stated year-on-year decrease of 4.0 MT closely re ects depletion due to production during 2007.
A corresponding re-statement of proven and probable reserves is re ected in the year-on-year decrease of 2.5 MT: this is disproportionately less than the decrease in resources and re ects developments at Artemyevsky and Nikolayevsky mines.
At Artemyevsky the current reserve estimate indicates that the reserves total at 31 December 2006 was understated in respect of C balance reserves which had not been 2 converted to JORC compliant probable reserves but which, during 2007, had been incorporated in mine development plans and extraction.
Depletion of reserves due to production in 2007 was 4.2 MT, which when compared with the year-on-year decrease of 2.5 MT indicates that the reserves base of the East Region mines in 2007 experienced an increment of 1.6 MT, primarily due to re-evaluation of currently accessed resource areas, in conjunction with some minor reductions experienced at Belousovsky and Irtyshsky mines as a result of on-going exploration.
KARAGANDA REGION With respect to the change in quoted reserves between the end of 2006 and end of 2007, the overall increase in proven and probable reserves of 9.6 MT is entirely due to the inclusion of the Akbastau project.
At the Kosmurun and Nurkazgan mines, the decrease in total reserves closely re ects depletion due to production in 2007.
At the Abyz mine stripping works were only performed in 2007, with the exception of the extraction of a bulk sample for metallurgical testwork.
The decrease in proven and probable coal reserves approximates the depletion due to extraction in the 12 month period.
KAZAKHMYS GOLD RESERVES AND RESOURCES ESTIMATION METHODS Following international convention, the Kazakhmys Gold resources reported in this document are in situ estimates, while the reserves make due allowance for mining recovery and dilution, based on actual operational experience.
Resources are inclusive of reserves.
The proved reserves and measured resources at Mizek are based on JORC fide nitions and not restricted to ore that has been exposed or is in the process of development within a three-year plan, as is the case in the other Kazakhmys reserves reported in this document.
BOZYMCHAK The Bozymchak indicated and inferred resources are based on two estimates: a C and C sectional estimate of the central deposit 1 2 made in November 2007 using a 0.6% copper equivalent cut-off grade: and an earlier datamine estimate made in December 2006, that used separate gold and copper cut-off grades and included the smaller West, East and Davan deposits that are peripheral to the Central Deposit.
MIZEK The Mizek reserves and resources are divided into three ore types: oxide, transition and sulphide, which are estimated at different gold equivalent cut-off grades oxide 0.5 g t, transition 2.0 g t and sulphide 3.0 g t. The reserves and resources are based on two historic datamine estimates, with due allowance being made for subsequent mining production up to the end of 2007.
The first estimate January 2007 only recognised oxide and primary sulphide ore types while the second April 2007 was an optimised open pit estimate that recognised oxide, semi-oxide and primary sulphide ore types.
AKJILGA The Akjilga inferred resources are based on C resources reported by the Tajikgeology State Agency in 1994.
They have been slightly 2 reduced since the state agencys estimate assumed greater ore body persistence in depth than would be prudent to assume for inferred resources.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 143 MUKUR The Mukur reserves and resources are based on a FSU sectional estimate made in 2003, which recognised C and C categories 1 2 and used a 0.5 g t gold cut-off grade.
Due allowance has been made for subsequent mining production up to the end of 2007.
ZHAIMA The Zhaima reserves and resources are based on a FSU sectional estimate made in January 2007, which recognised C and C 1 2 categories and used a 0.5 g t gold cut-off grade.
2 Gold equivalent ounces have been calculated based on the following prices: copper $2,756 per tonne, gold $561 per ounce and silver $10.20 per ounce.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 144 IMC Group Consulting Limited REVISION OF RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT TO 31 DECEMBER 2007 IMC Group Consulting Ltd IMC has undertaken a review of the reserves and resources estimates prepared by Kazakhmys PLC the Company, as the basis for the preparation of a Statement of Reserves and Resources as at 31 December 2007.
Following the acquisition of the Kazakhmys Gold assets formerly known as Eurasia Gold by the Company during 2007, IMC have included statements of reserves and resources and technical descriptions in this report.
In the interests of clarity these recently acquired assets have been referred to as the Kazakhmys Gold assets.
The mines and other facilities that constituted Kazakhmys LLC prior to this acquisition by the Company have been referred to as the Kazakhmys Copper assets.
The Statement of Reserves and Resources is restated in accordance with the criteria of the Australasian Code for Reporting Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004, published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and collaborating institutions the JORC Code.
IMC is satis ed, from the review undertaken, that the recently revised estimates of reserves and resources prepared by the Company is in accordance with the reserve classi cation system required by law in the Republic of Kazakhstan and that, correspondingly, the estimates have a consistent basis for expressing the degree of con dence for stating quantities of exploitable ore at speci c grades of metal content.
On the basis of the estimates supplied by the Company, IMC has applied the same criteria as expressed in the Competent Persons Report at the time of Listing for preparation of the restatement of reserves and resources as at 31 December 2007, in accordance with the reporting criteria of the JORC code.
In the previous Statement of Resources and Reserves prepared by IMC as at 31 December 2006, for the mature copper mining operations, the potential ambiguity in earlier statements for the distinction of the categories of measured and indicated resources and correspondingly proven and probable reserves was reviewed.
For that statement the policy was introduced that the category of measured resource will be restricted to that ore which has been exposed or is in the process of development within the rolling three-year forward operations plan as formally reported to the State Reserves Committee.
This policy has again been adopted for the present statement for Kazakhmys Copper operations as at 31 December 2007.
