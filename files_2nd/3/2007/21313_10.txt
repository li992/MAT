The decrease in these ratios reflected a change in the mix of credit risk loans and potential credit risk loans: unsecured retail exposures, where the recovery outlook is relatively low, decreased as a proportion of the total as the collections and underwriting processes were improved.
Secured retail and wholesale and corporate exposures, where the recovery outlook is relatively high, increased as a proportion of credit risk loans and potential credit risk loans.
Allowance coverage of ABS CDO Super Senior credit risk loans was low relative to allowance coverage of other credit risk loans since substantial protection against loss is also provided by subordination and hedges.
On ABS CDO Super Senior exposures, the combination of subordination, hedging and writedowns provide protection against loss levels to 72% on US sub-prime collateral as at 31st December 2007.
Note a Does not reflect the application of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 which became effective from 1st January 2005.
