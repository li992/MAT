Dignity plc is also required to explain how it has applied the principles set out in the Code.
This Directors Statement on Corporate Governance and the Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 30 to 41 provide a description of how the main and supporting principles of the Code have been applied within Dignity plc during 2010.

Peter Hindley is not regarded as independent under provision A.
The Board also recognises that the Code has been superseded by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 Code that was published in June 2010 and applicable for periods beginning on or after 29 June 2010.

The Directors have put in place an organisation structure appropriate to the size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority where the Board considers it necessary and appropriate: Internal audit The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Chief Executive.
It coordinates the completion of selfassessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control weakness or exposure.
Internal audit reviews are completed on such areas together with selected areas of the head office function and any area where an Executive Director requests a review.
During 2010 as in 2009, there were quarterly meetings between the Head of Internal Audit and the Executive Directors to formally review and discuss Internal Audits work programme and findings.

The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at every meeting: Procedures The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its operations, both client facing and in support departments.
These provide clear guidance on the correct or most appropriate course of action in various circumstances.
Procedures are supplemented by training where needs have been identified.
Both Internal Audit and a comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such processes and procedures.
