Corporate governance Compliance Corporate governance has been and remains the responsibility of the whole Board.
This statement describes how the Company applies the principles and complies with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in June 2008 the Combined Code, which applied to the Company in respect of the financial year ended 31st December 2010 and is publicly available at www.
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require UK listed companies to report on the manner in which they apply the Combined Code.
The Board considers that, subject to the ratio of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, the Company met the requirements of the Combined Code throughout the year ended 31st December 2010.
The Board assesses on an ongoing basis its practices to ensure continued compliance with the Combined Code and has allocated responsibility for compliance to appropriate Directors or officers.
Contact has been made with major shareholders to allow discussion of the Companys governance policy and strategy with the Chairman and four major shareholders availed themselves of the opportunity to meet the Chairman.
Board composition and procedures During the year the Board comprised the Non-Executive Chairman, three independent Non-Executive Directors, including a Senior Independent Director, and five Executive Directors, details of whom are set out on pages 26 and 27.
The positions of Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director were held by separate individuals.
There is a clear written division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The ratio of Executive to Non-Executive Directors is currently considered to be the best structure for the Company.
The Board is responsible for the Groups business operations and five Executive Directors are present on the Board in order to provide first-hand information and contributions to the running of the business.
The Executive Directors control the Groups devolved management structure, which requires local management initiative across the Groups global spread of operating companies, its broad product range and wide customer base.
Board membership of the Executives is key to the overall management of the Group, which employs a relatively flat management structure.
This also provides the Non-Executive Directors with regular direct access to the full Executive management team.
The Company views this to be a very appropriate and successful mix: appointing additional Non-Executive Directors would make the Board more cumbersome and would not add to the quality of the Boards performance.
The divisional structure will be retained with regional general managers providing support in each of the divisions.
The Board applies an appropriate policy in the recruitment of independent Non-Executive Directors to meet the particular requirements of the Board.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has a letter of appointment which meets the requirements of the Combined Code.
The Non-Executive Directors all have, or have had, senior executive experience and offer independent judgement on Board matters.
The Non-Executive Directors of the Company, including the Chairman, do not participate in any bonus, share option or share ownership schemes and their appointments are non-pensionable.
The Board met seven times in the year to consider strategic developments and to review trading results and operational and business issues.
All Directors attended all meetings either in person or by telephone in 2010, with the exception of Mr G Bullock who was unavailable for one meeting.
In particular the Board deals with those matters reserved to it for decision, details of which are posted on the Group website: www.

Utilising a format created with the advice of Towers Watson, the Board again carried out a rigorous evaluation of Board performance in accordance with the Combined Code requirements which confirmed the effective operation of the Board and reflected the importance of strategic matters.
The evaluation process comprises a review conducted by the Company Secretary, and reported to the Chairman, of all Directors views on the operation of the Board, the performance of the Chairman of the Company, and the performance of the Chairman of each of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
The evaluation confirmed a continued high rating for the Boards operations and encompassed Board constitution, Board meetings, Board functionality, communication and knowledge management, Company secretariat performance, assessment of the Chairmans performance and the effectiveness of the Boards Committees.
Where necessary, improvements are made to the Boards operation as a result of the evaluation.
32 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 There are procedures for individual Board members to receive induction and training as appropriate and provision to solicit independent professional advice at the Companys expense where specific expertise is required in the course of exercising their duties.

In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code published in May 2010 all Directors will be subject to re-election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment and thereafter annually.
Conflicts From 1st October 2008 the Directors became subject to a statutory duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation where they have or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company.
Directors of public companies may authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate if the articles of association contain a provision to this effect.
The Company amended its articles of association in May 2008 to deal with, amongst other things, the provisions on conflicts of interest in the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has established formal procedures for the disclosure and review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest which the Directors may have and for the authorisation of such conflict matters by the Board.
In deciding whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict the Directors must have regard to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006.
The authorisation of any conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, may be reviewed at any time and will be reviewed formally by the Board on an annual basis.
The Board believes that the procedures established to deal with conflicts of interest are operating effectively.

Internal controls The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness whilst the role of management is to implement Board policies on risk and control.
There is an ongoing process for identifying and managing risks faced by the Group which has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The reviews cover, and assess the effectiveness of, all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
This ensures that proper accounting records have been maintained, that financial information used within the business is reliable and that the consolidated accounts preparation and financial reporting process comply with all relevant regulatory reporting requirements.
The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives.
The Board believes from its annual reviews that the system of internal controls is embedded in the business and regular review allows for assessment of new and changing risks in the Groups business.
In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied throughout the year and up to the date of this report with the Combined Code provisions on internal controls, having established the procedures necessary to implement the guidance issued by the Turnbull Committee and by reporting in accordance with that guidance which is publicly available at www.
i Risk management The Group has operated procedures for considering risks in the normal operations of the Group and with regard to significant transactions.
Strategic and annual planning also encompass consideration of business risks.
The Risk Management Committee specifically reviews any risks facing the business which could give rise to a material loss.
The Risk Management Committee carried out a review with external consultants, Willis, of the risk register and risk management process in the context of the current business structure and operations with the aim of validating the risk register and the general risk management process, and identifying any additional new risks which could involve a significant risk to the Groups business.
This exercise was completed early in 2011 and consisted of a review of the risk magnitude and risk likelihood.
Significant potential new risks were assessed and countermeasures established.
The Board, on Williss advice, is satisfied that the system of management for significant risks is appropriate for the Group and is properly executed.
As part of the risk management process Group companies are required to report, on a six monthly basis, their position with regard to implementing identified countermeasures to address the Groups significant business risks.
The six monthly returns are assessed by the Risk Management Committee and the results of that assessment are reported by the Company Secretary to the Board.
The Risk Management Committee carries out an annual review of the business risks.
The Board monitors the system of reporting and its effectiveness as a whole and reviews the assessments made by the Risk Management Committee and any recommendations for improvements to the process.
ii Financial The Finance Committee of the Board considers financing and investment decisions concerning the Group, including the giving of guarantees and indemnities, and monitors policy and control mechanisms for managing treasury risk within the limits laid down by the Board.
Financial reporting systems include comprehensive annual plans approved by the Board and monthly reporting of actual results with appropriate comparisons against plan and previous years results.
Forecast operating results for the year are regularly updated.
Capital investment is subject to approval under a clear policy.

The Audit Committee reviewed and noted compliance with the good practice list of matters established by the Audit Committee Institute in all material matters.
v Non-audit services A policy on non-audit services provided by the auditors in line with professional practice has been established and approved by the Audit Committee.
The external auditors have undertaken non-audit work in regard to taxation and acquisition due diligence and the fees paid by the Company for it are set out in note 6 on page 57.
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the Companys auditors is carefully controlled in line with the written terms provided by the Company to the auditors with the objective of avoiding impact on their independence and objectivity.

The Company Secretary will ensure that a the circumstances are properly investigated and b the employment of the person contacting the Company Secretary will be protected appropriately.
Internal audit Following a review in 2006, the Board established an enhanced internal audit function which allows each of the Group companies to be audited at least every four years.
All businesses acquired by the Group are subject to internal audit within one year from the date of acquisition.
Internal audit resource is supplemented by experienced qualified accounting staff from principal Group companies and a professional auditing firm, BDO International.
Reports are made to the Audit Committee and the Board as a whole.
No significant matters were raised in the reports made in the 14 operating companies audited during the year.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, and the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Business Review and Financial Review on pages 8 to 21.
In addition note 32 on pages 77 to 81 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with contracts with a diverse range of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries.
No one customer accounts for more than 1% of Group turnover.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries and after conducting a formal review of the Groups financial resources at their March Board Meeting, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Directors responsibilities The Statement of Directors Responsibilities is set out on page 44.
