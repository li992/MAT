Changes in the composition of the Board during the year are noted below and in the Directors Report.
The non-executive directors are all free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.

The Chairman, Norman Askew, was also regarded as independent at the date of his appointment in May 2005.
Terry Gateley is the senior independent director.
The non-executive directors are from varied backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of skills and experience of senior management in commerce and industry.

The Companys articles of association include certain provisions relevant to the activity of the Board and its committees and can be viewed on the Companys website.
These provisions include requirements for disclosure and approval by the Board of potential conflicts of interest.
These procedures apply, inter alia, to external directorships and it is the Boards view that they operated effectively during the year under review.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman and Chief Executive, which is reflected in the written Corporate Governance Framework approved by the Board.
In summary, the Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the Board but does not have any executive powers or responsibilities.
The Chief Executive leads the executive management team in running the businesses and implementing operating and strategic plans under authority delegated by the Board.
The four executive directors are: the Chief Executive, Martin Lamb: Finance Director, Douglas Hurt: and two operational executives, Roy Twite and Ian Whiting.

The Finance Director has Board level responsibility for environmental, health and safety and Sean Toomes, a member of the Executive Committee, has group functional responsibility for these matters.
Non-executive directors are supported in becoming familiar with the businesses during and after induction and there is regular contact between management and non-executive directors during site visits and formal meetings and events like the annual management conference.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board meetings operate to an appropriate agenda, and that adequate information is provided sufficiently in advance of meetings to allow proper consideration.
He is supported by the Company Secretary, who also assists in ensuring that the Board operates in accordance with good corporate governance under the new Code and relevant regulatory requirements.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of the standing committees of the Board.

The Board received the findings of the evaluation in March 2011 and the directors confirmed that the Board is fulfilling its responsibilities appropriately.
Actions agreed as a result include further developing succession planning at Board and senior executive levels.
The evaluation concluded that the Board and its committees were effective and that each director demonstrated a valuable contribution.

Risk management processes The Board has assigned specific responsibility to the Executive Committee to act as the risk committee of the Board.
This is a key feature of the remit of the Executive Committee, which was updated by the Board in December 2010 and is part of the IMI Corporate Governance Framework.
The Executive Committee is responsible for implementing and monitoring internal controls and other elements of risk management systems in respect of which the Board has oversight.
The annual strategic risk review process is integrated into the annual forecasting and business planning requirements of the Group and monitoring and updates are carried out between annual reviews.
Each operating unit and corporate function is therefore required to undertake a regular process of business risk assessment and reporting.
The President of each business division has appointed a Risk Champion with responsibility for embedding the Group risk assessment process in their business.
During 2010 the Risk Champions received training on their role and responsibilities from the Head of Group Risk Management and external specialists.
The businesses risk reports, including mitigation action plans for significant risks, are reviewed by the most senior executive within the relevant business and then considered by the Head of Group Risk Management, who puts reports to the Executive Committee, which in turn submits a full annual risk review and at least two updates to the Board.
The other corporate functions go through a similar process and their input is reflected in these reports.
The Group Risk Management function reports to the Finance Director.
Terry Gateley, the senior independent non-executive and chair of the Audit Committee, attended the Executive Committees annual risk review meeting.
The divisional business Presidents present their strategic risks to the Board as part of the annual business plan session and the Board explicitly considers the risks associated with the Companys strategic objectives.
The Executive Committee also reports to the Board on major business and other risks involved in specific investment decisions including acquisitions.
During the year the Board received reports on risk issues from the Executive Committee and reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control in relation to financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
In addition, the Audit Committee considered and reported to the Board on the financial aspects of internal control.
The Audit Committee also reviewed the nature and scope of the external audit and the internal audit work carried out by the IMI Group Assurance Department.
The Remuneration Committee conducted a review of incentive arrangements with reference to their alignment with strategic objectives and appropriate risk-taking.
Through these processes significant risks are identified, assessed and ranked according to their probability and materiality and, following Executive Committee review, the Board considers what measures are appropriate in order to mitigate, transfer or avoid such risks.
Principal risks and uncertainties are described on pages 34 and 35.
Financial reporting processes The use of the Group accounting manual and prescribed reporting requirements by finance teams throughout the Group are important in ensuring that the Groups accounting policies are clearly established and that information is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the reporting process.
The use of a standard reporting package by all entities in the Group ensures that information is presented in a consistent way that facilitates the production of the consolidated financial statements.
46 BOARD REPORTS BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Internal control The Board has responsibility for oversight of the Groups system of internal control and confirms that the system of internal control takes into account the Combined Code and relevant guidance as updated in 2005 by the Financial Reporting Council the Turnbull Guidance.
In the IMI Corporate Governance Framework the Board has clearly defined in writing those matters which are reserved to it and the respective delegated authorities of its committees and it has also set written limits of authority for the Executive Committee.
The Group has a clear organisational structure and well established reporting and control disciplines.
Managers of operating units assume responsibility for and exercise a high degree of autonomy in running day-to-day trading activities.
They do this within a framework of clear rules, policies and delegated authorities regarding business conduct, approval of proposals for investment and material changes in operations.
All operating units prepare forward plans and forecasts which are reviewed in detail by the Executive Committee and consolidated for review by the Board.
Performance against forecast is continuously monitored by the executive directors, reviewed at monthly meetings of the Executive Committee and on a quarterly basis by the Board.
Minimum standards for accounting systems and controls, which are documented and monitored, are promulgated throughout the Group.
Certified quarterly reports are required from senior executives of operating units, confirming compliance with Group financial reporting requirements.
There is also a central internal audit function, the IMI Group Assurance Department, which operates a rolling programme of internal assurance reporting and reviews.
These include on site reviews of selected operating units which are carried out by the IMI Group Assurance Department.
Additionally, visits to operations are carried out by senior Group finance personnel.
These internal assurance processes are co-ordinated with the external auditor.
Capital investments are subject to a clear process for investment appraisal, authorisation and post-investment review, with major investment proposals referred for consideration by the Executive Committee and, according to their materiality, to the Board.
In addition, the Executive Committee and the Board regularly review the operation of corporate policies and controls in relation to ethics and compliance matters, treasury activities, environmental issues, health and safety, human resources, taxation, insurance and pensions.
Compliance and audit reports are made to the Board, and to the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee, to enable control issues and developments to be monitored.
Control processes are dynamic and continuous improvements are made to adapt them to the changing risk profile of operations and to implement proportionate measures to address any identified weakness in the internal control system.
More information in relation to risk is given above under the heading Risk management processes.
Through the procedures outlined above the Board has considered the effectiveness of all significant aspects of internal control for the year 2010 and up to the date of this Annual Report.
The Board believes that the Groups system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk, provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Responsible business A major ethics and compliance programe, known as The IMI Way, has been adopted across the Group and is led by the Chief Compliance Officer, Jo Morgan.
Reports on compliance and The IMI Way programme are considered at every regular meeting of the Board and the Executive Committee.
The Board takes account of the social, environmental and ethical impact of its decisions and The IMI Way Code of Responsible Business incorporates a series of corporate policies and standards for responsible business across the Group.
At a Group level, responsible business activity is co-ordinated through a steering group chaired by an Executive Committee member and key issues of corporate social responsibility are identified, monitored and addressed through the Groups general business processes and risk management framework.
The Company satisfies the FTSE4Good global corporate responsibility criteria and has been awarded membership of the FTSE4Good Index.
In addition, in 2010 IMI retained its membership of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and IMI is a signatory to the UN Global Compact.
More information on corporate social responsibility matters is given on pages 28 to 33 and on the Companys website.
