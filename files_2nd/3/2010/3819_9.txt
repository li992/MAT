Corporate governance statement Compliance statement The Board remains committed to the principles of good corporate governance and supports the best practice guidelines contained within the FRC Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code as published in June 2008, which can be found on the FRCs website www.
This statement explains the Companys governance policies and practices and sets out how the principles of the Code have been applied for the year ended 31 December 2010 the year.
The Board confirms that, save as detailed below, the Company has complied with section one of the Code throughout the financial year.
During 2011, the Board will consider the requirements as set out in the revised UK Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010, including annual re-election of the Directors and external board evaluation.
Board of Directors Composition At 31 December 2010 the Board consisted of Greg Lock Chairman : two Executive Directors, Mike Norris and Tony Conophy: and four Non-Executive Directors: Philip Hulme, Ian Lewis, Peter Ogden, John Ormerod.
Cliff Preddy stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting AGM held on 14 May 2010.
Brian McBride was appointed to the Board as NonExecutive Director on 10 January 2011.
Details of the current Directors, including their membership of Committees, are set out below and their biographies, which include details of their other significant commitments, appear on page 29.
The Board considers that Greg Lock was independent on appointment and that Ian Lewis, John Ormerod and Brian McBride are also independent under the provisions of the Code.
Brian McBride is currently the Senior Independent Director.
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, provision A.
3.2, states that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, Executive Directors 1 Non-Executive Directors 2 Independent Non-Executive Directors Chairman 3 2 must consist of independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Company was not compliant with this provision during the year.
The Nominations Committee considered the size and structure of the Board, including the required skills and agreed that the present size and composition of the Board remained appropriate, for the requirements of the Company.
The primary reason for the lack of non-conformance to this provision relates to the lack of independence of the founder members, Philip Hulme and Peter Ogden, due to the duration of their membership to the Board.
The Nominations Committee continues to believe that these two Directors experience and business acumen bring significant value to the Board as a whole.
The Nominations Committee will consider the Boards composition again in 2011.
Following Cliff Preddys departure from the Company, the Board did not initially nominate a Director to act as Senior Independent Director, but at the Board meeting in August 2010, Mr Ormerod agreed to act as interim Senior Independent Director.
This role was relinquished upon the appointment of Brian McBride on 10 January 2011.
