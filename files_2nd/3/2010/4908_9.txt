Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 28 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CORPORate GOveRnanCe FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2010 The Company fully supports the principles of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2008 the Combined Code.
Except as stated in the section on dialogue with shareholders, the Company has, throughout the year, been in compliance with the Code Provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code and has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
An explanation of how the principles have been applied is set out below and in the Remuneration Report and the Audit Committee section of this report.
BOaRd OF diReCtORS The Board comprises the Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors.
The roles of Chairman and Group Managing Director are defined and separate.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Group Managing Director is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board.
The Board has a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, which enables it to provide effective leadership and control of the Company and its subsidiaries.
It also ensures that the decision making process cannot be dominated by any individual or small group of individuals.
indePendenCe OF diReCtORS All of the Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which affects their independent judgement.
Mr Ruffles is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Board believes that, to be judged independent, each Director should be impartial and free from any relationship or connection which could affect their ability to discharge their responsibilities impartially and objectively.
In addition, each Director should in practice have demonstrated a scrupulously independent approach by conducting himself impartially in all matters relating to the Group, challenging the views of management and other Board members and by showing a willingness and ability to defend his own views.
On the basis of these criteria, the Board has determined that each of the Non-Executive Directors is independent.
In reaching this conclusion the Board has considered the factors identified in Combined Code provision A.
The only one of these factors relevant in Dominos case is the length of service of Mr Ruffles who joined the Board in 2002.
The Board believes that no connection or relationship has arisen from this period of service which impairs Mr Ruffles independence.
He has continued to approach all his duties as a Non-Executive Director in an entirely objective and impartial manner.
The annual appraisal process has confirmed that Mr Ruffles remains a very effective member of the Board.
Details of the backgrounds of the Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 22. teRmS OF aPPOintment and time COmmitment The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors can be viewed on the Companys website or are available from the Company Secretary.
The Non-Executive Directors are expected to spend approximately 20 days per year on Domino business.
This comprises approximately 10 days per year attending Board and committee meetings and the remainder spent in preparation and in providing advice and assistance.
aCtivitieS OF the BOaRd and attendanCe The Board met eight times during the year to consider operational, financial and strategic matters.
All Directors attended each meeting except that Mr Brinsmead did not attend two meetings and Mr Herbert did not attend one meeting.
There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Boards decision.
The Chairman periodically meets with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being present.
In broad terms, the Board is responsible for creating and maintaining the framework within which the Group operates.
It sets the Groups strategy, objectives and policies and approves operating and capital expenditure budgets and material initiatives and commitments.
The executive managers are responsible for the decisions necessary to implement such strategies, policies and initiatives.
Each Director regularly receives detailed written reports on the performance of the Group, future plans and any significant issues facing the business.
Standard formats have been developed for these reports to ensure key facts are readily ascertainable.
In addition, senior management give presentations to the Board on matters requiring Board approval or on topics that the Board selects.
For example, the Board received presentations on specific development projects and investment proposals.
One meeting during the year is scheduled over two days and set aside to consider strategic issues.
indePendent leGal adviCe There is a procedure in place for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Companys expense if this is necessary in connection with their duties.
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 29 Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements diReCtORS inSuRanCe and indemnity aRRanGementS The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year Directors and Officers liability insurance.
The Directors also have the benefit of the indemnity provision contained in the Companys Articles of Association.
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors.
Re-eleCtiOn All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment and the Board has decided that all the Directors will retire at each Annual General Meeting.
The Non-Executive Directors were appointed for specified terms subject to re-election and to Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of a Director.
aPPOintment OF new diReCtORS There is a formal and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board, which is described in the Nomination Committee section.
COnFliCtS OF inteReSt Directors are required by law to avoid situations which give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Company unless such a situation has been authorised by the Board.
The Company has adopted and followed a procedure under which Directors must declare actual or potential conflicts as they arise and the Board reviews potential conflicts of interest arising from other posts held by Directors on an annual basis.
During the year authorisation has been given for potential conflicts of interest arising as a consequence of other positions held by some Directors.
No actual conflicts of interest arising in respect of specific arrangements or transactions have been declared to the Board.
In determining whether to authorise conflicts of interest only those Directors who have no interest in the matter may make the decision and they must act in good faith in the manner most likely to promote the Companys success.
BOaRd COmmitteeS The Board has three standing committees: audit Committee Members: Sir Mark Wrightson Committee Chairman, Mr P C Ruffles, Mr C Brinsmead and Sir David Brown.
Sir Mark Wrightson has relevant financial experience.
Each year the Committee makes an assessment of the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence of the Companys auditors.
This assessment is based upon reports produced by the auditors, the Committees own dealings with the auditors and feedback from the Executive team.
Prior to the commencement of each audit, the auditors present a proposal to the Committee detailing how the audit will be conducted and the fees payable.
The Committee reviews the proposal with senior representatives of the auditors.
The Committee meets with the auditors to consider the interim and full year financial statements and to review a report by the auditors on any issues raised by the audit.
The independence and objectivity of the auditors is regularly considered by the Committee.
The Committee receives an annual statement from the auditors detailing their independence policies and safeguards and confirming their independence.
The Committee ensures that an audit partner rotation policy is operated and reviews the relationship between auditor and management to see if this has the potential to affect independence.
The Committee monitors the fees paid to the auditors in respect of non-audit work.
As a matter of policy, the only non-audit work which the auditors may undertake is tax compliance and acquisition due diligence.
The Committee considers that it is cost effective to use the auditors for such work and that the amount and nature of such work does not impair the independence and objectivity of the auditors.
Specific Audit Committee approval is required to engage the auditors to provide any other type of non-audit work.
The Committee would only give approval if it was satisfied that it would be beneficial to use the auditors and the nature and extent of the work would not impair auditor independence.
The Committee reviews the scope and effectiveness of systems to identify and address both financial and non-financial risk.
Detailed presentations on risk control issues are made to the full Board.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing whistle-blowing procedures.
The Committee reviews the internal audit programme with the Group Financial Controller, who has responsibility for the programme.
The Audit Committee has access to all internal audit reports and the Group Financial Controller has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee Chairman on any issue relating to internal audits.
The Committee met twice during the year.
