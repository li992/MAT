The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met on four occasions in 2010, and the members attendance record is set out on page 51.
The Chairman of the Committee reports the Committees deliberations to the following Board meeting and the minutes of each meeting of the Committee are circulated to all members of the Board.
Role The Committee assists the Board to fulfil its oversight responsibilities.
Its primary functions are to: monitor the integrity of the financial statements and other information provided to shareholders: review significant financial reporting issues and judgements contained in the financial statements: review the systems of internal control and risk management: maintain an appropriate relationship with the Groups external auditors and review the effectiveness and objectivity of the external audit process: and monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit function which is provided by Grant Thornton UK LLP, review the internal audit plan, all internal audit reports and review and monitor managements responses to the findings and recommendations of the internal audit function.
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board.
The terms of reference are available on the Groups website at www.
Attendance at meetings The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the internal and external auditors are normally invited by the Chairman of the Committee to attend meetings of the Committee.
In undertaking its duties, the Committee has access to the services of the Finance Director and the Company Secretary and their resources, as well as access to external professional advice.
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in accordance with an agreed annual work plan of which the main features were: at meetings in February and July 2010, the Committee reviewed the Groups Preliminary results announcement and Annual report and accounts, and the Half year results announcement and Half year report respectively.
On each occasion, the Committee received reports from management and the external auditors identifying accounting or judgemental issues requiring its attention and also satisfied itself of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors: at each meeting the Committee received reports from the internal audit function on the progress of their programme for the year, reviewed new internal audit reports and monitored progress with the implementation of internal control recommendations.
The Committee reviewed the arrangements for the provision of the internal audit function and the performance of the current provider, Grant Thornton UK LLP.
The Committee considered that outsourcing the internal audit function through Grant Thornton UK LLP continues to be effective and appropriate.
In establishing the internal audit plan for 2011, the Committee continues to focus on specifically identified strategic risk areas, as well as ensuring the provision of a core compliance assurance service: Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 56 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT Attendance at meetings continued in April 2010, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the management letter covering the external auditors findings in respect of the prior financial year and also reviewed the performance of the external auditors: at meetings in April and November 2010, the Committee reviewed the Companys risk register and in November 2010 it undertook a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls: in July 2010, the Committee received a specific report that it had commissioned from  LLP PwC on the effectiveness of controls applicable to Drax Power Limiteds commodity trading activities.
The report concluded that there were no significant weaknesses in the controls.
PwC are to conduct a further phase of their review during 2011: during the year, the Committee met four times in the absence of management with the external auditors and three times with the internal auditors.
No matters of concern were drawn to the Committees attention at any of these meetings.
The Committees understanding with both the external and internal auditors is that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters occasioning them material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committees attention via the Chairman of the Committee.
Nothing was subject to this procedure in the course of the year: and from October 2010, the revised risk and governance framework came into being and each of the Risk Management Committees met.
The Committee was presented with the key risks from each management committee in November 2010.
The nature of the Groups activities, and the markets in which it operates, are such that from time to time there is a need to consider carefully certain complex accounting issues and make subjective judgements.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Groups accounting for unrealised gains and losses under derivative contracts, and the methodology through which the Group determine appropriate actuarial assumptions for its defined benefit pension scheme.
The Committee also considered the subjective judgements which are made in connection with the Groups tax accounting and the remaining useful economic life of the Drax Power Station.
On each occasion, the Committee concluded that the relevant accounting standards were being properly applied, and that the judgements taken were reasonable and appropriate to the circumstances.
Independence of the external audit In July 2008, the Committee considered and adopted an enhanced Auditor Independence Policy.
In accordance with the Policy, the Committee annually reviews the quality and cost effectiveness of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
The provisions of the Policy include: seeking confirmation that the auditors are, in their professional judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from them an account of all relationships which may affect the firms independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff: a policy governing the engagement of the auditors to conduct non-audit work under which: the auditors may not be engaged to provide certain categories of work, including those where they may be required to audit their own work or make management decisions, or where the auditors would act in an advocacy role for the Group: there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditors to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to financial limits: all engagements of the auditors to conduct non-audit work are reported to the next meeting of the Committee: the balance between the fees paid to the external auditors for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee: and a policy on the employment by the Group of former employees of the external auditors, the essence of which is to require a period of two years to elapse between the cessation of an individuals association with the auditors and appointment to any financial reporting oversight role within the Group.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditors during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements on page 84.
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five years and the current audit partner, Carl Hughes, has been in place for two years.
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Groups choice of external auditor.
