This statement describes how the principles of the Combined Code are applied and reports on the Companys compliance with the Codes provisions.
The Directors consider that the Company has been in compliance with the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year under review and to the date of this report.
The Board The Board of Directors the Board currently has seven members, comprising the Non-executive Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, an additional Executive Director, and three further independent Non-executive Directors.
All of the Directors bring strong judgement to the Boards deliberations.
The Board is of sufficient size and diversity that the balance of skills and experience is considered to be appropriate for the requirements of the business.
The Non-executive Directors are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, including those relationships and circumstances referred to in provision A.
3.1 of the Combined Code that could materially interfere with the exercise of independent and objective judgement.
The Company considers that the Chairman was independent on appointment.
The Non-executive Directors were all appointed for an initial three-year term and, thereafter, subject to satisfactory performance, may serve one or two additional three-year terms, with a thorough review of their continued independence and suitability to continue as Directors if they are to remain on the Board for more than nine years.
The Chairman and Chief Executive The different roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged.
A responsibility statement for each of those roles has been agreed and adopted by the Board.
Senior Independent Non-executive Director The senior independent Non-executive Director, Michael Hartley, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which are not resolved through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director or for which such contact is inappropriate.

All Directors must stand for election at the first AGM after they are appointed and the Articles of Association provide that all Directors will stand for re-election at least every three years.
However, the Board has decided to adopt early the recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election and all the Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Role of the Board The Board is collectively responsible for the proper management of the Company.
The Board normally meets not less than seven times each financial year and has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making, including responsibility for the overall management and performance of the Group and the approval of its long-term objectives and commercial strategy, approval of annual and interim results, annual budgets, material acquisitions and disposals, material agreements and major capital commitments, approval of treasury policies, and assessment of its going concern position.
Board members receive appropriate documentation in advance of each Board or Committee meeting which normally includes a detailed report on current trading and full papers on matters where the Board will be required to make a decision or give its approval.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least annually, by the Board of medium-term plans and the annual budget.
The business reports monthly on its performance against its agreed budget.
The Board receives a monthly update on performance and reviews any significant variances.
All major investment decisions are subject to post-completion reviews.
During the year the Chairman met with the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors present.
Directors and Officers insurance cover, is provided by the Company, in line with normal market practice, for the benefit of Directors in respect of claims arising in the performance of their duties.
Board performance evaluation The formal annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was undertaken before the year end.
This consisted of an internally run exercise led by the Chairman with the assistance of the Company Secretary.
The appraisal questionnaire used in connection with the process was wide-ranging and included questions outlined in the Combined Code, covering both Board and Committee performance.
The appraisal output is used to identify strengths and development areas and confirmed that the Board and its Committees were operating effectively.
Individual performance was also appraised, based on one-to-one interviews with the Chairman, or in the case of the Chairman, with the Senior Independent Director following consultation with both the other Non-executive Directors and the Executive Directors.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 41 Independent professional advice The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Companys expense, if necessary.
No such advice was sought by any Director during the year.
In addition, the Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
Training and development An induction programme is arranged for newly appointed Directors and includes presentations from senior management on the business, as well as guidance on their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of a listed company.
Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting exhibitions in markets in which the Group operates to gain a greater understanding of the Groups activities and to meet senior managers throughout the business.
Every Director has access to training as required and is encouraged to continue his own development.
Conflicts of interest The Companys Articles of Association were amended at the 2009 AGM, in line with the Companies Act 2006, to allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose limits or conditions, as appropriate.
The Company has established a procedure whereby any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors voting or without their votes being counted and in making such a decision, as always, the Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the Company.
Board Committees There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various matters are delegated.
The Committees all have formal Terms of Reference that have been approved by the Board which are available on the Groups website www.
Details are set out below: The Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley and Malcolm Wall and is chaired by Iain Paterson.
It meets as necessary and is responsible for considering and recommending to the Board persons who are appropriate for appointment as Executive and Non-executive Directors.
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board which involves the Nomination Committee interviewing suitable candidates proposed by either existing Board members or by an external search company.
Careful consideration is given to ensure appointees have enough time available to devote to the role and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained.
When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the Chairman, the senior independent Non-executive Director will chair the Committee instead of the Chairman.
When the Committee has found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the whole Board and the appointment is the responsibility of the whole Board following recommendation from the Committee.
The Committee met three times during the year.
Its principal activities were: r Reviewing the size and composition of the Board including the mix of skills and experience r Succession Planning for the Board and senior management r Considering the responses to the questionnaire used for the annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees, prior to review by the whole Board.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley and Iain Paterson, and is chaired by Malcolm Wall.
The committee met five times this year.
Full details of its activities and of Directors remuneration are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 48.
Those pages detail compliance with the legal requirements with regard to remuneration matters.
The Audit Committee The Audit Committee comprises Neil England and Malcolm Wall and is chaired by Michael Hartley.
The Board is satisfied that Michael Hartley has appropriate financial expertise to fulfil this role.
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the financial reporting process, the integrity of the Groups interim and annual financial statements prior to their submission to the Board and the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts.
It is also responsible for reviewing the Groups internal financial control and risk management systems, advising the Board on the appointment of external auditors, overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, approving auditor remuneration, reviewing the Groups whistle blowing procedures, reviewing accounting policies and compliance, and monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups internal audit function.
The Committee met four times during the year.
On each occasion the Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, and other members of staff, as required, attended by invitation.
The external auditors attended all four meetings.
Significant areas of work covered by the Audit Committee included: r Reviewing the Groups final and interim financial statements: r Reviewing results from audits undertaken and progress against the internal audit plan: r Identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group: and r Reviewing the Groups internal control environment and its effectiveness.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 42 Governance Corporate governance report continued The Audit Committee regularly monitors the relationship with the auditors and assesses their performance, cost-effectiveness, objectivity and independence.
It agrees the scope of the audit work and discusses the results of the full-year audit and interim review each year.
At each Audit Committee meeting the external auditors were able to meet with the Committee without management being present.
It is a specific responsibility of the Audit Committee to ensure that an appropriate relationship is maintained between the Group and its auditors.
The Group has a policy of controlling the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors in order to maintain their independence and ensure that their objectivity and independence are safeguarded.
This control is exercised by ensuring non-audit projects, where fees are expected to exceed 50,000, are subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
In addition, where a proposed service is outside the normal scope of non-audit services, the engagement must be approved in advance by the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
In awarding work for non-audit services, the Group takes into account a range of factors including quality of service, cost effectiveness, and historic knowledge of the business or sector.
The Committee has scrutinised the internal procedures of Deloitte LLP and satisfied itself that the independence and objectivity of the auditors are not affected by the non-audit work undertaken.
Internal audit function The Group engages KPMG to perform internal control audits at its main offices.
This work is co-ordinated by the Head of Internal Controls and Procedures who reports KPMGs findings directly to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee considers the Group to have an effective independent internal audit function.
Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness.
In discharging that responsibility, the Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to apply the Combined Code, including clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority, which are reviewed regularly.
Business performance is managed closely and the Board has established processes, as part of the normal good management of the business, to monitor: r Strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress towards strategic objectives: r Financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, financial reporting, analysing variances against plan, exchange rate volatility, and taking appropriate management action: r Capital investment and asset management performance, with detailed appraisal, authorisation and post-investment reviews: and r Principal risks and risk management processes, which accords with the Turnbull guidance, and that the significant risks faced by the Group are being identified, evaluated and appropriately managed, having regard to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity.
Risk management process There is in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has operated throughout the financial year.
These are reviewed by the Board at each meeting and also in detail by the Audit Committee once a year.
The risk framework governs the management and control of both financial and non-financial risks.
The adoption of this policy throughout the Group enables a consistent approach to the management of risk at both regional and business unit level.
In addition, during the financial year, the Audit Committee received: r Reports from the Head of Internal Controls and Procedures on the work carried out under the annual internal audit plan: r Risk management reports, including the status of actions to mitigate major risks and the quantification of selected risks: and, r Reports from the external Auditors.
Through the monitoring processes set out above, the Board conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the financial year.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In that context, the review, in the opinion of the Board, did not indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and the Board is not aware of any change to this status up to the approval of this report.
