Compliance statement The Directors consider that the Company complied with the provisions of section 1 of the Code with the following exceptions: Code Provision A.
3.2: The Board recognises that the Code specifies that at least half of the members of the Board excluding the Chairman should be independent Non-executive Directors.

Code Provision D. 1.1: the Code specifies that the Senior Independent Director should attend sufficient meetings with a range of major shareholders to develop a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of major shareholders.
