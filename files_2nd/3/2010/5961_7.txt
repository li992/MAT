The Group has considerable financial resources, no borrowings, a high level of recurring revenue and a very broad spread of customers.

The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Groups significant risks and that this has been in place for the period under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.

Business unit performance and internal control are monitored by regular operating board meetings.
Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of business together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.
These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a variety of internal or external sources including competition, control breakdowns, disruption in information systems, natural catastrophe and regulatory requirements.
