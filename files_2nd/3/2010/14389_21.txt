smi ar10 middle aw2:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:32 Page 67 Corporate governance statement Throughout the period 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010 the Company has been in full compliance with the June 2008 issue of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code, published by the Financial Reporting Council and available on its website www.
uk, except that the value of any fees received by executive directors in respect of external non-executive directorships is not disclosed in the Directors remuneration report as this is not considered relevant to the Company.
Directors The Board In reviewing the performance of the Board during the year, the Board determined that the following statement of its role slightly amended from last year would be used to judge its success: Good corporate governance is about helping to run the Company well.
It involves ensuring that an effective internal framework of systems and controls is put in place which clearly defines authority and accountability and that promotes success whilst permitting the management of risk to appropriate levels.
It involves the exercise of judgement as to the definitions of success, the appropriateness of risk and the levels of delegation to the executive.
The exercise of this judgement is the responsibility of the Board and involves consideration of processes and assumptions as well as outcomes.
It also involves the creation of a sensitive interface for the views of shareholders and other stakeholders to be given appropriate consideration when reaching these judgements.
The executive team is required to provide such information to the Board as the Board needs to enable it to exercise its judgement over these matters.
There is a very fine distinction between the approval of processes and their definition.
Wherever possible it is the role of the Board to approve process rather than initiate or define it.
Only exceptionally would the Board intervene to initiate or define.
The Board also sets the tone for the Company.
The way in which it conducts itself, its attitude to ethical matters, its definitions of success and the assessment of appropriate risk all define the atmosphere within which the executive team works.
Good  not aboutadheringto codes of practice although  partof theevidenceof good governance but rather about the exercise of a mindset to do what is right.
One of the challenges facing any Board is the way in which the non-executive and the executive directors interact.
It is clear that they each have the same legal responsibility but it is generally unrealistic to expect executive directors to speak individually with the same freedom as the nonexecutive directors.
Equally executive directors who just toe the executive line in contradiction to their own views may not be effectively contributing to good governance.
A well-functioning Board needs to find the right balance between hearing the collective executive view and being aware of the natural internal tensions in an executive team.
One of the consequences of both increasing the watchdog role of the Board and finding this balance between individuality and team behaviour is driving more and more Boards to have fewer and fewer executive directors.
In our circumstances as a holding company for a number of businesses, the reduced Board size works effectively and an appropriate balance is struck.
Notwithstanding the tensions created by many external expectations which may be wholly or in part unrealistic, a successful Board should, ideally, becomposedof a groupofrespected, experienced,   success of the Company, provide a unified vision of the definitions of success and appropriate risk, endeavour to support management i. e. those who honestly criticise at times but encourage all the time and who create confidence in all stakeholders in the integrity of the business.
A Board meeting should feel like a meeting at which everyone is participating to solve problems together.
Above all, all participants should be able to say after a Board meeting that value has been added as a result of the meeting taking place.
This added value will come in many forms: challenge, advice, clarity, imagination, support, sharing of problems, or creating strategic intent.
The list is not exhaustive.
Board membership is for 365 days of the year.
Board responsibilities do not start and end with formal meetings.
Board members, on the Companys and their own initiative, should endeavour to engage outside of meetings to bring their experience to the assistance of the executive team whenever possible.
Above all there should be a sense of value added from the engagement of the Board members in all their interaction with the Company, formal or otherwise.
During the last financial year, on 1 August 2009, Ms A. C. Quinn was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Company: on 19 April 2010, Mr P. A. Turner was appointed as an executive director: and on 1 July 2010, Mr B. F. J. Angelici was appointed as an independent non-executive director.

Mr Challen is the senior independent director.
Biographies of these directors, giving details of their experience and other main commitments, are set out on page 61.
The wide-ranging experience and backgrounds of the non-executive directors ensure that they can debate and constructively challenge management in relation to both the development of strategy and the evaluation of performance against the goals set by the Board.

It additionally exercises control by determining matters specifically reserved to it in a formal schedule which only the Board may change: these matters include the acquisition or divestment of significant companies or businesses, the issue of shares, significant contractual commitments, the review of the effectiveness of risk management processes and major capital expenditure.
Once a year, the Board meets with a particular focus on long-term strategy and developments affecting the Company.
Additional meetings are arranged as necessary to deal with urgent items.
The Board sets the Companys values and standards and has adopted a Code of Business Ethics which is referred to on pages 55 and 56.
The Chairman meets the non-executive directors without the executive directors present at least twice a year.
The senior independent director meets the other non-executive directors without the Chairman present at least annually.
Directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a directors and officers liability insurance policy.
The following table shows the number of scheduled Board and Board Committee meetings held during the financial year ended 31 July 2010 and opposite each directors name the number of meetings they were eligible to attend and the number actually attended.
However, directors attend many other meetings and make site visits during the year.
For example, in September 2009, the Chairman and Ms Quinn visited several of the Companys manufacturing facilities in the US.
As part of her induction process, Ms Quinn also visited a number of manufacturing sites in the UK.
In January 2010 the Board visited the Smiths Medical facility in Latina, Italy and in May 2010 the Board visited the Smiths Detection facility in Wiesbaden, Germany.

The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda.
Once agreed by the Board as a whole, it is the Chief Executives responsibility to ensure delivery of the strategic and financial objectives.
Board balance and independence There is a balance of executive and non-executive directors such that no individual or small group can dominate the Boards decision taking.
Throughout the financial year at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, has comprised independent non-executive directors.
In deciding the chairmanship and membership of the Board Committees, the need to refresh membership of the Committees is taken into account.
All the non-executive directors are considered to be independent and Mr Brydon was considered independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman.
Appointments to the Board The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which are made on merit and against objective criteria.
Information and professional development The Board is provided with detailed information several days in advance on matters to be considered at its meetings and non-executive directors have ready access to the executive directors.
Regular site visits are arranged and non-executive directors are encouraged to visit sites independently.
During site visits, briefings are arranged and the Directors are free to discuss aspects of the business with employees at all levels.
Newly-appointed directors undergo an induction programme to ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and understanding of the Company and its activities.
They undertake briefing sessions on corporate governance, strategy, stakeholder issues, finance and risk management and HR strategy, as well as meetings and site visits to business locations in the UK and overseas.
Each directors individual experience and background is taken into account in developing a programme tailored to his or her own requirements.
Ongoing training is provided as and when necessary.
The suitability of external courses is kept under review by the Company Secretary who is charged with facilitating the induction of new directors and with assisting in the ongoing training and development of directors.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and a procedure is in place for them to take independent professional advice at the Companys expense should this be required.
68 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2010 smi ar10 middle aw2:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:32 Page 69 Conflicts of Interest Under the Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act a director must avoid a situation where he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the companys interests.
The requirement is very broad, and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
The 2006 Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate and where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect, as the Companys Articles do.
The Board has put procedures in place for directors to report any potential or actual conflicts to the other members of the Board for their authorisation where appropriate.
Each director is aware of the requirement to seek approval of the Board for any new conflict situations, as they may arise.
The process of reviewing conflicts disclosed, and authorisations given, will be repeated at least annually.
Any conflicts or potential conflicts considered by the Board and any authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of directors conflicts which is maintained by the Company Secretary.
Performance evaluation The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and each director.
The Board, led by the Chairman, used a detailed questionnaire, completed by each director, as the basis of these evaluations.
The performance evaluation of the Chairman is led by the senior independent director who obtains the views of both the executive and non-executive directors.
The directorships in listed companies and other significant commitments of the Chairman and the non-executive directors are shown on page 61.
It is   havesufficienttime to fulfil theircommitments to theCompany: thattheChairman does not hold the office of chairman of another FTSE 100 company: and that no executive director holds more than one non-executive directorship of another FTSE 100 company.
Re-election All directors stand for election by the shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting AGM following their appointment.
The Board has resolved that all directors who are willing to continue in office will stand for re-election by the shareholders each year at the AGM.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a specified term of three years, subject now to annual re-election at each AGM, and reappointment for a second three-year term is not automatic.
In exceptional circumstances and only after rigorous review, a non-executive director may serve for a third three-year term, subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Remuneration Information regarding the Remuneration Committee is set out on page 71 and the Directors remuneration report is on pages 73 to 81.
Accountability and audit Financial reporting The Board is required to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Companys position and prospects in the Annual Report and in interim and other public reports.
The Board is satisfied that it has met this obligation.
A summary of the directors responsibilities for the financial statements is set out on page 82.
The going concern statement required by the Code is set out in the Group directors report on page 63.
Internal control The Board maintains a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the Companys assets.
The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed at least annually, by the Audit Committee, covering all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems, and the Board reports to shareholders that it has done so.
The Financial Reporting Councils report Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code October 2005 provides guidance.
The Company has in place internal control and risk management systems in relation to the Companys financial reporting process and the Groups process for preparation of consolidated accounts.
These systems include policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets: provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS : require representatives of the businesses to certify that their reported information gives a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business and its results for the period: and review and reconcile reported data.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring these internal control and risk management systems.
The Companys internal control is based on assessment of risk and a framework of control procedures to manage risks and to monitor compliance with procedures.
The procedures for accountability and control are outlined below.
The Companys internal control systems are designed to meet the Companys particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed and, by their nature, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material loss to the Company or material misstatement in the financial accounts.
The Group has an embedded process for the identification, evaluation and management of significant business risks.
The process is reviewed through the Audit Committee and monitored by the Group Internal Audit Department.
The Company has during the year identified and evaluated the key risks, including ethical matters and information provision, and has ensured that effective controls and procedures are in place to manage these risks.
In the highly regulated environment of the industries in which the Company operates, procedures are codified in detailed operating procedures manuals and are reinforced by training programmes.
These are designed to ensure compliance not only with the regulatory requirements but also with general principles of business integrity.
A key element in any system is communication: the executive directors and senior corporate staff meet regularly with representatives from the businesses to address financial, human resource, legal, risk management and other control issues.
