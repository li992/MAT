AUDIT AND INTERNAL CONTROL The Audit Committee The Audit Committee is chaired by Dennis Millard and its other members are Adam Crozier, Richard Gillingwater, Peter Long and Paul Pindar.
All members of the committee have business and financial expertise.
The Chairman is a chartered accountant with recent and relevant financial experience.
The committee has written terms of reference which have been published on the Companys website.
The committee will meet three times a year and a detailed rolling agenda for each meeting has been prepared.
It will meet at least once a year with the external and internal auditors, without management present.
At its first meeting in July of this year, which was attended by all members, the Audit Committee carried out a review of the Groups systems of internal controls, reviewed the Groups risk management register, framework, and processes, reviewed the internal financial control processes, the internal and external auditors plans and the whistle blowing arrangements.
At the second meeting of the Audit Committee in October, attended by all members except Paul Pindar due to other commitments, the particular focus was the review of the Companys annual financial statements including a report from the external auditors identifying accounting or judgemental issues requiring the committees attention.
In addition the committee received an assessment by senior management and the internal auditor of the effectiveness of internal controls and the control environment, considered the objectivity and independence of the external auditors and met with the external auditors and internal auditor separately without management present.
At all meetings, the committee receives reports from the Finance Director, internal auditor, the external auditor and reports on material litigation, health and safety matters and treasury risks and controls.
The report of the internal auditor covers not only risk management and internal control matters but also on its profit protection roles which cover areas that are specifically germane to the Companys retail activities.
Internal control There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company.
The board is responsible for the Companys system of internal control further details of which are given in the following sections and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee carried out a review at its first meeting of the Groups system of internal controls.
This system is made up of the following elements: Risk identification The Company has a dedicated department whose focus is on both internal audit and profit protection including the detection of fraud.
This internal audit team identifies annually and monitors, as part of its control environment review, the significant risks facing the business and prepares a risk register.
The Company strengthened, in March of this year, its risk management strategy and policy.
As part of this policy each head of function within the Group submits a control environment review annually, which identifies the functions key performance indicators, business risks and controls to address them.
Risks are then ranked, initially by the functional head and then by internal audit.
These risks are classified as critical, serious, moderate and low, and rated as frequent, common, occasional and unlikely.
A matrix is prepared based on this classification which is presented to the Audit Committee and used to assess the main areas on which focus should be placed and to form the basis of the risk management and internal audit plans.
The Company also considered the risks relating to Debenhams business and its shares as part of its preparations for the Admission of the Company to the London Stock Exchange in May 2006 this assessment was also used by the internal audit team in identifying the significant risks facing the business.
Those risk factors are set out on pages 12 to 20 of the prospectus issued at the time of Admission, a copy of which can be obtained from the Company Secretary of Debenhams plc.

The internal audit work plan is designed to audit the risk management processes across the Company and measure the effectiveness of each divisions controls and management of its key risks.
The audit work plan for the year is presented to the Audit Committee.
Reviews are then carried out by the internal audit team.
All are risk scored, key actions are agreed with the head of function, and follow-up reviews are carried out on any area with an unacceptable result.
Where necessary, external resources are employed to assist in the review of the controls and control environment in specialist areas such as IT and treasury.
With regards to individual stores, the relevant sales directors are involved in follow-up reviews and stores are assessed, in part, based on their audit results.
Training and support is provided where necessary, and disciplinary action will be taken where unacceptable results persist.
Employees can access all risk management policies and procedures on the Companys intranet.
Financial control A budget is prepared for each year, with significant input from senior management as well as store managers and central functions.
The board determines the key planning assumptions in the budget, planning meetings are then held with key executives on sales and margin, and a number of meetings are held attended by the head of each function and cost centre controllers.
The final budget is approved by the board in August of each year.
Results are compared monthly against this budget and a reforecast is then done every month by store, division and for the Group against this budget.
Variance analysis against both budget and the latest forecast form a core part of the regular management information.
A monthly financial review pack which is reviewed by the executive directors and is made available to the non-executive directors is issued two weeks after the end of each month which contains the key financial and operating performance indicators.
In addition, a separate finance report from the Finance Director is made to each board meeting.
In accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules,  LLP PwC carried out an assessment, in May 2006, of the high-level financial controls, budgeting and forecasting, financial accounting procedures, accounting policies, management reporting framework, treasury operations and the IT environment of the Company.
In addition to its submission to the Sponsor of the Listing, that report has been reviewed internally by the Company and was also presented to the first meeting of the Audit Committee.
Arrangements for employees to raise matters in confidence whistle-blowing procedures The Audit Committee has also reviewed the arrangements by which employees may raise in confidence possible improprieties, namely: i The Code of Business Conduct, which applies to all employees all senior employees are required to confirm compliance in writing which includes details of how matters can be raised in strict confidence.
ii Problem solving guidelines, which are published on the intranet, and set out the process for raising any issues that may be affecting an employee at work.
iii A confidential crime line for all staff in stores.
37 Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2006 AUDIT AND INTERNAL CONTROL Non-audit services The fees paid to PwC for audit and non-audit services are set out in note 7 on page 69.
There were substantial non-audit services during the year due to the financial information requirements of the listing of Debenhams shares on the London Stock Exchange, which involved, inter alia, PwC: a carrying out an assessment of the Companys financial controls, procedures and systems: b reviewing the financial information prepared in accordance with UK GAAP for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 financial years: and c reporting its opinion on consolidated financial information for the 26 weeks ended 26 February 2005 and 4 March 2006 and year ended 3 September 2005 prepared in accordance with accounting standards adopted for use in the EU.
It was cost effective for the Company to acquire services from PwC in such areas and in areas such as taxation advice because of their knowledge of the Groups affairs.
The Audit Committee has developed a policy on the provision by the external auditor of non-audit services.
The objective of the Audit Committees policy is to ensure that the provision of such service does not impair the external auditors independence or objectivity.
In this context, the Audit Committee will consider: whether the skills and experience of the audit firm make it a suitable supplier of the non-audit service: whether there are safeguards in place to ensure that there is no threat to objectivity and independence in the conduct of the audit resulting from the provision of such services by the external auditor: the nature of the non-audit services, the related fee levels and the fee levels individually and in aggregate relative to the audit fee: and the criteria which govern the compensation of the individuals performing the audit.
The policy covers amongst other things: a monitoring the external auditors independence eg that the auditors and their immediate family have no family, financial or employment relationship with the Company, and checking that the Group engagement partner and audit senior manager do not work on the audit for a period in excess of that permitted: b the identification of three categories of accounting services: audit-related services, which the Companys auditors provide such as interim and full-year reporting : prohibited services, which the Companys auditors may never provide: and potential services, which the Companys auditors may in certain circumstances provide, subject to the policy such as tax advisory services or services where the auditors are acting as the Companys reporting accountants.
Prohibited services are those which would result in: the external auditors auditing their own firms work: the external auditors making management decisions for the Company: a mutuality of interest being created: or the external auditors being put in the role of advocate for the Company.
c reporting at each meeting of the Audit Committee on non-audit services being provided by the auditors.
