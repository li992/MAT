The prime medium by which the Company communicates with shareholders is through the interim and annual reports and accounts which aim to provide shareholders with a full understanding of the Companys activities and their results.
This information is supplemented by the daily calculation of the net asset value of the Companys ordinary shares which is published via the Stock Exchange and by a monthly factsheet.
Both the Manager and the Companys brokers are also in regular contact with shareholders and regularly report to the Directors on their views.
A presentation is made by the Manager following the business of the AGM each year.
Shareholders have the opportunity to address questions to the Chairman at the AGM and all shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM.
It is the intention of the Board that reports and accounts be issued to shareholders so as to provide twenty working days notice of the AGM.
Shareholders wishing to lodge questions in advance of the AGM are invited to do so, either on the reverse of the proxy card or in writing to the Company Secretary at the address given on page 12.
At other times the Company responds to letters from shareholders on a range of issues.
There is a regular dialogue with individual major shareholders and general presentations to both institutional shareholders and analysts following the publication of the annual results.
All meetings between the Manager and institutional shareholders are reported to the Board.
Institutional Voting The Board considers that the Company has a responsibility as a shareholder towards ensuring that high standards of Corporate Governance are maintained in the companies in which it invests.
To achieve this, the Board does not seek to intervene in daily management decisions, but aims to support high standards of governance and, where necessary, will take the initiative to ensure those standards are met.
The principal means of putting shareholder responsibility into practice is through the exercise of voting rights.
Your Companys voting rights are exercised on an informed and independent basis and are not simply passed back to the company concerned for discretionary voting by its chairman.
30 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued Socially Responsible Investing Your Manager considers many factors when evaluating potential investments.
Some are financial ratios and measures, for example, free cash flow, earnings per share, price to book and more.
Others are more subjective indicators, which rely more on first hand research, such as quality of management, innovation and product strength.
While a companys policy towards the environment and social responsibility is considered as part of the overall assessment of risks and the suitability of the company for the portfolio, the Manager does not necessarily preclude an investment being made in that company on these grounds alone.
Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
