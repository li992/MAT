Financial Review continued Maritime Sector Revenues from BGAN services during 2006 are set out in the During 2006, revenues from the maritime sector were table below.
These figures include voice, data and subscription US$284.7m, an increase of US$17.6m, or 6.6%, compared with revenues.
This principally reflects an increase in data revenue with a BGAN subscribers.
Revenues from data services in the maritime sector during 2006 were US$183.8m, an increase of US$18.7m, BGAN quarterly cumulative revenues US$m or 11.3%, compared with 2005.
The increase in revenues from 10 data services reflects greater demand, as a result of the take-up and utilisation of our Fleet services in the new-build market, 9.5 8 and increased data usage over our smaller terminals with lowerspeed capabilities, such as Inmarsat B and Mini M. Revenues 6 from voice services in the maritime sector during 2006 were 5.3 4 US$100.9m, a decrease of only US$1.1m, or 1.1%, compared with 2005, reflecting increasing signs of stabilisation in this 2 2.1 0.5 sector.
Historically our voice revenues for maritime services 0 have been affected in some cases by competition and by the 31 March 2006 30 June 2006 30 Sept 2006 31 Dec 2006 migration of users from our higher-priced analogue service to our lower-priced digital services although the remaining levels of analogue users on our network are now at much lower levels.
BGAN active subscriber numbers 000 This stabilisation in voice has benefited from growth in both our newer Fleet service and various promotions for Mini M, which 7500 we have initiated to promote greater use of our services by 7,119 6000 ships crews and to respond to increased competition.
5,547 4500 Land Mobile Sector 3000 3,367 In 2006, revenues from the land mobile sector were US$116.1m, a decrease of US$5.7m, or 4.7%, compared with 2005.
Revenues 1500 2,113 from data services in the land mobile sector during 2006 were 0 US$96.9m, a decrease of US$1.3m, or 1.3%, compared with 2005.
31 March 2006 30 June 2006 30 Sept 2006 31 Dec 2006 The decrease is a result of the decline in high-speed data traffic following a reduction in traffic in the Middle East and competition from VSAT.
This has been offset in part by the launch of BGAN and increased demand for R-BGAN with both services Aeronautical Sector contributing strongly in the second half.
Revenues from voice During 2006, revenues from the aeronautical sector were services in the land mobile sector during 2006 were US$19.2m, US$30.7m, an increase of US$8.0m, or 35.2%, compared with a decrease of US$4.4m, or 18.6%, compared with 2005.
The increase continues to be attributed primarily to continues the trend seen over the last few years of declining traffic increased demand for our Swift 64 high-speed data service, volumes resulting from competition, principally for our Mini M which targets the government aircraft and business jet markets and large antenna Mini M services, from operators of handheld as well as being used by commercial airlines.
satellite telephones who offer lower-priced voice services.
We believe that the launch of our own handheld voice product over the Inmarsat-4 coverage area will enhance our land voice offering and enable us to win customers in this growth area.

The previous years costs included in the second half due to the signing of a significant Swift 64 US$4.5m in relation to subsidiaries disposed of during that year.
Leasing growth in the land mobile and aeronautical The average headcount excluding staff employed in Indonesia sectors has been offset by a decline in the maritime sector.
as a result of the ACeS collaboration agreement decreased to 389 in 2006 from 404 in 2005 excluding subsidiaries disposed of, principally due to the restructuring plan.
In 2006 the Group MSS revenue by sector 2006 recognised US$5.2m of share option costs 2005: US$6.5m 12% relating principally to the all staff option scheme implemented in November 2004.

Included in this category in 2005 is US$11.7m Leasing 12% for leasing satellite capacity for the R-BGAN service.
This service was moved on to the Inmarsat-4 F1 satellite after launch in 2005 MSS revenue by sector 2005 and therefore there were no equivalent costs in 2006.
This 13% reduction was offset in part by an increase in the costs of in-orbit insurance with two Inmarsat-4 satellites having been in service 5% for the whole year, and by an increase in warranty and other maintenance costs on our Inmarsat-4 ground infrastructure that 56% were not incurred to the same extent in 2005.

EBITDA margin has increased to 66.3% for favourable restructuring of our debt portfolio.
This reflects an increase in revenue against a reduction in net operating costs.
EBITDA Income tax expense excluding the one time non-recurring termination costs was In 2006 the Group recorded a tax credit of US$37.9m, compared US$338.5m, an increase of 7.1% over 2005. to a tax charge of US$31.1m in 2005.
In December 2006, an intragroup lease receivable asset was disposed of and subsequently terminated resulting in the net release of a deferred tax EBITDA US$m provision of US$58.1m, which offset our tax liability for 2006.
Excluding the effect of this transaction in addition to a further 350 credit arising from the review of certain historical tax provisioning 337 300 332 314 316 302 positions, the tax charge for 2006 would have been US$27.3m, 250 resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.4%.

In particular, revenues from data services tend to by the terms and conditions of borrowing facilities and decline during the holiday season, reflecting reduced business debt securities.
Historically, the impact of this seasonal decline in data services on our results of operations has been limited, as the Dividends decline has been substantially offset by increased voice traffic.
The Board recommends a final dividend of 16 cents US$ per However, as data revenues increase as a percentage of our total ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006 revenues, we expect the seasonal decline in the volumes may amounting to US$73.1m.

Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 17 Financial Review continued Risk factors Spectrum Inmarsat faces a number of risk factors, not all of which are We rely on radio spectrum to provide our services.
Although many of the risk factors This has historically been allocated by the International influencing our performance are macroeconomic and likely Telecommunications Union without charge, and usage to affect the performance of businesses generally, others are has to be co-ordinated with other satellite operators in particular to our operations in mobile satellite services.
In the future, we may not be successful in co-ordinating our satellite operations under applicable Our critical risk factors are discussed below, but it is not international regulations and procedures or in obtaining intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all risks affecting the sufficient spectrum or orbital resources necessary for our business.
Some risks may be unknown to us and other risks, operations.
currently regarded as immaterial, could turn out to be material.
All of them have the potential to impact our business, revenue, Regulation profits, assets, liquidity and capital resources adversely.
Our business is subject to regulation and we face increasing regulation with respect to the transmission of our satellite They should also be considered in connection with the signals.
The provision of our mobile satellite communication statement on internal control and risk management in the services in some countries could cause us to incur additional Statement on Corporate Governance, the forward-looking costs, could expose us to fines and could limit our ability to statements in this document and the cautionary statement provide services in some countries.
Outlook Satellites We are pleased with the performance of our core business and Our satellites are subject to significant operational risk while believe the growth drivers of our 2006 performance can fuel in orbit which, if they were to occur, could adversely affect our further growth in 2007.
We are targeting growth across all our revenues, profitability and liquidity.
Although we have in-orbit business sectors in 2007 and overall a higher level of revenue insurance on our Inmarsat-4 satellite fleet, this may be insufficient growth than we achieved in 2006. to cover all losses if we had a satellite failure.
Our maritime and aeronautical businesses are experiencing We also intend to launch the third Inmarsat-4 satellite as soon as steady demand for new terminals and will benefit from a full year a launch slot becomes available.
Although we expect to take out contribution from the terminals installed in 2006.
We are pleased launch insurance, the launch is subject to risk of failure either on with the rate of growth in BGAN and see the potential for launch or once in orbit.

We continue to see opportunities for BGAN in new markets and will maintain Distribution a policy of adding new distribution partners as appropriate We rely on third party distribution partners and service providers to access these opportunities.
During 2007 we also expect to sell our services to end-users and they determine the prices to launch our SwiftBroadband and FleetBroadband services, end-users pay.
There is a risk that our distribution partners or however, we do not expect material revenue contributions from service providers could fail to distribute our services effectively, these services until 2008. or fail to offer services at prices which are competitive.
We expect to see a modest increase in our operating costs Furthermore sales to three distribution partners represent 85% of reflecting a full year of costs relating to our handheld service our revenues and the loss of any of these could materially impact and a full year of other satellite related costs, including in-orbit our routes to market, reduce customer choice or represent a insurance of our Inmarsat-4 satellites.
Costs will also rise due to significant bad debt risk.
The merger of any two distribution foreign exchange rate movements as 60% of our operating costs partners will also increase the amount of volume discounts that excluding depreciation are denominated in Sterling.
In 2006 we are given to partners.
The merger of Stratos and Xantic in had hedged our costs at a rate of US$1.77 1.00 whereas in 2007 February 2006 resulted in an additional US$6.0m of volume we are hedged at US$1.81 1.00.
These cost increases will be discounts in 2006.

Assuming the launch does not occur in 2007, we expect cash capital expenditure to be in the region of US$120.0 million, including maintenance.
In the event we can achieve a launch in 2007, we would expect total cash capital expenditure to be in the region of US$240.0 million.
In addition as a result of the Groups investment to enable expanded handheld coverage using the existing Inmarsat-4 satellites, the Group will undertake a process of network infrastructure upgrades and an accelerated modernisation of the existing handheld satellite phone.
