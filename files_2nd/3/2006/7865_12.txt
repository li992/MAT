36 Corporate governance Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and confirms that the system of internal control accords with the relevant guidance issued in September 1999 and revised in October 2005 by the Financial Reporting Council the Turnbull Committee Guidance.
Consistent with the Turnbull Committee Guidance, the Board has assigned responsibility for the continuous review of risk management and controls to the Executive Committee.
During the year the Board received reports on risk issues from the Executive Committee and reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control in relation to financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
In addition, the Audit Committee considered and reported to the Board on the financial aspects of internal control including the nature and scope of external audit.
The committee also reviews the internal audit work carried out by the IMI Assurance Department.
Each operating unit is required to undertake a continuous process of business risk assessment and reporting.
This is reviewed by the most senior executive within the relevant business and any major risk issues are considered by the Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee makes regular reports to the Board on major business risks faced by individual operations and by the Group and how those risks are managed.
Through this process major business risks are identified, assessed and ranked according to their nature and urgency and the Board considers what measures would be appropriate in order to control such risks.
The Board has clearly defined in writing those matters which are reserved to it and the respective delegated authorities of its committees and the executive directors.
The Group has a clear organisational structure and well established reporting and control disciplines.
Managers of operating units assume responsibility for and exercise a high degree of autonomy in running day-to-day trading activities.
They do this within a framework of clear rules and policies regarding business conduct, approval of proposals for investment and material changes in operations.
All operating units prepare forward plans annually which make projections for a period of three years.
These plans are reviewed in detail by executive directors and consolidated for review by the Board.
Performance against forecast is continuously monitored by the executive directors, reviewed at monthly meetings of the Executive Committee and on a quarterly basis by the Board.
Minimum standards for accounting systems and controls, which are documented and monitored, are promulgated throughout the Group.
Certified quarterly reports are required from senior executives of operating units, confirming compliance with Group standards.
There is also a central internal audit function, IMI Assurance Department, which operates a rolling programme of internal assurance reporting and reviews.
These include on site reviews of selected operating units which are carried out by the IMI Assurance Department and co-ordinated with the divisional financial management review processes and external audit.
Additionally, visits to operations are carried out by senior Group finance personnel in conjunction with the external auditor.
Control processes are dynamic and continuous improvements are made to adapt them to the changing risk profile of operations and whenever weakness in the internal control system is identified appropriate remedial action is taken.
Capital investments are subject to a clear process for investment appraisal, authorisation and post-investment review, with major investment proposals referred for consideration by the Executive Committee or the Board, as appropriate, according to their materiality.
In addition, the Executive Committee and the Board regularly review the operation of corporate policies and controls in relation to treasury activities, environmental issues, health and safety, human resources, ethical trading, taxation, insurance, pensions, legal and regulatory compliance.
Compliance reports are made to the Board and the Audit Committee, as appropriate, to enable control issues and developments to be monitored.
Through the procedures outlined above the Board has considered all significant aspects of internal control for the year 2006 and up to the date of this Annual Report.
The Board believes that the Groups system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk, provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
