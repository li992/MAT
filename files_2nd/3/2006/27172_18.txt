Statement of Corporate Governance Introduction The Company is committed to a high standard of corporate governance.
Accordingly, the Board has put in place a framework for corporate governance, which it believes is appropriate for an investment trust and which enables it to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance Code for listed companies published in July 2003.
The Association of Investment Companies AIC also published the AIC Code on Corporate Governance as amended in February 2006 the AIC Code, which complements the Code and represents a framework of best practice in certain areas of governance where the specific characteristics of investment companies suggest alternative approaches that may be preferable to those set out in the Code.
There is a certain amount of overlap with the Code, although the focus of attention is on the points of difference.
Application of the Code The Board is accountable to the Companys Shareholders for good governance and this statement describes how the principles identified in the Code have been applied by the Company.
Save for the exceptions noted below, the Company has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require the Board to report on compliance with the Code provisions throughout the year.
In instances where the Code and AIC Code differ, an explanation will be given as to which Code has been applied and the reason for that decision.
The exception to compliance with the Code, which is explained more fully under the heading of The Board is as follows: x a senior independent non-executive Director has not been appointed A 3.3 : and, x there is no separate internal audit function C 3.5.
The Board The Board consists of five non-executive Directors, all of whom are considered to be independent of the Manager Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited or the Manager and free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct.
It should be noted that: x the Chairman was independent on appointment and, in compliance with the AIC Code, continues to be so.
Biographies of the Directors appear on pages 4 to 6 of this report and indicate their high level and range of industrial, commercial and professional experience, within an international perspective.
The Board sets the Companys values and objectives and ensures that its obligations to its Shareholders are met.
During the year ended 31 December 2006 the Board met seven times and also held a Strategy Meeting.
The primary focus at regular Board Meetings is a review of investment performance and associated matters, including gearing, asset allocation, marketing and investor relations, peer group information and industry issues.
Between these meetings, the Board maintains regular contact with the Manager.
It has formally adopted a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it for decision, thus ensuring that it maintains full and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues.
These matters include: x the maintenance of clear investment objectives and risk management policies.
x the monitoring of the business activities of the Company ranging from analysis of investment performance through to annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting and variance analysis.
x Companies Act requirements such as the approval of the interim and annual Financial Statements and approval and recommendation of the interim and final dividends respectively.
x setting the level of gearing which the Manager may operate.
x Board appointments and removals and the related terms subject to appropriate Shareholder approval.
x appointment and removal of the Manager and the terms and conditions of the management and administration agreements relating thereto.
x terms of reference and membership of Board Committees.
x Stock Exchange UK Listing Authority Financial Services Authority responsibility such as approval of all circulars, listing particulars and approval of all releases concerning matters decided by the Board.

Murray International Trust PLC 37 Statement of Corporate Governance continued The Chairman of the Company is a non-executive Director.
A senior non-executive Director has not been appointed as all the Directors are non-executive and the Board considers that each of the Directors has different qualities and areas of expertise on which they may lead.
Consequently no one individual has unfettered powers of decision.
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Companys expense.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the corporate Company Secretary through its appointed representatives who are responsible to the Board: x for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with.
x under the direction of the Chairman, for ensuring good information flows with the Board and its committees, as well as facilitating induction and assisting with professional development as required.
x for advising through the Chairman on all corporate governance matters.
When a Director is appointed, an induction meeting is arranged by the Manager.
Directors are provided, on a regular basis, with key information on the Companys policies, regulatory and statutory requirements and internal controls.
Changes affecting Directors responsibilities are advised to the Board as they arise.

Internal Control The Board of Directors of Murray International Trust has overall responsibility for the Companys system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Directors confirm that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company, that has been in place for the full year under review and up to the date of approval of the Financial Statements, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control and, in particular, it has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks faced by the Company and the policies and procedures by which these risks are managed.
The Directors have delegated the investment management of the Companys assets to the Manager within overall guidelines and this embraces implementation of the system of internal control, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
Internal control systems are monitored and supported by an internal audit function which undertakes periodic examination of business processes, including compliance with the terms of the management agreement, and ensures that recommendations to improve controls are implemented.
Risks are identified and documented through a risk management framework by each function within the Managers activities.
Risk is considered in the context of the TurnbuIl guidance and includes financial, regulatory, market operational and reputational risk.
This helps the internal audit risk assessment model identify those functions for review.
Any weaknesses identified are reported to the Company and timetables are agreed for implementing improvements to systems.
The implementation of any remedial action required is monitored and feedback provided to the Company.
The key components designed to provide effective internal control for the year under review and up to the date of this Report are outlined below: x the Investment Manager prepares forecasts and management accounts which allow the Board to assess the Companys activities and review its investment performance: x the Board and Investment Manager have agreed clearly defined investment criteria: Murray International Trust PLC 41 Statement of Corporate Governance continued x specified levels of authority and exposure limits.
Reports on these issues, including performance statistics and investment valuations, are regularly submitted to the Board.
The Investment Managers evaluation procedure and financial analysis of the companies concerned include detailed appraisal and due diligence: x as a matter of course the compliance department of Aberdeen Asset Managers continually reviews the Investment Managers operations: x written agreements are in place which specifically define the roles and responsibilities of the Investment Manager and other third party service providers: x the Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but, because of the compliance and internal control systems in place at the Investment Manager, has decided to place reliance on the Investment Managers systems and internal audit procedures: and x twice a year, at its Board meetings, the Board carries out an assessment of internal controls by considering documentation from the Manager, including its internal audit and compliance functions and taking account of events since the relevant period end.
In addition, the Manager ensures that clearly documented contractual arrangements exist in respect of any activities that that have been delegated to external professional organisations.
The Head of Internal Audit of the Manager reports six monthly to the Audit Committee of the Company and has direct access to the Directors at any time.
The internal control systems are designed to meet the Companys particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed.
Accordingly, the internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, by their nature, can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Socially Responsible Investment Policy Aberdeen Asset Managers gives due weight to what it considers to be socially responsible investment when making investment decisions but the overriding objective is to produce good investment returns for Shareholders.
The Manager votes against resolutions that it considers might damage Shareholders rights or economic interests.
Exercise of Voting Powers The Company has operated a corporate governance voting policy which, in summary, is based on the governance recommendations of the Code, with the intention of voting in accordance with best practice, whilst remaining a primary focus on financial returns.
In the case of the Companys investments, the Company has given discretionary voting powers to the Investment Manager, Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited.
