40 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Corporate governance Statement of compliance with the Combined Code Throughout the year ended 4 January 2007 the Company has been in compliance with Section 1 of the July 2003 edition of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code with the following exceptions: as a result of the process of Board refreshment, including the appointment of a new Chairman on 1 December 2006, the Board considered the results of the performance review undertaken during 2005, but did not undertake a full performance evaluation during the year.
Further, whilst the Senior Independent Director led a meeting of the non-executive Directors, this meeting considered the role to be taken by a new Chairman and not the performance of the retiring Chairman.
The Board expects to undertake a performance review during 2007.
The Board has considered, and where appropriate implemented, the guidelines on corporate social responsibility issued by the Association of British Insurers.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council the Company has adopted the June 2006 version of the Code on a voluntary basis for the year beginning 5 January 2007.
This statement describes how the Company has applied the main and supporting principles of the Code.
It should be read in conjunction with the Business review and Remuneration report on pages 14 to 35 and pages 45 to 50 respectively.
The Board maintains a Corporate Governance Manual which is reviewed and updated annually.
Directors The Board The Board is collectively responsible to the Companys shareholders for the success of the Company.
The Board is satisfied it has met the Codes requirements for its effective operation.
It has set the Companys strategic aims, which were reviewed during the year and has ensured that there is a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed.
The Board set the Companys values and standards which are set out in the Statement of Core Values and Ethics Policy, both of which are referred to on page 30 in the Business review.
The Board met formally nine times during the year to review current performance against agreed objectives and to make and review major business decisions.
There is a schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board, including the acquisition of companies, significant contractual commitments, the review of the effectiveness of risk management processes, major capital expenditure and corporate responsibility.
Various matters are delegated to duly authorised sub-committees of the Board.
During 2006, a number of important changes were made to the Board.
On 20 February Mark Robertshaw became Chief Operating Officer, in addition to his role as Chief Financial Officer.
Joe MacHale became Senior Independent Director on 20 April.
Following the retirement of Warren Knowlton on 3 August, Mark Robertshaw was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Kevin Dangerfield joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer.
Tim Stevenson was appointed as non-executive Chairman on 1 December, following the retirement of Lars Kylberg.
As at 4 January 2007, the Board comprises Tim Stevenson, Chairman: Mark Robertshaw, Chief Executive Officer: two other executive Directors and three independent non-executive Directors.
Joe MacHale is the Senior Independent Director.
Biographies of the Directors are set out on page 37.
All Directors submit themselves for re-election at least once every three years, and for reappointment by the shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment.

During 2006, the Chairman and the non-executive Directors met without the executive Directors present.
Following the previous Chairmans announcement to the Board of his intention to retire, the non-executive Directors, led by Joe MacHale, the Senior Independent Director, met without the Chairman present in order to assess the role to be played by his successor.
An appropriate Directors and Officers liability insurance policy is in place.
Corporate governance The Morgan Crucible Company plc 41 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman, who is responsible for running the Board, and the Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for running the Companys business, is clearly established and agreed by the Board.
Board balance and independence In the year under review, the Company complied with the requirement of the Code that there should be a balance of executive and non-executive Directors.
At the year end, in addition to the Chairman, whom the Company deemed to be independent on appointment, the Board comprised three executive Directors and three independent non-executive Directors.
Appointments to the Board As is further detailed in the report of the Nomination Committee, set out on page 44, there is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for appointments to the Board.
The Board is satisfied that there are succession plans in place for appointments to the Board and for senior management.
Information and professional development The Board receives, in a timely manner, information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties, with Board papers generally sent out five days before each meeting.
All Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board, and have letters of appointment confirming what is expected of them.
Training needs are assessed as part of the Board Performance Review process and the Directors regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge, including their familiarity with the Company.
In addition to the Directors visiting operations and meeting with management, each year at least one Board meeting is normally held at an operating facility.
During 2006 the Board meeting which had been planned for an operating facility was moved to the head office location as this was during the period that the Company was subject to a possible offer.
As part of his induction, the new Chairman has visited a number of operating facilities of the Group.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who is also responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are observed.
The Directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Companys expense in connection with their duties as Directors, and a procedure is in place to facilitate this.
Performance evaluation As noted above, during the year the Board considered the results of the formal performance review undertaken during 2005 but due to the refreshment of the Board during the year, including the appointment of the new Chairman on 1 December 2006, did not undertake a further performance review during 2006.
Further, although the Senior Independent Director led a meeting of the non-executive Directors, the meeting considered the role to be played by the new Chairman, not the performance of the retiring Chairman.
The Board plans to undertake a further performance review during the course of 2007 with the Chairmans performance to be reviewed in the latter part of the year.
Remuneration Remuneration policy and practice is discussed in the Remuneration report on pages 45 to 50.
Accountability and audit The assessment of the Companys position and prospects as required by the Code is included in the Business review on pages 14 to 35.
The Board also presents updated information in its Interim reports and other price sensitive announcements.
A summary of the statement of Directors responsibilities in respect of the Annual report and the financial statements is set out on page 44 and the going concern statement is set out in the Business review on page 26.
Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the Companys assets.
Through the Audit Committee, the Board reviews the effectiveness of the internal control system annually.
This review covers all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk management systems.
Over the past year, internal audits have been focused in emerging countries to help ensure that practices are brought into line with Morgan codes of conduct and business ethics.
As is detailed further in the Business review, the anti-competitive behaviour compliance programme is ongoing.
The review of internal controls also includes consideration of the Turnbull Risk Review and the effectiveness of the various risk management systems in place to manage the risks identified.
The Board delegates the establishment and implementation of the systems for internal control and risk management to the operating Divisions which are responsible for the identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of business together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.
The Board delegates the monitoring and review of the internal control and risk management systems to the Audit Committee assisted by the Risk Management Committee.
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, reviews the full range of risks faced by Morgan Crucible as a Group, ensures there are adequate systems in place and evaluates their effectiveness.
Where necessary, the Risk Management Committee will initiate action to improve the systems and ensure compliance.
42 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Corporate governance The Directors believe that the Groups system of internal financial controls provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the assets of the Group are safeguarded: transactions are authorised and recorded in a correct and timely manner: and that such controls would prevent and detect, within a timely period, material errors or irregularities.
The system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risk and to address key business and financial risks, including social, environmental and ethical risks.
The internal control framework complements the Groups management structure.
The main features of the formal system for assessing the potential risks to which the Group is exposed are summarised as follows: Financial reporting A detailed budgeting system for each Division exists with an annual consolidated budget reviewed and approved by the Board.
Businesses present their revenue and capital expenditure budgets for approval.
Monthly results for the Group are presented to the Executive Committee and the Board, including comparisons against budget and the prior year.
The Groups annual and half yearly results are reported externally, in addition to appropriate trading statements.
The annual results are audited and the half yearly results are reviewed by the auditors.
Performance monitoring There are regular meetings of the Board and of the Executive Committee.
A comparison of forecast and actual results is considered, including cash flows and comparisons against budget and the prior year.
Divisional management also meets regularly to review performance.
Presentations of actual and forecast performance are made to the Executive Committee by the Groups Divisional Chief Executive Officers.
In addition, regular site visits are made by members of the Executive Committee.
Risk management The identification of major business risks is an ongoing process, and, as noted in the Internal Control section, this is carried out in conjunction with operating management.
Steps are taken to mitigate or manage any material risks identified.
The Board, either directly or through the Audit Committee, receives reports on financial, treasury, taxation, insurance, pension, legal, information systems and social, environmental and ethical risks from management.
The Divisional Chief Executives cover risk issues at their management meetings and the Director of Operational Risk helps to ensure that internal control and risk management is embedded into the Groups operations.
Risk factors Morgans businesses are affected by a number of factors, many of which are influenced by macroeconomic trends and are therefore outside the Companys immediate control, although as described above and in the Business review, the identification and management of such risks is carried out systematically.
Audit Committee and auditors The Board has formal and transparent arrangements for considering how the Directors apply the financial reporting and internal control principles, and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the Companys auditors.
This requirement is met by the work of the Audit Committee, as described below, and by the audit work carried out by the Companys external auditors, KPMG Audit plc.
The Audit Committee has received confirmation from KPMG Audit plc that its general procedures support the auditors independence and objectivity in relation to non-audit services.
After considering such procedures the opinion of the Audit Committee was that the auditors objectivity and independence was safeguarded despite the provision of non-audit services by KPMG Audit plc.
Relations with shareholders Dialogue with shareholders The importance of dialogue with major shareholders is recognised and meetings are held in order to help achieve a mutual understanding of objectives.
In this respect, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make themselves available to major shareholders as appropriate throughout the year, in particular at the time of the preliminary and interim announcements.
The Senior Independent Director holds separate meetings with major shareholders when requested.
Non-executive Directors also attend investor briefings.
To help facilitate dialogue with shareholders, the Investor Relations section of the Companys website includes details of stock exchange announcements, press releases, presentations, webcasts and other information relevant to investors.
Following the announcement of the Groups Preliminary and Interim results and after other significant statements and presentations, an investor survey is carried out and the results are presented to and discussed by the Board.
Constructive use of the AGM The Annual General Meeting is normally attended by all members of the Board and by a representative of the auditors.
The results of the proxy voting on all resolutions are provided for all attendees.
At the AGM held in April 2006, the Chief Executive Officer made a short business presentation.
Shareholders are also invited to ask questions during the meeting, and have the opportunity to meet the Directors and other members of senior management before and after the formal meeting.

When the cost of services is expected to be in excess of 200,000 a competitive tender process is normally used.
The external auditors have processes in place to safeguard their independence and have written to the Committee confirming that, in their opinion, they are independent.

In the light of this review, the Committee prepares a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors are available for inspection.
Their letters of appointment set out the expected time commitment, since non-executive Directors are asked to undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet their commitments to the Company.
