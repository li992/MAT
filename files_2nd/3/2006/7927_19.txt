Statutory Reports Corporate Governance Report The Board of Directors the Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which it sees as a cornerstone in managing the business affairs of the Group and a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities.
Applicable Corporate Governance Provisions Throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report, the Group has complied with the governance rules and best practice provisions applying to UK listed companies as contained in section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate 41 Governance the Code which was introduced in 1998 and further revised during 2003 and 2006, although this latest revision is not anticipated to come into effect until the second quarter of 2007.
Since Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC, the Group also complies with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are applicable to foreign large accelerated filers.
In the light of this ongoing obligation, a programme of activity was put in place to enable the Group to meet the further requirements with regard to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which are applicable for the first time in respect of the financial year ended 30 September 2006.
Corporate Governance Compliance The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the Groups standard of governance and this report, together with the Directors Remuneration Report, seeks to demonstrate how the principles of good governance, advocated by the Code, have been and continue to be applied in practice within the Group.
During the course of the financial year there has been continued rationalisation of the Groups activities.
Notwithstanding the ongoing organisational changes, the Board and its Audit Committee have continued to keep under review the Groups entire system of internal control, encompassing both financial and operational controls, as well as compliance and risk management.
Based on these reviews the Board is satisfied that an appropriate internal control framework is in place across the whole Group.
Throughout the Group, formal procedures, including well established and embedded internal controls, have been and continue to be maintained.
Such procedures, together with continued regular formal reporting to the Audit Committee, have ensured the maintenance of a strong procedural framework for the ongoing identification, evaluation and management of the significant areas of risk to achievement of the Groups strategic objectives.
As previously reported, certain investigations were initiated by German authorities in January 2003 into alleged foreign trading and related violations by a number of people, including Reemtsma employees during a period prior to its acquisition by the Group.
A number of former and current employees have been interviewed and the German authorities have sought assistance from several other jurisdictions to obtain evidence.
These investigations are continuing but in the course of 2005 parts of the investigations into certain of the individuals were terminated on terms agreed by the individuals with the authorities and settlement was made of any duty payable as a result of certain of the activities being investigated at no cost to the Group.
In 2006, investigations against some of the other individuals were terminated for lack of evidence.
Charges relating to smuggling have been brought in connection with one of the investigations against 18 individuals, one of whom is a former Reemtsma employee.
The continuing investigations and any ensuing trials could take several years to be concluded.
If employees are ultimately found to have committed offences, the authorities could impose penalties on Reemtsma for which the Group would seek recovery under arrangements made on the acquisition of the business.
A Board Committee established in 2003, under the Chairmanship of Mr A G L Alexander, remains in place to monitor the progress of the investigations and the Groups responses on behalf of the Board.
The German authorities investigations are based on alleged activities prior to the Groups acquisition of Reemtsma and the Committee remains satisfied that, since the acquisition, the Group has not been involved in any activities of a nature similar to those alleged by the German authorities.
As previously reported, information was supplied by Imperial Tobacco and a number of other companies to the UK Office of Fair Trading the OFT in October 2003 in relation to an enquiry into the operations of the UK tobacco supply chain.
Further information was supplied in April 2005 but to date no substantive response to any of the information submitted has been received from the OFT.
If the OFT were to decide that there are grounds for an infringement decision against the Group, it would issue a Statement of Objections setting out its preliminary findings and the basis for those findings.
Imperial Tobacco would then have an opportunity to respond to these preliminary findings.
If the OFT were subsequently to make an infringement finding, Imperial Tobacco would be able to appeal the OFTs infringement decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
As at 27 October 2006, the OFT has not issued a Statement of Objections or publicly announced an intention to do so and as such the Board is unable to predict the outcome of this enquiry.
However, in the event that the OFT decides that a company has infringed UK competition law, it may impose a fine.
The amount of the fine is calculated by reference to the turnover of the infringing company.
The rules regarding the maximum amount of such a penalty changed on 1 May 2004.
Before that date, the maximum amount of a fine was 10 per cent of a companys UK turnover for up to three years.
In the three years to 30 September 2003 our aggregate net UK turnover was 2,215 million.
Under the revised rules, a fine may not exceed 10 per cent of a companys worldwide turnover.
However, the OFTs guidelines state that where an infringement ended before 1 May 2004, the fine may not exceed the maximum penalty under the old rules.
In either case, the applicable turnover on which the amount of a fine is based expressly excludes VAT and other taxes directly related to turnover, which we have been advised would also exclude duty.
In addition, if the OFT were to make an infringement finding, it could issue orders prohibiting that activity in the future.
com Statutory Reports Corporate Governance Report continued During the course of the year business reviews of the Groups operations and reviews performed in preparation for conformance to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, have been performed as part of the Group Compliance Functions programme of activity.
This has highlighted a number of controls requiring minor remediation work which is being completed.
From reports to the Group Compliance Function by the business operations of any potential instances of fraud or accounting irregularity that may have occurred during the financial year, the Audit Committee concluded that neither individually nor collectively did they have 42 a material impact on the results or performance of the Group for the financial year.
Board and Board Committees Board Structure The Board of Directors, which met seven times during the year with two of the meetings having a duration of two days, currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, six independent Non-Executive Directors, one Non-Executive Director not classified, for the purposes of the Code, as independent when determining the composition of the Board or its Committees and five Executive Directors.
There is a clear separation of the roles of Chairman, Mr D C Bonham, and Chief Executive, Mr G Davis, to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the whole Board with the Chief Executive, in conjunction with the Chief Executives Committee, responsible for managing the Group and implementing the strategy and policies which have been set by the Board.
Mr I J G Napier is Joint Vice Chairman alongside Mr A G L Alexander, Chairman designate and the recognised senior independent Non-Executive Director to whom any concerns can be conveyed by shareholders.
Following the 2006 Board evaluation and consideration of all other relevant factors contained in the Code and the NYSE Corporate Governance rules, the Board concluded at its meeting in September 2006 that all Non-Executive Directors continue to contribute effectively and constructively to Board debate, to challenge and question management objectively and robustly and at all times to have the best interests of the Group in mind and that, taking account of these factors, together with the other relevant factors contained in the Code and the NYSE Corporate Governance rules, all eight Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman remain independent for the purposes of the NYSE Corporate Governance rules and all seven Non-Executive Directors excluding the Chairman as required by the Code remain independent for the purposes of the Code.
However, recognising the general external focus under the Code on directors who have served in excess of nine years, the Company is no longer going to classify Mr A G L Alexander, for the purposes of the Code, as an independent Director when determining the composition of the Board and its Committees.
For the time being Mr A G L Alexander will remain on the Board to ensure continuity at senior Board level pending Mr I J G Napier succeeding Mr D C Bonham as Chairman during 2007.
Mr A G L Alexander is not a member of any of the Board Committees other than the Nominations Committee.
In accordance with the Groups policy, Mr A G L Alexander, having served in excess of nine years, will offer himself for re-election at the Companys 2007 AGM.
In addition, given his imminent change of role, Mr I J G Napier will also offer himself for re-election.
The Directors biographies, appearing on pages 36 and 37, demonstrate a detailed knowledge of the tobacco industry and the wider Fast Moving Consumer Goods sector together with a range of business and financial experience which is vital to the management of an expanding international company.
The biographies also include details of their other major directorships.
Board Changes During the year the Nominations Committee again reviewed the composition and balance of the Board.
This review took into account not only the overall balance of skills, knowledge and experience of Board members but also of the wider provisions of the Code and the results of the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors.
The Board performance evaluation in 2005 identified that, given the Groups expansion within the Asia Pacific region, recruiting new Non-Executive Directors with international, and specifically Asian, experience would enhance the skill set of the Board.
As a result the Nominations Committee produced two role profiles for an external search consultancy to identify suitable candidates.
Subsequently Dr K M Burnett and Mr C F Knott joined the Board on 19 April 2006 as Non-Executive Directors having been identified as fitting the criteria.
As part of the ongoing review of the composition and balance of the Board it was announced, on 23 May 2006, that Mr I J G Napier would succeed Mr D C Bonham as Chairman during 2007.
Prior to this appointment a role profile of the competences, experience and time commitment required by any potential candidate for the position of Chairman was produced by the Nominations Committee.
It was determined by the Nominations Committee that Mr I J G Napiers skills and experience so closely matched this profile that it was unlikely that a more suitable candidate would be found by conducting an external search or undertaking open advertising.
During all discussions of the Chairmans succession the Nominations Committee was chaired by Mr A G L Alexander and once Mr I J G Napier had been identified as a potential candidate he was excluded from all such discussions.
As also announced on 23 May 2006, Mr I J G Napier will cease to be a director of Taylor Woodrow plc by spring 2007.
On 28 October 2005 Mr G L Blashill was appointed to the Board as Group Sales and Marketing Director.
As reported last year, the Board accepted Mr D W Thursfields resignation with effect from 28 October 2005.
Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans both retired from the Board following the conclusion of the 2006 AGM.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Statutory Reports The opportunity exists for major shareholders to meet with new and existing Directors.
Directors also made themselves available to meet shareholders after the formal business of the AGM had been completed.

These reviews were conducted by way of detailed questionnaires, completed by the Directors.
A report on the performance of the Board as a whole and of the Board Committees was made to the Board at its meeting in September 2006.
Feedback on individual Directors was discussed with the Chairman and this in turn was followed by private feedback meetings between the Chairman and each of the Directors.
In line with the provisions of the Code the performance of Mr I J G Napier was subjected to particularly rigorous review in light of him having served for six years.
This review was conducted as part of the Chairman succession process.
In addition, an opportunity was taken at the Board meeting in September 2006 for Mr I J G Napier, the senior independent Non-Executive Director, to meet with the Non-Executive Directors as a group, without the Chairman present, to consider the performance of the Chairman.
After also taking account of the views of the Executive Directors and the results of the Chairmans formal performance evaluation, Mr I J G Napier held a private feedback meeting with the Chairman.
During the course of the year the Chairman additionally held meetings exclusively with the Non-Executive Directors to consider, amongst other things, the performance of the Executive Directors in the discharge of their duties.
Following these reviews the Board and its Committees are satisfied that they are operating and performing effectively and that, notwithstanding the ongoing Board refreshment, there remains a high degree of Board unity.
No fundamental issues or training needs that require addressing were identified and the Board is also satisfied that each of the current Directors has sufficient time and commitment to contribute effectively to the Board and its Committees.
Accordingly, the Board recommends that Messrs A G L Alexander, I J G Napier, D Cresswell, together with Dr F A Rogerson should stand for re-election, and Dr K M Burnett and Mr C F Knott should stand for election, at the 2007 AGM.
The key theme which emerged from the review related to the need to ensure the Board continues to maintain an appropriate balance between strategic matters and those relating to governance and the wider industry.
The key themes of succession and the desirability of one or more additional Non-Executive Directors with international experience, specifically within the Asia region, identified in the 2005 evaluation were addressed during the year with the announcement of the appointment of Mr I J G Napier as Chairman Designate and the appointments of Dr K M Burnett and Mr C F Knott to the Board.
As reported last year, following the disclosure of individual Directors external commitments as part of the 2005 evaluation, the Board accepted that Mr D W Thursfields increasing level of external commitments was likely to have an adverse impact on his availability for Board and Committee matters.
As a consequence, the Board accepted Mr D W Thursfields resignation with effect from 28 October 2005.
The Board plans to conduct evaluations on an annual basis and may employ alternative formats and approaches in future years.
Board Operations The Board is the principal decision making forum of the Group and manages overall control of the Groups affairs by the schedule of matters reserved for its decision contained in the Groups Corporate Manual.
These include, inter-alia, responsibility for the Groups commercial strategy, the approval of financial statements and corporate plans, the overall corporate governance framework, www.

The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters and for ensuring Board procedures are followed and applicable rules and regulations complied with.
All Directors are equally accountable in law for the proper stewardship of the Groups affairs, with the Non-Executive Directors having a 44 particular responsibility for ensuring that strategies proposed for the development of the business, resources and standards of conduct are critically reviewed using their independent judgement and experience.
This ensures that the Board acts in the best long term interest of shareholders, takes account of the wider community of interest represented by employees, customers and suppliers and that environmental and ethical issues are fully integrated into the Groups risk assessment processes.
During the year the principal matters considered by the Board included the Board changes detailed above, review of the strategy and operating results of the business, monitoring and if appropriate approval of major projects, for example the acquisition of the worldwide rights to the Davidoff cigarette trademark, approval of annual and medium term plans, return of capital to shareholders through share buybacks, feedback from results presentations to institutional shareholders, review of the Groups non-financial reporting framework, consideration of the three-year occupational health safety and environment trends and priorities within the Group and review of Group funding arrangements, including the renewal of the Groups European Medium Term Note programme.
Actual results of the Group were reviewed at each Board meeting, with monthly reports, including detailed commentary and analysis, being provided in the intervening periods.
This ensured that the Board was supplied with information on the progress of the business in a timely manner and that the Directors were properly briefed on issues arising at Board Meetings.
All Board members receive reports from the chairmen of all Board Committees and receive copies of the Committees minutes.
The Non-Executive Directors also play a leading role in corporate accountability and governance through their membership of the Remuneration Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Audit Committee.
The membership and remit of each Committee are considered below, together with a record of each Directors attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings during the year.
As part of the Groups policy of annual review, the terms of reference for each of these Committees were reviewed during the year and are published on the Imperial Tobacco website www.

Responsibilities The responsibilities of the Committee include the evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, the development of role specifications, the formulation of succession plans and the making of recommendations to the Board with regard to the appointment of Directors.
In the financial year the Committee, after taking into account the Board evaluation and succession plans, produced role profiles for two new Non-Executive Directors and a successor to the Chairman, and following the identification of suitable candidates made a number of recommendations to the Board resulting in the appointments as detailed in the Board Changes section above.
Any Directors appointed by the Board must submit themselves for election by shareholders at the AGM following their appointment.
Thereafter all Directors, in accordance with the Code, are subject to re-election at least every three years.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Statutory Reports Audit Committee Membership The Audit Committee, consisting exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, met four times during the year and members attendance is set out in the table on page 45.
The members of the Committee during the year were: 47 Mr C R Day appointed and chairman 31 January 2006 : Dr P H Jungels: Mr C F Knott appointed 6 September 2006 : Ms S E Murray appointed 31 January 2006 : Mr I J G Napier: Mr A G L Alexander stepped down 31 January 2006 : and Mr S P Duffy chairman until retirement from the Board 31 January 2006.
Messrs C R Day, C F Knott and I J G Napier are qualified accountants and are therefore appropriately qualified to discharge the responsibilities that Audit Committee membership entails and are regarded as financial experts for the purposes of both the Code and section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Responsibilities The Committees terms of reference cover the matters recommended by the Code and are published on the Imperial Tobacco website www.
During the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report the Committee worked with a structured agenda of matters focused to coincide with key events of the annual financial reporting cycle, together with standing items that the Committee is required to consider at each meeting.
These responsibilities included, inter alia: monitoring internal control throughout the Group: approving the Groups accounting policies: reviewing the interim and annual financial statements, together with the US filing on Form 20-F, prior to submission to the Board: reviewing the scope of the external Audit plan and the internal Group Compliance work plan: consideration of any related party matters: review of Auditor independence: consideration of and recommendations to the Board regarding the reappointment of the Auditors: review of non audit fees paid to the Auditors: review of the Going Concern statement prior to consideration by the Board: oversight and monitoring of the Groups Public Interest Disclosure Whistleblowing policy: and review of risk management systems.
During the year the Head of Group Compliance provided the Committee with detailed reports to facilitate the regular monitoring and review of its activities and effectiveness including those in respect of the programme of activity in place to enable the Group to meet the requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The Committee undertook its annual review of the scope and content of the risk assessment and compliance programme implemented by the Group Compliance Function and confirmed its approval.
The Committee continually monitors and critically reviews the authority, effectiveness and level of resource allocated to the activity.
The Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the Head of Group Compliance, the Deputy Company Secretary and other financial management were invited to attend each meeting of the Committee and a standing item on each agenda allowed for the Head of Group Compliance to meet formally with the Committee, without any Executive Director or other manager being present, in line with the Codes requirements.
In addition, the Groups Auditors attended each meeting of the Committee during the year and, as a standing item on each agenda, met with the Committee members without the presence of any Executive Director or other manager, providing a direct line of communication between the Auditors and Non-Executive Directors.
Auditor Independence Policy The Group regularly reviews its Auditor Independence Policy document, which provides clear definitions of services that the external Auditors can and cannot provide such that their independence and objectivity are not impaired.
The policy also establishes a formal authorisation process, including the tendering and pre-approval by the Audit Committee for allowable non-audit work that they may perform and establishes guidelines for the recruitment of employees or former employees of the external Auditors.
This policy is published on the Groups website www.
com Statutory Reports Corporate Governance Report continued The Audit Committee also carried out bi-annual reviews of the remuneration received by the Auditors for audit services, audit related services and non-audit work with the aim of seeking to balance objectivity, value for money and compliance with this policy.
The outcome of these reviews was not only that performance of the relevant non-audit work by the Auditors was the most cost-effective way of conducting the Groups business but also that no conflict of interest existed between such audit and non-audit work.
The fees for such non-audit work within the financial year were principally related to tax advisory work associated with the reorganisation of legal entities within the Group including the review of work undertaken by other accounting firms prior to implementation, Sarbanes-Oxley 48 section 404 compliance and assistance in preparing the Group for compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards, which became effective for the financial year ending 30 September 2006.
In other situations, proposed assignments were subject to independent tendering with decisions taken on the basis of competence and cost-effectiveness.
Following a review during the year by the Audit Committee of the scope, efficiency and effectiveness of the audits performed by the Auditors it was agreed that the Group continues to receive an efficient, effective and independent audit service.
Internal control The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviewed the effectiveness of the system in accordance with the guidance set out in the Code from information and regular reports provided by management, the internally independent Group Compliance Function and external Auditors.
However, given the size and complexity of the Groups operations, such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of meeting internal control objectives by managing rather than eliminating risk and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board, either directly, or through the Audit Committee, regularly reviewed the effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control.
It confirms that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Groups significant risks operated throughout the year and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report.
The Group has established control processes and procedures to ensure compliance with the best practice governance provisions as advocated by the Turnbull Guidance, and to comply with any relevant US governance and control provisions.
The provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require US listed companies to adopt a generally accepted framework of control, advocating the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO as appropriate.
The Group considers its approach, methodology and actions in support of maintaining high standards of corporate governance satisfies the requirements of both the Turnbull guidance and COSO.
The following key features have operated to provide reassurance of both the reliability of information and the safeguarding of assets: Risk assessment: The Group has clearly set out its strategic objectives as part of its medium term planning process.
These objectives are incorporated as part of the annual planning cycle: A detailed assessment of strategic risks was undertaken by the Executive Directors as part of the medium term planning and annual and monthly forecasting reporting cycles: All areas of the business undertook risk-profiling exercises to formally review their principal areas of risk so that all major risks were reviewed at all levels across the Group.
This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment summaries from each of the business operations identifying their major areas of business risk, together with the controls embedded in the business processes to mitigate such risks.
This review is ongoing throughout all business operations of the Group to ensure that there continues to be clear and consistent procedures for monitoring, updating and implementing appropriate controls to minimise the risk exposure so identified: The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance risks on a regular basis.
The Group Compliance Function formally reported at each Audit Committee meeting the outcome of its ongoing activities, including its programme of reviews relating to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and any more general business reviews.
These reports have supported the Audit Committee and the Board in assessing the effectiveness of internal controls within the business operations.
In this way, the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the Groups exposure to major business risks is minimised such that the levels of retained risk are acceptable to the Group: and A summary of the principal risks facing the business is included on page 14.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Statutory Reports Control environment and control activities: The Group is organised on a functional basis with manufacturing, sales and marketing and central support functions each having their own management and control structures which satisfy the Groups controls, accounting policies and regulatory responsibilities: The Board continually reviews the Groups organisational structure to ensure that clearly defined lines of responsibility with appropriate delegation of authority and segregation of duties exist, with personnel of the necessary calibre in place to fulfil their roles.
Such delegated authority ensures that decisions, significant either because of their value or impact on other parts of the Group, are 49 taken at an appropriate level: The Board has formally adopted, and annually reviews, the schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational or compliance nature, which are required to be brought to it for decision: The Group has an established framework of policies and procedures laid down by the Board which personnel are expected to comply with.
These cover key issues such as authorisation levels, segregation of duties, ethical compliance matters and legislation, physical and data security as well as regulatory, governance, and health, safety and environmental issues.
This framework of policies and procedures, which has been developed and issued, with consistent communication throughout the Group, is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to ensure it continues to provide the requisite control guidance and remains pertinent to the Groups business activities: As part of the Groups work for compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act during the year, further documentation and controls associated with establishing the structure of this framework have all been completed: A formal policy and arrangements for dealing in confidence with issues of genuine and significant concern raised by employees or others relating to perceived malpractice, improper business practices, management impropriety or other similar matters, whether financial or non-financial commonly referred to as Whistleblowing arrangements operates throughout the Group: The Group has an established and consistent methodology for ranking the level of risk from each of its business operations and identifying significant risk issues associated therewith.
Appropriate strategies have been implemented to deal with each significant risk that has been identified, including not only internal controls but also other external measures such as insurance and dual sourcing of supplies: There are well-defined procedures for appraisal, approval, control and review of capital and strategic expenditure including acquisitions: and The Groups treasury function operates within a well defined policy designed to control the Groups financing arrangements and to minimise its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks through treasury instruments.
Information and communication: Each area of the business produced detailed financial plans, prior to the start of the financial year, which were reviewed for robustness and realism: and A comprehensive system of controls, including regular periodic performance reviews for each area of the business, ensured that major variances against plan were promptly and thoroughly investigated.
These reviews were conducted at a detailed level within each function and at a high level by the Chief Executives Committee.
The achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, were assessed on a regular basis using a range of key performance indicators.
These indicators are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and reliable.
Monitoring: A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal controls across the Group.
