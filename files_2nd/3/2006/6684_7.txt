CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance.
The board is accountable to the companys shareholders for good corporate governance.
This statement describes how the principles of corporate governance are applied to the company and the companys compliance with the Combined Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003.
Statement by the directors on compliance with the provisions of the combined code The company has been in full compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code with the following exceptions: Combined Code reference A.
3.2 Up to the year end, non-executive directors, excluding the chairman, did not comprise at least 50% of the board.
Following the resignation of Christopher Moyes as an executive director, the board now complies with this code provision.
2.1& Given the size of the board, the audit and remuneration committees consist of the non-executive chairman and the C. 3.1 two non-executive directors, and not three non-executive directors as required by the code provisions.
The independence of the chairman and non-executives is subject to ongoing monitoring by the board at least annually.
3.3 In the boards opinion, its size does not justify the appointment of a formally recognised senior independent nonexecutive director.
Furthermore, both of the independent non-executive directors are well known to investors and financial professionals in the UK.
Shareholders should feel free to approach either of them in the event that their contacts with the chairman and executives are deemed unsatisfactory.
The board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to comply with The Turnbull Report:Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
These controls have been reviewed in the light of the revised guidance published in October 2005 and applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
The board The board currently comprises three non-executive directors including the chairman, all of whom are considered to be independent, and two executive directors, and is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the group.
It meets at least every two months, developing and monitoring group strategy and safety standards, setting objectives for the operating subsidiaries of the group, monitoring performance, ensuring adequate funding, examining major acquisition possibilities, formulating policy on key issues and reporting to shareholders.
Day to day responsibility for the operation of group companies, implementation of group strategy and achievement of objectives is delegated to executive management.
Whilst non-executive directors are not appointed for a specified term, all directors are subject to re-election by shareholders following appointment and subsequently at intervals of not more than three years.
The board maintains a group board procedures manual prepared in response to the Combined Code.
It includes formal procedures for the working of the board and its committees, the timely provision of appropriate information to directors, standards of conduct, and the procedures for directors to take independent professional advice, if necessary at the groups expense.
The group maintained Directors and Ofcers liability insurance cover throughout the year as permitted by section 310 of the Companies Act 1985.
This cover was renewed on 30 June 2006.
The board has adopted a procedure for the evaluation of the performance of the board, its committees and individual directors, including the chairman.
The review consists of a questionnaire completed by each of the directors in confidence and analysed by an external consultant.
The findings were presented to and discussed at a meeting of the board where no significant issues were raised.
During the year the board met seven times.
All members of the board attended each meeting, with the exception of Chris Collins and Chris Moyes who each were unable to attend one meeting held during December 2005 and May 2006 respectively.
The chairman and the chief executive There is a clear division of responsibility between the chairman and the chief executive.
The chairman is responsible for leadership of the board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role and setting its agenda, taking into account the issues relevant to the group and the concerns of all board members.
The group chief executive has overall responsibility for group management.
Re-election of directors Sir Patrick Brown joined the board in 1999 as a non-executive director, becoming non-executive chairman in 2002.

Internal controls The board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the groups system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Internal controls are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the groups strategic objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
An ongoing process, in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control, has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group.
The process has been in place for the full year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual review and financial statements.
The board regularly reviews this process.
The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal controls are as follows: a decentralised organisation structure with dened limits of responsibility and authority in accordance with the groups policy and procedures manual: an annual budgeting process with regular re-forecasting of results, identifying key risks and opportunities: monthly financial reporting and review of results by group executives: the company reports to shareholders twice a year: dened capital expenditure approval procedures: and a commitment to best practice in external reporting.
The key processes used by the board to review the effectiveness of the system of internal control include the following: annual review of the group internal control document, which covers both financial and non-financial areas of internal control, and is certied by the respective operating company boards: monthly reporting of financial information to the board encompassing profit and loss, cash ow and balance sheet information and key operating ratios: regular reporting to the board on specic matters including safety, insurance and treasury management: and considering the outcome of the audit committee meetings and the relevant action determined in respect of any control issues raised by internal or external auditors.
Going concern On the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
