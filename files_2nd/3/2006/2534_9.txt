Internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the Companys system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness.
In discharging that responsibility, the Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to apply the Code, including clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority.
These procedures have been in place since the Company listed and will be regularly reviewed by the Board.
Business performance is managed closely and the Board and the Executive Committee have established processes, as part of the normal good management of the business, to monitor: strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress towards strategic objectives: financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, financial reporting, analysing variances against plan and taking appropriate management action: capital investment and asset management performance, with detailed appraisal, authorisation and post investment reviews: and principal risks and risk management processes, which accords with the Turnbull guidance and is supported by reports from the Head of Internal Audit and Risk that the significant risks faced by the Company are being identified, evaluated and appropriately managed, having regard to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity.

In addition, the Audit Committee received: reports from the Head of Internal Audit and Risk on the work carried out under the annual internal audit plan: and reports from the external auditors.
Through the monitoring processes set out above, the Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the year ended 1 October 2006.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and it must be recognised that it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In that context, the review, in the opinion of the Board, did not indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and the Board is not aware of any change to this status up to the approval of this Annual Report.
