In applying the independence test, the Board considers relationships with management, major shareholders, subsidiary and associated companies and other parties with whom the Group transacts business against predetermined materiality thresholds, all of which are set out in the Policy.

BHP Billiton has complied with the Best Practice Recommendations throughout the financial period and has continued to comply up to the date of this Annual Report.
BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc are registrants of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.
Both companies are classified as foreign private issuers and both have American Depositary Receipts listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE.
BHP Billiton has reviewed the governance requirements currently applicable to foreign private issuers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act US including the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules of the NYSE and is satisfied that it complies with those requirements.
Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual has instituted a broad regime of new corporate governance requirements for NYSE-listed companies.
Under the NYSE rules foreign private issuers, such as BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc, are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the requirements of Section 303A, except for the rule relating to compliance with Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10A-3 and certain notification provisions contained in Section 303A of the Listed Company Manual.
11 of the Listed Company Manual, however, requires BHP Billiton to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US-listed companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards.
Following a comparison of BHP Billitons corporate governance practices with the requirements of Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that would otherwise currently apply to foreign private issuers, the following differences were identified: Our Nomination Committee Charter does not include the purpose of developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the corporation.
At BHP Billiton we believe that this task is integral to the governance of the Group and is therefore best dealt with by the Board as a whole.
