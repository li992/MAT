Corporate governance report Throughout the year ended 30 September 2006, the Company has been in compliance with the code provision set out in section 1 of the 2003 FRC Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code.
This report describes Aberdeens corporate governance arrangements, explaining how we have applied the principles of the Code.
The Board The Board currently comprises the Chairman, five Non Executive Directors, and three Executive Directors, all of whom served throughout the year.

The Chairman, Charles Irby, is responsible for the effective conduct of the Board and for shareholder relations, whilst the Chief Executive, Martin Gilbert, is responsible for the day to day management of the Group.
The Board considers all of the Non Executive Directors to be independent and has appointed Donald Waters as the Senior Independent Director.
In considering director independence, the Board has taken into consideration the guidance provided by the Combined Code.
Giles Weaver joined the Board following the acquisition of the Murray Johnstone Group MJ in November 2000.
Giles was formerly an executive director of MJ until December 1999, following which he became chairman of MJ until the acquisition in November 2000.
