INDEPENDENCE OF AUDITORS The Board is aware of the need to maintain an appropriate degree of independence and objectivity on the part of the Group external Auditors.
Both the Audit Committee and the external Auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have safeguards in place to avoid the Auditors independence and objectivity being compromised.
The Group policy with regard to the provision of audit and non-audit services by the external Auditors, which was operated during 2006, is based on the principles that they should only undertake non-audit services where they are the most appropriate and cost-effective provider of the service and where the provision of non-audit services does not impair, or is not perceived to impair, the external Auditors independence and objectivity.
It categorises such services between: Auditor permitted services those services which it is acceptable for the Auditors to provide and the provision of which can be engaged without referral to the Committee e. g. regulatory and other specialist financial reporting: accounting advisory services : Auditor excluded services those engagements that the Committee and the Board do not consider appropriate for the Auditors to undertake e. g. selection, design or implementation of major financial systems: provision of internal audit services or risk management assessment and monitoring services : and Auditor authorised services those services for which the specific approval of the Committee is required before the Auditors are permitted to provide the service e. g. complex tax planning and structure advice, corporate finance and M&A activity.
The policy defines the types of services falling under each category and sets out the criteria to be met and the internal approvals required prior to the commencement of any Auditor Authorised Services.
The Committee regularly reviews an analysis of all services provided by the external Auditors.
The policy is reviewed annually by the Committee and is approved by the Board.
Details of the amounts paid to the external Auditors for audit and non-audit services in 2006 are set out in Note 4 to the Accounts on page 67.
The external Auditors report to the Committee each year on the actions they have taken to comply with professional and regulatory requirements and best practice designed to ensure their independence, including the rotation of key members of the external audit team.
Deloitte & Touche have formally confirmed their independence to the Board in respect of the period covered by these financial statements.
Having reviewed and expressed satisfaction with the level of fees, independence, objectivity, expertise, resources and general effectiveness of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Committee recommends and the Board agrees that a resolution for the re-appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Auditors of the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
