40 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Governance The Board met eight times during the period excluding ad hoc meetings convened to deal with procedural matters.
All directors attended all meetings apart from David Longbottom who was absent from one meeting.
Two meetings were held in overseas locations enabling the non-executive directors to gain first hand experience of markets in which the Group trades and giving local management direct access to members of the Board.
There were meetings of the non-executive directors during the period without the executive directors being present and a meeting between the Senior Independent Director and the other non-executive directors without the Chairman being present.
An annual Board awayday focuses on the longer term strategic direction of the Group and the markets in which it operates.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its principal committees and of their constitutions and processes was undertaken in July 2005.
This included an assessment of the individual members of the Board and of their roles, conducted through one-to-one interviews with the Chairman.
The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, reviewed the leadership and performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive directors.
These processes will be repeated in 2006 07.
The assessment concluded that the structure of the Board and of its committees was robust and that the contributions and the time commitments of their constituent members satisfied the present needs of the business.
The offices of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are held separately and written statements of their responsibilities have been approved by the Board.
The Chairman ensures that the Board has full and timely access to all relevant information and holds occasional meetings with the non-executive directors to discuss corporate strategy and performance.
There is frequent contact between directors outside formal meetings to progress the Groups business and to promote open communication and teamworking.
A corporate governance framework has been approved by the Board defining the role and responsibilities of the constituent elements of the Groups management structure.
This enables the Board to plan, execute, control and monitor the Groups activities so as to achieve its strategic objectives.
All directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice at the Companys expense in the furtherance of their duties.
On appointment, each director receives a tailored induction programme into the Group together with guidance and training appropriate to their level of previous experience.

Pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme, which operates in the UK, comprises a funded defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
Trustees hold the assets of the scheme separately from those of the Group.
There are six trustees: three members of senior management and three external trustees.
The power of appointment of new trustees is vested in the trustees.
Asset management is delegated to three independent companies whose performance is monitored by a specialist performance measurement service.
The schemes accounts are audited annually by Nexia Smith and Williamson Audit Limited, who are not auditors to any Group companies.
Members of the scheme receive an annual statement of their accrued benefits and a copy of the trustees annual report.
The defined benefit section of this scheme has been closed to new members since 1 September 2002.
Membership of the defined contribution section is available to all UK employees of the Group with six months service or more.
Further information about pensions is given in note 27 to the financial statements.
Internal control In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull working party set out in Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, the Group has established and maintained a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control and for confirming that action has been taken to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses that have been identified.
This process was in place throughout the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006 and to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Responsibility and accountability The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness and the Groups approach to risk management.
The Board delegates to executive management the day to day responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks facing the Groups operations, and for implementing and maintaining internal control systems that manage those risks in an efficient and effective manner, appropriate to their nature and scale.
Senior management is responsible and accountable for internal control and risk management and for ensuring compliance with the Groups policies and procedures.
Inherent limitations and continuous improvement In determining its policies on internal control, the Board has regard to the materiality of the relevant risks, the likelihood of losses occurring and the costs of control.
The directors are aware that the inherent limitations in any system of control mean that risk cannot be totally eliminated.
It follows that the Groups system of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate, rather than remove, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
The Groups approach to managing and monitoring internal control and risk assessment is regularly reviewed to identify ways in which it can be improved and further embedded throughout the Groups operations.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 43 Corporate Governance Report continued Control environment and control activities In addition to the corporate governance structure described above, the Groups system of internal control and processes for managing risk comprise the following main elements: the Board and management committees meet regularly to monitor progress against the targets set out in the Groups budget and strategic three year plan and to consider the quarterly re-forecasts of the Groups expected financial period end position.
Financial and non-financial performance reports are produced daily, weekly and four weekly to facilitate this review process: the defined lines of authority established by the Board ensure that significant decisions are taken at an appropriate level.
These include requirements for the approval and control of both capital and operating expenditure, treasury operations and cash management: each business function has established procedures and controls to minimise the risk of fraud and to safeguard the Groups assets: appropriate controls and procedures have been established over the security of data held on, and functionality provided by, the Groups internal and outsourced business systems.
These include disaster recovery arrangements.
The computer systems are periodically tested and reviewed by both internal and external audit functions: the Group appoints individuals who are of a calibre to enable them to discharge the duties and responsibilities of the roles assigned to them.
Established performance review and development mechanisms exist to identify key objectives and areas for improvement for each member of staff.
Succession planning forms an integral part of HR management: Group Treasury operates within established and documented policies and procedures.
The policies are described in the Directors Report on pages 33 and 34 and are reviewed and approved annually by the Group Executive Committee: the Groups programme of insurance covers the material risks to the Groups assets and business and is reviewed annually by the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee: all entities within the Group are required to adhere to common standards of internal control and corporate governance, which are specified in documented guidance: and following major acquisitions, post completion assessments are carried out.
Assurance and monitoring The Board conducts an annual evaluation of the management of risk and the processes of internal control.
The Audit Committee seeks ongoing assurance that the control environment and activities described above are operating effectively and reports at each Board meeting.
Corporate responsibility The Group operates a Corporate Responsibility CR Committee, chaired by the Company Secretary, which meets at least four times annually.
The Group Finance Director is a member of the CR Committee and is the Board member with specific responsibility for social, environmental, ethical and other CR-related matters.
The CR Committee assists the Board in identifying business and reputational risks arising from the conduct of the Groups businesses.
It makes recommendations on measurement tools and audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of systems for managing CR-related matters.
All Board members receive regular updates on CR issues, risks and opportunities and the Board regularly reviews CR issues.
Further information on corporate responsibility is given on pages 20 to 25 and on the corporate website.
Compliance The directors consider that the Company has, throughout the period, complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
