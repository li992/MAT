Remuneration report Composition and role of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee comprises all the non-executive directors as detailed on page 54 and throughout 2002 was chaired by Nick Hodges.
From January 2003, Rob Rowley has been chairman of the committee.
With the exception of Dr Stephan Buck, all members of the remuneration committee in both 2002 and 2003 are considered to be independent in corporate governance terms.
The board believes that Dr Stephan Bucks knowledge of the group and of the market research industry is invaluable to the remuneration committee and therefore supports his position as a committee member.
Mike Petch, Group Human Resources Director and Jane Drysdale, Group Compensation and Benefits Director provide supporting information to the remuneration committee.
The Chairman, Tony Cowling and Chief Executive, Mike Kirkham attend the meetings as required, by invitation.
External advice is received from time to time from New Bridge Street Consultants NBSC on remuneration matters that affect senior executives.
In addition, the group participates in and purchases a number of remuneration surveys, the data from which are used to help formulate remuneration decisions.
NBSC provides compensation advice on other remuneration-related matters to the HR team, but does not undertake tax or audit services, or any other services that may lead to a conflict of interest.
The remuneration committees role is to advise the board on overall remuneration policy and, on its behalf, to determine the remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior executives.
The committees responsibilities are: to ensure that, in determining salary, its policy and practices support business strategy by being competitive and cost-effective: to align the interests of executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders, through the establishment of appropriate short and long-term incentives: to determine performance targets applicable to the annual bonus and long-term incentives: to ensure that the determination of remuneration packages follows formal and transparent procedures.
Remuneration policy The following remuneration principles apply across the group to all employees, including executive directors and senior executives: total remuneration should be structured to facilitate the recruitment and retention of key individuals: remuneration should be competitive in the local and global market places: bonus plans should be in place to encourage delivery against challenging annual financial targets: long-term alignment of individuals interests with company performance should be strengthened through share option plans and equity participation: individuals should have an appropriate balance of salary, short and long-term incentives and benefits within their total remuneration.
Mike Kirkhams and David Lowdens remuneration packages are structured to have a maximum annual cash bonus opportunity of 100 per cent and 75 per cent of base pay respectively.
They also have the opportunity to be considered for an annual grant of options over shares with a maximum market value, at the time of grant, of two times their earnings.
The value of Mike Kirkhams benefits equate to approximately 11 per cent of his base pay and for David Lowden, the benefits value is approximately 9 per cent of base pay.
Tony Cowling is no longer eligible for share option grants and approximately three quarters of his annual remuneration is given in the form of base pay, with the balance being his annual cash bonus plan capped at 75,000, and benefits worth approximately 4 per cent of base pay.
The committee takes into account external market data supplied by independent professional sources.
For benchmarking purposes, the group continues to position itself against companies in the FTSE 250, with a specific focus on those organisations with sector and size similarities.
A number of the groups key senior executives are located outside the UK, for example in France, the Netherlands, the US, Spain and Singapore and so total remuneration is compared internationally and locally, with particular regard to the levels of remuneration in the industries and businesses in which the company competes.
The remuneration committees objective is that cash remuneration is typically positioned at the median of the comparative market place, with high performing individuals able to increase their total remuneration above the median through their annual bonus plans.
The fees of the non-executive directors are a matter reserved for the board as a whole, excluding the non-executive directors.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the companys pension, annual bonus or share option plans.
Chairman and executive directors remuneration elements Base pay This is reviewed annually on 1 January and reflects the rate for the specific role.
Base pay increases recognise external pay movements and individual performance and base pay is the only pensionable element of remuneration.
62 TNS annual report 2002 Annual bonus Executive directors and senior executives have annual cash bonus plans that reward growth in profit and operating margin.
Each years performance provides the platform for the next years targets, giving a continuous drive for higher levels of achievement.
The bonuses are a maximum of 75,000, 100 per cent of base pay and 75 per cent of base pay for Tony Cowling, Mike Kirkham and David Lowden respectively.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentive arrangements are employed as a performance incentive and as a key retention tool.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the 2001 Executive Share Option Plan, the Equity Participation Plan and, in exceptional circumstances, the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Participation is at the discretion of the remuneration committee, subject to plan rules and within the terms of the agreed remuneration policy.
Pension Mike Kirkham and David Lowden are members of a money purchase pension plan governed by an independent trust.
The group contributes 8 per cent of salary for Mike Kirkham and 6 per cent of salary for David Lowden.
Tony Cowlings membership of the plan ceased in January 2002.
Benefits Individual private health insurance, independent financial and taxation counselling and health screening are provided.
There is no company car benefit for any director.
Long-term incentive plans At the annual general meeting in June 2001, shareholders approved two new incentive plans.
These were the 2001 Executive Share Option Plan, which replaced the 1994 Executive Option Plan, and the Equity Participation Plan.
The remuneration committee has agreed that executive directors should be encouraged to hold shares in the group and it is planned that this shareholding will be achieved through a policy of retention of a proportion of the shares gained through the options plans.
2001 Executive Share Option Plan ESP Executive directors and selected employees are eligible to participate in the plan at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Annual grants of options may be made over shares worth up to twice the value of an individuals remuneration.
Grant levels are subject to the individuals performance and value to the business.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years after grant, subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions: for 50 per cent of each grant, growth in EPS before goodwill charges must exceed inflation plus an average of 4 per cent per annum over three years: and for the remaining 50 per cent, growth in EPS before goodwill charges must exceed inflation plus an average of 8 per cent per annum over three years.
If performance conditions have not been met after three years, re-measurement will take place annually for up to two further years, using the original year as a fixed base.
If performance conditions have not been satisfied at this point, the options will lapse.
Fixedbase re-testing is appropriate for this plan, as it is a critical retention tool for the group that demands high levels of performance from its participants.
EPS was chosen as a suitable performance measure, as it provides a meaningful and clear measure of improvement in the companys financial performance and, as it is disclosed in the accounts, is transparent to shareholders.
2001 Equity Participation Plan EPP Shareholders gave authority for this plan in 2001 and it is intended that 2003 will be the first year of its use.
Executive directors and selected employees are eligible to participate in the plan at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Under the plan, employees may deposit company shares to a market value not exceeding 50 per cent of the individuals base salary in any one year.
In return, a matching award will be granted over shares with a market value on the day of grant equal to half the pretax amount, which would have been required by the individual to acquire the deposited shares.
A matching award will normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of its grant, and is conditional upon the deposited shares being retained and the executive remaining in employment at this time.
The plan has been structured to provide an incentive for executives to build and maintain a shareholding in the company through regular annual purchases of shares, thereby creating a clear alignment with shareholders.
As the plan is designed to be highly retentive, it is not the intention of the remuneration committee to attach performance conditions to the matching award.
com 63 Remuneration report continued Worldwide Employee Share-save Plan WESP The company continues to operate the WESP that was adopted in 1999 and replaced the Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS.
The plan is a share option plan in which the employee saves from salary, up to a maximum of 150 per month, over a fixed period of time, for a minimum of three years, and is then given the opportunity to purchase fixed price shares from his or her fund.
The group uses the WESP to encourage global ownership of shares by employees.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The companys LTIP is used to make awards of shares to selected employees and executive directors in recruitment or acute retention situations, or other exceptional circumstances, at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Awards under the LTIP may be structured as nil cost options or requiring the payment of an exercise price, which is set at the time of the grant.
Performance conditions, set by the remuneration committee, are normally attached to awards.
Service contracts The remuneration committee has established all aspects of directors service contracts in the light of specific circumstances of the group and current practice.
There is typically no fixed term to the contracts and the remuneration committee has agreed that, going forward, notice periods within any new contracts will be 12 months.
In the event of termination, all contractual obligations would be honoured by the company, subject to mitigation.

If the contract were terminated with proper notice being given, no damages would be paid.
2 Jacques-Henri David retired from the board and all remuneration ceased with effect from 31 January 2003.
3Nick Hodges retired from the board and all remuneration ceased with effect from 31 December 2002.
4 The committee believes that the 24-month notice period is appropriate for Mike Kirkhams role as chief executive, where his particular contribution and expertise is invaluable to the group.
This provision within the contract was deemed appropriate when the contract commenced following the merger with AGB in 1992.
5 David Lowdens notice period increases to 24 months in the event of change of control, if he is not offered a position in the reconstructed company on generally equivalent terms.
