Introduction This is the directors remuneration report of Provident Financial plc the company for the financial year ended 31 December 2002.
It has been prepared pursuant to and in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company to be held on 30 April 2003.
The remuneration committee 2.1 In accordance with best practice, the company has had a remuneration committee the committee for many years.
Pursuant to its terms of reference, it considers the framework of executive remuneration and makes recommendations to the board.
It also considers the specific remuneration packages and conditions of service of executive directors, including their service agreements.
No director is involved in determining his own remuneration.
2.2 For the whole of 2002 the committee consisted of Charles Gregson and John Maxwell under the chairmanship of Angela Heylin.
2.3 The Chairman and the Chief Executive each have the right to attend and speak but not vote at meetings of the committee other than when their remuneration or any matter relating to them is being considered in which case they absent themselves from the meeting.
In 2002 the committee consulted with the Chairman, John van Kuffeler, about the proposals for the Chief Executives remuneration and with the Chief Executive, Robin Ashton, about the proposals for the other executive directors.
The Company Secretary, Rosamond Marshall Smith, is secretary to the committee and attended the meetings of the committee in 2002: as a solicitor she provided legal and technical support to the committee.
2.4 In 2002 the committee adopted the Provident Financial Performance Share Plan the performance share plan pursuant to a resolution of the company in general meeting: the performance share plan had previously been considered and recommended to the board by the committee.
The committee took advice on the performance share plan from Slaughter and May, and Monks Partnership, both of whom were instructed on behalf of the committee by the secretary.
Monks Partnership were also instructed again on behalf of the committee by the secretary to provide advice on remuneration trends.
Slaughter and May are the companys city solicitors and during 2002 provided advice principally on corporate and treasury matters.
Monks Partnership is a trading name of , which also provides audit, accounting and tax services to the company.
Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration 3.1 The remuneration policy applied by the committee is based on the need to attract, reward, motivate and retain executive directors in a manner consistent with the long-term accumulation of value for shareholders.
The committee is also conscious of the need to avoid paying more than is reasonable for this purpose.
3.2 The executive directors remuneration consists of a basic salary, an annual cash bonus subject to performance conditions and other benefits.
The directors participate in pension schemes.
Additionally they may participate in an employee savings-related share option scheme which is not subject to performance conditions, executive share option schemes which are subject to performance conditions and the performance share plan which is subject to performance conditions.
The committee reviews the executive directors remuneration annually.
In December 2002, the committee decided to continue the existing policy of setting the executive directors basic salaries in the lower quartile to median range determined by reference to a broad range of appropriate companies selected by Monks Partnership but to increase the potential earnings under the annual cash bonus scheme.
The committee also considered the individual performance of each director.
The executive directors salary increases averaged 6.6% and these increases were implemented from 1 January 2003.
3.4 Annual cash bonuses are payable, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
They are calculated as a percentage of salary.
The purpose of the bonus scheme is to provide a meaningful incentive for executive directors which is clearly focused on improving the groups performance and directly aligns shareholder and executive director interests.
Executive directors are eligible for annual cash bonuses by reference to the growth in the companys audited earnings per share as defined in the bonus scheme over the previous financial year and the achievement of agreed personal objectives.
For 2003, no bonus will be payable if growth in earnings per share is less than 4%.
Up to 15% of salary will be payable if growth in earnings per share is 4% and the percentage rises to a maximum of 100% of salary for 15% growth in earnings per share, provided that each directors agreed personal objectives have also been achieved.
In exceptional circumstances the committee may make such adjustments to the calculation of earnings per share as it considers fair and reasonable.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
3.5 The company currently operates two senior executive share option schemes.
Further details are set out in paragraphs 3.5.
1 The Provident Financial plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 is an Inland Revenue approved scheme.
The aggregate exercise prices of the options held by an executive under this scheme must not exceed 30,000.
The Provident Financial plc Unapproved Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 is not approved by the Inland Revenue.
The aggregate exercise prices of the options granted to an executive annually under both schemes must not exceed two times his her salary.
2 Both schemes have performance targets which have to be met before any options can be exercised.
3 For options granted prior to 2002 the performance condition is that over a three year period the real growth in earnings per share as defined must average 3% a year after making appropriate adjustments for inflation.
Provident Financial | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 11 Directors remuneration report continued 3.5.
4 For options granted in 2002 the following performance conditions apply: a where the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price of up to one times directors salary, the real growth in earnings per share after adjusting for inflation must average 3% a year over a fixed three year period this period may be extended to four or five years : b to the extent that the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price in excess of one times directors salary, the condition is 4% rather than 3% real growth in earnings per share.
5 A performance condition based on earnings per share has been used in both executive schemes since their establishment in 1995 and 1996.
It is considered that this aligns the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
The performance conditions were amended in 2002 pursuant to the approval of the company in general meeting but retained earnings per share as their basis, reflecting the alignment of the interests of the directors and those of the shareholders.
6 The grant of options under the schemes to executive directors and senior managers is normally considered once in each year after the announcement of the companys results in accordance with a formula determined by reference to salary.
7 No executive options have been offered at a discount.
3.6 The executive directors together with other eligible group employees may participate in the Provident Financial plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 1993.
Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and have the option to use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an Inland Revenue approved scheme designed for employees at all levels.
3.7 The performance share plan entitles executive directors who waive up to 50% of their annual cash bonus to be considered for participation.
Participants will receive a basic award of up to the value of the waived bonus together with a matching award of an equivalent amount which is subject to a performance condition.
In normal circumstances the awards vest after three years.
For awards granted in 2003 the matching award will vest only if the companys average growth in earnings per share as defined is equal to or greater than RPI plus 3% over a period of three consecutive financial years, the first of which is the financial year starting immediately before the grant date of the matching award.
The performance conditions were selected by the committee following advice from Monks Partnership and after consideration of other possible types of condition.
The committee took the view that the use of this earnings per share target aligned the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
3.8 The company has a share retention policy for executive directors which encourages them over a five year period to build up a shareholding based on shares acquired under senior executive share option schemes referred to in paragraph 3.5 above and the performance share plan referred to in paragraph 3.7 above with a market value of twice annual salary.
3.9 The executive directors are provided with company-owned cars, fuel, long-term disability income under the companys insured permanent health policy and medical cover for them and their immediate families.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
3.10 The executive directors have service agreements which require two years notice to be given by the company.
The company and the committee consider that the two year notice periods are in the best interests of the group.
In view of the groups specialist businesses, the main concern is to retain senior management and seek to ensure that they are not able to leave and make their valuable experience and training available to a competitor without adequate safeguards.
The company has a policy and a record of retaining its executive directors and management over the longer term and providing them with extensive development opportunities and with support in their study for qualifications.
No director has a service agreement containing a liquidated damages clause on termination: in the event of the termination of a contract, particularly for poor performance, it is the current policy to seek full mitigation of loss by the director concerned and to ensure that any payment made is the minimum which is commensurate with the companys legal obligations.
Where possible, the company would seek to make any payment in instalments and subject to appropriate conditions.

The three former directors at various times agreed to retire before their normal retirement dates in order to facilitate the change in board structure.
In considering appropriate arrangements for them, the committee took into account a number of factors: these included the requirements of the businesses of the group, the fact that the timing of the changes was designed to be at the most opportune time for the future development of these businesses, the need for a smooth transition in changes of management at the highest level, the benefit of retaining the facility to use the services of these senior executives and the need to protect the commercial interests of the group.
