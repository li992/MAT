Remuneration Report The members of the Remuneration Committee who served during the year are Clive Gilchrist Chairman, Charles Irby and Sir Malcolm Rifkind.
The Committee appointed an external firm of consultants, DLA MCG Consulting, to advise them on executive remuneration.
DLA MCG Consulting did not provide any other services to the Group during the year.
This report includes certain voluntary disclosures in advance of the introduction of The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
These regulations will be effective for the Companys year ending 30 September 2003.
Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is designed to reflect the importance of recruiting and retaining senior executives of the calibre necessary to maintain and improve the Groups position in the asset management sector.
The policy seeks to reward performance in a manner which aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
Executive remuneration comprises basic salary, annual cash bonus, Share Option and Performance Share schemes, and the provision of medical insurance cover.
Executives posted overseas are entitled to a local housing allowance.
Executives are also entitled to membership of the Groups contributory money purchase pension scheme to which the employers contribution is 15% of basic salary.
The aggregate amount of any cash bonus available in any year is dependent on the Groups overall performance and profitability.
Individual bonuses, which are non pensionable, are discretionary and based on the Remuneration Committees assessment of the achievement of objectives.
Individual bonuses for key employees are made on condition that a proportion is repayable in the event of the individual leaving the Groups employment within the following year.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan SIP is intended to encourage share ownership by employees.
It is designed to be available to all employees, subject to a minimum period of service, and is considered to be the successor to the ESOP schemes such as that previously operated by the Group.
No provisions have been made for any profit related contribution to this scheme in 2002.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Group has an Executive Share Option Scheme which is approved by the Inland Revenue.
Options are granted at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and are issued for no consideration.
Options granted to executive directors and senior employees under the Scheme may only be exercised if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that earnings per share have increased, over a period of 3 years or longer, by 5% per annum in excess of the average growth in the stock markets in which the Groups assets under management are invested.
An unapproved schedule was added to this scheme in 1999 to permit options to be granted within institutional guidelines but in excess of the reduced limits on approved options imposed by the Government.
During the year options were granted over 1,207,000 shares at an exercise price of 261p.
Performance Share Scheme In 1997 the Company established a Performance Share Scheme under which executive directors and senior employees were offered the opportunity to subscribe for Performance Shares at the greater of their nominal value and market value, as determined by the Remuneration Committee on the advice of independent accountants.
This scheme was in operation for two years, 1997 and 1998, before the introduction of changes in UK tax legislation removed the efficiencies of the scheme.
The 50p Performance shares may convert, wholly or partly, into ordinary shares of 10p each at the end of a five year period, provided that the Groups earnings per share have grown over that period by defined margins in excess of general growth of the markets in which the Groups assets under management are invested.
The growth in EPS for the five year period to 30 September 2002 has been independently verified as surpassing the target of 5% per annum in excess of weighted average stock market growth required to permit the maximum rate of conversion of the 1998 Performance shares.
On publication of this Annual Report the 344,000 1998 Performance shares will therefore convert into 1,352,500 ordinary shares, which will vest in individual holders, and 367,500 deferred shares which are valueless will be cancelled.
The Performance share scheme will thereafter be terminated.
