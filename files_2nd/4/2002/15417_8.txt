Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises Messrs D Wallace, R Kiernan and D Mapp, under the chairmanship of Mr D Wallace.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee measures the performance of the executive directors before recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to the Board for final determination.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is recommended by Mr D Wallace and also takes account of the time spent on Board matters.
The final determinations are made and approved by the Board as a whole, although no director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee consults the Chief Executive about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside the Company.
During 2002 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide advice on structuring directors remuneration packages.
New Bridge Street Consultants did not provide any other services to the Group.
The Committee met three times during 2002, to review general policy and to agree remuneration for executive and non-executive directors for recommendation to the Board.
The Board also discussed and agreed the remuneration policy for senior staff.
Remuneration Policy Taylor & Francis operates globally and its continued success is dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and reward appropriate high calibre staff.
The rewards for the Chief Executive, for the other executive directors and for senior staff must therefore be competitive with global salary scales and, in particular, must reect the international dimension of the Group.
However, individual performance targets must be demanding, so that outstanding performance is appropriately rewarded.
Whatever the geographical location of staff, their rewards must enable the Company to attract the best, and to motivate them as a team.
The Remuneration Committee works within the fundamental principles of corporate governance, of independence, accountability, transparency of information and alignment of reward with performance.
In making its judgements it utilises external independent advice, both commissioned and from reputable surveys.
In its most recent reviews, the Committee has noted that the remuneration of the directors is generally in the lowest quartile of companies which are comparable, whether by market capitalisation, revenue, number of employees or sector.
The Committee is now in the process of addressing this position, to reect the continuing success of the Group, and to ensure this for the future.
18 - Taylor & Francis Group plc Directors Remuneration Report continued There are four elements of the remuneration package for executive directors: r Basic salary and benets: r Annual bonus payments: r Share option incentives: and r Pension benets These are summarised below.
Basic Salary This is reviewed annually and determined by the Board prior to the beginning of each year, having regard to individual performance and responsibility.
External market factors are taken into account as appropriate.
In addition to basic salary, executive directors receive certain benets-in-kind, principally private medical insurance.
Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme The Groups policy is that a significant proportion of the maximum potential remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related.
Accordingly, the executive directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The level of potential bonus is expressed as a percentage of basic salary with Messrs A Foye, R Horton and J Conibear receiving up to 40 per cent of basic salary and Mr D Smith receiving up to 50 per cent of basic salary, subject to the achievement of financial targets on a sliding scale for revenue, operating profit and earnings per share.
The targets are set at the beginning of the year by the Remuneration Committee and, if appropriate, adjusted to take account of acquisitions made during the period.
For 2002, the maximum and actual bonuses payable for achievement of each of the financial targets, as a percentage of basic salary, were as follows: Maximum bonus payable Operating Earnings Actual bonus Revenue profit per share Total awarded % % % % % D Smith 17.5 15.0 17.5 50.0 25.0 A Foye 12.0 14.0 14.0 40.0 20.0 R Horton 12.0 14.0 14.0 40.0 20.0 J Conibear 12.0 14.0 14.0 40.0 20.0 Excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation Awards under the bonus scheme are non-pensionable.
Share Option Incentives The Board considers that it is in the best interests of shareholders for executive directors, senior management and other employees with the Group to have an interest in the shares of the Company.
Grants of share options are, therefore, considered upon executives joining the Group and periodically thereafter by reference to their position within the Group, their performance and the status of options currently outstanding.
Options can be granted to executives under the Taylor & Francis Group plc Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme and under the Taylor & Francis Group plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme together the Discretionary Share Option Schemes.
The directors are not eligible to participate in the Companys Save as You Earn share option scheme.
The directors have reviewed the operation of the existing Discretionary Share Option Schemes and, in the light of developments in current best practice encapsulated in the revised guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers in December 2002 propose to amend the individual Taylor & Francis Group plc - 19 Directors Remuneration Report continued limits under the Companys Discretionary Share Option Schemes.
It is proposed to replace the current individual limit of four times earnings for subsisting options with an annual limit on option grants of up to one times annual basic salary, except in the case of new executive appointments only, wherein the Remuneration Committee would continue to have the discretion to award higher grants on appointment of up to four times basic salary.
Any such higher grants would be subject to more stretching and demanding performance criteria.
Resolution 11 set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting authorises the directors to amend the rules of the Companys Discretionary Share Option Schemes accordingly.
Since 2001 all options granted under the Discretionary Share Option Schemes have been and will continue to be subject to performance criteria.
The options granted to the executive directors during 2002 and the performance criteria attached to them are shown on page 23.
The exercise price of the options granted is equal to the market value of the Companys shares on the date the options were granted.
The company does not currently operate any long-term incentive schemes other than the share option schemes described above.
Pension Benets Executive directors and employees of certain UK subsidiaries were eligible until 8 March 2002 when the scheme was closed to new entrants to join the Taylor & Francis Limited Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
This is a dened benefit scheme which, subject to Inland Revenue limits and length of service, provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final salary excluding benets at the age of 63.
Dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of the members death in service.
No payments other than basic salary are pensionable.
Because he joined the Company after the above pension scheme was closed to new entrants, Mr D Smith does not participate in the scheme and instead receives an additional 10% of his basic salary.
