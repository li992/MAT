Carillion plc Remuneration Report This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code.
The Board is responsible for determining policy for remuneration of the Directors of Carillion plc and key members of the senior management team.
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises the four Non-Executive Directors and which is chaired by Andrew Parrish, is responsible for formulating policy and recommending to the Board the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Board determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors based on independent external advice.
The Remuneration Committee is assisted on remuneration decisions by Susan Morton, Group HR Director and by John McDonough, Group Chief Executive.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee appointed in 2001 The Monks Partnership a business owned by  LLP to provide salary survey information and in 2002 New Bridge Street Consultants to advise on share incentive matters.
Remuneration policy It is the policy of the Company to ensure that remuneration and other benefits attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and senior managers of the required calibre to achieve the Boards objectives, including that of achieving growth in shareholder value.
Remuneration and other benefits are determined with regard to competitive market practice and, where considered appropriate, are supported by external independent surveys.
The main elements of remuneration of the Executive Directors are basic salary and pension benefits, together with annual long term bonuses linked to the Groups financial and share price performance to ensure that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned to those of the shareholders.
The Company intends to continue this approach to the structure of remuneration for the foreseeable future subject to any changes in legislation with regard to pension provision although consideration is being given to the design and effectiveness of share incentive schemes for Executive Directors and senior managers.
The Groups remuneration policy is also based upon Carillions strategic objectives, which specifically include financial performance targets and achieving high standards in respect of sustainability, which encompasses Carillions health and safety, environmental and social performance.
Service contracts The Chief Executives service contract is terminable by one years notice from the Company.
The other Executive Directors service contracts are terminable in normal circumstances by two years notice from the Company.
Whilst the Combined Code states there is a case for reducing notice periods to one year or less, the Boards policy in this respect reflects the long term nature of many of the Groups project-related activities.
Upon termination of their employment, Executive Directors of the Company have no additional entitlement to compensation for loss of their office as Directors.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
Notice Name Commencement period Term John McDonough 1 January 2001 12 months rolling Roger Robinson 29 July 1999 24 months rolling Chris Girling 13 September 1999 24 months rolling Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of service, but are generally appointed for fixed terms of three years renewable for a further one to three years if both parties agree.
As Chairman and in recognition of the associated responsibilities, Sir Neville Simms has a contract of service which commenced on 1 February 2001 for a period of two years and which now continues unless and until terminated by either party giving one years notice.
Basic salary and other benefits The basic salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors are set by the Remuneration Committee and are determined taking into account individual performance and information provided by independent sources on the rate of salary for similar posts in comparable companies.
The aim is to reward Directors fairly and competitively.
Other benefits typically include a company car, private healthcare and salary supplements or contributions to a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS in place of approved pension provision for salary over the annual earnings cap.
Annual performance bonus Annual cash bonuses are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee, which sets performance targets geared to key financial indicators and individual performance objectives.
The Executive Directors have the potential to earn annual bonuses up to a maximum of 50% of their basic salary for outstanding performance.
The bonus arrangement for 2002 set a financial performance target based on earnings per share and personal performance objectives that support the strategic objectives of the Company.
The maximum bonus opportunity of 50%, comprises an annual cash payment limited to 30% of salary with a deferred bonus of shares of the Company with a value of up to 20% of salary vesting after one year.
Pension benefits The Group makes contributions to an Inland Revenue approved defined benefit scheme and, where applicable and where the individual has elected, to FURBS on behalf of the Executive Directors.
Alternatively, a payment equal to the contribution the Group would have made to the funded unapproved arrangement is paid to the Executive Director as a salary supplement.
Contributions to the funded unapproved arrangements are reported as a benefit in kind on an annual basis.
Salary supplements are taxed at source.

The total 2001 remuneration for Sir Neville Simms includes 38,000 salary and other benefits paid to him as Chief Executive in January of that year.
The total remuneration in 2001 of former Directors was 1,084,000 including 747,000 compensation for loss of office.
Executive pensions It is the Companys policy to offer membership of the Carillion B Pension Scheme to Executive Directors and other senior employees.
This scheme was operational from 1 October 1999.
The scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, defined benefit scheme to which members contribute 5% of pensionable earnings.
The main features are: pension payable at the normal retirement age of 60 save in cases of ill health or early retirement pension accrual rate for Executive Directors of 1 30th of final pensionable salary for each year of service targeting a pension at normal retirement age of two thirds of final pensionable salary subject to twenty years service after which employee contributions cease increases to pensions in payment in excess of the State Guaranteed Minimum Pension in line with price indexation up to 5% per annum life assurance of four times pensionable salary pensions payable in the event of ill health, and on death in service or after retirement spouses and or dependants pension at two-thirds of members pension.
Maximum pension benefits of two thirds of pensionable salary are offset by any pension benefits accruing from earlier pension arrangements.
The Carillion B Pension Scheme will be closed to new entrants after 31 March 2003.
Pension provision for senior managers and executives in future will be through their existing Carillion scheme current employees or the Carillion Pension Plan new employees and existing employees who opt for membership.
The Carillion Pension Plan is a defined contribution pension arrangement that provides members with pensions at retirement based on the accumulated value of their notional pension account within the plan.
The current Executive Directors are subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap and their pensionable salary is limited accordingly.
Executive Directors who are subject to the earnings cap are provided with additional benefits by way of individual FURBS or a salary supplement equal to the contribution the Group would have made to a FURBS.
In all cases, any contributions made to these arrangements in respect of the year are disclosed separately above.
As these additional arrangements are limited to the balance of basic salary in excess of the earnings cap, bonus paid to Executive Directors does not count towards pension benefits.
The Company does not contribute to any pension arrangements of Non-Executive Directors.

Share incentive schemes The Company operates four share incentive schemes to motivate employees and to encourage them to invest in the future success of the Group.
The Founders Equity Plan, the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan all have challenging performance criteria that apply similarly to all participants.
The Board believes that these schemes complement the strategy of achieving growth in shareholder value by directly aligning these incentives of the Executive Directors and senior employees to the interests of the shareholders.
A Sharesave Scheme also operates to give UK employees the opportunity to have a financial stake in the Company.
The Founders Equity Plan FEP is a one-off scheme established as an incentive for those employees capable of making a critical contribution to increasing shareholder value.
The Executive Directors and certain senior managers were invited to join the FEP and invest a percentage of their basic salary in purchasing ordinary shares in Carillion plc.
These shares, referred to as the Investment Shares, were purchased at an average market price of 137.74 pence per share.
The Investment Shares are owned and controlled by the individual, who is free to choose whether to stay in the FEP or sell the shares at any time during the performance period.
Where members of the FEP dispose of an element of their Investment Shares, the options they have been granted will be proportionately reduced.
For every Investment Share purchased, up to a maximum of four free shares can be awarded, subject to Carillions share price performance.
As the performance condition was not attained in the initial three year period, in accordance with the rules, the performance period is now the four years commencing 31 August 1999 and the performance condition has increased proportionately.
The benchmark share price against which performance will be measured is 138 pence which was the mid-market price at close of business on 31 August 1999.
At 31 August 2003, Carillions average share price over the previous six weeks must have been at least 347.5 pence for the options to be exercisable in full.
If the share price does not reach 201.5 pence, the options will not be exercisable.
If the share price increases in between these two prices, options will become exercisable on a pro-rata basis.
A nominal fee of 1 is payable on the exercise of options.
The performance condition which must be achieved before any free shares are allocated, is challenging but provides a real incentive to Directors and senior managers who can deliver increasing value for shareholders.
At 31 December 2002, Executive Directors and senior managers held a total of 1,439,961 Investment Shares and options over 5,759,845 shares.
Those options not exercised by the tenth anniversary of their grant will lapse.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 37 Carillion plc Remuneration Report continued Executive Share Option Schemes Share options have been granted to certain senior managers under two Executive Share Option Schemes.
The options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
Executive Share Options have not been granted to participants in the Founders Equity Plan.
Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 which carries certain tax advantages for UK employees and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 are exercisable normally between three and ten years after the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
The performance condition requires that the earnings per share before exceptional items of Carillion over a rolling three year period must increase by a percentage that is not less than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period, expressed as a percentage, plus four percentage points per annum.
This performance condition was selected in order to provide an incentive that aligns the interests of executives with those of shareholders in growing the Companys earnings per share.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under the Executive Share Option Schemes cannot normally exceed their remuneration in any year although this limit can be exceeded if the Directors so determine.
At 31 December 2002, options were outstanding over 2,068,486 shares under both schemes at exercise prices ranging from 125.2 pence to 210.7 pence which may, subject to achievement of the performance condition, be exercisable for up to ten years from the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan Conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are made to the Executive Directors and key members of senior management, in recognition of the contribution that these individuals can make to the Groups success.
There is no subscription price for the shares, the award of which is conditional on the Companys performance during a three year period in delivering Total Shareholder Return TSR against a comparator group of ten companies in the construction to services sector.
The awards will vest in full only if Carillion achieves first place.
If the Companys ranking is sixth, 30% of the awards will vest.
If ranking is below sixth, none of the awards will vest.
This performance condition was chosen in order to align the interests of Directors and senior managers with those of shareholders in growing Total Shareholder Return against comparator companies operating in similar sectors.
It is intended that conditional awards under the Plan will be made annually.
At 31 December 2002, conditional awards were outstanding over a total of 4,205,073 shares.
Conditional awards made to Executive Directors under these plans are set out in the table of share incentives on page 39.
The awards represent the maximum number of shares that could be awarded to Directors under the performance periods commencing on 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2001.
The monetary value of the conditional awards attributed to each Director were based on their annual basic salary at the date of award and the number of shares were calculated using the share prices of 113.3 pence and 120.3 pence, the average share prices over the last six weeks of 1999 and 2000 respectively.
Total Shareholder Return Performance Graph The following graph shows the TSR of Carillion plc compared with the TSR of the FTSE 350 Index for the period from 30 July 1999 the day dealings in Carillion shares commenced on the London Stock Exchange, to 31 December 2002.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 38 Carillion plc The Sharesave Scheme The Company has established a Sharesave Scheme which provides a savings and investment opportunity for employees in the UK.
The options may normally be exercised on completion of a three or five year savings contract, at a price equivalent to not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
Options were granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194 shares and in October 2002 over 3,995,803 shares.
At 31 December 2002, options over 7,302,280 ordinary shares of 50p each were outstanding under this scheme, exercisable on various dates up to June 2006 at exercise prices of either 109.1p or 126.6p.
The three year options granted in November 1999 became exercisable on 1 January 2003 for a period of six months.
Proposals for Share Incentive Schemes The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance conditions applying to the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
As described in the Notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Company is seeking shareholder authority to apply different performance conditions for future grants and conditional awards, which both comply with best practice and are more demanding than the current performance requirements.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 39 Carillion plc Remuneration Report continued The companies comprising the comparator group for Long Term Incentive Plan conditional awards made in January 2000 and also the Long Term Incentive Agreement with John McDonough are Amec plc, Amey plc, WS Atkins plc, Balfour Beatty plc, Jarvis plc, Kier Group plc, John Laing plc, Alfred McAlpine plc, John Mowlem plc and Taylor Woodrow plc.
The same comparator group is also used for the Long Term Incentive Plan conditional awards made in 2001 and 2002 except that Interserve plc replaces John Laing plc.
In January 2003, the performance condition pertaining to the Long Term Incentive Plan conditional awards made in January 2000 was not met and these awards have now lapsed.
The conditional award made to John McDonough under the Long Term Incentive Agreement also lapsed at this time.
This is shown in the table on page 39.
The number of options over Carillion plc shares held by Directors of the Company under the Executive Share Option and Sharesave schemes are detailed below: Earliest As at Granted As at date from 1 January during 31 December Exercise which 2002 the year Exercised Lapsed 2002 price exercisable Expiry date John McDonough ESOS 2001 501,930 501,930 129.5p 09.01.04 09.01.11 ESOS 2002 254,532 254,532 210.7p 07.01.05 07.01.12 Roger Robinson Sharesave 2,699 2,699 109.1p 01.01.03 30.06.03 The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the above table.
The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7 pence granted to John McDonough in March 2002 under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 was made later in the year than had been specified at the time of his appointment which resulted in an increased option price of 67.3 pence.
Therefore, in order to ensure that he will be in neither a worse nor better position as a result of the delay in the grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 67.3 pence per share less tax will be made when and if the option is exercised.
Other than as shown in the tables above and the exercise by Roger Robinson of his Sharesave option over 2,699 shares in February 2003, there have been no changes to the interests of Executive Directors in share incentives and options in the period 1 January to 12 March 2003.
