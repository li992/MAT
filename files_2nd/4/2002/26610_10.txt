Man Group front WACE 13 6 02 5:10 pm Page 34 Remuneration Report The Remuneration Committee comprises only independent non-executive directors: Glen Moreno Chairman, Alison Carnwath and Dugald Eadie.
It is responsible for remuneration policy as applied to executive directors of Man Group plc.
Executive remuneration policy The Group aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages which are linked to both individual and business performance.
These packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they are supportive of the Groups business objectives and the creation of shareholder value.
To this end the Group seeks to give a comparatively higher proportion of total compensation in the form of variable remuneration, rather than fixed by way of base salary, and so take directly into account individual and business performance during the year.
In assessing the competitiveness of remuneration, salaries and bonuses have been reviewed against external market data provided by independent professional consultants.
It is also the Groups policy to align the interests of directors and senior executives with the Groups shareholders through the promotion and encouragement of share ownership, by offering participation in share-based long-term incentive schemes.
The remuneration of executive directors consists of annual salary, car allowance, health and disability benefits, an annual cash bonus scheme, pension contribution and participation in long-term incentive schemes.
Details of each individual directors remuneration, shareholding and, where applicable, share options and long-term incentive plan benefits are set out in this report.
Directors remuneration The remuneration of the directors listed by individual director is as follows: Salary Annual 2002 2001 and fees Benefits bonus Total Total 000 000 000 000 000 Executive directors Peter Clarke 262 67 1,400 1,729 1,411 Kevin Davis 252 179 1,700 2,131 1,520 Stanley Fink 350 119 2,750 3,219 2,523 Andrew Sutton 160 Non-executive directors Harvey McGrath 272 1 273 273 Alison Carnwath 50 50 9 Dugald Eadie 9 9 Glen Moreno 50 50 42 Stephen Nesbitt 50 50 50 # Garth Ramsay 13 13 42 31 March 2002 1,308 366 5,850 7,524 31 March 2001 6,030 # Appointed 1 April 2000 Resigned 8 June 2000 Appointed 24 January 2001 Resigned 6 July 2001 Appointed 29 January 2002 34 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group front WACE 13 6 02 5:10 pm Page 35 Retirement benefits accruing to Peter Clarke under a defined benefit pension scheme, and contributions to money purchase schemes relating to other directors were as follows: Money purchase scheme Defined benefit schemes Transfer Increase value of Accumulated Accumulated in accrued increase in total accrued total accrued pension for accrued pension at pension at 2002 2001 the year pension 31 March 2002 31 March 2001 000 000 000 000 000 000 Peter Clarke 2 15 15 12 Kevin Davis 12 23 Stanley Fink 35 26 Harvey McGrath 23 This represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 March 2002 and the corresponding pension one year earlier, excluding inflation and exchange differences.
This represents the annual pension payable at normal retirement date, based on service to date.
Service contracts The executive directors service agreements are all terminable on the expiry of not more than 12 months notice.
The Committee is mindful of the need to consider what compensation commitments, if any, are appropriate in the event of the early termination of executive directors contracts, bearing in mind the Groups legal obligations and the individuals ability to mitigate their loss.
Salaries Salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for executives of comparable status, responsibility and skills.
Particular regard is paid to salary levels within other leading companies in the financial services sector.
These comparisons are made with the assistance of independent remuneration surveys.
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits contained in the Articles of Association.
Pension provision The Group operates pension and retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of countries.
Base salary is the only component of remuneration which is pensionable.
All executive directors are eligible to participate in the Groups pension arrangements generally operating in the jurisdiction in which they work.
Alternatively, the Group will, at the executive directors request and subject to applicable limits and regulations, make a contribution of the same amount to a private pension plan nominated by the director.
Performance-related cash bonuses In addition to base salary, all executive directors and senior executives are eligible for an annual performance-related cash bonus, which is non-pensionable.
Bonuses are discretionary and linked to the achievement of agreed strategic objectives and, where appropriate, to the performance of the Group or the particular business with which the individual is involved.
Bonuses available across the Group for distribution to eligible employees are determined by reference to the pre-tax profit of each business unit after making certain adjustments, including a charge for the capital allocated by the Group to the operation of that business.
The bonus of each executive director, as determined by the Remuneration Committee against these measures on an individual basis, is shown in the table on page 34.
35 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group front WACE 13 6 02 5:10 pm Page 36 Remuneration Report continued Long-term incentive schemes The Group operates its long-term incentive schemes, other than the Share Option Schemes, through employee trusts established and funded for this purpose.
Although the terms of the Group incentive plans permit the Company to satisfy awards by issuing new shares, it is the Boards current practice to avoid the dilutive effect of such share issues through the purchasing by the trusts of shares in the market for transfer by the trustees to entitled participants.
The following is a summary of the long-term share-based incentive schemes operated by the Group during the year.
Performance Share Plan This is a long-term incentive plan for executive directors and key contributors first approved by shareholders in 1996 and amended at the 2001 AGM.
Awards are performance-related over a three year measurement period based on the level of post-tax return on average capital employed Return on Equity achieved by the Group throughout that period.
No award will be transferred unless the Group maintains an average annual Return on Equity of at least 20% 18% pre July 2001 awards across the performance period and awards will be transferred at levels above this on a sliding scale.
Full benefits of an award can only be transferred when annual Return on Equity has averaged 30% 24% or more pre July 2001 awards.
Additionally, no pre July 2001 award is capable of being transferred regardless of the level of Return on Equity achieved unless aggregate earnings per share growth over the performance period has exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Index for the same period by at least 6%.
Entitlements are subject to an additional one year restriction on transfer to participants dependent upon continued employment with the Group.
The 1999 awards vested at 100% and will be transferred in June 2003.
The 1998 awards vested at 100% and will be transferred in June 2002.
The 1997 awards did not vest as the required performance levels were not met.
The 1996 awards vested at 86% and became exercisable in September 2000.
Additionally the Plan allows participants to invest part or all of their annual performance-related cash bonus in shares in the Company invested shares.
In return, a participant will be provisionally allocated such number of additional shares as represents the amount of their investment gross of personal tax and social security liabilities matching shares.
In addition, shares purchased under the Assisted Purchase Scheme see below are eligible for a matching allocation under the Plan on a one to one ratio.
The provisional allocation of matching shares will be subject to the same performance criteria and three year performance period as set out above, and to continued employment with the Group over four years.
A participant may withdraw their invested shares at any time but if, and to the extent that they do so during the performance period, the corresponding allocation of matching shares lapses.
Details of the Performance Share Plan are shown on page 38.
Co-Investment Plan This is a long-term incentive scheme, designed to encourage senior executives other than directors to invest a proportion of their cash bonus by purchasing shares in the Company and to facilitate their retention.
It is a matching scheme whereby the Group matches on an agreed basis the pre-tax amount of bonus invested in the scheme provided that the bonus investment shares are retained by the employee for three years.
The matching award can be exercised for no payment after four years provided that the employee is still employed by the Group.
The Plan operated on a two to one matching basis but this increased to a four to one matching basis during the year.
The amount a participant can invest cannot exceed 100% of their bonus.
The only director participating in the Co-Investment Plan during the year was Peter Clarke, who was granted awards prior to becoming a director.
Assisted Purchase Scheme The Group has established and contributes to a discretionary trust, for the benefit of employees of the Group including executive directors, to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Company as long-term holdings.
The current trustee, who is not connected with the Group, is Ansbacher Jersey Limited.
The trustee acquires shares in the market which it will sell on to such employees including directors at the 36 Man Group plc Annual Report 2002 Man Group front WACE 13 6 02 5:10 pm Page 37 prevailing market price on deferred payment terms.
In the case of executive directors, such assistance is subject to prior approval by the Remuneration Committee.
As at 31 March 2002 the directors receiving such assistance were: Peter Clarke 1,125,253, repayable in annual instalments during the period to November 2006: Kevin Davis 580,003, repayable in annual instalments during the period to November 2006 and Stanley Fink 1,781,403, repayable in annual instalments during the period to November 2006.
Share Option Schemes The only outstanding options under the Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes established in October 1994, were exercised during the year details on page 38.
Options under these schemes could only be exercised if earnings per ordinary share EPS increased by an average of 2% per annum above the increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI for the three year period prior to exercise.
The Remuneration Committee does not propose to approve the grant of further options under these schemes.
A new Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved Scheme, The Man Group Executive Share Option Scheme 2001, was established during the year following shareholder approval at the 2001 AGM.
Selected senior employees and executive directors are eligible to participate.
All grants of options are subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
Details of options held by executive directors are set out in the table below.
Options issued under the Scheme normally may only be exercised between three and 10 years from the date of grant.
The Remuneration Committee may impose performance conditions on the exercise of options.
Initially 50% of each option will vest if the Companys normal earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in RPI plus 3% per annum, with the entire option vesting at RPI plus 6% per annum.
Performance criteria are calculated from the end of the financial year prior to the grant of option.
If the targets attached to any option are not reached after three years the EPS performance will be remeasured annually for a further two years.
If the targets are not satisfied after five years, the option will lapse.
Under the unapproved part of the Scheme, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to pay a sum equal to the gain on the option when it is exercised rather than issue or transfer shares to the option holder.
Additionally during the year, the Group introduced an Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Scheme in the United Kingdom and an Internal Revenue Code qualifying employee Stock Purchase Plan in the United States.
Both are all-employee plans and executive directors are entitled to participate, subject to the relevant terms and conditions.
The UK Sharesave Scheme contracts are for three or five year periods, with each participant permitted to save up to 250 per month to purchase Man Group plc shares at a discount.
The initial grant was made in October 2001.
The discount was 20% of the market value near the time the option was granted.
Under the US Stock Purchase Plan, each participant is permitted to save up to $375 per month to purchase Man Group plc shares at a discount, normally after a 24 month period.
The initial grant, for a 17 month period, was made in January 2002 with the option price being a 15% discount to the market value on the date of grant.
