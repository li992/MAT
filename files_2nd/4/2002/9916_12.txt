McCarthy & Stone plc Report on Directors Remuneration Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee with the objective of ensuring that the Group attracts, motivates and retains high quality management.
The remuneration package is intended to include a significant proportion of performance related remuneration, set against challenging objectives.
The Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors and throughout the financial year comprised Sir George Young chairman, J S McCarthy and S E K Purser.
The Group Finance Director, Matthew Thorne, provided information to the Remuneration Committee to enable it to review Executive Directors' salary and incentive packages and the Committee also sought the views of the Chief Executive, Keith Lovelock, on such matters.
Independent professional advice on remuneration has been sought over the financial year from Bacon & Woodrow.
That firm, now called Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, has been engaged by the Board to advise the Committee in respect of the current year.
The Companys solicitors, Travers Smith Braithwaite, advised the Committee on the establishment of the Deferred Plan referred to below and during the year the Committee received assistance from the Company Secretary, Trevor Green.
Remuneration of the Directors includes annual salary, bonuses, benefits, personal pension plans and participation in short and long-term incentive arrangements.
The remuneration of each Director is determined to reflect the duties and responsibilities of his role and his performance in that role.
The policy for future years is to pay salaries at the median compared to companies of comparable size and complexity of operation and, subject to the achievement of performance targets, provide overall packages at the upper quartile level.
The Committee seeks specific advice on remuneration levels, trends in executive remuneration packages and addresses corporate governance and best practice in making its determinations.
The Remuneration Committee, together with the Executive Directors, has previously considered the most appropriate comparator group for the illustration of total shareholder return.
For remuneration purposes the comparator companies should include members of the housebuilding subsector and other companies outside the construction sector and hence, for illustration purposes the FTSE350 Construction and Building Materials total shareholder returns index is shown below against the Companys total shareholder return for the period.
Constituents of the FTSE350 Construction and Building Materials Index comprise 22 companies, including 6 housebuilding companies, that have been tracked by the Committee over recent years to benchmark Executive Directors' salary and incentive packages.

The annual Deferred Bonus Plan bonus plan and the Deferred Plan are therefore linked.
"The terms of the Deferred Plan were approved the ""Deferred Plan"" by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 21 December 2001."
Annual bonuses are payable on achievement of specific and challenging performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee each year in relation to Group profit before tax.
On achievement of a performance target the bonus will amount to 30% of a Directors salary.
Above that target the bonus will increase on a percentage basis and there is no limit on the maximum bonus payable.
Achievement below a minimum target figure will result in no bonus becoming payable.
The Directors' cash bonuses are awarded in conjunction with the Deferred Plan.
The Deferred Plan has been designed to require Executive Directors to apply that part of their cash bonuses above a specified percentage of salary in the acquisition of shares, which have to be retained.
Directors are thereby qualified to apply for additional shares, so aligning the interests of Directors and shareholders.
In aggregate, the Executive Directors have been awarded bonuses of 1,214,000 in respect of the financial year ended 31 August 2002.
This represents a bonus of 114.75% of each Executive Directors salary for the year then ended.
"As the bonus exceeded 40% of base salary, participants are required to use the balance of their bonus after the payment of income tax to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company ""Bonus Shares""."
"These Bonus Shares will be held on behalf of participants, who are beneficially entitled to them, by the Trustee of the Company's Deferred Bonus Trust for a holding period the ""Holding Period"" being, the earlier of three years from the date of acquisition of Bonus Shares, the participant ceasing to be an employee and a change in control of the Company."
The incidental costs of acquiring the Bonus Shares will be borne by the Company and an accrual for this is made in the accounts of the Company at the year end.
Depending on the duration of the Holding Period, which in the ordinary course would be three years, participants will have the right to call for free shares in the Company.
If the Holding Period is between one and two years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every four Bonus Shares held.
If the Holding Period is between two and three years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every three Bonus Shares held.
If the Holding Period is three years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every two Bonus Shares held.
Any free shares so acquired by participants will be subject to payment by them of income tax and NIC on the value of such shares at the time of acquisition.
Provision is made at the year end for the costs to the Company of providing the free shares over the three year period.
The Deferred Plan is part of the Company's policy of seeking to retain quality management, as well as encouraging and facilitating long-term share ownership by Executive Directors.
Directors will only benefit from the Plan to the extent that they have achieved the challenging performance targets determined annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee will monitor retention of shares both during and after the Holding Period.
Share Option Schemes The Company believes that share ownership by Executive Directors and senior executives can strengthen the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
"The Company introduced a Company Share Option Plan the ""Share Option Plan"" at its Extraordinary General Meeting held on 5 October 2000."
This plan is designed to reward Directors and other senior executives for delivering long-term returns to share holders.
The Share Option Plan contains an approved and an unapproved part.
Details of the interest of the Directors in options over the Company's Ordinary Shares are set out later on in the report.
Options are granted at prevailing market prices at the time of grant.
Historically, options granted before 1996 were granted under the original Executive Share Option Scheme, which did not contain any performance criteria.
No options in favour of Executive Directors are outstanding under this scheme.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 consisting of grants made on or after 27 November 1996 are subject to a performance condition.
These options only become exercisable if the Company's share price growth over a three year period exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% over that period.
The new Share Option Plan, introduced on 5 October 2000, has replaced both the original Executive Share Option Scheme and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1996.
Options may be granted under the Share Option Plan up to a maximum of three times salary each year.
The Remuneration Committee considers past performance in deciding the level of grant on each occasion.
The approved part of the Share Option Plan is used to allocate the first 30,000 of options to executives, with the associated potential income tax benefit.
All grants in excess of this Inland Revenue limit are made under the unapproved part.
Grants to Executive Directors and senior executives are approved, on a discretionary basis, by the Committee following consultation with the Chief Executive.
For options granted under the new Share Option Plan stretching performance targets of earnings per share growth over a three year period to exceed the increase in the Retail Prices Index by at least 10% per annum in respect of options granted in November 2000 and 8% per annum in respect of options granted in November 2001 have been imposed by the Committee.
Details of options granted are set out in the table on page 31.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the performance conditions are appropriate, both because of the Companys focus for management of the business on growth in earnings per share and because of the transparency and ascertainability of the measure.
McCarthy & Stone plc Page 29 McCarthy & Stone plc Report on Directors Remuneration Other Employee Share The Directors also participate in the Savings Related Share Option Schemes SAYE and the Companys Schemes Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP SIP which are open to all employees of the Group.
Pensions Each of the Executive Directors has one or more personal pension plans.
The Company makes set contributions to these plans at a rate of 25% of salary up to the age of 55, and at 30% of salary thereafter.
FURBS arrangements have been established in previous years for the benefit of M W J Thorne, M J Jennings and H P S Phillips as the amounts exceeded the cap on personal pension contributions.
The cost shown below is the total of the contributions payable by the Group for the year.
Service Contracts The following Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company terminable on the length of notice indicated below:- Executive Director Date of Contract Length of Notice K Lovelock 23.12.93 2 years M W J Thorne 27.05.93 2 years M J Jennings 10.03.98 1 year H P S Phillips 07.08.95 1 year The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the fact that the termination periods on some of the directors service contracts are greater than one year.
Those service contracts terms are historic and the Remuneration Committee will consider this point in all future contract negotiations but does not consider it appropriate to change at this time.
The intention of the Committee is to approve future service contracts terminable upon notice of no more than one year, save in exceptional circumstances.
The consent of the Board is required for any external appointment where it may give rise to a conflict of interest.
Where an appointment is accepted, it must be undertaken in the Directors own time.
The Director is therefore normally permitted to retain any remuneration earned from the appointment.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors fees comply with the limits set out in the Articles of Association and are set at levels which fairly represent the responsibilities of and time spent by Non-Executive Directors on company affairs.
Regard is also had to the level of fees payable to Non-Executive Directors in other comparable companies.
Non-Executive Directors fees are determined by the Board as a whole.
Directors do not participate in discussions and decisions relating to their own remuneration.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in pension, option or bonus schemes.
J S McCarthy has a service contract with the Company for a fixed term ending on 31 December 2003.
The other Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts and have not been appointed for specified terms.
However, the Articles of Association specify that Directors must retire by rotation every three years, so each term of appointment is for a limited period only.
The re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors is not automatic.
