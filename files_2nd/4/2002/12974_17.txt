REMUNERATION REPORT The Remuneration committee Ranks Remuneration committee is comprised solely of independent non-executive directors.
It is chaired by Peter Jarvis and its other members are Oliver Stocken and John Sunderland.
The committee has formal terms of reference which include making recommendations to the board on the Companys policy on directors remuneration and on the Companys framework of executive remuneration and its cost.
The committee also determines on behalf of the board the remuneration, benefits and employment packages of the Chairman and the executive directors.
The committee meets at least three times a year: Alun Cathcart and Mike Smith normally attend its meetings as do Christine Ray, Group Human Resources Director, and Charles Cormick, Company Secretary, except for when issues in which they have a direct interest are being considered.
Advisers During 2002, Towers Perrin was appointed by the committee as external adviser to the board and the committee on remuneration issues: advice on share-based incentive arrangements is also provided by New Bridge Street Consultants.
Towers Perrin only provided services to the Company in 2002 relating to remuneration and benefits arrangements for executive directors and senior management: the advice provided by New Bridge Street Consultants extended to a wider employee population.
Christine Ray assists the committee by preparing an annual report on remuneration and employment conditions existing within the Group, including current and anticipated levels of pay increases, and planned changes in employment conditions.
Internal support is provided to the committee by Charles Cormick.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy is to design and implement remuneration packages for executive directors and employees that are competitive in the marketplace and consistent with the reasonable expectation of shareholders for enhancing shareholder value.
The Remuneration committee reviews the remuneration packages regularly to ensure that they meet the policy requirements.
For 2003, the committee does not foresee any major changes in policy, although a new annual cash bonus scheme has been introduced, as detailed below.
The committee however accepts that the policy may need to change in subsequent years in order to take account of possible future changes in the Companys business environment, its strategic objectives, and in remuneration practice.
Any changes in policy for years after 2003 will be described in future reports.
The remuneration packages combine both short term elements base salary, benefits and bonuses with long term elements executive share option scheme and long term incentive plan.
A significant proportion of executive directors remuneration is performance related through the annual bonus plan, and the two long term share based incentive programmes.
The share based schemes align the directors with the interests of shareholders and to reinforce this alignment, the committee has introduced shareholding guidelines for the executive directors.
These guidelines call for the Chief Executive to build up a shareholding equivalent to one and a half times base salary, for other executive directors a shareholding of one times base salary, and for Executive committee members a shareholding of 0.75 times base salary.
All have a number of years in which to build up the specified holding.
The targeted composition of each of the executive directors remuneration excluding pensions is approximately 60% performance related and 40% non-performance related.
For each director, the performance related elements of the remuneration comprise an annual cash bonus and two long term share based incentive programmes see full description overleaf.
If target performance is achieved, the long term share based incentive plans have a value approximately twice that of the annual cash bonus.
This reward structure is regularly reviewed by the committee to ensure that it meets the objectives of the remuneration policy.
34 The Rank Group Plc Base salary and benefits The policy is that base salaries should be reviewed annually, taking into account individual performance, and paid at a market competitive level in comparison with comparable jobs in selected relevant companies.
Comparator groups are derived from their sector involvement, turnover and market capitalisation.
Benefits include a car, or cash allowance in lieu, and life, disability and health insurance.
Annual cash bonus In recent years the executive directors have participated in a performance award scheme which provides annual cash bonuses of up to 50% of base salary.
Under this scheme, bonuses are dependent upon achievement of primary and secondary performance measures.
The primary measure is operating profit: the secondary measures are specific to the various group businesses and relate to a combination of turnover, cash flow, and cost reduction targets, with all criteria being demonstrably quantifiable.
The scheme provides for a sliding scale of bonuses dependent upon performance.
On-target performance results in bonuses totalling 35% of base salary with a maximum bonus of 50% of base salary for 106% achievement.
For 2003 a new annual cash bonus plan for executive directors and senior management has been introduced.
A small element of this bonus will relate to the Companys performance in the first six months of the year.
Whilst the objectives and overall structure of the plan are broadly similar to previous arrangements, the committee believes that the following changes are consistent with current market practice, achievement of the strategic objectives of the Group and in line with the remuneration policy: A change in the full-year performance measures for executive directors to a primary measure of operating profit and a secondary measure of return on capital employed.
There will be only one performance measure for the first half-year, which will be operating profit.
The performance range and bonuses payable have been extended.
On-target performance will continue to attract a bonus of 35% of base salary but the maximum bonus payable for the full year has been increased to 70% of base salary for 115% achievement.
Additional cash bonuses Additional cash bonuses were introduced in 2000 when it was essential to ensure the retention and incentivisation of key management at a time when the Group was undergoing major restructuring.
It was never the intention of the Remuneration committee that they would become a permanent element of remuneration packages: instead, it was planned that they would be phased out as the Group emerged from the restructuring.
This has now occurred and no additional cash bonuses accrued to directors or senior management in the second half of 2002.
The committee does not intend to pay additional cash bonuses in the future, save in exceptional circumstances.
For the first six months of 2002 additional cash bonus accrued to executive directors equal to one half of the ordinary cash bonuses earned in the period.
Payment of these additional cash bonuses was deferred until December 2002: the amounts are disclosed in the table below, headed Additional bonus.
The cash emoluments received by the directors in 2002 were as follows: Total emoluments excluding pensions Base Expenses Annual Additional salary fees Benefits allowances bonus bonus 2002 2001 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Alun Cathcart 150 10 160 107 Ian Dyson 300 23 116 31 470 481 Peter Jarvis 33 33 32 Mike Smith 530 30 206 54 820 878 Oliver Stocken 33 33 32 John Sunderland 29 29 28 No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by a director during the year.
The Rank Group Plc 35 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Long Term Incentives The Company operates a Save As You Earn SAYE option scheme in which all UK employees and executive directors can currently participate.
This scheme operates within specic tax legislation, including a requirement that the exercise of options can only be nanced by the proceeds of a monthly savings contract: the exercise of options is not subject to satisfaction of a performance condition.
In addition, there are two other long term share based incentive programmes for executive directors and senior management.
These are an executive share option scheme, in which approximately 200 current employees participate, and a long term incentive plan, in which some 20 top managers participate.
Executive Share Option Scheme A new executive share option scheme, the Rank Group 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2002 ESOS, was approved by shareholders at last years annual general meeting and options were subsequently granted to the executive directors under the terms of this scheme.
The minimum performance condition attaching to the exercise of these options is an average annual real growth in normalised earnings per share eps of 3% over a three year performance period.
The scheme provides for tiered, more challenging performance conditions, dependent upon the value of options granted.
Eps was determined by the committee to be the appropriate criterion given its clear linkage with shareholder value, and the required real growth was in line with market practice at the time of shareholder approval of the scheme.
Retesting of the performance conditions is permitted for one year only following the relevant performance period, using the original base year.
The board considers that providing limited retesting is appropriate, given the changing focus of the Company and the cyclical nature of a number of its businesses.
Both executive directors were also granted options under the Rank Group 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme at the time of their recruitment in 1999.
The performance condition attaching to the exercise of these options is that there must be an average annual real growth in eps of at least 2% over a three year period.
The details of the executive directors executive share options are as follows: Number of Options Number of shares under awarded shares under option at exercised option at Price 1 January lapsed 31 December paid on Exercise Exercise Expiry Director 2002 varied 2002 grant price p date date Ian Dyson 278,225 278,225 248.00 13.09.02 12.09.09 138,376 138,376 271.00 24.05.05 23.05.12 Mike Smith 795,580 795,580 226.25 01.04.02 31.03.09 244,464 244,464 271.00 24.05.05 23.05.12 granted under the terms of the Rank Group 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme.

36 The Rank Group Plc The market value of one ordinary share was 266.5p at 31 December 2002: the highest market value during 2002 was 303p, and the lowest, 226p.
The directors additional interests in shares of the Company, including options to purchase ordinary shares under the terms of the Groups SAYE option scheme, are given below: 31 December 2002 1 January 2002 Ordinary Preference Ordinary Preference Exercise shares shares SAYE shares shares SAYE price p Alun Cathcart 75,000 50,000 Ian Dyson 20,000 20,000 Peter Jarvis 25,525 20,113 5,412 179.00 Mike Smith 120,000 80,000 Oliver Stocken 38,188 25,000 John Sunderland 1,058 1,058 No options to subscribe for ordinary shares were granted to directors or lapsed during the year ended 31 December 2002.
Peter Jarvis exercised a SAYE option over 5,412 ordinary shares on 1 May 2002.
The exercise price per ordinary share was 179p and the market price at the date of exercise was 275p.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, each executive director is also deemed to be interested in the ordinary shares of the Company held by the Rank Group Employee Benefit Trust.
At 1 January 2002 the interest was in a total of 1,224,389 ordinary shares, and at 31 December 2002, and at the date of this report, the interest is in a total of 3,897,157 ordinary shares.
There were no changes in directors interests between 1 January 2003 and the date of this report.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Companys current policy, introduced in 2002, is to allow executive directors, and selected senior executives, to participate in a long term incentive plan the Rank Group 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan the Plan and the 2002 ESOS in respect of the same performance periods.
The Plan provides for executive directors, and selected executives, to be given restricted awards over existing ordinary shares with a market value of up to one times base salary.
Awards are released if a total shareholder return TSR target is achieved and if there is an average annual real growth in normalised eps of at least 2% over the relevant performance period, comprising three consecutive financial years of the Company.
TSR is measured by reference to the change in the price of ordinary shares over the performance period and the gross value of dividends received on the shares, assuming they are immediately reinvested in shares during that period.
A total shareholder return criterion was selected by the committee because of its linkage with shareholder value, and a secondary criterion of eps growth was selected to ensure that awards do not vest at a time of overall unsatisfactory financial performance.
The group of companies with which the TSR of the Company is compared currently comprises BAA, Boots, Carlton, fide Vere, Dixons, EMI, Granada, GUS, Hilton, Kingsher, Luminar Leisure, Mothercare, MyTravel, Next, Pearson, Scottish & Newcastle, Six Continents, WH Smith and Whitbread.
A participant in the Plan will receive the total number of shares comprised in the restricted award if the Companys TSR performance ranks in the top quartile of the comparator group.
To receive the minimum award 30%, the Companys TSR performance must exceed the median performance.
The percentage of shares to be released for performance between the minimum and maximum targets increases on a straight line basis.
The executive directors were given further restricted awards under the Plan in 2002 but these had a market value of 50% of base salary, not 100% as applied previously, as the directors were also granted executive share options in this period.
The Companys TSR performance over the three years ended 31 December 2002 ranked number two in the comparator group, and the average annual real growth in normalised eps exceeded 2% in the period.
Accordingly, in 2003 Mike Smith and Ian Dyson will receive all of the shares conditionally awarded to them in 2000.
In addition, Jerry Fowden, who resigned as a director in 2001, will receive an award of 61,502 ordinary shares.
At the date of vesting of the awards, the market value of one ordinary share was 235p.
The Rank Group Plc 37 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The following information relating to the Plan is required to be disclosed by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
As at 31 December 2002 the Company was ranked number two in its comparator group in respect of the performance periods commencing January 2001 and 2002.
