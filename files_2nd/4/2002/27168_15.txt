Directors Remuneration Report The Board has prepared this report, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, which applies for the first time to this financial year.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 33 and 34.
Remuneration Committee Until the resignation of the Rt Hon Viscount Younger of Leckie on 6 November 2002, the Company had five nonexecutive Directors.
The whole Board fulfils the function of a Remuneration Committee.
The Board has not been provided with advice or services by any person in respect of its consideration of the Directors remuneration although the Directors expect, from time to time, to review the fees paid to the boards of directors of other investment trust companies.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of the Directors, all of whom are non-executive Directors, should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole, be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts in the same AITC Sectors of Global Growth and Income and Global Growth, which also have a similar capital structure, and investment objectives.
The primary aim of Murray International Trust is to achieve a total return greater than its benchmark by investing predominantly in equities worldwide.
Within this objective the Manager will seek to increase the Companys revenues in order to maintain an above average dividend yield.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 31 December 2003 and subsequent years.
The Companys policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by him.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association, which limit the aggregate of the fees payable to the Directors to 100,000 per annum.
The Companys policy is that fees payable to the Directors should reflect the time spent by them on the Companys affairs and should be sufficient to enable candidates of a high quality to be recruited.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The Remuneration Committee carried out a review of the level of Directors fees and concluded that the amounts should increase with effect from 1 January 2002 from 15,000 per annum to 15,750 per annum for the Chairman and from 9,000 to 10,500 for each Director.
The policy is to review these rates from time to time.
Directors and officers liability insurance cover is held by the Company in respect of the Directors.
Directors service contracts None of the Directors has a contract of service or services and a Director may resign by notice in writing to the Board at any time: there are no set notice periods.
All Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years: this period may be varied by mutual consent.
The Articles of Association provide that, at the Annual General Meeting each year, one third of the Directors for the time being or if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to one third shall be subject to retirement by rotation.
Directors, therefore, shall retire and be subject to re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter shall be obliged to retire by rotation, and offer themselves for re-election, at least every three years.
Any Director who attains the age of 70 is subject to annual re-election.
No compensation is payable for loss of office, save any arrears of fees which may be due.
