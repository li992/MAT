26 Croda Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Report on the directors remuneration Report on the directors remuneration The directors remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.
Its members are given on page 24.
The parts of this report which are subject to audit are indicated with an asterisk.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The remuneration of executive directors and senior executives is determined by the committee.
The key objectives of Crodas executive remuneration policy are nto ensure that individual rewards and incentives are comparable with those provided by similar companies having regard to the Groups turnover, business sector and market worth and the need for skills to manage international businesses nto enable the Group to attract and retain high calibre people nto give full consideration to the relevant principles on directors remuneration set out in the Combined Code the Code nto ensure a balance between fixed and performance related remuneration, the latter being related to objective measurement of the financial performance of the Company nthe committee believes that the interests of shareholders and directors are more closely aligned with bonuses related to cash profitability and the control of working capital of the Group, rather than being based on performance related to peer groups, where external factors beyond the control of the directors can have a disproportionate influence on bonus payment, both favourable and adverse.
BASIC SALARY AND BENEFITS The basic salaries and benefits for the executive directors for 2002 were established on the basis of a report commissioned by the committee from New Bridge Street Consultants NBSC against a group of comparator companies chosen by NBSC.
NBSC do not provide any other services to the company.
In view of the difficulty in establishing a list of companies who are true comparators with the Companys operations, the committee has decided that it would be more appropriate to set salaries in relation to those paid by companies comprising the FTSE mid 250.
For 2003 we have used salary information as published by Income Data Services.
PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS SCHEMES The Company operates bonus schemes for its directors and senior executives.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
In respect of 2002 the bonus scheme for executive directors was established on the basis that bonuses would be payable at 0.5% of salary for each 1% by which the Groups profitability from continuing operations exceeded 90% of target income rising to 2% of salary for each 1% that the performance percentage exceeded 100% of target, target income being strategic plan Group EBITDA adjusted for exceptional items but after deduction of a notional interest charge on working capital employed.
Bonuses earned in respect of 2002 are shown on page 28.
In respect of 2003, the bonus scheme for executive directors is again related to target income incorporating an element for the control of working capital and with bonuses payable on a graduated scale from 0.5% of salary for each 1% that performance percentage exceeds 90% of target income rising to 3% of salary for each 1% of performance percentage above 112.5% of target income.
The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of salary with the element of any bonus in excess of 50% of salary being deferred until 31 December 2004 and bonus up to 50% of salary paid by 31 March 2004.
SHARE OPTIONS Senior Executive Share Option Schemes are in place.
Options which may be exercised between three and ten years from the date of issue are granted to executive directors and senior executives both in the UK and overseas.
The share options are based on market prices of the Companys ordinary shares at the time of grant.
The aim of the option schemes is to identify closely the interests of the executive directors and senior executives of the Company with those of its shareholders.
To this end the options granted under the option schemes which were extended by a resolution passed at the Companys 1995 AGM are subject to satisfaction of performance conditions before they can be exercised.
Options granted between 1995 and 1999 cannot be 27 Croda Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Report on the directors remuneration exercised for a minimum period of three years after the date of grant, but are then exercisable at any time during the following seven years provided the Companys earnings per share have increased by more than 2% plus the rate of UK inflation per annum in any period of three consecutive years following the date of grant.
The rules of the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes adopted with effect from 1 January 2000 enable options to be awarded annually in the absence of special circumstances on a graduated scale awarding the Group Chief Executive options to a value of one years salary, 80% of salary for other executive directors and decreasing percentages for other senior employees.
Earnings per share must grow at RPI plus 7% per annum for 100% of the options allocated to be exercisable.
With earnings per share growth at RPI plus 5% per annum 75% of the options are exercisable and at RPI plus 3% per annum 50% of the options are exercisable.
The performance period commences at the date of grant and lasts for a minimum of three years and a maximum of ten years until an average growth rate of at least RPI plus 3% per annum over the whole period has been achieved.
Details of options granted to directors are shown in the table on page 30.
It is the Companys current intention to satisfy the exercise of share options primarily from shares purchased in the market and not by the issue of new shares.
Details of shares held for this purpose are given in note 18 on page 49.
PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS Pensions, company cars, medical insurance, annual leave and other benefits are in line with those provided to executive directors in similar businesses.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Croda has a number of different pension plans in countries in which it operates.
Pension entitlements for Crodas executives are tailored to local market practice, the length of service and age of the participants.
The principal pension plans in the UK are defined benefit schemes which provide a pension based on a proportion of final salary.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS M Humphrey and B M Richmond have service agreements with the Company which are terminable on either side on six months notice.
In addition, if the service agreements are terminated by the Company without just cause, a termination payment equivalent to eighteen months remuneration is payable by the Company.
The Chairman and non-executive directors do not have service contracts but each is appointed for a fixed term.
Details of the appointments of the Chairman and non-executive directors are shown below Contractual Appointment Unexpired Notice termination date term period payments A R Beevor 20.12.01 2 years 2 months 12 months Nil D M Dunn 26.04.00 3 years 2 months N A Nil M A Ward 24.04.01 1 year 2 months N A Nil Appointment extended for a further three year period on 24 February 2003.

28 Croda Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Report on the directors remuneration Report on the directors remuneration RELATIVE PERFORMANCE GRAPH Total shareholder return monitoring: Croda vs FTSE 250 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 FTSE MID 250 CRODA INTERNATIONAL Over the last five years our total shareholder return has been -28% compared to the FTSE 250 return of 3%.
However, following a period of takeover speculation the Croda International Plc share price at 1 January 1998 had risen to 420.5p, almost an all time high, after which the price fell significantly during 1998 with this one years poor performance more than accounting for the five year underperformance.
Indeed over four year and one year time frames we have outperformed the index by 39% and 31% respectively.
In the opinion of the directors the FTSE 250 is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of Croda International Plc should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies to Croda International Plc.
THE CHAIRMANS AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES These fees are determined on the basis of current fee levels in similar businesses.
Fees are reviewed every two years.
The fee for the Chairman of 90,000 per annum has not changed since January 1997.
Basic Fees for the non-executive directors were increased to 29,000 with effect from 1 January 2003 following a review of current practice.
Supplementary fees are paid for committee chairmanship and for special duties beyond the norm expected of a non-executive director, to give total fees of 35,000 for D M Dunn and 32,000 for M A Ward with effect from 1 January 2003.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, incentives or any similar payments other than out-of-pocket travel and accommodation costs in connection with the performance of their duties.
Benefits incorporate all assessable tax benefits arising from employment by the Company and relate in the main to the provision of a company car.
29 Croda Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Report on the directors remuneration PENSION RIGHTS Pension benefits of M Humphrey are funded under the Croda International Supplemental Scheme CISS.
He will be entitled on retirement at age 60 to a pension equal to two-thirds of his final annual pensionable remuneration.
Because of his length of service with the Group he is not subject to limitation on the level of final remuneration known as the earnings cap.
If directors retire before age 60 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death a pension equal to two-thirds of the directors pension would become payable to the surviving spouse.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum.
B M Richmond was paid an additional salary during the year of 43,125 2001: 37,100 to enable her to make independent retirement provision.
B M Richmond is also entitled to death in service benefits from the CISS up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap with the balance being administered by the Company, but receives no other benefits from that fund.

2 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2002 and the corresponding pension one year earlier.
3 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2002 and the corresponding pension one year earlier after an adjustment for inflation was provided for under paragraph 12.43A c ix a of the Listing Rules.
4 Transfer values are quoted on the basis recommended by the Scheme Actuary for valuation of accrued benefits if the member had transferred benefits to another approved scheme on the relevant date.
The reduction in transfer value between 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 is due to fall in equity markets over the period.
This fall has more than offset the increase in accrued pension over the year.
5 The figure represents the difference between transfer values of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001, less contributions paid by M Humphrey.
6 This figure represents the transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits over the period, adjusted for inflation, less contributions paid by M Humphrey.
