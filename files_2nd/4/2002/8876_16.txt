XX 41 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Johnston Press Annual Report & Accounts 2002 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Company voluntarily adopted the same practice last year.
The Remuneration Committee The Committee is chaired by Lord Gordon of Strathblane, an independent Non-Executive Director, and also comprises two other independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr R G Parry and Mr P E B Cawdron.
During the year Mr P E B Cawdron replaced Sir Harry Roche who will step down from the Board next year.
It meets at least annually and as necessary.
The Committee is charged with recommending the remuneration of the Board, employment conditions, changes to the Executive Share Option Schemes and to the Save as you Earn Scheme, and the introduction of any new incentive or remuneration Schemes.
The Committee is consulted on and notified of all senior management appointments and related remuneration.
It is also consulted on major organisational changes.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interest arising from crossdirectorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
The Chief Executive attends meetings when invited by the Committee and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide advice on structuring directors remuneration packages.
New Bridge Street Consultants did not provide any other services to the Company in 2002.
Remuneration Policy Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management: Basic annual salary and benefits: Performance related bonuses: Share options: Pension arrangements: and Proposed Share Matching Plan as detailed in the circular to shareholders dated 19 March 2003.
Both Executive Directors have agreed to a one-year rolling contract.
The most recently executed contracts for Mr T J Bowdler and Mr S R Paterson are 24 March 1995 and 24 May 2001 respectively.
A new service contract is being drawn up for Mr T J Bowdler to reflect the recent changes outlined in this report.
In the event of termination both Executive Directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pensionable service for the notice period, subject to mitigation where appropriate.
The appointments of Non-Executive Directors of the Company are terminable at will.
It is the Committees policy that any future Board appointments would be made on the same terms.
The Companys policy is that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments together with the benefits of participation in Share Option Schemes.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept one Non-Executive appointment outside the Company providing the Chairmans permission is obtained.
Any fees are retained by the director at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition the Executive Directors are entitled to accept any positions connected with the newspaper industry or any businesses in which the Company holds an investment.
Basic Salary An Executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries were reviewed in June 2002, following the acquisition of Regional Independent Media Holdings Ltd, with increases taking effect from 1 May 2002.
The next review will take place on 1 January 2004.
Executive Directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or a cash buyout and private medical insurance.
42 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Johnston Press Annual Report & Accounts 2002 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued Performance Related Bonus The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting the appropriate bonus parameters the Committee, having taken advice, takes into account the Companys internal budgets and analysts expectations.
The Committee believes that this ties any incentive payments to the interests of shareholders.
In 2002 a 25% bonus was payable on achievement of the target with additional sums payable for performance above target with a cap of 50% of the Executives 2 earnings.
From 2003 the cap has been increased for Mr T J Bowdler and Mr S R Paterson to 66 3% and 60% respectively.
The Board retains the discretion to recognise performances over and above this arrangement where exceptional circumstances apply, but any such discretion is restricted to a total bonus of 25% of earnings.
The Annual General Meeting will consider a Share Matching Plan, details of which are included in the circular to shareholders dated 19 March 2003.
Share Options The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme and grants are shown below and in note 27 to the Accounts.
Certain former and current Directors have already participated in the Scheme.
The Remuneration Committee reviews each grant of options to subsidiary company Executives on the recommendation of the Executive Directors.
All options are granted for nil consideration.
These options are only capable of being exercised if the growth in the Groups headline earnings per share exceeds the growth in the retail price index by between three to five percentage points depending on the level of the grant, over a period of at least three years.
Performance is always tested from a fixed base and may not be retested after the fifth anniversary of the option grant.
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring the exercise criterion is met.
The performance criterion, which applies to all Executive Directors to whom options have been granted under the Scheme, was chosen as it requires significant improvement in financial performance before options can be exercised.
In order to exercise a grant above 0.5 times and 1 times salary, the growth in the Groups earnings per share must exceed the growth in the retail price index by more than four and five points respectively.
The Companys policy is to grant options at the discretion of the Committee taking into account individual performance, phasing the grants over a period of time.
The policy is reviewed by the Committee from time to time.
Currently, the grant of options to the Executive Directors and all participants in the Scheme in any year is based on a percentage of salary for achieving a target and an increasing allocation of share options for performance above target up to a maximum level.
The maximum annual grant for Mr T J Bowdler and Mr S R Paterson under this policy is 1.5 times and 1 times salary respectively.
The exercise price of the options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme is equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the time when the options are granted.
The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
Following the acquisition of Regional Independent Media Holdings Ltd in April 2002, which was partly funded by a Rights Issue, all the outstanding share options at the date of acquisition were revised to reflect the discount element of the Rights Issue.
The revision factor was independently checked by the external auditors and approved by the Inland Revenue.
Pension Arrangements The Company operates two final salary schemes, which are closed to new members, and two defined contribution schemes.
The assets of the pension schemes are totally separated from the assets of the Company and of the Group, and are invested by independent fund managers.
A professional independent trustee and member nominated trustees are appointed to each of the pension schemes.
A firm of external actuaries and consultants act as advisors.
Pension scheme members receive a report from the trustees and a statement of their actuarial benefits each year.
Mr T J Bowdler participates in the Johnston Press Pension Scheme for a pension of two-thirds of the earnings cap.
He also receives a contribution to an unapproved scheme which is a total cost to the company of 50% of salary per annum equivalent to a contribution of 27% of salary per annum.
These pension provisions were revised during 2002 and in order to compensate Mr Bowdler for the changes to his detriment, the Annual General Meeting last year approved an award of 169,896 Restricted Shares to Mr Bowdler.
He is entitled to acquire a proportion of these shares every six months for a cost of 1 until 2009.
No performance conditions apply to the Restricted Shares as they were granted to replace reduced pension rights.
Mr S R Paterson does not participate in the Johnston Press Pension Scheme and the Company has agreed instead to make a contribution equivalent of 20% of his basic salary into his private pension scheme.
This contribution increases to 25% from his 50th birthday.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies.
The basic annual fee paid to each to Non-Executive Director is 30,000.
The Non-Executives receive further fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect of the chairing of the Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee together with the XX 43 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Johnston Press Annual Report & Accounts 2002 responsibilities as Chairman and Deputy Chairman.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys Share Option Schemes and are not eligible to join the Companys pension schemes.
Performance Graph The following graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE 350 and FTSE Media Sector also measured by total shareholder return.
The FTSE 350 and FTSE Media Sector have been selected for this comparison because the former measures the performance of stocks in general and the latter measures the performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group.
