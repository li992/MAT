Pension arrangements During the year the Company operated a final salary pension scheme and a GPPP.
During the year the Company contributed 13.6% of the pensionable payroll in respect of the W&DB section, 9.1% in respect of the Marston section and 11.0% in respect of the Mansfield section for the period to 1 December 2001.
With effect from 1 December 2001, the Company contributed 16.5% of pensionable payroll for all members.
Members contributed in accordance with the Rules.
All employees in the Company final salary pension schemes have death-in-service life assurance cover to the value of between two and four times pensionable salary.
The Company introduced the GPPP for new entrants with effect from 29 September 1997 to which it contributes 7.0% of pensionable salary and members contribute a minimum of 3.5% of their pensionable salary.
Membership of the GPPP includes death-in-service life assurance cover to the value of between two and four times pensionable salary.
During the year, the Group operated a final salary pension scheme for employees who joined the Scheme prior to 29 September 1997.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by Trustees and are separate from the Group.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out on 1 October 2000.
This resulted in a long-term Company contribution rate of 16.5% of members total earnings.
The increase from 13.6% in the 1 October 1998 valuation was mainly due to increased life expectancy and falling investment returns.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the Scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings.
The 2000 valuation for the Scheme assumed that investment returns over the longterm would exceed salary growth by 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 184.2m, which was sufficient to cover 98% of members accrued benefits, after allowing for future increases in earnings at the long-term rate.
A provision of 3.1m 2001: 2.8m is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss account over the Company contributions paid.
Non-executive Directors fees The fees for the Non-executive Directors are set by the Board.
The current basic fees were set on 1 October 2001.
The Non-executive Directors do not receive any benefits or pension contributions from the Company.
Compliance with Greenbury The Company complies with the recommendations relating to remuneration committees made by the Greenbury study group on Directors remuneration, now incorporated in Section A of the best practice provisions annexed to the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.
In formulating its remuneration policy, the Committee gives full consideration to Section B of the best practice provisions annexed to the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.
