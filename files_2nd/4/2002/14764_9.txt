S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 R EPORT B Y T HE BOARD TO THE S HAREHOLDERS ON D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION Policy on directors remuneration The board is responsible for setting the Companys policy on directors remuneration and the Remuneration Committee decides on the remuneration of each executive director.
The primary objectives of the Companys policy on executive directors remuneration are rstly, that it should be structured so as to attract and retain executives of a high calibre with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully and, secondly, to reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for the shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee.
No director is involved in determining or deciding his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its role is, inter alia, to apply the boards policy on remuneration.
The current members of this committee are David Wilbraham chairman of the committee, Lorraine Baldry and Graham Menzies.
The executive directors remuneration consists of four components: a Salary which reects the executives experience, responsibility and market value.
b Bonus based on objectives set by the Remuneration Committee relative to the performance of the Group, operating unit or individual as appropriate, as an incentive to the executive directors to achieve relevant and demanding targets.
No executive director received a bonus in respect of 2001 2002.
The Committee decides annually on what objectives should be set for the executive directors for the forthcoming financial year.
For 2002 2003 the Remuneration Committee has set an incentive for the executive directors to achieve a targeted profit before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In addition a further element may be payable in October 2005 in the event that in any financial year ending on or before August 2005, the Groups profit before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items exceeds a target.
Wayne Angstroms bonus is also dependent in part on the US division meeting or exceeding its budget for 2002 2003.
Targets may be adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of any change in the issued share capital.
Bonus payments to directors do not qualify for pension benets.
c Pension and other benets Brian Edwards and Raymond Morley each participate in the Groups principal dened benefit pension scheme which has a normal retirement age of 65.
Miles Emley joined the Company after the imposition of the Inland Revenue earnings cap introduced by the Finance Act 1989.
In his case, the Company contributes to a number of money-purchase pension arrangements.
These were set up for the purpose of providing pension and death in service benets for the executive and his dependants comparable to those of colleagues to whom the cap does not apply.
Wayne Angstrom participates in a Section 401 k Plan set up in the USA for the benefit of employees of St Ives Inc. Certain executive directors receive benets in kind, including the provision of a car, fuel and medical expenses insurance.
d Share options Executive directors and senior managers have been granted share options under the Groups discretionary Executive Share Option Schemes.
These share options were not granted at a discount and, therefore, over time will reward 19 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2002 R EPORT B Y T HE BOARD TO THE S HAREHOLDERS ON D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION continued Policy on directors remuneration continued management when shareholders are rewarded, but not otherwise, as is proper.
At last years Annual General Meeting the shareholders approved a new discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 Scheme and, as a result, no further options will be granted under the Inland Revenue Unapproved 1995 Scheme and the Approved Scheme 1997 Scheme.
No options have been granted under the Approved 1985 Scheme and the Unapproved 1992 Overseas Executive Scheme since, respectively, May 1995 and October 1996.
No options have been granted to the directors under either the 1997 Scheme or the 2001 Scheme: nor has any invitation been issued to directors under the Equity Partnership Plan, also approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held last year.
The performance conditions which will apply to any invitations to participate in the 2001 Scheme and the Equity Partnership Plan will be reported on to shareholders in due course.
Options outstanding under the 1997 Scheme, the 1995 Scheme and the 1992 Scheme cannot be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied, which is an increase in earnings per share on average of not less than 2 per cent per annum above the UK Retail Prices Index over a period of at least three years.
Options can only be exercised between the third and the seventh anniversary of grant in the case of the 1995 Scheme, and between the third and tenth anniversary in the case of the Groups other discretionary schemes.
Executive directors may participate in the Companys Savings-Related Share Option Schemes.
The rules of the Companys share option schemes prevent non-executive directors from participating.
Full details of the components of the executive directors remuneration referred to above, including options granted, exercised and outstanding under all option schemes, are set out in the table below and on pages 21 to 23.
