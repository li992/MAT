44 Capita Report on Directors remuneration Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee the Committee is a Committee of the Group Board with terms of reference approved by the Group Board, established to determine the terms of employment and remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The members of the Committee are the three Non-Executive Directors Peter Cawdron Chairman, Eric Walters and Robert Alcock.
The Committee meets twice a year, in addition to other meetings arranged as necessary.
The Committee consults the Executive Chairman about the proposals in relation to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Inbucon-Meis is an independent  firm that is appointed as an advisor to the Remuneration Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes.
Inbucon-Meis does not provide any other service to the Group.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code as relating to Directors remuneration annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration packages a Overall policy The Committee is of the view that, because of the nature of the Group's business, maintaining its growth and profit record and its developing characteristics justify an overall compensation policy with a strong performance-related element.
Accordingly, a cash and share based package has been designed to provide Directors with rewards that rest between the median and upper quartile ranges of comparable companies if the Group meets its performance targets.
The overall package is weighted towards share based rewards, which the Committee strongly believes link the interests of the Directors and shareholders in respect of shareholder value.
The Committee considers that this approach to remuneration is appropriate particularly due to the strong link between the total executive remuneration and Group performance and plans to continue with this approach in its future remuneration policy.
The Committee believes that the two performance measures chosen for the share incentive schemes - growth in earnings per share EPS and comparative total shareholder return TSR - are the two key long-term indicators of the financial success of the Company.
They are also measures that are acceptable to the majority of the investors in the Company.
The chart below compares the value of an investment of 100 in Capitas shares with an investment in the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE 350 Support Services Index over the five years starting on 1st January 1998 assuming that all dividend income is reinvested.
The Committee believes that this comparison provides a clear picture of how well the company has performed relative to both a wide range of companies in the UK and also a specific group of companies in the same sector.
Capita Group 500 FTSE All Share Index FTSE 350 Support Services Index 400 300 200 100 0 01.01.1998 01.01.1999 01.01.2000 01.01.2001 01.01.2002 01.01.2003 A 100 investment in Capita shares on 1st January 1998 would be worth 207 at 31st December 2002 compared to 89 for an investment in the FTSE All Share Index and 74 for an investment in the FTSE350 Support Services Index.
b Basic salary and benefits Each year the Committee commissions independent reviews of the salaries and benefits of the Executive Directors.
The policy of the Committee is to provide salaries and benefits that are below those provided to comparable roles so as to be able to provide higher performance related elements.
The policy of low base salaries and benefits allows the Executive Directors to provide a lead in terms of keeping fixed remuneration costs low within the Group as a whole.
In addition, it is reflective of the Groupss remuneration policy.
As the Group has been successful, it has been able to prove the benefits of a highly geared structure to its reward strategy which delivers a very competitive total remuneration package.
c Bonus scheme The basis for payments under the bonus scheme is determined at the start of the year and payments are triggered at a predetermined Group profit before tax.
The view of the Committee is that, these performance conditions are relevant, challenging and designed to enhance the business.
As a result of the Groups exceptional performance, annual bonuses have been paid out at the maximum 60% of salary.
This helps to lift the competitiveness of total remuneration towards the upper quartile of the market.
45 Capita Report on Directors remuneration d Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Group adopted The Capita Group Plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP at the Annual General Meeting of the Group on 16th April 1998.
No further awards will be made under the LTIP.
Awards are structured either as Restricted Share Awards or Indexed Performance Share Appreciation Rights IPSARS.
Share Appreciation Rights IPSARS Only one award of Share Appreciation Rights was made to a participant under the LTIP.
Only executive directors were allowed to participate.
Share Appreciation Rights are designed like share options except that the exercise price to be paid by the participants increases pro rata to the FTSE All Share Index, a feature that ensures that participants only gain if the share price outperforms such index.
Share Appreciation Rights are exercisable five years after the award was granted provided that the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR ranking is at least at the upper quartile level of a comparator group, selected from the Support Services Sector.
If the Companys TSR is at the upper quartile level, 40% of the IPSARS will vest.
For 100% vesting, the Companys TSR has to be at the 10th percentile or better within the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR ranking is below the upper quartile, the Share Appreciation Rights lapse.
The comparator group at the date of award is listed below.
AEA Technology Hays Sema Group Aggreko JBA Holdings Serco Group BTG Logica Spring Group Capita Misys Williams CMG Rentokil Initial Danka Business Systems Sage Group The The asterisked companies have been taken over, merged or demerged since the original award date.
Adjustments have been made to the TSR figures for these companies following the capital event to make their data fully comparable.
For example, if the terms of the takeover are such that the offer is made in cash, then such cash proceeds are assumed to have been reinvested in the FTSE All Share Index and the cash value substituted for the share price.
In addition, no Share Appreciation Rights will be exercisable unless growth in the Companys earnings per share exceeds the growth in RPI over the five year period.
The market price of The Capita Group Plc ordinary shares at the date of grant on 5th May 1998 was 1.69 and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 2817.
At 31st December 2002 the market price of The Capita Group Plc ordinary shares was 247.5p and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 1924 and the Retail Price Index had increased by 15 points.
Restricted Share Awards The awards made under this part of the plan vested in full on 4th May 2001, the performance criteria having been met in full.
One of the awards is still in trust and therefore details of the award are set out below.
Restricted Share Awards were designed to deliver shares to participants three years after the date of award depending on the Companys TSR relative to the comparator group listed above over the three year performance period.
Shares may only be released if the company is ranked at or above the median in this comparator group with 5% of awards released at the 49th percentile, 50% of Awards released at the 40th percentile and 100% of Awards released at the 25th percentile or above.
If the Companys TSR ranking is below the median at the end of the performance period, the Restricted Share Awards lapse.
In addition, no shares will be released if the growth in the Companys EPS has not exceeded the growth in the RPI over the three year performance period.

Non-Executive Director 47 Capita Report on Directors remuneration b Share option schemes The Group has two share option schemes in existence, the 1997 Scheme, approved by shareholders in April 1997, and the Capita Sharesave Scheme that was established in 2000.
The 1997 Scheme replaced the A Scheme and the B Scheme, which were closed in April 1997.
The exercise of options granted under the 1997 Scheme is conditional on growth in Capitas Earnings per Share EPS exceeding the growth in the retail price index RPI by 8% per annum over the three year period from the date of grant.
The performance condition is more challenging than general market practice for share option schemes.
The Directors interests in share options are listed below.
In 2002, the aggregate gain on the exercise of share options was nil 2001: 4,685,000.
The market price of the Companys shares on 31st December 2002 was 248p and the high and low prices during the year were 492 p and 167p respectively.
Since the grant of the share options on 22nd May 2002, the high and low of the Companys shares were 390p and 167p respectively.
The options are exercisable, after the date given above, for a period of six months after completion of a three or five year savings period.
There are no performance criteria under this scheme.

The aggregate value of the restricted share awards that vested on 5th May 2001 was 4,723,000.
Mr R M Aldridge OBE has not exercised his right of transfer in respect of these shares.
Had he exercised this right on 5th May 2001 the gain would have been 1,420,461.
Mr P R M Pindar the highest paid director exercised his rights over 265,116 shares on 18th March 2002 and made a gain of 1,193,000 on that day.
The performance requirement in respect of the IPSARS are detailed in d, in the not subject to audit section above.
d Long Term Indexed Share Appreciation Scheme LTISAS The Group adopted The Capita Group Plc Long Term Indexed Share Scheme LTISAS at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Group on 12th November 2002.
The LTISAS is designed to replace the IPSARs described above which reach the end of their performance period on 4th May 2003.
The new LTISAS is very similar to the IPSAR under the LTIP that it replaces.
Executive Directors will be provided with two equal tranches of 600,000 options over five years.
The exercise price of the options increases in line with the FTSE All Share Index, a feature that ensures that participants only gain if the share price outperforms such index.
In calculating the share price, only upward movements in the FTSE All Share Index are taken into account i. e. falls in the Index do not lead to falls in the exercise price.
In addition the options will only be exercisable if, over the performance period, the growth in the Companys EPS exceeds the growth in the RPI.
25% of the options shall vest if growth in the Companys EPS exceeds RPI growth by 8% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS exceeds growth in the RPI by 12%per annum.
The first tranche of 600,000 options was granted on 25th November 2002 and will have a five year performance period.
The second tranche will be granted in November 2004 and will have a three year performance period using the same criteria as the first tranche.
Thus both tranches will have performance periods which will end in November 2007.
The market price of The Capita Group Plc ordinary shares at the date of grant on 25th November 2002 was 2.77 and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 1980.
At 31st December 2002 the market price of The Capita Group Plc ordinary shares was 247.5p and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 1924.
The grant price for the first tranche of options was 216p.
This was calculated based on the average of the closing share price one month prior to the date of grant.
No further long-term incentive awards will be made to the executives over the five year period to November 2007. e Interests in Shares awarded under the Long Term Indexed Share Appreciation Scheme Options Earliest Latest Date of Award granted exercise date exercise date R M Aldridge OBE 25th November 2002 600,000 25th November 2007 25th November 2012 P R M Pindar 25th November 2002 600,000 25th November 2007 25th November 2012 P M Doyle 25th November 2002 600,000 25th November 2007 25th November 2012 G M Hurst 25th November 2002 600,000 25th November 2007 25th November 2012 The performance criteria attached to these awards is included in d above.
