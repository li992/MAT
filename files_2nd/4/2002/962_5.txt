It is the Committees usual policy to base 70% of each annual bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the Elements of executive director remuneration remaining 30% on the personal key performance measures.
Executive director remuneration comprises the following five principal elements: In order to encourage directors to build up a significant personal stake in the Company, a share match is used.
Directors are required base salary: to defer 50% of their bonus and may, at the discretion of the Committee on a year-by-year basis, defer all of their bonus net of annual bonus plan: tax to acquire shares in Anglo American.

EPS was selected as the key performance measure individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken for this plan as it is a fundamental financial performance indicator, into consideration when determining annual base salaries.
The EPS growth requirement takes account of the cyclical nature of the natural resources business.
If the performance condition is not met at the end of the first three year period, then performance is retested each year over the ten year life of the option on a rolling three year basis.
Options are normally exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Save As You Earn SAYE and Share Incentive Plan SIP schemes, which are open to all UK employees.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 17 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Long term incentive plan LTIP It is the Committees policy to make conditional LTIP awards to executive directors annually.
These awards are discretionary and are considered on a case-by-case basis.
The policy of the Committee at present, and in recent years, is to make annual awards of LTIP interests over shares with a face value of 120% of basic salary for the chief executive and 100% of basic salary for the other executive directors.
However, in exceptional circumstances and in order to accommodate changing market conditions, awards may be made to each executive director of up to a maximum of two times basic salary per annum.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance measures relating to Total Shareholder Return TSR and to an operating measure, initially Return On Capital Employed ROCE, over a fixed three year period.
50% of the award for all directors, except B E Davison, is subject to the Group TSR measure and 50% to a Group ROCE measure.
Vesting of B E Davisons award is conditional upon the same TSR performance measure: however, only 30% of the award is conditional upon the Group ROCE measure, with the balance of 20% of the award being conditional upon an Anglo American Platinum Corporation Limited Anglo Platinum ROCE measure.
This reflects his responsibility for the Anglo Platinum business.
These performance conditions are selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value, and there is no provision for retesting.
The Committee may amend the performance condition applying to any award, provided that the amended conditions are no less demanding and will be a fairer measure of performance or will provide a more effective incentive to the participant, and that circumstances merit such a change.
At the end of each performance period, the level of performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published and be subject to external verification by the Companys auditors.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in Anglo American.
Detailed structure of the LTIP Part of each award will be based on the TSR measure and part will be based on the operating measure, as described below: Performance measures Performance measure % of LTIP award conditional on performance Anglo Group Platinum Executive directors TSR ROCE ROCE A J Trahar chief executive 50% 50% B E Davison with divisional responsibility for Anglo Platinum 50% 30% 20% A W Lea 50% 50% W A Nairn 50% 50% Further details of the TSR and ROCE operating measures are set out below Total Shareholder Return The proportion of shares vesting in relation to the part of the award contingent on TSR performance varies according to the Companys TSR over the performance period relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies the Index.
The Index comprises three categories, and each of the three categories is weighted to reflect Anglo Americans business mix, and the average TSR of the Index is thus determined.
The first category consists of a minimum of five international diversified mining companies, the second of a minimum of five international forest products companies and the third a minimum of four international industrial minerals companies.
The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Index, and the relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of comparator companies in the Index.
In calculating TSR, it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For the LTIP interests awarded in 2002 the comparator companies are as follows: Mining Forest Products Industrial Minerals Category weighting 71% 17% 12% Comparator companies Anglovaal Mining Limited M-real Corporation Aggregate Industries plc BHP Billiton plc Sappi Limited CRH plc Companhia Vale do Rio Doce SCA Hanson plc MIM Holdings Limited David S. Smith Holdings plc RMC Group plc Noranda Inc Stora Enso Oyj Rio Tinto plc UPM-Kymmene Group WMC Limited Xstrata plc Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 18 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The TSR element of the award vests as shown in the table below: Anglo Americans relative TSR Proportion of TSR element vesting Below the weighted average TSR of the Index 0% Equal to the weighted average TSR of the Index 50% Equal to the weighted average TSR of the top two companies in each category 100% Equal to or greater than the weighted average TSR of the top company in each category 150% Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between 50% and 100% as described above, and also between 100% and 150% for exceptional performance as described above.
A graph showing Anglo Americans TSR performance against the weighted average of the comparator index as shown above for the period from 24 May 1999, when the Company was incorporated, to 31 December 2002 can be found on page 20: for the purposes of drawing this graph Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Xstrata plc were excluded from the index as they were not listed at the beginning of the period depicted by the graph.
Return On Capital Employed ROCE has been adopted as the second performance measure for the LTIP grants made to date.
The directors consider this to be among the most important factors which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business as well as one of the most important measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting in relation to this part of the award will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Groups and or business average annualised ROCE over the performance period adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.
The Committee has set Minimum Targets for improvement in return on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period Existing Capital Employed and on the additional capital employed during the performance period Incremental Capital Employed.
The Maximum ROCE Targets are based on stretching levels of return on the Existing Capital Employed.
The targets for each element of the 2002 Plan are shown below.
These are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.

Pensions Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historical obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal circumstances of each executive.
Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 24 and 25.
Other benefits Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability insurance, social club membership in accordance with local market practice and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
Directors based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies at a preferential interest rate in accordance with local market practice.
The provision of these benefits is considered to be market competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of one and a half times base salary in the case of the chief executive, and one times base salary in the case of other executive directors.
Share dilution through the operation of share plans Where shares are issued to satisfy incentives, the aggregate dilution resulting from executive incentives will not exceed 5% in any ten-year period, and that resulting from all incentives, including all-employee incentives, will not exceed 10% in any ten-year period.
External appointments Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the board: if approved, they may retain the fees payable from one such appointment.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 19 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Non-executive directors The board reviews non-executive directors fees periodically in the light of fees payable to non-executive directors for comparable companies and the importance attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals as non-executive directors.
Levels of fees are also set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the board and its committees.
Additional fees are paid to the senior independent non-executive director and were also paid to the deputy chairman while the post was occupied.
Where non-executive directors have board roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they also receive additional fees on account of their increased responsibilities.
Non-executive directors are eligible to forgo all or part of their directors fees to subscribe for shares in the Company, after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys annual bonus plan, share option schemes, long term incentive plan or Company pension arrangements.
Directors service contracts It is the Companys policy that the period of notice required for executive directors does not exceed 12 months.
In order to properly reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is employed by Anglo American International BVI Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International IOM Limited and with Anglo Operations Limited.
The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and or South African rand as appropriate.
The employment contracts of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months notice by either party.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Anglo American for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment, subject to reappointment at the annual general meeting.
In addition to his service contract with Anglo American, R M Godsell has a service contract with AngloGold Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of Anglo American, in his capacity as chief executive.
Under this contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months notice.

Sir David Scholey retires by rotation at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
In addition, a director may at any annual general meeting retire from office and stand for re-election.
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, D J Challen and F T M Phaswana were appointed subsequent to the 2002 AGM and will stand for election at the 2003 AGM.
2 There is no fixed notice period: however, the Company may in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, by Ordinary Resolution, of which special notice has been given, remove any director from office.
The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company terminates the contract other than for cause or the executive resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration.
Compensation is based on the value of 12 months basic salary, target annual bonus for 12 months and the annual value of benefits.
The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other benefits per se during the notice period or to pay an amount equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period.
Vesting of share options on termination of a directors contract is dependent on how the contract is terminated.
Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy.
However, if the director resigns voluntarily, then all options lapse unless the Committee determines otherwise.
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns, then his interests lapse.
If he is made redundant, at the end of the performance period vesting is based on the normal performance criteria and then is pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period for which the director served.
Similarly, in the case of the deferred bonus plan, no matching shares would be granted should a director resign before the end of the three year vesting period, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
If a director is made redundant, he would receive matching shares pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period for which he served.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 20 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Performance graphs The graphs below represent the comparative TSR performance of the Company from 24 May 1999 to 31 December 2002.

This graph has been produced in accordance with the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The second graph shows the Companys performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance for the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests granted in 2002.
This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American is performing against the targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for each years interests may vary to reflect changes in the marketplace such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Companys competitors or changes to the Companys business mix.
In drawing these graphs it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30 day period up to and including that date.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES DURING 2002 The application of the Companys remuneration policy during the period under review resulted in the following directors remuneration.

3 Share options in respect of shares whose market price as at 31 December 2002 is below the option exercise price.
4 Details of the share option scheme and the performance conditions attached to awards of share options can be found on page 16.
In summary, the exercise of these options is subject to Anglo Americans EPS increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
5 The Anglo American options awarded in March 2002 in respect of the Executive Share Option Scheme were granted at an exercise price of 11.50, which reflected the price ruling at the date of grant.
These share options are exercisable between 18 March 2005 and 17 March 2012.
The directors have also been granted additional shares in order to meet the national insurance contribution liability.
The directors do not benefit from this arrangement which operates as a hedge against the future uncapped national insurance contributions liability and hence these have not been included herein.
In addition, W A Nairn was granted 1,029 shares under the SAYE Scheme at an exercise price of 9.23.

Signed on behalf of the board of directors R J Margetts 27 February 2003 REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW This letter reports on the results of the review by Mercer Human Resource Consulting of the executive remuneration processes and outcomes that underlie Anglo Americans remuneration report for the financial year 2002.
Mercer undertook the review at the request of the Companys Remuneration Committee the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes that you have followed are appropriate and that the Company has complied with the policies set out in the remuneration report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Remuneration Committees Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings during the year as well as the materials prepared for the Committees review.
We also interviewed the Committee Chairman and Secretary.
Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the remuneration report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo Americans executive remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that Anglo Americans executive remuneration process with respect to 2002 was fully consistent with the description set forth in the remuneration report and that the remuneration decisions for the year were made based on the principles and policies laid out in the report.
Furthermore, it is our view that the Remuneration Committee continues to take a suitably robust approach to its work.
One area of potential improvement that we identified was that of ensuring that effective training procedures are put in place for new appointments to the Committee.
Management have undertaken to do this.
Additional detail regarding Mercers review is included in a letter of this date to the Committee Chairman: we understand that this letter will be available on the Companys website.
