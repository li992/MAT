Directors Remuneration Report Part I As proposed by the Combined Code and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee advises the Board on the Groups policy on executive remuneration and specifically determines the remuneration packages of each of the executive directors.
The committee is comprised solely of independent non-executive directors and currently consists of John C Morgan Chairman, Roberto Monti and D John Ogren appointed February, 2003.
The Committees written terms of reference were revised and restated at the time of the Groups IPO in June.
Except when his own remuneration was being discussed, the Chairman and Chief Executive attended meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide advice on setting remuneration for other executive directors.
In addition the Groups Head of Human Resources, Peter D Nicholson has provided advice that assisted the Committee.
No external advisers or consultants provided services to the Committee during the year.
Remuneration Policy In formulating remuneration policy, the Committee gives full consideration to the relevant provisions of the Combined Code and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Committees policy is to ensure executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group.
Remuneration packages are intended to be competitive when compared against those offered by a range of companies within the same business sectors and geographic areas as the Group.
They comprise a mix of performance related and nonperformance related remuneration designed to attract, retain and incentivise international executives who have the necessary skills and expertise to continue to deliver exceptional shareholder value.
The total remuneration package for each executive director comprises a basic salary, benefits-in-kind, annual cash bonus and participation in the Groups pension and share option schemes.
Sir Ian Wood, Chairman and Chief Executive does not participate in the Groups share option schemes.
This report sets out the Groups policy on executive directors remuneration for 2003 and, so far as practicable, for future years, subject to changes in the Groups business environment and in remuneration practices.
Following a review of benchmark company information, the Committee is currently working with the Group to review the remuneration policy, in particular the long-term share based retention elements for its executive directors and senior management, with a view to improving the competitiveness and the potential of these arrangements to incentivise long term retention of key personnel.
We hope to include further details of the proposals which result from this review in our Annual General Meeting documentation and any changes in policy will be described in future Directors Remuneration Reports.
Basic Salary In setting the basic salaries of the executive directors the Committee seeks to ensure that a significant part of the remuneration package payable to each executive director is based on performance so that the total reward from base salary and performance related elements is at a competitive level.
32 John Wood Group PLC Directors Remuneration Report Annual Cash Bonus 2002 annual cash bonuses were based on the executive directors performance during the year.
Actual bonuses for the year are disclosed in the table set out in Part II.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Bonuses under the 2003 annual cash bonus plan are based partly on the executive directors performance against annually agreed objectives aimed at achievement of the Groups business related goals and partly on overall Group financial performance, measured against annually established financial budgets, comprising both an earnings and a return on capital employed measure.
The Committee has fixed the maximum bonus potential for executive directors for 2003 at 50% of basic salary.
Share Options No share options were granted to executive directors during 2002.
Pensions UK based executive directors are entitled to membership of the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefit Scheme which is a defined benefit pension scheme.
This entitles them to the following benefits: 1.
Life assurance cover of four times basic salary 2.
A retirement pension subject to Inland Revenue restrictions based upon an accrual rate of 1 60th of final salary per year of service up to a maximum of 40 60ths.
Normal retirement age under the scheme is 65.
If a director dies in pensionable service, the surviving spouse or dependants are entitled to a pension of two thirds of the pension that would have been received at normal retirement date based on the final pensionable salary at the date of death.
The surviving spouse of W Edgar would receive a pension of 50%.
Retirement pensions relating to service post 6th April 1997 will increase annually at the lower of RPI or 5%, however there will be no increases to pensions for service prior to 6th April 1997 except to comply with contracting out requirements for post April 1988 Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.
W Edgar makes a contribution of 6% of basic salary.
Sir Ian Wood and A G Langlands are non-contributory members of the Groups UK pension scheme.
Sir Ian Wood and A G Langlands receive pension increases of 3% per annum on pensions accrued prior to 6th April 1997 and a minimum increase of 3% on pension accrued after 6th April 1997.
Sir Ian Wood and A G Langlands, at age 65, are entitled to a pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary less retained benefits from previous employers schemes.
Only A G Langlands has such retained benefits.
The maximum level of benefits which can be provided by an approved pension scheme for joiners post June 1989 currently stands at 97,200.
As a result of this restriction, W Edgar receives additional remuneration based upon 10% of the difference between his actual salary and the cap.
Benefits are provided to A G Langlands in excess of the cap, and are provided by way of an unfunded, unapproved arrangement.
A Semple and W Brooks participate in a Group defined contribution arrangement.
During the year the Groups contributions on their behalf amounted to US$ 5,500 2001: US$5,100 and US$ 6,000 2001: US$5,100 respectively.
They also have life insurance, of approximately four times salary.
John Wood Group PLC 33 Directors Remuneration Report Share Option Schemes Prior to listing on the London Stock Exchange the Group operated two approved executive share option schemes, the John Wood Group PLC 1994 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the John Wood Group PLC 2000 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and two unapproved executive share option schemes, the John Wood Group PLC 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme and the John Wood Group PLC 2000 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the Former Share Option Schemes.
The options granted under the Former Share Option Schemes vest on the basis of periods of continuous employment with the Group and do not have additional performance conditions attached which have to be satisfied prior to vesting.
The Board has resolved that no further options will be granted under the Former Share Option Schemes.
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important for the Group to be in a position to incentivise and retain its executive directors and key management by granting share options within parameters acceptable to the Groups shareholders.
Accordingly the Group has adopted the John Wood Group PLC No 1 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme and the John Wood Group PLC No 2 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the New Share Option Schemes in order to provide a proper platform for the incentivisation and retention of executive directors and key management.
The New Share Option Schemes and the proposed parameters of their operation were approved by shareholders on the listing of the Group in June 2002.
Options granted under the New Share Option Schemes are exercisable between four and ten years from the grant date and options granted to Group Directors are subject to the achievement of performance criteria.
Options granted to employees below the level of Group Director are currently not subject to additional performance conditions to ensure that the Groups option package is competitive in all locations where it has operations, in particular in the US where the Companys competitors do not normally impose performance conditions on the vesting of options.
The current performance condition for Board members in the New Share Option Schemes is that annualised earnings per share growth over the measurement period must be an average of 3% per annum greater than the percentage increase, if any, in the Retail Price Index, over that period.
The measurement period is a period of four consecutive financial years of the Group, starting from the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant.
Re-testing of the performance condition may occur over an extended measurement period of five, six or eight consecutive financial years of the Company, starting from the original base point.
The operation of the New Share Option Schemes is subject to ongoing review by the Remuneration Committee with regard to the performance conditions, level of allocation and the frequency of issue of options, taking into account the practice of comparable companies.
Grants of options are considered on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee and grants to any individual are generally phased rather than awarded in blocks.
Service Contracts The executive directors entered into new service contracts with effect from 1st May 2002.
They do not have a fixed term and are terminable by either party giving to the other not less than 12 months written notice of termination.
It is the Remuneration Committees view that these contractual notice periods continue to be appropriate and in line with current best practice.
None of the service contracts provides for pre-determined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination.
On termination of service contracts, executive directors are entitled to the payment of their salary and benefits in kind provided that they will be subject to a general duty to mitigate their loss.
Within contractual constraints, the Remuneration Committee will endeavour to ensure that executive directors do not 34 John Wood Group PLC Directors Remuneration Report receive unwarranted payments if it is judged that their performance has had a detrimental effect on shareholder value.
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships or other significant appointments without the Boards prior consent.
Non Executive Directors Non-executive directors are paid directors fees, which reflect the commitment expected of them, and are reimbursed all necessary and reasonable expenses in the performance of their duties.
Additional fees are paid in respect of membership of a committee of the Group.
Non Executive Directors do not participate in the Groups annual bonus, share option or pension plans.
The Non Executive Directors have each entered into letters of engagement addressing remuneration, services to be provided, conflicts of interest and confidentiality.
Subject to the requirement for retirement by rotation every three years under the Articles of Association, the letters of engagement do not have fixed terms and are terminable by either party giving to the other not less than 90 days written notice of termination.
