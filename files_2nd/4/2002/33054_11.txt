As a result of this delay, those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of 4.333 adjusted for the Rights Issue.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
