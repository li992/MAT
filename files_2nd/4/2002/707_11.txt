b Associated undertakings Group highlights in the Euro and US dollars The principal difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP relates to the accounting treatment of goodwill which is discussed in note a.
Sterling Euro US dollar 2002 2001 2002 2001 2002 2001 c Stocks $ $ Under UK GAAP, stock acquired through a business combination is valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.

Under US GAAP, Net assets 786m 409m 1,242m 654m 1,218m 593m these amounts would be treated as Treasury Stock and deducted from shareholders funds.
Free cash flow after dividends paid 211m 86m 333m 138m 327m 125m Figures stated in the Euro and US dollars have been translated at the 31 August closing rates of exchange for each year.
e Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, provisions are made for restructuring costs once a detailed formal plan is in place and valid expectations have been raised in those affected that the restructuring will be carried out.
Provision is made for voluntary redundancy payments to the extent that it is expected that volunteers will come forward.
US GAAP requires a number of specific criteria to be met before restructuring costs can be recognised as an expense.
Also, to the extent restructuring costs are related to the activities of an acquired company, US GAAP allows them to be recognised as a liability upon acquisition provided certain specific criteria are met whereas UK GAAP does not.
Accordingly, timing differences arise between UK GAAP and US GAAP recognition of restructuring costs.
f Pension and other post retirement benefits Under the groups accounting policy for post-employment benefits, in accordance with SSAP 24, pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the service life of employees based on consultation with actuaries and using the projected unit credit method and a set of long term actuarial assumptions.
Under US GAAP, pension costs and liabilities are calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
This standard requires the use of the projected unit credit method and prescribes, in particular, the use of a market-related discount rate.
This is not the same as the long term approach used under SSAP 24.
68 Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Annual Report and Accounts 2002 69 US GAAP reconciliation Year to Year to g Share compensation 31 August 31 August Under UK GAAP, the cost of share option plans are amortised based on the cost of the shares acquired by the employee trusts to fulfil the plan, 2002 2001 less the amount contributed by the employee.
Under US GAAP, compensation for fixed plan awards is determined at the date of grant, based Note m m on the cost of the fair value of the shares subject to the award, less the option exercise or purchase price, if any, except for allowable discounts Profit earned for ordinary shareholders in accordance with UK GAAP 392 344 with respect to certain qualified plans where the discount is no greater than 15% of the fair value of the shares.
Compensation costs for Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: variable plan awards is estimated at the end of each period from the date of grant to the date final compensation costs are determinable Brands a 32 based on the difference between the fair value of the shares subject to the award and the option exercise or purchase price.
Such cost is allocated to compensation expense over the vesting period and, if performance criteria are applicable to the award, based on actual Goodwill a 38 16 performance attained.
Other intangible assets a 4 5 Stocks c 66 1 h Proposed dividends Restructuring costs e 4 10 Under UK GAAP, the proposed dividends on ordinary shares, as recommended by the directors, are deducted from shareholders equity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the period to which they relate, including proposed dividends which have been Pension costs and other post retirement benefits f 28 3 recommended but not yet approved by shareholders.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are only deducted from shareholders equity at Share compensation g 1 the date of declaration of the dividend.
Derivative instruments i 90 19 Mexican excise rebate l 54 94 i Derivative instruments Franchise income n 9 The groups foreign currency, interest rate and commodity contracts hedge forecast exposures that do not meet the US GAAP hedge accounting criteria.
Under US GAAP, these contracts are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains and losses arising are Other 1 2 included in net income.
Under UK GAAP, these gains and losses can be deferred until the hedged transactions actually occur.
Deferred taxation other j 40 Deferred taxation on above US GAAP adjustments j 28 21 The group may enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge the purchase price consideration on certain acquisitions.
Under UK GAAP, the gains and losses arising on these foreign currency contracts are recognised in the purchase price consideration.
Under US GAAP, the gains Minority share of above adjustments and losses arising on these foreign currency contracts are recognised within net income.
Net income in accordance with US GAAP 406 332 Other comprehensive income: j Deferred taxation Minimum pension liability 203 207 The group has adopted FRS 19 Deferred Tax in the year ended 31 August 2002.
Consequently, the consolidated financial statements as at 31 August 2001, and the year ended 31 August 2001 have been restated and disclosures have been modified to reflect retroactively the Currency translation differences 130 11 impact of the adoption of FRS 19 on such financial statements as required by UK GAAP.
FRS 19 brings accounting for deferred tax under UK Comprehensive income in accordance with US GAAP 73 114 GAAP conceptually closer to US GAAP, although some differences remain.
Following the groups restatement under FRS 19, and other than Net earnings per ordinary share the tax effect of other UK to US GAAP differences, there is only one material difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
This difference Basic 38.1p 31.5p relates to the recognition criteria for recording deferred tax assets under US GAAP and UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, the calculation of current and deferred tax assets is based on the probable tax treatment of the tax position taken.
Once it is determined that there is a probable Diluted 38.0p 31.5p deferred tax asset, it is then reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent it is deemed more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50% Goodwill and other intangible assets adoption of SFAS No.
142 that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realised.
Reported net income in accordance with US GAAP 406 332 Under UK GAAP, both the existence of the asset and the probability of its recoverability are considered in combination, and a deferred tax Add back: brand amortisation 32 asset is recognised only to the extent that its existence and recoverability are probable a threshold which is higher than more likely than not.
Add back: goodwill amortisation 29 Adjusted net income in accordance with US GAAP 406 393 k Exceptional items Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are those that, by virtue of their size or nature, the board of directors believes should be separately Basic earnings per share: disclosed.
Such items are included within the profit and loss account heading and disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial Reported net income in accordance with US GAAP 38.1p 31.6p statements.
Under US GAAP, there is no such concept as exceptional items.
Exceptional items would not be considered extraordinary or non-operating items under US GAAP.
Brand amortisation 3.1p Goodwill amortisation 2.8p l Mexican excise rebate Adjusted net income in accordance with US GAAP 38.1p 37.5p Under UK GAAP, we are recognising the amount due when offset against future excise duty and other taxes payable.
Under US GAAP, the Mexican excise rebate was recognised upon the issuance of a favourable court judgment and additional interest and inflation adjustments Diluted earnings per share: are recognised as they accrue.
Reported net income in accordance with US GAAP 38.0p 31.6p Brand amortisation 3.1p m Liabilities The group is contractually obligated to make a payment to a business venture partner upon termination of the venture which, unless renewed, Goodwill amortisation 2.8p is scheduled to terminate in 2029.
Under UK GAAP, the group records the obligation at the present value of the payment obligation, Adjusted net income in accordance with US GAAP 38.0p 37.5p discounted at a risk-adjusted rate to reflect the time value of money, and recognises interest expense each period such that the recorded obligation will equal the payment obligation at the currently best estimated scheduled maturity.
Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at the amount payable at maturity i. e. undiscounted.
n Franchise income The group has entered into agreements to sell the right to develop multiple stores within a specified territory, which entitles the group to nonrefundable franchise fees.
Under UK GAAP, these franchise fees are recognised upon signing of the agreement.
Under US GAAP, the revenue recognition is based on store openings or until the rights to develop the territory have been forfeited.
