6005 Text 17 49 5 4 03 9:03 am Page 29 Compliance This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Regulations 2002 and REMUNERATION The Combined Code, appended to the Listing Rules, as issued by the Financial Services Authority Combined Code.
REPORT The constitution and operation of the remuneration committee are in compliance with the Principles of Corporate Governance and the Code of Best Practice contained in the Combined Code.
In framing its remuneration policy the committee has given full consideration to the matters set out in Schedules A and B to the Combined Code.
As required by the regulations, a resolution resolution 2 to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting to be held on 29th May 2003.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of this report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
This report therefore indicates where information has been audited.
Remuneration committee The company has established a remuneration committee Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The terms of reference of the Committee are that it makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration and its cost.
It determines, without reference to the board, the pay and benefits of the executive directors and sector managing directors formerly regional managing directors in the light of the recommendations of the chief executive other than in relation to himself and professional advice and external sources of information referred to below.
The members of the Committee are Mr B D McGowan, Mr P J Long and Mr R R Spinney, who are all independent non-executive directors and the Committee is chaired by Mr McGowan.
Messrs McGowan and Spinney were members of the Committee during 2001 when the Committee was considering directors remuneration for 2002.
The Committee seeks to obtain information from suitable sources regarding directors remuneration.
In this context it has obtained reports from inter alia Monks Partnership and New Bridge Street Consultants.
It specifically commissioned the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt, to advise on the structure of the discretionary share option schemes and Deferred Share Award Plan which were introduced in 2000 and the benefits available thereunder.
None of the members of the Committee has any personal interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In view of the relinquishment by Sir Clive Thompson of his responsibilities as chief executive and the appointment of Mr J C F Wilde as his successor on 1st January 2003, the Committee consulted both of them about its proposals.
Remuneration policy The overall policy of the Committee during both 2002 and currently is to provide pay and benefits packages for the executive directors and the sector managing directors that are appropriate to attract, retain and incentivise the best staff in order to meet the objective set by the board to achieve superior performance.
Specifically, with regard to executive directors, the objective of the policy is to ensure that executive directors should receive remuneration which reflects their responsibilities and performance.
Account is also taken in the case of sector managing directors of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which they are responsible and the extent to which the strategic objectives set by the board are being met.
The Committee monitors competitive market practices, particularly through the use of generally available external independent data, such as that provided by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The Committee also takes into account the size, complexity and international nature of the companys operations when assessing comparative data.
RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 29 6005 Text 17 49 5 4 03 9:03 am Page 30 Remuneration packages for executive directors, sector managing directors and senior management generally contain REMUNERATION the following principal elements: REPORT Salaries Bonuses Share options Pensions Benefits The Committee has developed remuneration packages designed to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Consistent with this policy, the remuneration packages awarded to directors are intended to be competitive and provide a mix of performance related and other remuneration designed to incentivise directors but not detract from the goals of Corporate Governance.
The executive directors and sector managing directors are entitled to bonuses, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions see section entitled Executive directors bonuses below.
50% of bonuses are paid in the form of shares which vest after one year in accordance with the terms of the companys Deferred Share Award Plan.
Sector managing directors bonuses are based in part on the achievement of turnover and profit targets for the performance of the businesses for which they are responsible and in part on their membership of the Deferred Share Award Plan.
Generally, the personal targets of senior managers other than executive directors and sector managing directors are tied into the performance of those profit centres to which they contribute.
Both short-term rewards base salary, annual bonuses and fringe benefits and longer term benefits share options and pension benefits reflect the responsibilities and performance of individual executives.
The companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related.
As described below, executive directors and sector managing directors may earn annual incentive payments with a maximum of between 53.3% and 80.0% of their basic salary together with the benefits of participation in share option schemes.
Further commentary on the level of annual incentive payments for executive directors is provided on page 31 of this report.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the company provided that the boards permission is obtained and fees from all such appointments are paid to the company.
In addition to the emoluments on the preceeding page, the executive directors have been awarded REMUNERATION deferred shares under the Deferred Share Award Plan 2002 equal in value to the cash bonuses disclosed, REPORT details of which are given on page 32.
Such shares are held in trust by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust on a conditional basis for a period of one year see table regarding awards under the Deferred Share Award Plan on page 32.
Executive directors are provided with private health cover and a company car.
The value of the benefits is included in the table above.
No director waived emoluments in respect of the year ended 31 December 2002 2001: the same.
Executive directors salaries Executive directors basic salaries are determined by the Committee at the commencement of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries in the company at a senior level as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on executive directors remuneration in British companies in both the support services sector and generally for example, survey of executives remuneration prepared by New Bridge Street Consultants referred to under Remuneration Committee on page 29.
Executive directors bonuses The Committee establishes the performance criterion which must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid and deferred shares awarded to executive directors under the Deferred Share Award Plan.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee instructed and took advice from remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt see Remuneration committee on page 29.
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the companys shareholders and that, in the context of bonus entitlement, is best measured by movements in the companys earnings per share.
The performance criterion for 2002 was that for every 1% increase and pro rata for lesser percentages in the companys earnings per share over the earnings per share for the previous year over 2% in excess of the rate of inflation, Sir Clive Thompson would receive a bonus of 10% of basic salary maximum 80%, Messrs J C F Wilde, R C Payne and E F Brown would each receive 6.65% of basic salary maximum 53.3%.
The Committee considers that earnings per share growth of 2% in excess of the rate of inflation should be expected and that if that rate is exceeded and only if that rate is exceeded should the performance be rewarded.
The Committee has reviewed the 2003 bonus arrangements for the executive directors and has concluded that, following his promotion to chief executive, Mr J C F Wilde will be on the same basis as that enjoyed by Sir Clive Thompson in 2002 see immediately preceeding paragraph.
The performance criterion which was applied in 2002 see above to Mr R C Payne will remain unchanged.
Sir Clive Thompson will not be entitled to a bonus in respect of 2003.
Mr E F Brown, in his new capacity as a sector managing director, will qualify for a bonus in respect of 2003 calculated as follows: i for every 1% increase and pro-rata for lesser percentages in the companys earnings per share over the earnings per share for the previous year over 2% in excess of the rate of inflation, he would receive a bonus of 3% of basic salary maximum 24% and ii for each 1% of turnover for his sector in excess of 97% of its budget, he would receive 1% of basic salary maximum 13% and for each 1% of profit for his sector between 90% and 95% of its budget he would receive 0.5% of basic salary and for each 1% of profit for his sector in excess of 95% of its budget, he would receive 1% of basic salary increasing to 2% of basic salary if 100% or more of turnover budget is exceeded, which will be satisfied in cash.
RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 31 6005 Text 17 49 5 4 03 9:03 am Page 32 Bonuses for executive directors for the year ended 31st December 2002 were between 52% and 78% of basic salaries, REMUNERATION as summarised in the table below, and the maximum bonuses for executive directors for the year ended 31st December REPORT 2003 will range between 53.3% and 80% of basic salary: 2003 MAXIMUM BONUSES 2002 BONUSES AS % OF AS % BASIC SALARY BASIC SALARY Sir Clive Thompson - 78% J C F Wilde 80% 52% R C Payne 53.3% 52% E F Brown 74.0% 52% Note: 2002 basic salaries for the purposes of this table are the rates of salary as at 31st December 2002.
2003 salaries are those effective at 1st January 2003.
Bonuses are awarded on 1st March following the end of the financial year to which they relate.
In accordance with the companys Deferred Share Award Plan, 50% of the annual bonus as calculated on page 31, is paid in cash with the remaining 50% being satisfied by the award of shares in the company.
The number of shares awarded is calculated by reference to the two prices shown in the quotations for the companys shares immediately preceeding the date of the award plus one quarter of the difference between these two prices.
These shares are held in trust on a conditional basis by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust for a period of one year from the date of award.
The performance criterion for a bonus to be paid and deferred shares awarded under the Deferred Share Award Plan is established by the Committee at the commencement of the relevant financial year as above.
Following the release of the companys preliminary results in respect of the financial year to which the plan relates and if the performance criterion is met, then bonus and deferred shares are respectively paid and awarded.
Deferred shares are held in trust on a conditional basis by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust until the expiry of one year from the date of the award.
The value of shares vested in 2003, in respect of deferred shares awarded on 1st March 2002, reflects the mid-market closing price for the companys shares of 182.75p on the last trading day before the vesting of the shares.
This part of the report has been audited 32 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 6005 Text 17 49 5 4 03 9:03 am Page 33 Executive directors The company has share option schemes for approximately five hundred senior executives worldwide.
The original REMUNERATION share options executive share option scheme was established in 1973 and new schemes were established with the approval of REPORT shareholders in 1989, 1996 and 2000.
Grants of share options up to and including 1999 were based upon individual performance and conditional on the achievement of a 15% increase in earnings per share, which was duly achieved.
Share options granted in the period 1996 to 1999 inclusive were subject to an exercise condition under which the earnings per share of the company needed to be at least 2% 3% in 1999 in excess of the UK rate of inflation over a period of three years.
The condition attaching to the grants of options in 1996 to 1998 inclusive have been satisfied but the conditions attaching to 1999 options has yet to be satisfied.
The exercise price for all share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceeding the date of grant.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary schemes Discretionary Schemes, which were approved by shareholders in 2000, are calculated by reference to base salaries and status in the company.
The Committee sought the advice of remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt, on both the structure of the Discretionary Schemes and the level of benefits payable under them.
The Committee believes that performance criteria set out below best satisfy the alignment of shareholders interests with those of executive directors in particular and executives in general.
There are two levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes, Level 1 which applies to all senior executives including executive directors and Level 2 which applies to executive directors and sector managing directors, which may be summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation or, failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
The grant of options under Level 1 will be 25% to 150% of basic salary depending on the position of the executive in the company for further information on executive directors see below.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 Index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 Index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100: in addition If the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
The number of share options granted under Level 2 will be 50% to 100% of basic salary depending on the position of the executive in the company for further information on executive directors see below.
The companys policy is to grant share options to directors and senior executives annually.
The entitlements of executive directors to the grant of options under the Discretionary Schemes in 2002 were calculated by multiplying their basic salaries by the factors set out below and then dividing by the strike price i. e. the mid-market closing price RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 33 6005 Text 17 49 5 4 03 9:03 am Page 34 for the companys shares on the trading day immediately proceeding the date of grant.
The committee is currently REMUNERATION reviewing the factors to be applied in 2003.
REPORT Mr J C F Wilde Mr R C Payne Mr E F Brown Level 1 0.9 1.0 1.0 Level 2 0.5 0.666 0.666 Note: No share options were granted in 2002 or will be granted in 2003 to Sir Clive Thompson as he will be retiring as an executive in April 2003 and, under the rules of the Discretionary Schemes, is not entitled to be granted share options in the period of 18 months preceding his retirement.
Share options granted under the Share Option Scheme for UK Employees, which is a S. A. Y. E. scheme.
Level 1 share options granted under the Discretionary Schemes see page 33 in 2000 and subsequently cannot yet be exercised as the performance criteria have yet to be satisfied, while Level 2 share options are similarly not yet exercisable save for those granted in May 2000 where 85% of share options will be exercisable from the third anniversary of their grant as a result of the companys total shareholder return being in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 Index and between the median and upper quartile as measured against a sector comparator group see Performance graph and charts on pages 38 and 39.
The conditions attached to all other options granted in 1999 to 2002 inclusive have yet to be satisfied.
Otherwise all share options are capable of being exercised.
Mr E F Brown exercised 258,612 share options in 2002 135,000 at a strike price of 74.254p: 35,612 at a strike price of 116.000p: and 88,000 at a strike price of 121.9835p which had a value of 270p per share at the date of exercise namely the mid-market closing price on the date of exercise of the share option and resulted in a total notional gain of 449,354.
No other directors were granted options in the shares of the company or any other group entities.
None of the terms and conditions of share options granted were varied during the year.
With regard to Level 2 share options granted in 2000, after calculating total shareholder return, 15% of options granted will lapse on the third anniversary of these grants in May 2003.
All share options must be exercised by the expiry of ten years from their date of grant.
