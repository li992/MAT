Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board committee meetings.
The Board, following recommendations from a sub-committee of the Board consisting of the CEO, Bart Becht, and the CFO, Colin Day, determines their fees.
Fees are reviewed annually, with the Board taking external advice from Towers Perrin on best practice and competitive levels, taking into account the responsibilities and time commitment of each Non-Executive Director.
In addition to the basic fees payable, Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, receive an additional 5,000 per annum for the Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee see Table 1.
It is the policy of the Board which the Board has no plans to change that Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pension fund membership and will not participate in any of the Companys bonus, share option or long-term incentive schemes.
External appointments Executive Directors of the Company may accept one appointment as a Non-Executive Director of another company.
The Board must approve such appointments and any exceptions.
Bart Bechts appointment as a Non-Executive Director of Prudential plc was approved by the board on 25 June 2002.
Directors are permitted to retain fees for non-executive appointments.
Process of the Committee The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive Directors.
Dr Peter Harf chairs the Committee and its other members are Dr Hkan Mogren, Adrian Bellamy and Dr George Greener.

Towers Perrin has been formally appointed as an external adviser to the Committee and, during the year, has provided advice to the Board on executive compensation levels, structure and design and issues relating to retirement benets.
Internal advisers include the Chief Executive officer, Bart Becht and Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report 2002 35 Report on Directors remuneration continued Remuneration disclosures In 2002, Reckitt Benckiser substantially out-performed its peers yet the bonus paid to Executive Directors has dropped by over a third compared to 2001 when measured as a percentage of salary from 351% to 209% of base salary for the Chief Executive officer and 263% to 157% for the Chief Financial officer.
