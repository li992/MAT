An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the companys balance sheet.

As with other employees, the directors are deemed to have a potential interest in those shares, being beneficiaries under the trust.
These interests remained unchanged as at 17 February 2003. iii From 1 January 2002 to 17 February 2003, none of the directors had any beneficial interests in the companys securities other than ordinary shares, nor any non-beneficial interests in any of the companys securities, or those of its subsidiary or associated undertakings.
Accordingly, 100% of the allocations were released on the vesting dates 4 March 2002 and 1 October 2002 respectively following the expiry of the two year retention period.
These shares were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2002 in the second table on page 28. ii At the end of the respective performance periods 30 September 2001 and 30 September 2002, the company ranked fourth in the relevant LTIS comparator groups.
Accordingly, 100% of the allocations are being held in trust for a further two years at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion.
iii The performance period relating to this allocation will end on 1 October 2003.
If and to the extent that the performance condition is met, the relevant number of shares will then be held in trust for two years, at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion.
iv The respective performance periods relating to these allocations will end on 30 September 2004 and 1 April 2005.
If and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the allocations will vest and the relevant number of shares will be released to the directors, at the trustees discretion.
v The end of the qualifying period is the date on which it is judged whether or not the qualifying conditions see LTIS section on page 26 have been fulfilled.
vi The vesting date was the next business day after the end of the qualifying period.
