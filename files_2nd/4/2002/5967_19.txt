Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives a Total level of remuneration The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives.
b The main components The companys policy is to structure remuneration packages so that an appropriate element comprises the grant of share options which enables the company to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders.
The main components of remuneration payable are: i Salary Salary for each executive is determined by the remuneration committee taking into account the performance and responsibilities of the individual.
Electronic and electrical engineering is an international industry within which there is a clear market in executive talent.
The overriding factor in determining executive remuneration is market forces.
Salaries are normally reviewed on 1 July each year.
No bonuses are paid to any of the companys executive directors.
ii Share options The directors believe that the opportunity to participate in the companys shareholding is a key factor in attracting and retaining executives of the right calibre and that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
The companys policy is to grant options at the point of recruitment or promotion.
All grants of options are determined by the committee.
The committee takes account of guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds when making awards of options.
Pursuant to resolutions of the shareholders passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on 17 February 1999, the committee is authorised in exceptional cases to grant options to a value of up to eight times an executives salary.
In November 2001, in accordance with the discretion granted to it under the rules of the companys Approved, Unapproved and 1997 Executive Share Option Schemes, the remuneration committee varied the performance targets which must be achieved before options granted under those schemes vest.
Previously the ability to exercise options was conditional upon the company achieving growth in diluted earnings per share of either 5% or 8% where options had been granted of a value more than four times an executives salary more than the increase in the Retail Prices Index in the financial years following the grant of the option.
For the Approved and the Unapproved Schemes this target had to be achieved in each of the three years following the grant of the option.
In the case of the 1997 Executive Scheme this target had to be achieved in each of the five years following the grant of the option.
Annual Report 2002 49 Remuneration Report The remuneration committee concluded that these performance targets no longer represented a fair measure of performance and varied the target so that all options which might otherwise have vested had the previous targets been achieved would vest if the company achieved either an adjusted operating profit of 20m in the year ending 31 May 2002 or the operating profit target to be determined by the Remuneration Committee in the year ending 31 May 2003.
In the event, the operating profit target for the financial year ending 31 May 2002 was not achieved and the options in question have not yet vested and are not exercisable.
The remuneration committee has determined that henceforth the vesting of options granted under the Approved, Unapproved and 1997 Schemes will be conditional upon adjusted operating profit targets for the five financial years following the grant of options being achieved.
These targets will be determined by the remuneration committee annually, principally by reference to the budget set for the relevant year, and will be set at a level which the remuneration committee determines will be challenging to those concerned.
Adjusted operating profit for this purpose is defined as operating profit before goodwill amortisation and impairment, fixed asset impairment and share compensation.
Details of directors share options are set out on page 53. c Company policy on contracts of service All the executive directors have service contracts under which the notice period for termination by either party is 6 months.

e Company policy on external appointments The remuneration committee reviews any request by an executive director with regard to a proposed external appointment and deals with each request on its individual merits.
