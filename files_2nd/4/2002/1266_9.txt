Arriva plc Annual report and accounts 2002 32 Directors Remuneration Report 1 Introduction All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Membership of the Committee is restricted to the non-executive Directors and for the year under review comprised Mr. M. J. Allen Chairman of the Committee, Mr. W. G. Cooper, Mr. J. S. Ward until 26 April 2002 and Mrs. A. V. M. Palmer.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the executive Directors are both highly motivated and fairly rewarded for their contribution to the Groups overall performance having due regard to the interests of the shareholders, the overall remuneration structure within the Group and practices adopted by comparator companies.
In assessing the remuneration of the Directors, the Remuneration Committee pays particular attention to the value added to shareholders interests by the Company when compared with suitable comparator groups.

The Remuneration Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration, including basic salary, performance related remuneration, awards under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan, pension provision, benefits in kind and service agreement terms.
The executive Directors are each paid a salary which is open to annual review in January.
The Directors received no increase in their annual salaries at the January 2002 review: in January 2003 the salaries of the executive Directors were increased by 3%.
In addition the executive Directors participate in a performance related pay arrangement with payment being made on the attainment of specified targets established by the Remuneration Committee and agreed with the Director.
The performance related targets focus on three elements: Group performance, divisional performance and personal performance.
The Group performance and divisional performance elements are based on the achievement of budgeted earnings per share and budgeted divisional profit.
The personal performance element is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and is a qualitative element reflecting individual performance against key personal objectives.
For service after 1 January 2000 the performance related element of the Directors remuneration is not taken into account in computing pension benefits.
Benefits in kind are awarded as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate and currently comprise company cars, fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
The non-executive Directors fees are limited to 200,000 per annum in the aggregate by the Articles of Association and within this aggregate the annual fee for each non-executive Director is determined by the Board, the non-executive Director in question taking no part in the deliberations.
With effect from 1 January 2003 the fees for the non-executive Directors were increased as follows: Increased from Increased to W. G. Cooper 70,000 p. a.
Annual % Change in TSR Annual % Change in TSR Arriva plc Annual report and accounts 2002 33 1 Introduction continued Each of the non-executive Directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years.
The appointments are renewable with the agreement of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years.
The maximum period of aggregate service for a non-executive Director is limited to nine years.
Each of the executive Directors has a service contract which is subject to twelve months notice.
With the exception of Mr. S. P. Lonsdale, all the executive Directors have contracts dated 19 November 2001: Mr Lonsdales contract is dated 5 September 1997.
Each of the executive Directors service contracts contain an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of misconduct.
Where a Directors service contract is terminated by the Company, a severance payment will be made comprising the sum of: i the Directors basic annual salary at the time of notice: and ii the performance related element estimated to be payable to the Director in respect of the financial year in which notice is served: and iii an amount representing the value of benefits in kind in the audited accounts of the Company for the financial year immediately preceding the date of termination.
Additionally, the Company will procure a further twelve months service or, where appropriate, a further twelve months Company contribution to the relevant Directors pension arrangement.
In principle the Board will permit the executive Directors to accept appointments outside the Company.
However before accepting such appointments the Director s involved must receive the prior written approval of the Board.
In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive Directors expected contribution to the Company, nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest.
Any fees earned by an executive Director in such a capacity are assigned to the Company as in the case of Mr. R. J. Davies two external appointments with Geest plc and T & S Stores plc T & S, where the non-executive Directors annual fees of 24,000 and 25,000 respectively are paid directly to the Company on a quarterly basis.
Mr. Davies resigned from his directorship of T & S on 6 January 2003 following the acquisition of T & S by Tesco plc.
The remaining sections of the Directors Remuneration Report have been audited.
Executive Share Option Scheme Share Incentive Scheme Savings Related Share Option Scheme # The closing mid market price of the ordinary share on 31 December 2002 was 273.5p The highest price achieved by the Arriva plc ordinary share in the year ended 31 December 2002 was 390p: the lowest price of the Arriva plc ordinary share in the same period was 262.5p.
The executive Directors participate in one or more of the Groups share option schemes.
The Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Scheme both incorporate performance target requirements which must be achieved before the exercise of the share option is permitted.
The performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time.
The current target requires the Companys earnings per share over a period of three consecutive years prior to any exercise to exceed the Retail Price Index by a minimum of 2 per cent p. a. i. e. 6% over the three year period.
Following the introduction of The Long Term Incentive Plan, the Directors are no longer eligible to participate in future option grants under the Companys executive share option schemes.

Prior to January 2000 their benefits accrued at the rate of 1 60th of pensionable salary.
The aggregate benefit accruing to Mr. E. A. R. Cameron and Mr. A. M. Saxton from the Arriva Pension Scheme and their respective FURBS is equivalent to 1 30th of basic annual salary for each year of service.

The vesting will be on a sliding scale of 25 per cent 100 per cent and no share will vest unless the TSR of Arriva plc is at least equal to the median TSR of the Peer Comparator Group, and that Arrivas earnings per share in the same period has exceeded the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6 per cent.
The Remuneration Committee believes the FTSE 250 to be an appropriate and challenging target which closely aligns the interests of The LTIP participants with those of the shareholders.
With regard to the two performance conditions governing the award made on 2 May 2000, the earnings per share of the Company over the three year period increased by 25.5 per cent and the Retail Price Index over the same period increased by 6.69 per cent.
The Companys Total Shareholder Return over the same period achieved upper quartile performance 37 per cent when compared with the Peer Comparator Group.
Maximum Minimum 1st Quartile 207% 20% 2nd Quartile 19% -33% 3rd Quartile -34% -64% 4th Quartile -65% -100% Source: Datastream As a consequence, the Remuneration Committee confirmed on 6 March 2003 the vesting of the whole of the conditional share awards made on 2 May 2000: the market price of the Arriva plc ordinary share on the date of vesting was 302p.
It is an objective of the Remuneration Committee that the Directors will utilise awards under The LTIP to build up an interest in the share capital of the Company which is broadly equivalent to one years base annual salary from time to time.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the impact that the short-term volatility in pension costs, caused by changes in bond yields and equity market fluctuations, has on the Groups reported financial performance and the consequent impact on the performance measures underlying the Groups long-term management incentive schemes.
Without amendment of the performance measures that are related to earnings per share growth, the Committee believes that attainment of long-term performance targets might prove too easily achievable in some circumstances and almost impossible in others.
This is contrary to the fundamental objective of the Long Term Incentive Plan which is to motivate and reward management to achieve objectives that support the pursuit of shareholder value.
The Committee has therefore determined that the calculation of earnings per share growth for all conditional awards, made after January 2003, will exclude the impact on the annual pension charge of gains or losses arising from movements in the equity and bond markets.
In making this assessment the Remuneration Committee received advice from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited.
The adjustment required will be subject to external audit.
5 Remuneration Report Approval An ordinary resolution to consider, and if thought fit approve this Remuneration Report, will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
For and on behalf of the Board M. J. ALLEN Chairman, Remuneration Committee 6 March 2003
