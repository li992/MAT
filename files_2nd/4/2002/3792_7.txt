Peter E B Cawdron Chairman 3 December 2002 Compass Group PLC 37 Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Company and the Group for that year.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: i select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: ii make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: iii state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and iv prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records and sufficient internal controls for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors of the Company, having prepared the financial statements, have requested the auditors to take whatever steps and undertake whatever inspections they consider to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit report.
