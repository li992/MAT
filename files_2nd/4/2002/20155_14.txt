Further details relating to the Groups employment policies are set out on page 26 in the Directors report.
Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee consists only of independent non-executive Directors.
Its members during the year were Dr J R Forrest the Committee Chairman, Baroness Hogg and Mr F D Rosenkranz, all of whom served throughout the year.
Sir George Russell was also a member of the Committee until his retirement on 31 December 2001.
Mr O H J Stocken served as a member of the Committee with effect from 1 January 2002.
None of the Directors sit with each other on the boards of other quoted companies.
The Committees terms of reference take into account the provisions of the Combined Code on corporate governance.
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee considered and determined the specific remuneration packages for each of the executive Directors.
In addition, the Committee has considered and made recommendations to the Board on the Companys framework of executive remuneration and its costs.
The Committee has the benefit of advice from the Companys Human Resources department and from an external remuneration consultant, Monks Partnership, a representative of which attends Committee Meetings.
Mr B P Larcombe, the Chief Executive, also attends Committee Meetings except when the Committee discusses his remuneration.
Market background The Company operates in the venture capital sector where competition for quality, trained investment executives is aggressive.
Most of the Companys competitors offer senior employees co-investment schemes or carried interest schemes under which executives share directly in the profits on investments made by their employer.
In order to ensure that staff of the appropriate calibre are attracted and retained, the Company offers a package of rewards which are designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders and to be competitive with rewards offered elsewhere in the venture capital industry.
The Group operates carried interest plans for investment executives in each of the countries in which it operates.
These plans are linked to the performance of investments in executives business units.
Executive Directors remuneration The base salaries and other benefits of the executive Directors are determined by the Committee, on behalf of the Board, in the light of the need to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the calibre required.
The Committee has due regard to competitive market data in relation to similar jobs in comparable organisations including other FTSE 100 companies and other financial institutions including venture capital organisations.
The Committee is sensitive to wider issues including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when setting executive Directors pay levels and takes into account the Companys reward strategy generally, before deciding specific packages for the executive Directors.
The Companys policy is that the performance related elements of compensation should form a significant proportion of the potential total rewards of the executive Directors.
The executive Directors performance related compensation is also designed to encourage, where practicable, investment in, and the holding of, shares in the Company so as to align the interests of Directors and shareholders.
The remuneration packages of the executive Directors comprise: a base salaries: b annual cash bonuses: c deferred share bonuses: d long-term incentives: and e pension and other benefits.
Base salaries Executive Directors base salaries are determined by the Committee in the manner referred to above.
Annual cash bonuses All employees, including executive Directors, are eligible for non-pensionable discretionary annual cash bonuses which are determined on the basis of a formal individual performance appraisal system and Group performance.
Deferred share bonuses Share bonus awards are offered under the terms of The 3i Group Management Equity Investment Plan established with shareholder approval in 1994.
These provide executives chosen at the discretion of the Committee with the opportunity to receive a bonus in the form of shares in the Company in addition to any cash bonus.
Awards are considered annually by the Committee in the light of the Groups performance.
Participants are awarded a conditional allocation of shares in the Company through an employee benefit trust and can exercise their right to acquire these shares at no cost to them after three years providing they remain in employment with the Group.
In addition, executive Directors are required to maintain an agreed shareholding.
These awards are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan During the year, options up to the Inland Revenue limit of 30,000 for approved share options were granted under The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan to a total of 125 employees including executive Directors.
These options were granted with the same performance target as the options granted under the new Discretionary Share Plan.
The 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan Following shareholder approval of the new Discretionary Share Plan at the Annual General Meeting in July 2001, share options were granted under this Plan to a total of 474 employees including executive Directors.
As permitted by the revised guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers and in line with developments in market practice, the Plan does not have an overall limit on the value of options which can be granted.
The Committee has adopted a general policy of annual grants in place of its previous policy of phased grants up to an aggregate salary multiple.
The level of annual grants is reviewed each year taking account of market practice and the specific circumstances facing the Company.
The Committee determines grants of options to executives based on an assessment of individual performance.
All options are granted subject to a performance target, the achievement of which will normally be a condition precedent to the right to exercise an option.
Careful consideration has been given by the Committee to appropriately demanding performance targets.
The performance target applied to options granted during the year is based on increases in Group net assets as described in note 3 on page 33 below.
Remuneration report 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2002 31 The 3i Group Share Incentive Plan During the year, all eligible UK employees, including executive Directors, were invited to participate in the Inland Revenue approved share incentive plan formerly known as the All Employee Share Plan approved by shareholders in 2000.
The first allotments of shares under the Plan were made in April 2002.
Employees were invited to invest up to 125 per month in the Companys shares and, for each share so acquired by an employee, the Company agreed for the first twelve months of the operation of the Plan to grant that employee two free additional shares.
Dividends received on these shares are reinvested on behalf of participants in further shares.

The plan provides for a pension, subject to Inland Revenue limits, of two-thirds of basic annual salary limited to the Earnings Cap where this applies on retirement normally at age 60 after 25 years service and less for service under 25 years.
The plan also provides life cover of four times salary, pensions payable in the event of ill health and spouses pensions on death.
Further details of the plan are set out in note 8 to the accounts on pages 45 and 46.
Details of the pension entitlements of Directors who served during the year are provided in the table below.

2 The increase in leaver pension shown reflects the difference between deferred pensions on leaving, payable from age 60, except in the case of Sir George Russell.
For Sir George Russell, the figure shown is the difference between the amount of immediate pension granted to him on his retirement and the amount of the pension to which he would have been entitled on 31 December 2001 if he had left on 31 March 2001.
3 The pensions shown, except for Sir George Russell, are deferred pensions payable from age 60.
Sir George Russells figure is the immediate pension granted on his retirement, which was equal to his then accrued pension.
4 The total accrued leaver pension entitlement at 31 March 2001 of Mr B P Larcombe was 319,100 per annum.
The pensions shown above become payable at a Normal Retirement Age of 60 or immediately on retirement if the member is already over the age of 60.
Certain members have guaranteed early retirement rights in order to comply with EC sex equality requirements.
In the figures given above, the value of these rights has been converted into extra deferred pension of equal value to these rights.
On early retirement from active membership of the plan, there is a discretionary practice of permitting retirement in accordance with published enhanced terms.
This is not available to deferred pensioners and no allowance for it is made in the calculations of cash equivalents under the plan.
Deferred pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension GMP are increased in the deferment period according to statutory requirements subject to an annual minimum of 3%.
GMPs are increased at fixed rate revaluation with increases vesting at Normal Retirement Age.
When in payment, pensions in excess of the GMP are increased in line with cumulative price inflation since retirement subject to an annual maximum of 7.5% and minimum of 3%.
On death in deferment or after retirement, a two-thirds pension is payable to the members spouse.
Dependants pensions may be payable in the absence of a spouses pension.
In addition, on death within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is payable equal to the balance of five years pension.
Directors service contracts The Companys policy is that in normal circumstances notice periods for Directors should not exceed one year.
Each of the executive Directors has a contract of service with 3i plc or in the case of Mr M M Gagen, 3i Corporation under which the notice period is six months if given by the Director and 12 months if given by the employer.
The Committee considers that the payment of compensation in cases of early termination of service contracts should depend on individual circumstances.
The duty of individual Directors to mitigate their loss will always be a relevant factor.
None of the non-executive Directors has a service contract.
