Remuneration Report In preparing this report, the Board has followed the provisions of Schedule B to the Combined Code, the Code annexed to the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The role of the Remuneration Committee is to provide recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Groups framework of executive remuneration and its cost.
The composition of the Committee is described on page 33.
REMUNERATION POLICY The remuneration policy is designed to attract, develop, retain and motivate the senior executives of the Group relative to other large UK based international businesses of similar size and complexity.
It provides for a competitive compensation package that reflects market value, sustained individual performance, job responsibilities and the Groups performance against financial objectives.
The remuneration package consists of short-term rewards base salary, benefits and performance payments together with a significant proportion of longer term benefits provided by share options, a long-term incentive plan and pension arrangements.
Overall the policy is designed to reward executives fairly and responsibly for their contribution without paying more than necessary to achieve this objective.
In forming its remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to both Section 1 part B and Schedule A of the Code.
The Board believes that the total remuneration package aligns senior executives interests with those of the shareholders and gives these individuals keen incentives to perform at the highest levels.
The Remuneration Committee used the services of remuneration advisers Buck Consultants and Kelper Associates during the year.
ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION All details of the executive Directors emoluments, including basic salary, annual bonus, share options, long-term incentives and pension entitlements, are shown on pages 37 to 39.
Benefits in kind include car benefits and medical expenses insurance.
None of the Directors waived fees during the year.
Basic salary and, for executive Directors whose membership of Hays Pension Scheme started before 1 July 1994, car benefits of up to 9,000, are the only elements of executive Directors remuneration which are pensionable.
PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS The executive Directors performance payments were based on achievement of specific business objectives.
SHARE OPTIONS The Company operates three executive share option plans: the Inland Revenue approved Hays plc 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme which has now ceased to make grants, the Hays plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme which is unapproved for Inland Revenue purposes and the Hays plc 1996 Company Share Option Plan which is an Inland Revenue approved scheme.
The policy regarding the grant of executive share options is to phase grants over the life of the schemes.
The schemes are designed to allow participation in the business and to encourage long-term retention of key staff.
Further information on share options is shown on page 38.
Hays plc 35 Remuneration Report LONG-TERM INCENTIVES On 19 November 1996 an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company approved the creation of a Performance Share Scheme the Scheme available to Directors and a limited number of senior executives.
The Scheme excludes any Director or employee who held shares at the time of the management buy-out of the Company in 1987, or at the time of its flotation in 1989.
The Scheme is the main long-term incentive arrangement in which executive Directors and senior executives participate.
The key attributes of the Scheme are: a Participants have to make a significant financial investment at the outset: b In normal circumstances, participants can only realise any gain after five years: and c The performance measures totally align participants and shareholders interests.
The Scheme is designed to lock-in key executives and motivate them through the opportunity to earn significant financial rewards on the achievement of demanding corporate performance targets.
Under the Scheme, participants will only receive shares in the Company provided demanding performance targets have been achieved.
For the participant to receive shares with a greater value than his original investment, the targets require growth in earnings per share EPS of the Company over five years to be more than 2% per annum in excess of the growth in EPS of the median company in the FTSE-100 Group, excluding those in the oil and financial sectors the Median at the start of each year.
The EPS figure will be the fully diluted EPS calculated on the basis of headline earnings using the Institute of Investment Management and Research guidelines.
The number of shares receivable will be in direct relationship to the increase in the Companys EPS in the five years following the payment made by the participant.
However, if the minimum performance target is not met, or if the minimum performance target is met but the growth in EPS of the Company over a five year period does not exceed the change in the Retail Prices Index over the same period by at least 2% per annum, then only a nominal number of shares may be acquired by the participant.
The maximum number of shares can only be achieved when EPS growth is compound, 10% per annum above the Median for the five year period.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board are confident that these performance targets will ensure an emphasis upon achieving long-term sustained earnings growth and continued retention of key management.
Every two years the Remuneration Committee reviews the number of participants in the Scheme and the number of shares receivable by each participant under it.
The Scheme is in line with current best practice as recommended by the Code.
At the Annual General Meeting on 8 November 2001, shareholders approved the renewal of the Performance Share Scheme for a further five year period.
Participants in the Scheme are eligible to receive grants of options under the Hays plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Hays plc 1996 Company Share Option Plan.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that all three schemes form part of a well considered plan for the remuneration of senior executives.
In making grants of options or issuing invitations to participate in the Scheme, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the extent of an individuals existing participation in these schemes.
PENSIONS Pension contributions are made into the Hays Pension Scheme, which is an approved defined benefit scheme providing benefits up to Inland Revenue limits.
For those Directors subject to the Inland Revenues earnings cap on pensionable salary, top-up benefits are provided through the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme, which is an unapproved, unfunded retirement benefit scheme.
Details of benefits accruing under these schemes are shown on page 37.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND COMPENSATION All executive Directors have service contracts terminable by the Company on two years notice.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board consider this to be in accordance with market practice and necessary to attract and retain executives of appropriate calibre.
Such service contracts do not include provisions for pre-determined compensation on termination which exceed two years salary and benefits.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will give careful consideration to what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances and the responsibility of the individual to mitigate.
The service contracts of Messrs Lawson and Williams, proposed for re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 20 November 2002, will have a period of two years unexpired.
Mrs Knox, Messrs Danon, Taylor and Wallace are non-executive Directors and are not appointed for a specific term.
In practice, all Directors are required to stand for re-election to the Board at least every three years.
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
