P&O Annual Report 2002 Directors remuneration report 39 Directors remuneration report This report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations which apply to the Company for the first time this year.
It has been approved by the directors and will be put to stockholders for approval at the annual general meeting on 16 May 2003.
Remuneration committee The remuneration committee consists entirely of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Sir John Collins.
The other members of the committee during 2002 were Rodney Galpin, Michael Everard and Sir David Brown appointed to the committee on 13 February 2002.
Towers Perrin, who provide advice on other remuneration issues from time to time, were appointed by the committee to provide independent advice to the committee on executive directors remuneration.
In addition, the committee consults with the Chairman and Managing Director as appropriate with regard to its proposals relating to the remuneration of the executive directors.
Policy The policy of the committee is to review executive directors remuneration based on an independent assessment of market practice.
The total remuneration package of the executive directors is structured to attract, retain and motivate executive directors.
The committee has, in consultation with its advisers, conducted an annual review of executive directors remuneration, including bonuses and long term incentives, to ensure consistency with market practice, local conditions and business objectives.
The major proportion of the remuneration package for executive directors is performance-related assuming maximum performance in respect of the performance-related elements.
This includes participation in the Companys long term incentive plans, which consist of a Deferred Bonus and Co-investment Matching Plan the Matching Plan and an Executive Stock Option Plan the ESOP, which are described in more detail below.
The performance conditions and policies relating to long term incentives and directors remuneration packages were approved by stockholders in October 2000 and have not been materially altered since that date.
The total remuneration package is designed to align the interests of executive directors with those of stockholders.
This report sets out the Companys policy on executive remuneration for 2003 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of years after 2003 is required by the Regulations.
The committee is able to state its remuneration policy for 2003 with reasonable certainty, but is less certain that this policy will continue without amendment in subsequent years.
This is because the committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufciently exible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
In addition, where necessary in order to recruit a director of sufficient calibre the remuneration committee may consider it appropriate to enter into special arrangements for the benefit of that director.
Any changes in policy for years after 2003 will be described in future reports, which will continue to be subject to stockholder approval.
All statements in this report in relation to remuneration policy for years after 2003 should be read in light of this paragraph.
There are no current proposals to change this policy.
Components of remuneration The remuneration package of executive directors comprises annual salary, an annual bonus scheme, share option and long term incentive plans, pension arrangements and certain benets in kind for example health cover, car benets and accommodation where relevant to their role.
Base salary Base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually and are set at levels which reect the level of responsibility of the executive directors concerned and ensure that they are competitive with pay for executive directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies.
The benchmark levels represent remuneration data across industries and reect factors including company size, reporting level and international accountability.
Annual performance bonus Executive directors participate in a bonus scheme which is linked to the achievement of demanding individual, business and corporate objectives including return on capital employed and other key performance indicators.
Bonus targets for 2002 for directors with divisional responsibility Douglas Anderson, Graeme Dunlop, Richard Hein, Charles Rice and Robert Woods were based on:.
the return on capital employed of the Group as a whole:.
the performance of their respective divisions against stretching targets set by the committee these are generally profit related such as return on capital employed but may include performance against business-specic performance indicators: and.
individual performance targets relevant to the executive directors concerned such as satisfying strategic objectives determined by the committee.
Bonus targets for 2002 for Head Ofce directors Lord Sterling, Sir Bruce MacPhail, Joanne Curin, Michael Gradon and Peter Smith were based on:.
the return on capital employed of the Group as a whole: P&O Annual Report 2002 40 Directors remuneration report.
the weighted average performance of each division against their targets set by the committee the same as the divisional targets for directors with divisional responsibility and.
All incentive targets are set by the committee and are designed to be demanding.
Financial targets are normally set above those for the prior year, but having regard to the anticipated trading environment.
The maximum annual bonus that can be earned is generally 75 per cent of salary.
Two thirds of any bonus up to 75 per cent of salary is paid in cash with the balance awarded as a Stock Award under the Matching Plan, as described below.
The committee has over-riding discretion in determining the payment of bonuses.
Long term incentives As stated above, the Companys long term incentive plans comprise the Matching Plan and the ESOP.
The Matching Plan The Matching Plan provides participants with the opportunity to receive matching awards of deferred stock depending upon the performance of the Company over a two year retention period following the year in which an original bonus-related award is earned.
As noted above, one third of any annual bonus awarded to directors and other executives who are participants in the Matching Plan is in the form of a Stock Award which is automatically invested in the Matching Plan.
The Board believes that in order to further align participants interests with those of stockholders participants should be encouraged to commit their own resources to the Matching Plan.
Therefore participants also have a choice of investing their own funds in further deferred stock in the Company described as Invested Stock subject to an overall limit for directors on the amount invested in the Matching Plan in any one year of 75 per cent of base salary.
Subject to the discretion of the Matching Plan Trustee, Matching Plan participants receive Matching Awards.
Matching Awards entitle the participants to acquire a maximum amount of deferred stock which, at the date of grant, has a value equal to the aggregate value of the executives Stock Award and Invested Stock valuing Invested Stock on a gross of tax basis.
The amount of deferred stock over which a Matching Award may be exercised is dependent on the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the retention period compared to that of the other companies in the FTSE 350 index.
If the Company achieves median performance a participant is entitled to exercise 25 per cent of his Matching Award and if the Company achieves upper quartile performance, a participant will be entitled to exercise 100 per cent of his Matching Award.
For performance between median and upper quartile, entitlement is calculated on a straight line basis.
These targets are subject to review by the committee in subsequent years.
Matching Awards are only exercisable if a secondary validating performance condition is also met.
This requires earnings per share growth after appropriate adjustments to ensure consistency throughout the period over the retention period to exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 3 per cent per annum.
These performance conditions were chosen since they were considered the most appropriate for determining the Companys performance.
They were established after consultation with the Association of British Insurers and the Companys largest stockholders.
Share related benets The executive directors may receive annual grants of stock options under the ESOP.
Annual grants are normally made to an aggregate face value of 150 per cent of base annual salary subject to the employers national insurance contributions adjustment referred to below unless the committee considers that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a higher amount.
Options under this Plan are generally exercisable three years after the date of grant subject to the achievement of performance conditions and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of grant.
Performance conditions are based on the achievement of earnings per share EPS growth after appropriate adjustments to ensure consistency throughout the period of an average of at least 3 per cent in excess of the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over a period of at least three years from grant.
This was considered to be an appropriate hurdle and consistent with market practice at the time the ESOP was adopted.
There is a facility for the Company to require optionholders to assume the Companys liability for employers national insurance contributions due on the exercise of unapproved stock options.
The Company may grant additional options in recognition of the liability that optionholders assume.
Executive directors may also participate, subject to the usual limits, in the P&O Save As You Earn Stock Option Scheme the P&O SAYE Scheme on the same terms as other employees.
The P&O SAYE scheme operates within specic tax legislation including a requirement to finance the exercise of the option using the proceeds of a monthly savings contract and exercise of the option is not subject to satisfaction of a performance target since this is an all employee share scheme.
Service contracts No executive director has a service contract of more than twelve months with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
All executive directors service contracts are reissued on 1 January in each year and are subject to twelve months notice by either party.
The Chairman and the executive P&O Annual Report 2002 Directors remuneration report 41 directors appointed to the Board on or after the demerger of the Groups cruise business on 23 October 2000 Joanne Curin, Douglas Anderson and Charles Rice have service contracts which provide for payments in lieu of notice equivalent to 12 months base salary and benets.
In the case of the Chairman and Charles Rice the bonus element of the benets has a calculation mechanism so that the bonus is equivalent to that paid in respect of the year preceding the year in which employment terminates.
Compensation payable upon early termination other than under the payment in lieu of notice provisions would be based on the contractual entitlement to salary and benets subject to mitigation.
Non-executive directors The non-executive directors are independent of management and have no relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the executive directors.
Changes in their annual directors fee are subject to approval by stockholders.
They may also receive fees for additional services such as chairing a board committee.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for incentive schemes or other benets.
The unexpired term of service of the non-executive directors subject to re-election by stockholders is: Sir David Brown: 15 January 2007 Sir John Collins: 31 December 2005 Michael Everard: 31 December 2005 Rodney Galpin: 31 March 2005 All letters of appointment are subject to twelve months notice by either party.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH Cumulative TSR Performance In line with the Regulations, the following graph compares the 175 performance of the Companys deferred stock on a TSR basis for the past five years against the FTSE 350 Index.
This index has been 150 selected as P&O is a constituent of the FTSE 350 and uses this index for their comparator group for the Matching Plan.
However, the line 125 representing the FTSE 350 on the graph is based on the market index weighted by market capitalisation whereas the Matching Plan is based 100 on the performance of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 at the commencement of the relevant performance period.
TSR is shown as the value of 100 invested in P&O and in the FTSE 350 index over the 75 five year period.
50 The demerger of P&O Princess Cruises occurred on 23 October 2000.
25 There are a number of different accepted methodologies that are used to take account of such a demerger in assessing how much 100 invested in P&O at the beginning of 1998 would be worth at the end of 0 2002.
Therefore two methods are shown on the performance graph: Jan-98 Dec-98 Dec-99 Dec-00 Dec-01 Dec-02 P&O including TSR performance of P&O Princess Cruises.
P&Os TSR including the TSR performance of P&O Princess P&O using historically adjusted P&O data Cruises: and FTSE 350.
P&Os TSR using data which has been adjusted to exclude the value attributable to P&O Princess Cruises by reference to the proportionate value of the two businesses at the demerger date.
TSR is calculated for each year relative to the base date of 1 January 1998 and taking the percentage change of the market price over the relevant period, reinvesting any dividends at the ex-dividend date.

At 31 December 2002 the Trust held 8,975,556 nominal of deferred stock.
The interests in the deferred stock of four executive directors have increased by a total of 497 nominal of deferred stock as a result of the reinvestment of dividends in their personal equity plans and individual savings accounts between 31 December 2002 and the date of this report.
The following is a table of directors long term incentive awards and option grants in units of 1 nominal of deferred stock under the Long Term Incentive Plan operated by the Company prior to the demerger on 23 October 2000 the P&O LTIP, the Matching Plan and the ESOP.
The terms of the ESOP are set out under the heading Share related benets on page 40.

Awards granted under the LTIP in relation to the 1996 97 performance period vested on 1 January 2000 and remain exercisable until 27 March 2005.
P&O LTIP Roll over Awards At the time of the demerger, awards granted under the LTIP in relation to the 1996 99 performance period were allowed to vest and participants could choose to exercise such awards and acquire the underlying deferred stock.
Executives were also given the opportunity to release such awards in consideration for the grant by the Company of replacement awards and related matching awards under the rules of the Matching Plan.
The amount of deferred stock that may be acquired under the matching awards is dependent on the TSR performance of the Company relative to that of the FTSE 350.
The value of the deferred stock over which the LTIP roll over awards were granted was equivalent to the value of the deferred stock the subject of the released LTIP award after adjustment for notional reinvestment of the P&O Princess Cruises shares received on demerger.
One half of an individuals LTIP roll over award represents a 2001 LTIP award and the other half represents a 2002 LTIP award.
The 2001 LTIP award became exercisable from 7 March 2002 and the 2002 LTIP award became exercisable from 6 March 2003.
The related matching awards are linked to the TSR performance of the Company over the period from 24 October 2000 to 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 respectively.
The Companys TSR performance over the period from 24 October 2000 to 31 December 2001 resulted in a ranking position of 141 out of 324 companies.
Therefore, each participants 2001 LTIP roll over matching award was exercised over deferred stock equal to 45 per cent of their 2001 LTIP roll over award.
For the period from 24 October 2000 to 31 December 2002, the Companys TSR performance resulted in a ranking position of 129 out of 315 companies resulting in each participants 2002 LTIP roll over becoming exercisable over deferred stock equal to 53 per cent of their 2002 LTIP roll over award.

Douglas Anderson and Richard Hein are members of the P&O Australia Superannuation Fund the Australian Scheme.
No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Ination revaluation includes UK ination of 1.7 per cent in accordance with Schedule 3 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and scheme uplift in respect of late retirement where appropriate.
Australian ination was 3.2 per cent for the calendar year 2002 and has been used where appropriate in the calculation of entitlements in the Australian Scheme.
Lord Sterling and Sir Bruce MacPhail have ceased to accrue further pension rights, and increases in accrued pension reect the UK Schemes late retirement provisions.
In accordance with Inland Revenue regulations they are not entitled to transfer their benets out of the scheme.
The amount shown as transfer values in the table above indicates the change in cost to the scheme of providing the late retirement benets given prevailing market conditions.
Lord Sterlings increase in annual accrued pension during the year is after an adjustment of 16,500 to his annual accrued pension at 31 December 2001 to reect late retirement factors.
Transfer values for directors not close to retirement age have fallen over the year owing to a sharp decline in UK equity prices.
Transfer values for directors close to retirement age are calculated by reference to yields on bonds.
These have fallen during the year giving rise to increased values.
The Australian Scheme traditionally provides a lump sum benefit on retirement.
However, Douglas Anderson and Richard Hein are able to choose between a pension and a lump sum benefit at retirement.
The pension shown in the table above is the UK pension equivalent of their lump sum benefit.
Richard Hein ceased to accrue further pension rights with effect from 31 May 2002.
He has in accordance with the rules of the Australian Scheme drawn part of his entitlement.
The gures above represent a UK equivalent pension of his remaining Australian Scheme entitlement.
Graeme Dunlop reached Normal Retirement Age under the UK Scheme rules on 25 June 2002, at which point his accrued pension in the scheme came into payment after exchanging part of it for a cash sum.
The increase in pension during the year and the transfer value quoted at 31 December 2002 allow for both the pension in payment and the commutation payment.
Michael Gradon, Charles Rice, Peter Smith and Robert Woods are contributing members of the UK Scheme.
Except for Robert Woods, the accrued pensions at 31 December 2002 represent the deferred pension earned which is payable on reaching Normal Retirement Age.
On attaining the relevant age and service criteria, Michael Gradon and Charles Rice will become entitled to the early retirement provisions set out below.
The benets that can be provided to Peter Smith from the UK Scheme are restricted by the pensions earnings cap.
The Company has therefore established a Funded Unapproved Retirement benefit Scheme, which operates on a dened contribution basis: the Companys contribution to this scheme was 43,807 of which 4,704 represented arrears for the prior year 2001 33,620.
Robert Woods accrued pension is the total pension earned, which could be paid immediately in the event of retirement, in line with provisions set out below.
For the purpose of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules his pension in excess of revaluation ination is consistent with him not taking an immediate pension last year.
Joanne Curin has a dened contribution pension arrangement.
The contribution paid for the year was 97,443 2001 95,532.
P&O Annual Report 2002 48 Directors remuneration report Under the UK Scheme rules the Normal Retirement Age for Senior Executives is 60 and they may receive a pension of up to two thirds basic salary.
There are the following early retirement arrangements for directors depending on age and length of service: i Age 55 and over and completed 25 years service, on voluntary and compulsory early retirement a pension of two thirds of basic salary.
ii Age between 50 and 55 and completed 25 years service, for voluntary early retirement a proportion of the expected two thirds pension based on service to date of retirement without actuarial reduction.
iii Age between 50 and 55 and completed 25 years service, on compulsory early retirement a full two thirds pension.
The UK Schemes rules guarantee pension increases during retirement fully in line with the RPI up to 3 per cent, subject to the minimum introduced in the Pensions Act 1995.
Increases above 3 per cent are not guaranteed but the trustee has the power to grant them, if circumstances permit, without referring to the Company.
Increases greater than 80 per cent of the movement in the RPI may be given with the agreement of the Company.
The current policy of the Company and the trustee is to fund the UK Scheme for increases matching 80 per cent of the movement in the RPI.
As a result of a review of transfer value calculations undertaken to ensure compliance with the Pensions Act 1995, the trustee of the UK Scheme has directed the schemes actuary to make only partial allowance for discretionary pension increases in transfer values calculated after 6 April 1997.
In the case of death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times basic salary is payable by the UK Scheme.
Spouses pensions are also provided by the Scheme and are 66 per cent of the members pension before commutation.
Dependants pensions may be payable at the trustees discretion if there is no spouse and are the same percentage as spouses pensions.
Childrens allowances are paid at the rate of 25 per cent of the spouses pension for each of up to three children ceasing at the age of 18, or at the age of 23 if in full time education.
The pension entitlements shown exclude any additional pension purchased by the directors Additional Voluntary Contributions.
