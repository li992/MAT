Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Report by the Board to Shareholders on Directors Remuneration Remuneration committee The remuneration committee was established in 1993.
The current members are The Viscount Rothermere chairman, CJF Sinclair, JC Botts and JD Bolsover.
All are non-executive directors of the company.
The Viscount Rothermere and CJF Sinclair are directors of Daily Mail and General Trust plc but have no personal financial interests in the company other than as shareholders, and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The committee consults the chairman and managing director about its proposals and is authorized to seek professional advice from outside the company where appropriate.
Policy on directors remuneration The group believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.
The two consistent objectives in the companys remuneration policy since its inception in 1969 have been the maximization of earnings per share and the creation of shareholder value.
The first objective is achieved through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors and key managers to the profits and growth in profits of the group or relevant parts of the group.
This scheme is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling.
To support the implementation of the policy of profit sharing, the group is divided into a number of profit centres.
The manager of each profit centre is paid a profit share related to the profit centres profits and profit growth.
Each profit centre is part of a larger business group.
Each business group manager has an incentive based on the business groups profits and profit growth.
Profit sharing encourages directors and managers to grow their businesses, to launch new ventures and to search for acquisitions that would fit well with their businesses.
All those on profit shares are aware that if profits rise, so does their pay.
Similarly if profits fall, so do their profit shares.
The profit shares of executive directors and senior managers make up much of their total pay.
For example, of the total remuneration of the thirteen executive directors who served in the year, 66.3% was derived from profit shares.
The creation of shareholder value is also encouraged through an executive share option scheme.
The companys previous scheme was approved by shareholders in 1985 and expired in 1995, although options granted under this scheme may be exercised before various dates through to 2005.
A new executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders in January 1996 and the performance criteria under which options granted under this scheme may be exercised are set out on page 26.
During the year share options were granted to DC Cohen, CR Jones, E Bounous, SM Brady and G Mueller pages 24 & 25.
Options are granted in phased blocks over a period of several years.
The directors believe that the profit sharing and share option arrangements are responsible for much of the companys success since 1969.
These arrangements serve shareholders by aligning the interests of the directors and managers with those of shareholders and are considered an important driver of the companys growth strategy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board.
Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Page 19 Report by the Board to Shareholders on Directors Remuneration continued Directors service contracts With the exception of the chairman and managing director, each of the executive directors has a twelve month rolling service contract.
The chairman and managing director have two year rolling service contracts and the remuneration committee believes that the length of these contracts is appropriate given the competitive pressures of the media industry.
The board, however, would not normally appoint a new executive director with a service contract of more than one year.
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract.
Five of the directors have waived profit shares in respect of the current and future years as follows: PM Fallon 138,800: PR Ensor 100,000: NF Osborn 8,674: DC Cohen 65,000: GB Strahan 30,000.
Profit shares waived were paid into private pension schemes on the directors behalf.
Included within total remuneration are amounts paid into a discretionary employee benefit trust.
