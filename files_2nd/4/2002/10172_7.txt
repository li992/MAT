Annual Report and Financial Statements Remuneration Report Scope and membership of Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee meets not less than twice a year and comprises all Non-Executive Directors.
It is chaired by Adrian Montague.
The Chief Executive attends the meetings except when his own remuneration is under consideration.
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to review, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and to determine the level of remuneration, incentives and other benefits, compensation payments and the terms of employment of each Executive Director.
It also seeks to provide a remuneration package that aligns the interests of Executive Directors with the shareholders.
The Committee has continued to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors with regard to the need to maintain a balance between the constituent elements of salary, incentive and other benefits.
It has appointed and receives advice from independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants, and makes comparisons with similar organisations.
New Bridge Street Consultants provides no other material services to the Company.
No Directors other than the members of the Remuneration Committee provided material advice to the Committee on Directors remuneration.
Remuneration policy The objective of the Groups remuneration policy is to attract and retain management with the appropriate professional, managerial and operational expertise necessary to realise the Groups objectives as well as to establish a framework for remunerating all employees.
It is the Companys policy that none of the Executive Directors has a service contract which can be determined by more than 12 months notice.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
They are appointed for an initial term of three years and thereafter are subject to re-appointment each year.
Additional details of service contracts are shown on page 24.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive any pension or other benefits, other than out-of-pocket expenses, from the Group, nor do they participate in any of the bonus or share option schemes.
The remuneration agreed by the Committee for the Executive Directors contains the following elements: a base salary and benefits, an annual bonus reflecting Group performance, share options conditional upon achieving performance criteria, and pension benefits.
The following sections provide an outline of the Companys policy during 2002 and for the forthcoming and subsequent years with regard to each component.
Base salary and benefits The Committee establishes salaries and benefits by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for Executive Directors of comparable status and market value, taking into account the range of incentives described elsewhere in this report, including a performance bonus.
Reviews of such base salary and benefits are conducted annually by the Committee having regard to the individuals performance and the performance of the Group.
18 - Michael Page International plc Annual Report and Financial Statements Remuneration Report Remuneration policy continued Performance bonus a Cash Executive Directors are eligible to receive a cash bonus related to the performance of the Group.
The terms upon which the bonus is payable are determined annually.
The bonus is not pensionable.
b Deferred shares For 2003 and subsequent years, a deferred share performance bonus scheme is being introduced for a small number of senior employees, including the Executive Directors.
Bonuses under this scheme are payable in deferred bonus shares.
A bonus pool will be established each year and used to make market purchases of Michael Page shares through an employee benefit trust.
One third of deferred bonus shares will vest a year after the award, a further third after two years with the full amount vesting after three years.
On vesting the shares will be capable of transfer from the trust to the individual.
Share schemes Restricted Share Scheme On flotation in 2001, 6% of the issued shares of the Group owned by Spherion Corporation, the Groups previous ultimate parent company, were allocated to the Executive Directors and certain senior executives in a Restricted Share Scheme.
Benefits received under the Restricted Share Scheme are not pensionable and the shares will be delivered in March 2004.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Directors and certain key employees are eligible to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme.
No payment is required on the grant of an option and no share options are granted at a discount.
Benefits received under the Executive Share Option Scheme will not be pensionable.
Share options can only be exercised on the achievement of performance criteria which are disclosed in note 17 of the Financial Statements.
Pension benefits Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a Company pension plan which is a defined contribution scheme.
No changes were made to pension arrangements during 2002 and no changes are anticipated in 2003.
