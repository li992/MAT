Remuneration Committee the Committee : Composition, Responsibilities and Operation The names of the members of the Committee who served during the year ended 31 December 2002 are as follows: Mr P G Rogerson Chairman: Mr A C Salvesen: Mr N H Northridge appointed 14 February 2002.
Mr P G Rogerson stood down from the Committee on 22 January 2003 and was replaced as Chairman by Mr N H Northridge.
Mr R V McGlone joined the Committee on the same date.
The membership of the Committee is entirely non-executive.
They have no personal financial interest, other than as Shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no potential conicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day operational responsibility within the Group.
The Committees principal function is to determine the policy on remuneration for the most senior executives and to approve the specic remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Secretary, including their service contracts.
The Committees remit therefore includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, benets in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, long-term incentive schemes, pension rights and any compensation or termination payments.
In exercising its responsibilities the Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, and consults with the Group Chief Executive.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has appointed Monks Partnership to provide remuneration consultancy with respect to basic salary and bonus plans.
Monks Partnership became part of  in 2001:  have been the Auditors of the Company from 1997 to 31 December 2002, at which time  LLP became the Auditors.
Tax and other non-audit services have also been provided during this period.
On 25 February 2003, the Committee appointed Towers Perrin to take on the role of providing remuneration consultancy with respect to basic salary and bonus plans.
There are a number of external advisors appointed by the Company who advise on remuneration matters for the wider workforce and also provide advice to the Committee from time to time.
Principal advisers in the year were: New Bridge Street Consultants provide advice on Savings-Related and Executive share option schemes: Mercer Human Resource Consulting provides advice on retirement benets in the UK and overseas and administers the UK dened benefit pension scheme: Watson Wyatt LLP provides advice on retirement benets in the UK.
Remuneration Policy The Committee has adopted the following policy for the Remuneration of Executive Directors, it is intended that this policy will apply in 2003 and future years.
General Policy Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the job.
The Company pays the market median, on average, for standard performance in the job, and pays up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at the basic salary element, reference is made to a number of well-established salary surveys covering similar jobs of the same size in a large sample of over 400 companies in the manufacturing and service sectors in the UK.
The same consistent approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate surveys for the geographical location.
28 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 29 Remuneration Strategy is adapted to reect the current business strategy.
On occasions, it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
The Company is always mindful of the need for good corporate governance in all its dealings regarding pay and benets for employees as well as Directors.
Pay systems are designed to allow progression that reects an individuals contribution to the business and to control overall cost.
Pay and benefit structures are designed to be cost effective to achieve the right level of attraction and retention at the best value.
Performance related elements of Remuneration A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related through annual bonus and share options.
Annual Cash Bonuses The Company pays competitive bonuses that can place the total cash earnings near the upper quartile for the market place in high performance years.
The factors to be measured for bonus purposes and the corresponding levels of bonus are pre-determined at the start of the performance period.
Bonuses are paid as close to the end of the performance period as practicable so that they reect current performance.
All Executive Directors participate in a scheme, which allows them to earn bonuses on a graduated scale if a targeted level of Earnings per Share is exceeded, with in addition 25% of the overall bonus being related to the achievement of personal goals.
The performance criteria are designed to enhance Shareholders value and the Committee approves all financial targets and personal goals: no bonus will be paid if targets and goals are not achieved.
A maximum bonus of 50% of basic salary is available to all Executive Directors, except in North America where there is a maximum bonus of 75% of basic salary.
The Committee does, however, also have discretion to reward outstanding individual achievement.
Share Option Schemes The Company believes that employee share schemes encourage the matching of interests between employees and Shareholders.
The Aggreko Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave is normally offered annually to all employees who have at least six months service.
Senior executives are able to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Since August 2001 Executive Share Options have been granted on an annual basis, with new participants not normally receiving options until they have been employed for at least twelve months.
The allocation of executive share options is based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the seniority and job size of the 1 individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
UK participants in the Executive Share Option Scheme receive part of their entitlement under a scheme that has received approval under the Taxes Act conferring certain tax relief on participants.
The Treasury limit for outstanding options under the approved scheme is currently 30,000 for each participant, with the balance of the participants entitlement being held under an unapproved scheme.
All the executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both total Shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings per Share as disclosed in the Companys Consolidated profit and Loss Account.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus three per cent per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
A performance condition with both a TSR and EPS element has been chosen because the Company believes that the TSR element clearly aligns the interests of Executive Directors and Shareholders as it only rewards out-performance of the FTSE Mid 250 Index, while the EPS element encourages the Executive Directors to generate real earnings growth.
The Committee will regularly review the suitability of the performance conditions for future grants of options, and the conditions imposed from time to time at the date of grant of options will be disclosed to Shareholders each year in the Companys Annual Report and Accounts.
As described more fully below, Shareholder approval is to be sought at the forthcoming AGM to an amendment to the rules of the Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997 relating to the grant of options to employees nearing retirement.
The Committee has adopted a policy that encourages Executive Directors to use their Executive Share Options to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company with the objective of further aligning their long-term interests with those of other Shareholders.
29 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 30 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Other Benets Other benets, including pensions, are based on the current market median practice and take into account long-term trends in provision.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods The notice period from the Company offered to Executive Directors appointed after 1 January 2000 has been restricted to one year in the light of the Best Practice Provisions of the Code.
Mr A G Cockburn, Mr G P Walker and Mr H J Molenaar have service agreements that require one years notice from the individual and one years notice from the Company.
Mr F A B Shepherd has a service agreement under which the notice period from the Company reduced to one year with effect from his 60th birthday on 24 November 2002.
Mr P J Harrower was appointed to the Board prior to 1 January 2000 and at the date of the cessation of his directorship he held a service agreement that required one years notice from the individual and two years notice from the Company.
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors The remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Non-executive Director of the Company.
When setting the fees payable to Nonexecutive Directors, the Board makes use of information provided by a number of remuneration surveys and takes into account the extent of the duties performed and the size of the Company.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to bonuses, benets, pension contributions or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.

The other points plotted are the intervening financial year ends.
The FTSE Mid 250 was selected as a comparator as this index is used as one of the performance measures for the Executive Share Option Schemes.
A general index is considered more appropriate than sector and peer group comparators given the unique nature of the Companys business.

Benets in kind are made up of private health care, taxable life insurance benets, car costs, relocation costs and the allowances paid to Directors on expatriate secondment.
Other pay represents the amount paid to Directors in order to fund pension benets beyond the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
Pursuant to the terms of his service contract, Dr C Masters received an additional 22,916 for service between the date of his resignation as a Director and the date of his retirement from the Company on 31 May 2002.
Mr P J Harrower was the highest paid Director.
His entitlements under the Retirement plans and details of his potential receipt of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme are disclosed separately.
Pension Entitlements The Executive Directors who are UK-resident or on overseas secondment from the UK are members of the Aggreko plc pension scheme which is a funded, dened benefit scheme approved by the Inland Revenue.
The key elements of their benets are: a normal retirement age of 60: a benets accrual rate of 1 30th for each years service up to a maximum of two thirds of final pensionable salary: an employee contribution rate of 5% of basic salary: a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary: a spouses pension on death: and an early retirement pension based on a 3% simple reduction factor.
31 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 32 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Where members are subject to the Inland Revenue cap, the Company has paid such members the equivalent of the amount that it would have cost the Company to fund the pension benets beyond the cap.
The following disclosures relate to Executive Directors who, during 2002, were members of the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme.
Increase in Accrued Transfer Transfer Increase in Increase in Pension Value of Value of Transfer Accrued Accrued during Accrued Accrued Directors Value during Pensions at Pension 2002 Pension at Pension at Contributions 2002 net 31 Dec during net of 31 Dec 31 Dec during of Directors 2002 2002 ination 2002 2001 2002 Contributions Age pa pa pa Dr C Masters 55 187,800 3,040 2,600 3,755,700 3,625,300 2,750 127,650 A G Cockburn 39 8,640 3,300 3,250 46,000 35,200 4,770 6,030 F A B Shepherd 60 72,700 16,570 15,620 1,589,300 975,400 9,370 604,530 The Transfer Values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would be paid if the Director left service at the relevant date.
During the year Dr C Masters left service and took a transfer value of his benets from the Scheme.
The end of year disclosure gures therefore relate to the position at his date of withdrawal.
He had no remaining accrued benets under the Scheme at 31 December 2002.
Under an agreement that was in existence at the time of demerger on 29 September 1997, the benets of Dr C Masters were enhanced to allow early retirement without the application of actuarial reduction factors between the age of 55 and 60.
Prior to 1 January 1995, the Senior Staff Pension Scheme included the average bonus over the last three years in final pensionable salary.
Since that date all elements, other than basic salary, have been removed for new entrants.
Those who were already members at that date were given the choice of retaining the bonus element and continuing to pay 6%, or accepting a xed supplement representing the level of taxable benets in kind with a lower contribution rate of 5%.
It has been decided not to change this arrangement for existing scheme members, as they have made higher contributions in recognition of this enhancement.
The UK dened benefit pension scheme was closed to new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
New employees, including Directors, are now offered membership of a Group Personal Pension Plan.
The Directors outside the UK participate in dened contribution schemes that are designed to be in line with the median practice in the relevant country.
Mr P J Harrower was and Mr G P Walker is entitled to participate in the Employees Savings Investment Retirement plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement plan of Aggreko LLC, which are governed by the laws of the United States.
These plans allow contributions by the employee and the Group to be deferred for tax.
During 2002 the Groups contributions for Mr P J Harrower were 73,974 2001 85,843 and for Mr G P Walker were 32,577 2001 48,152.
At 31 December 2002 the Groups total contributions and the accumulated earnings in the funds held for Mr P J Harrower were 236,149 2001 266,964 and for Mr G P Walker were 227,179 2001 277,236.
The benets also include a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary.
Mr H J Molenaar is a member of the Aggreko Netherlands pension scheme.
During 2002 the Groups contributions for Mr H J Molenaar were 10,707 2001 8,460.
At 31 December 2002 the Groups total contributions and the accumulated earnings in the funds held for him were 39,724 2001 26,852 Under this scheme the employee contributes 5% of basic salary and the Company contributes a percentage of basic salary dependant upon age.
Up to the age of 39 this percentage is 10% increasing to 15% between the ages of 40 and 45 and reaching a maximum of 30% between the ages of 55 and 60.
His benets include a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary.
Phantom Share Option Scheme for Mr F A B Shepherd Under the rules of Aggrekos Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997 as originally drafted, options may not be granted to individuals who are within two years of normal retirement age.
For the purposes of the rules of the Schemes, normal retirement age is the normal retirement age under the Companys general retirement policy which, for Executive Directors, is age 60 and not the age at which any particular individual is expected to retire.
It was agreed that the retirement age for Mr F A B Shepherd, who reached the age of 60 on 24 November 2002, will be 63.
Consequently, the rules of the Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997 prohibited the grant of options to Mr Shepherd as, notwithstanding the fact that Mr Shepherd was three years from his actual expected retirement date, he was within two years of his normal retirement age of 60 for the purposes of the rules of the Schemes.
32 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Aggreko WEB pdf 14 3 03 11:40 am Page 33 The Committee considered it essential to continue to incentivise Mr Shepherd and that he be granted some form of long-term incentive, the ultimate value of which was tied to the Companys future share price and financial performance.
Due to the unusual circumstances described above, it was not possible to grant Mr Shepherd options under either the Approved or Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997.
Therefore, having consulted a number of the Companys major Shareholders and the Association of British Insurers, the Committee determined that Mr Shepherd be granted an award under a Phantom Option Scheme that was established with Mr Shepherd as the sole participant.
Mr Shepherd first became eligible to receive an award under the Phantom Option Scheme on 25 September 2002, the date when the Scheme was established.
The award is granted over a notional number of shares.
On exercise of the award, Mr Shepherd will receive a cash sum net of tax equal to the amount by which the market value of these shares at exercise exceeds their market value on grant 128 pence per share.
The aggregate market value of the shares to which Mr Shepherds award notionally relates at the date of grant was 280,000.
The intention was that, where possible, the terms and conditions to which options granted under the Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997 are subject should also apply to Mr Shepherds award under the Phantom Option Scheme.
Therefore, Mr Shepherds award will only normally become exercisable three years after grant and only then to the extent that, over three consecutive years, the Companys TSR matches or exceeds the TSR of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus three per cent per annum.
The other main features of the Phantom Option Scheme are as follows: No payment is required for the grant of awards, which are neither transferable nor pensionable.
Awards will not be capable of exercise more than 10 years after grant.
Awards normally lapse on cessation of employment, save in certain prescribed circumstances although different rules apply if cessation is more than three years after grant.
Awards also become exercisable on a change in control of the Company.
However, in both circumstances, awards only become exercisable to the extent determined by the Committee taking account of the likelihood that the performance conditions would have been met.
In the event of a variation of share capital or on a demerger or other events similarly affecting an award adjustments considered to be appropriate may be made to the total number of shares to which the award notionally relates and the price payable on the exercise of the award.
The Phantom Option Scheme may at any time be amended or added to by the Board in any respect subject to compliance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, provided that the prior approval of the Company in general meeting must be obtained for alterations or additions to the rules of the Scheme to the advantage of Mr Shepherd in respect of the rules governing eligibility, individual or Scheme limits including the maximum entitlement of the participant, the terms of awards, the basis of participation and the adjustment of awards as described above, except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the Scheme, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for Mr Shepherd or Group Companies.
It is intended that no further awards will be made to Mr Shepherd under the Phantom Option Scheme if the amendments described below to the rules of the Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997 are authorised by Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
In any event, it is not intended that any awards will be made to Mr Shepherd in any year that will result 1 in the market value of the shares to which awards notionally relate at the relevant date of grant exceeding 1 3 times his remuneration.
Changes to the Rules of the Executive Share Option Schemes The Company wishes to ensure that the unusual circumstances described above do not occur again, and also to ensure that the operation of the Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes 1997 reect current best practice in terms of the period before retirement in which participants may be granted options.
Therefore, a resolution will be put to Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM asking them to approve minor amendments to the rules of these Schemes, the effect of which will be that options may be granted to participants up to six months as opposed to two years as is currently the case prior to their expected retirement date.
This accords with the latest Guidelines for Share Incentive Schemes published by the Association of British Insurers.

These options may be exercised within 12 months after the date of his death.
No options were exercised by Directors during the year ended 31 December 2002.
In the year ended 31 December 2001 the aggregate gain made on the exercise of Share Options by Directors was 598,404, of which 382,801 related to the gain of the highest paid Director.
