Remuneration report This report sets out the Companys policy and disclosures in relation to Directors remuneration.
The Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to the remuneration of its Directors and has complied with the provisions of the Code of Best Practice as set out below and as disclosed in Corporate Governance Statements.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive Directors.
The Committee determines their total remuneration packages including any compensation on termination of office.
The Committee also provides advice to the Chief Executive Officer on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of senior executives.
To ensure that Interteks remuneration practices are market competitive, the Remuneration Committee takes advice from various independent sources.
The Committee met five times during 2002.
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are: DP Allvey Chairman RE Sayers five Treves The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
They give due regard to the interests of shareholders and the requirements of The Listing Rules and associated guidance.
The Committee appointed and has taken independent advice from The Hay Group Management Ltd Hay Group, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, to help it achieve its objectives.
The Board, with the support of external professional advice, determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy The Committees policy is to attract, retain, motivate and reward high calibre individuals to ensure the future success of the business and to deliver shareholder value.
It determines the terms of service contracts, and any changes to the terms of employment, of the executive Directors.
The Committee therefore has regard to the following objective: The maintenance of a competitive package of pay and benefits, commensurate with comparable packages of pay and benefits provided by other companies of comparable size and complexity in the industry and services group of the FTSE 250 index.
The base salary is targeted at the market median whilst for superior performance the total package of salary and bonus is aimed at the top quartile.
The Company anticipates that its policy for 2003 and for the foreseeable future will remain the same, targeted as it is on the market median.
Executive Directors Basic salary The basic salary for each Executive Director is set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account both the performance and experience of the individual and information from external advisors.
21 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com Remuneration report Performance bonuses The Executive Directors and senior executives are eligible for annual incentive payments for the achievement of annual financial and tactical goals of the Intertek Group and its businesses.
The financial targets are derived from the strategic planning process for the Intertek Group and its businesses which is the cornerstone of Interteks results culture.
During 2002, bonus targets focused on profit growth, the delivery of cash and the achievement of individual strategic objectives.
Targets are established and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Such incentives are not pensionable.
Pensions Executive Directors excluding RC Nelson participate in the Companys UK final salary pension scheme on the same basis as other eligible employees.
RC Nelsons pension entitlement was established at a level which reflected the valuable contribution he has made in the development of the Group.
That policy as well as the amounts paid into his pension fund, were agreed with the institutional shareholders of Intertek Testing Services Limited, the Groups former parent company.
Non-Executive Directors The Board, with the assistance of Hay Group, determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
On the recommendation of Hay Group their remuneration will increase with effect from 1 April 2003 to the amounts disclosed in the notes below the summary of pro-forma emoluments and compensation on page 25.
Such remuneration is neither pensionable nor eligible for annual incentive payments.
The Non-Executive Directors are not allowed to participate in share option schemes.
Other than five Treves, the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company who has the benefit of a company car, no other benefits in kind are provided.
Service contracts Details of the service contracts currently in place for Directors who have served during the year are as follows: Executive Directors The service contracts of both Executive Directors are dated 24 May 2002 and are twelve month rolling contracts, which are terminable by either party on twelve months notice.
Both contracts contain provisions for payment of salary over a twelve month period, subject to mitigation, pro-rated bonus and benefits in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
The letter of engagement for each Non-Executive Director states that they are appointed for a period of three years.
The Board excluding Non-Executives determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
As noted in this Remuneration report under Transactions with Directors, W Hauser has a consultancy agreement with the Company.
Policy on external appointments The Company recognises that, during their employment with the Company, Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that such duties can broaden their experience and knowledge.
Executive Directors may, with written consent of the Company, accept a single directorship outside the Company.
At the date of this Report, no such appointments have been made.
Share options The Company believes that share ownership by employees is an integral part of its programme to incentivise, reward and retain employees as it strengthens the link between the employees personal interest and that of the shareholders.
In order to encourage share ownership the Company established a share option scheme for senior management in March 1997.
That scheme has now been discontinued and replaced by The Intertek Testing Services 2002 Share Option Plan the 2002 Plan and the Intertek Testing Services 2002 Approved Share Option Plan the Approved Plan on 9 May 2002.
Options are granted by either the Board or the Employee Share Ownership Trust on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
22 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com The 2002 Plan Only Executive Directors or employees of the Intertek Group are eligible to participate in the 2002 Plan.
The exercise price is determined by the average of the closing middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the Company on the five dealing days immediately prior to the date of grant and the options are exercisable between three and ten years after the date of grant, provided the performance conditions have been satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee will make that determination at the appropriate time.
Options are granted subject to performance criteria unless there are regulatory or legal difficulties in jurisdictions in which the employee is based.
The performance condition requires that the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS out-performs the growth in the retail prices index by a minimum of 5% per annum over a three year period.
If the condition is met, 25% of the 2 options become exercisable.
If the growth rate is 8% then 66 3% of options become exercisable.
100% of the options would only become exercisable if the Companys growth in EPS outperformed the growth in the retail prices index by 11% per annum over a three year period.
For growth rates between 5% and 8% and 8% and 11%, the exercisable percentage of options is calculated on a sliding scale.
If the performance targets are not met in full for the initial performance period of three years, the performance period is extended by a further twelve months to ascertain whether the balance of the unvested options can be exercised.
The above performance criteria were selected to closely link improvement in performance with increase in shareholder value.
Senior executives are required to retain up to 25% of their shares acquired upon the exercise of their options ignoring shares sold to meet any tax liability, financing cost on exercise or in the case of hardship, for a period of up to two years following acquisition, in order to demonstrate their commitment to the Company.
The Approved Plan The key features of the Approved Plan which has been approved by the Inland Revenue are broadly the same as for the 2002 Plan except that options are granted subject to the requirement that the aggregate exercise price of all the subsisting options granted to an employee under the Plan must not exceed 30,000.
Period of exercise Under both the 2002 Plan and the Approved Plan, the period during which options can be exercised is as follows: Date of grant Date first exercisable Date last exercisable 30 May 2002 30 May 2005 29 May 2012 Performance graph Intertek share price and FTSE 250 share price index rebased to 100 at 24 May 2002 Intertek FTSE 250 120 This graph shows the movement in share price since the Companys flotation on 24 May 2002, as compared to the movement in the FTSE 250 share price index.
That index has been selected as the most appropriate measure of the 100 performance in the Companys share price as there are too few direct competitors in the Support Services sector to enable a meaningful comparison 80 to be made.
At the time of flotation, the share price was 400p per share and at 60 31 December 2002 the share price was 404.5p.
The highest price was 462.5p and the lowest was 334.5p during that period.
