In the event of termination of his appointment, Mr H V Reid would be entitled to twelve months notice and Mr M F Garner and Mr A J Stewart would each be entitled to six months notice.
The executive directors all have service contracts under which they are entitled to receive twelve months notice of termination.
There are no special provisions in the executive directors contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The remuneration committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
