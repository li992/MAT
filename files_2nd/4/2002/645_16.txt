702350 pp38-pp42 22 4 03 5:30 pm Page 38 38 Alfred McAlpine PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Remuneration report Membership and constitution of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee, comprising the Non-Executive Directors Mr C D Collins, Mr A M Robb and, until his retirement on 13th May, 2002, Sir Terence Harrison, makes recommendations to the Board on the Companys overall framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors, and also determines their individual remuneration packages including pension rights and compensation payments.
The Committee consults the Chief Executive on the remuneration of the Executive Directors, and is assisted by the Group Company Secretary.
Inbucon-Meis Limited act as advisor to the Company and the Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes.
Mercer Human Resources Consulting Limited advise the Company on pension matters.
Inbucon-Meis and Mercer do not provide other services to the Group.
Compliance The Committee is constituted and operates in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, as adopted by the UK Listing Authority and annexed to the Listing Rules the Code.
In preparing this report the Board has complied with the provisions of the Code.
Executive remuneration policy and structure The Groups aim is to provide remuneration packages that are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors of a high calibre.
To this end, surveys and external advice are instrumental in the annual review of salary and benefits packages.
The Committee believes that base salary and benefits for Executive Directors should represent a fair return for employment, but that the total reward for Executive Directors should be derived substantially from the performance-related elements of the remuneration package annual bonus and Restricted Share Plan awards.
Performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the Executive Directors total remuneration packages, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders and providing incentives for performance.
In designing schemes for performance-related remuneration, the Committee follows the provisions of the Code.
Due consideration is given to performance relative to comparable companies.
There have been no significant amendments to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director under the long-term incentive scheme the Restricted Share Plan during the year.
Performance chart The chart below compares the growth in value of 100 invested in ordinary shares in Alfred McAlpine PLC on 1st January, 1998 with the performance of a similar investment in the shares of the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index and the FTSE Support Services Index.
The Directors are of the view that these constitute a relevant broad equity market index.

When determining Directors salaries the Committee is always sensitive to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
Independent remuneration surveys are commissioned when required to substantiate salary levels.
Annual bonus The Committee determines annual bonuses.
The bonuses are based upon the achievement of Group profit before tax compared with budget.
This is relevant, stretching and designed to enhance the business.
The maximum bonus achievable is 50% of salary.
The Committee reviews the targets for the Executive Directors annually.
Pensions policy Executive Directors and senior executives may be eligible for membership of the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan the Pension Plan.
The Pension Plan is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary defined benefit pension scheme into which the Company currently contributes 12% of pensionable salary, and members contribute between 5% and 8% of pensionable salary.
702350 pp38-pp42 22 4 03 4:48 pm Page 39 39 Alfred McAlpine PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 The Pension Plan provides executive members with a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary on retirement at age 62, subject to completion of at least 30 years of pensionable service.
In addition, life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary is provided whilst in service.
Dependants pensions are provided on a members death in service or in retirement.
Pensionable salary is a members basic salary excluding all bonuses.
All Pension Plan benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
It is the Groups policy to provide those executives who joined the Company after May 1989 and are subject to the earnings cap 97,200 in the 2002 2003 tax year, with appropriate pension benefits outside the Pension Plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap.
Executives who are not members of the Pension Plan are also due to retire at age 62.
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the impact of basic salary increases upon pension and associated employment costs.
Share schemes The Company currently operates the Alfred McAlpine PLC Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 the ESOS 2000 and the Alfred McAlpine PLC Restricted Share Plan the Restricted Share Plan, both of which are performance-related.
The ESOS 2000 replaced the Alfred McAlpine Executive Share Option Scheme 1991 the ESOS 1991, under which a number of options are still outstanding, the final grant having been made in April 2000.
The Group also operates an all-employee share scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998, further details of which may be found in note 21 on page 65.
There are no plans to grant discretionary options to Executive Directors who receive awards under the Restricted Share Plan.
The Restricted Share Plan Restricted Share Plan awards are subject to performance conditions intended to link participants interests with those of the shareholders by encouraging an increase in the total shareholder return TSR of the Group relative to a peer group of companies and also in the long-term earnings per share EPS of the Group.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS are appropriate performance measurements, being two key long-term indicators of a companys success.
It is the current intention of the Committee that these performance measurements continue to apply.
Under the terms of the Restricted Share Plan, the Committee makes awards of ordinary shares in the Company which may be released if the Company achieves specific performance criteria and the participant remains in the Groups employment.
The maximum value based on market value at date of award of shares over which an initial award may be made to a participant in any year may not exceed 50% of salary.
Typically, initial awards are made each year following the preliminary announcement of the full-year results.
Initial awards may be made at other times, when the Committee believes them to be justified.
The performance criterion currently used to determine the vesting of the initial awards is TSR, which is calculated by taking the percentage increase in the average mid-market ordinary share price of the Company for the three-year period from the date of award, plus the value of the reinvested dividends.
The Companys performance is then measured against a peer group of companies on the same basis, the majority of which are direct competitors.
As shown below, the peer group was amended following the sale of the Homes business on 1st October, 2001.
Original comparator companies to 2001 : AMEC p. l. c. Costain Group PLC Montpellier Group Plc Taylor Woodrow plc Beazer Group Plc Interserve Plc Morrison Construction Group plc Wainhomes Birse Group plc Kier Group plc Persimmon plc Westbury plc Bryant Group plc John Laing plc Speedy Hire plc George Wimpey PLC Beazer Group Plc, Bryant Group plc, Morrison Construction Group plc and Wainhomes were all taken over after the start of the performance periods for the Restricted Share Plan awards.
Wainhomes is not included as a comparator company for awards made after 1999.
Current comparator companies 2002 onwards : Amey plc Birse Group plc Interserve Plc MITIE Group PLC W S Atkins plc Costain Group PLC Jarvis plc Morgan Sindall plc Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc Kier Group plc Serco Group plc Vesting may take place from the third anniversary of the initial award date.
No awards vest if the Companys performance is below the 50th percentile.
Vesting starts at the 50th percentile, and 100% of the initial award will vest at the 40th percentile.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between the 50th and the 40th percentile.
If the Companys performance exceeds the 40th percentile, the number of shares subject to the award increases on a proportionate basis, so that at the 1st percentile 150% of the number of shares subject to the initial award may vest.
These additional shares are known as Exceptional Performance Shares.
Vesting may be deferred for a further period of three years in the Alfred McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust the Employee Benefit Trust, whereupon the shares may be matched on a one-for-one basis subject to satisfaction of a further performance target.
This second performance target requires the growth in EPS of the Company to exceed the growth in RPI by 9% over the three-year period.
The Trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends.
However, where a participant has elected to defer vesting, the Company makes discretionary cash payments to the participant, which are equivalent to the dividends payable in relation to such shares.
702350 pp38-pp42 22 4 03 4:48 pm Page 40 40 Alfred McAlpine PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Remuneration report continued ESOS 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme Senior executives are granted discretionary options over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the date of grant.
The performance condition for the ESOS 2000 requires the Companys earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index RPI by 3% per annum over a rolling three-year period in order for the options to be exercised.
The Committee believes that this performance condition is appropriate and sufficiently demanding.
Other taxable benefits The Executive Directors are eligible for other taxable benefits, which include a fully expensed company car, membership of private medical schemes and top-up of life assurance premiums in respect of salary above the earnings cap.
