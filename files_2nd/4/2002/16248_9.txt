DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 the Act as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and has been approved by the board.
Disclosure relating to remuneration policy, long term incentive arrangements, total shareholder return and non-executive directors remuneration policy is not subject to audit.
Disclosure relating to individual directors remuneration on page 20, directors interests in share options and other long term incentive schemes on pages 23 to 25, and pensions information on page 21 has been audited.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The board has delegated to the remuneration committee responsibility for determining the companys policy on the remuneration of executive directors and specific approval of the remuneration package and terms of employment for each of the executive directors of the company and for other senior executives of the group.
In determining remuneration policy, the committee has regard to the provisions of the Combined Code.
All its members are non-executive directors: it is chaired by John Botts, who is also the senior independent director.
The other members are Jonathan Newcomb, Christopher Powell, Adair Turner, Geoff Unwin, Fields Wicker-Miurin and, until his retirement in November 2002, Sir Ronald Hampel: all are considered by the company to be independent.
The chief executive attends committee meetings by invitation: he is not present for discussion on matters concerning his own remuneration.
Meetings are also attended by the company secretary, Anne Siddell, and the legal and personnel director, Jane Stables.
Shareholders have been given an opportunity to vote on the companys remuneration policy at every annual general meeting since 1998.
A resolution seeking shareholder approval of this directors remuneration report will be proposed at this years annual general meeting.
REMUNERATION POLICY All of the companys personnel policies, including its policy on remuneration for executive directors, are driven by the requirement to attract, motivate and retain the best available talent in highly competitive markets.
The company aims to strike an appropriate balance between fixed and performance related or variable remuneration.
Non-performance related aspects include base salary, cash allowances and contributions to pensions arrangements.
Performance related aspects include annual bonus arrangements and other long term incentive arrangements such as executive option schemes and executive equity participation plans.
By this means the company is better able to recognise and reward outstanding performance and contribution at the appropriate level.
The company believes the contribution made by the performance related elements of the directors packages should constitute a significant proportion of the total remuneration package and should incentivise them by means of annual and medium term objectives to achieve stretching corporate goals for the benefit of shareholders.
The committee intends to review its policy on performance related remuneration during 2003, with particular reference to the balance between cash and equity based awards.
The company believes that executive directors and senior managements pay arrangements ensure that they work effectively as a team in addition to encouraging individual creativity and delivery against goals.
The company encourages directors to build up a shareholding in the company by means of the Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan which is described on page 19.
There is no requirement for directors to hold shares in the company.
The companys policy on non-executive directors remuneration is described on page 26.
Executive directors service contracts It is the companys policy that all executive directors should have service contracts that are terminable on no more than one years notice, and that contracts should not have a fixed term.
Contracts provide for automatic termination on retirement at age 60.
All directors are subject to re-election by shareholders every 3 years.
Details of the service contracts of those executive directors who served during the year are as follows:- Director Contract date Notice Period C Hollick 31.10.2001 1 year C Gregson 31.12.2001 1 year M Wall 24.11.2000 1 year N Wilson 06.07.2001 1 year The description on page 21 sets out the calculation of Clive Hollicks pension entitlement if his service were terminated by the company following a change of control.
If Clive Hollick or Charles Gregsons employment were terminated other than for cause summary dismissal, they would be entitled to a payment, calculated by reference to their unexpired period of notice, of up to one years salary and benefits and 50 per cent of average annual bonus over the preceding 3 years excluding any special bonus.
Under Malcolm Wall and Nigel Wilsons contracts, any payment on early termination would be by reference to the unexpired period of notice, subject to a duty to mitigate.
Base salary for each director is determined annually with effect from 1 January.
The company regularly participates in executive remuneration surveys that provide information on the practice of major public companies to measure the competitiveness of the directors base salaries.
In addition to measurement against competitive market data, factors such as inflation, the individuals responsibilities, the companys performance and the salary policy throughout the group as a whole are taken into account when determining base salary levels.
No increases were made in base salary levels for executive directors during 2002, nor have any been made in 2003, thus leaving executive directors base salary levels unchanged since 1 January 2001.
Benefits comprise nonpensionable car and cash benefit allowances.
The executive directors are eligible for an annual bonus dependent on the achievement of qualitative and quantitive targets which are set by the committee at the beginning of the year.
Targets customarily include a combination of factors which recognise both relevant company performance and individual objectives.
The annual bonus is normally capped at 60 per cent of base salary, with the full bonus becoming payable only if targets are substantially exceeded.
Bonuses earned are paid in cash or the individual may be invited to invest his bonus in the companys Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan which is described below.
18 UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT 2002 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Long term Incentive Arrangements Executive share options It is the companys policy to award executive directors executive share options to reward past performance and to incentivise future performance.
Such awards are currently made under the United Business Media 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme which was established, with shareholder approval, in April 2000.
Options are granted at market value and the committee determines the appropriate level of each grant having regard to corporate objectives, market forces and individual circumstances.
It was decided in December 2000 to award options to approximately twenty senior employees of the group including executive directors over a period of two years with a maximum value of 12 times salary.
This was considered to be appropriate given the wish to incentivise these key individuals during a time of great organisational change, and in light of the restructured groups increased exposure to US markets and the need to compete for talent in those markets.
Options with a value of approximately 12 times salary have been granted to Clive Hollick and Malcolm Wall, with a value of approximately 11 times salary to Charles Gregson and with a value of approximately 9 times salary to Nigel Wilson.
Half of the options granted in each tranche will vest after three years and half after four years, subject to fulfilment of the performance condition described below.
Awards to other participants in the 2000 Scheme are generally made on a phased basis, with annual awards of up to 3 times salary being usual.
The exercise of options under the 2000 Scheme is subject to a performance condition which requires growth in earnings per share to exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index by an average of 3 per cent per annum over the measurement period.
If this condition is met, options with a face value equal to 0.75 times salary will vest.
In order for the whole award to vest, growth in earnings per share must exceed inflation by an average of 5 per cent per annum.
A sliding scale applies between these two figures.
These performance conditions are measured over a period of three to six years from the date of grant, with a fixed start date.
No re-testing is permitted after six years from the date of grant.
The committee considers that a performance condition based on long term earnings per share growth is an appropriate means of incentivising directors and that the targeted growth levels of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent above inflation are appropriately stretching.
As and when options are due to vest, the companys auditors will be asked to confirm whether the performance conditions have been met.
Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan The United Business Media 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan SEEPP was established with shareholder approval in April 2000.
Invitations are issued annually by the committee and there is no automatic entitlement to participate.
Under the SEEPP selected senior executives including executive directors may waive part or all of their annual bonus and receive an interest in shares in the company bonus shares to the equivalent value.
The executive may also be granted a right to acquire shares matching shares in the company equal in value to the gross amount of the bonus foregone at a nominal price.
A matching share award will normally be exercisable in full between the fourth and tenth anniversaries of its grant, but only to the extent that the attached bonus shares are still held on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
Two thirds of a matching share award may only be exercised if growth in earnings per share exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index by up to 5 per cent per annum over the period of four years commencing with the year of grant: the remaining one-third requires no performance condition.
No re-testing of performance conditions is permitted.
These conditions are in accordance with the committees policy as outlined above.
Other long term incentive arrangements Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson also hold outstanding awards under executive option and other incentive plans previously operated by the company which have now closed.
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave scheme, under which eligible employees around the group may acquire options over ordinary shares of the company at a discount of up to 20 per cent of their market price, using the proceeds of a related SAYE contract.
Further details of these plans, including an explanation of performance conditions, and of the outstanding awards held by executive directors, are set out on pages 23 to 25.
External appointments It is recognised that by holding the office of a non-executive director of another company, an executive director may gain valuable knowledge and experience that can benefit the company.
The policy therefore provides for executive directors to accept not more than two outside corporate directorships, subject to board approval which may be given or withheld at the boards discretion.
An executive director may retain the fees received for a non-executive directorship.

Benefits are non pensionable car and cash allowances.
Directors may be invited to sacrifice part or all of the bonus to the SEEPP.
Sir Ronald Hampel ceased to be chairman with effect from 5 November 2002 and the fees column in the above table reflects his remuneration up to that date.
He continued to receive fees in accordance with the companys obligations in the terms of his appointment for the remainder of his notice period which would otherwise have expired on 27 March 2003.
The figure of 82,108 in the table above comprises the amount of such fees and the value of secretarial services provided: 51,552 of this amount has been paid in 2003.
With effect from 1 October 2000, 50 per cent of the fees otherwise payable to Sir Ronald Hampel were provided to him in the form of a provisional allocation of ordinary shares in the company to which he would become entitled, subject to certain conditions, on his retirement from the board.
The cash equivalent of these provisional allocations of shares has been reported as part of Sir Ronalds remuneration for the periods in question.
He became unconditionally entitled to receive the shares on 5 November 2002.
Geoff Unwins fees increased with effect from 5 November 2002, when he succeeded Sir Ronald Hampel as chairman.
Adair Turners fees increased from the same date, when he became chairman of the audit committee.
These increases are reflected in the fees column.
Malcolm Wall was appointed as a director on 1 January 2001, Nigel Wilson on 1 August 2001 and Jonathan Newcomb on 27 September 2001.
The comparative table shows remuneration paid to them during 2001 with effect from their respective dates of appointment.
The company receives a contribution from ICAP plc in consideration for making available Charles Gregsons services as chairman of that company.
Charles Gregsons remuneration shown above reflects that contribution.
His basic salary level remains unchanged since 2001.
Non-executive directors fees include an element payable in the form of ordinary shares, as described on page 26.
The cash element of Christopher Powells fee is paid to BMP DDB Limited, while that of John Botts is paid to Botts & Company Limited.
20 UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT 2002 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Pension entitlement Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson are members of the United Pension Plan which is an approved defined benefit scheme.
The company meets the full cost of the benefits.
The pension entitlement is two thirds of Final Pensionable Salary, which is the annual average of the best three consecutive Pensionable Salaries in the last ten years.
Under Clive Hollicks contract any bonus paid after 5 April 2001 is not pensionable: this means that if he remains in office until normal retirement age of 60 20 May 2005 he will receive his already earned pension entitlement of 726,000 per annum.
If he retires earlier this entitlement will be reduced pro rata on a sliding scale.
The pension would normally also be subject to a discount if drawn prior to normal retirement date.
If Clive Hollicks service were terminated by the company following a change of control he would be entitled to receive the pension of 726,000 per annum, reduced to reflect completed service plus his one years notice period.
Under the terms of Charles Gregsons service contract, the definition of Pensionable Salary includes annual bonus up to 50 per cent of base salary: this is a longstanding term of his service contract.
If Charles Gregsons service were terminated by the company without his consent he would be entitled to an immediate pension calculated as a proportion of his pension entitlement at age 60, based on his Final Pensionable Salary at the date of termination.
As members of the United Pension Plan Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson receive increases on their pensions in payment of 5 per cent per annum or RPI, if less, for all pensionable service.
The widows pension for the two executive directors is two thirds of their pension.
The company contributes to personal pension plans for other executive directors.
The following tables show the pension figures required to be disclosed by both the Act Table 1 and the current UKLA listing rules Table 2 which have not, as yet, been withdrawn.
Table 1 shows accrued pension entitlements at 31 December 2002 for Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson with the increase in pension accrued during the year together with prior year and current year end transfer values.
These transfer values represent the amount that would have been payable assuming the executive left service at the year end.
It should be noted that during the year, as a consequence of changes introduced by the Government to the basis used for calculating Minimum Funding Requirements the Trustees of the scheme amended the basis for calculating transfer values.
The equivalent transfer values at 31 December 2002 on a like for like basis are also shown for information.
A significant proportion of the increase disclosed has arisen due to the change in the basis and as a consequence of falling equity markets.
Details of the contributions paid by the company during the year to personal pension plans in respect of the other executive directors are also shown.

At 31 December 2002, the trustees of the United Business Media Employee Share Ownership Trust, and the Qualifying Employee Share Trust QUEST held a total of 1,482,768 UBM ordinary shares 2001: 1,599,185, and 529,530 B shares 2001: 1,446,982 and options over 1,332,707 UBM ordinary shares 2001: 2,253,097 and 1,165,572 B shares 2001: 1,377,771.
Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 of the Companies Act, the executive directors are deemed to be interested in these shares and options.
The maximum price of UBM ordinary shares during the year was 611 pence and the minimum price was 211 pence.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The graph below shows UBMs total shareholder return performance over the five years since 31 December 1997 as compared to the FTSE Media index, which has been chosen as UBM is a constituent of that index.
During the period two major restructuring events monetised shareholder value which had been created over many years: these were the demerger of Garban now ICAP, and the return of a 1.25bn special dividend following the disposal of UBMs three ITV licences to Granada Media for 1.75bn.
Since the demerger the ICAP shares have significantly outperformed the FTSE 100.
In accordance with the requirements of the Act, the UBM Divs Reinv line assumes that the benefits received by shareholders from these two events were reinvested in UBM shares: it shows a 49 per cent decline in shareholder return compared to a 19 per cent decline in the return for the FTSE Media index.
Within this UBM Divs Reinv line the element which relates to the UBM share price decline since 31 December 2000 primarily reflects the severe deterioration in market conditions affecting the groups ongoing US businesses.
The UBM ICAP Capital Return on Deposit line reflects ICAPs outperformance and the monetisation of value represented by the special dividend, and shows an increase in shareholder value of 16 per cent.

Options granted to Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson under the United 1994 Executive Scheme are subject to a performance condition which requires EPS growth to exceed inflation by an average of 2 per cent per annum over a three year period.
At the time of setting up the 1994 Executive Scheme this performance measure was in line with existing market practice.
The performance condition has been met in respect of all outstanding options held by these executive directors under the United 1994 Executive Scheme, which are consequently fully vested.
All options were granted at market value and for no consideration.
Options granted to Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson under the MAI Executive Schemes are not subject to any performance conditions: at the time these schemes were established it was not customary to require performance conditions.
All options were granted at market value of the corresponding MAI shares at the date of grant and were converted into options over shares in the company upon the merger of the company and MAI in 1996.
No consideration was payable for the grant of options under these schemes.
Options granted under the MAI Sharesave scheme and United SAYE scheme are not subject to performance conditions as these are all-employee schemes.
There have been no variations in the terms and conditions of scheme interests during the year.

This condition requires the groups total shareholder return i. e. share price movement and dividends paid, when compared with that of FTSE 100 companies over the three year period, to place the group in at least 50th position within the FTSE 100.
The shares will vest in full at 25th position or above, while 20 per cent of the shares will vest at 50th position.
Shares will be allocated proportionately on a sliding scale between 25th and 50th position.
The scheme rules give discretion to the committee to allow limited re-testing if the condition was met after the third year: no such re-testing is undertaken.
The last awards under the LTIP were made in 2000.
The performance condition was not met in relation to these awards, which will consequently lapse on 3 March 2003.
No further awards will be made.
The value of shares that vested during the year is calculated at 585 pence, the market value on the date on which the shares were transferred to the directors.
Market value of LTIP shares as yet unvested is calculated at 290 pence, the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2002.
Awards becoming exercisable prior to 3 March 2004 were granted under the 1996 SEEPP, which operates in a similar manner to the 2000 SEEPP, except that the matching awards are subject to a longer vesting period up to seven years but no performance conditions are attached.
Notes: Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson gave up cash bonuses that would otherwise have been receivable by them in order to receive awards under the SEEPP.
The bonus was paid to each individuals funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS and used by the FURBS Trustees to purchase shares from the SEEPP Trustees.
A matching award was granted over an equal number of shares.
The table shows the total bonus shares and matching awards.
The bonus shares are included in the directors beneficial interest in shares shown on page 22: the amount used to purchase the bonus shares was included in the directors reported remuneration for the year in which the award was made.
This award comprises 222,487 bonus options and 34,689 matching awards granted to Clive Hollick in exchange for options previously held under the Meridian Broadcasting Executive Share Option Scheme.
These options were granted in exchange for options previously held under the MAI 1989 Purchase Only Share Option Scheme, the rights to which were waived by Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson.
Both the bonus options and an equal number of matching options are exercisable in full.
The SEEPP bonus shares options and matching awards were adjusted to reflect the capital reorganisation which took place on 23 April 2001, whereby every shareholder received 44 B shares and 29 new ordinary shares in place of every 44 ordinary shares previously held.
The market value of the matching awards is calculated at 290 pence per ordinary share, the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2002, and 245 pence per B share.
Changes in directors interests since 31 December 2002 There have been no changes to the interests of directors in UBM shares nor in options over UBM shares between the year end and 28 February 2003.
25 UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT 2002 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION The fees of the chairman and non-executive directors are considered and approved by the board as a whole, having regard to current market practice.
