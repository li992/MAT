Directors remuneration report Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee has been chaired throughout the year by Sir Bruce MacPhail.
Dr DKP Li was the other committee member until 9 December 2002 on which date he resigned and M Grabiner was appointed.
The following information on pages 25 to 27 is not subject to audit procedures: Remuneration policy for the executive directors The committee aims, on behalf of the board, to ensure that the remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the right calibre.
Accordingly, the committee has developed a remuneration policy for executive directors which attempts to align the interests of these executives with those of shareholders by providing remuneration packages which include the following: i Basic salary and benets Basic annual salaries for executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee.
The committee takes into account information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar jobs in a selected group of comparable companies as well as the individual performance of each director.
Benets are provided at a similar level for comparable positions with other companies and include a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance and the annual subscription to professional bodies.
ii Annual bonus Annual discretionary bonuses are awarded on the basis of individual contribution and the companys comparative performance within the property sector.
Whilst recognising continued progress, in particular in relation to the groups major projects, the committee has also had regard for reported financial performance relative to the sector.
Aggregate payments made to the three executive directors receiving bonuses in 2002 were substantially below those made in 2001.
No awards were made under the long term incentive plan nor the deferred bonus plan.
iii Pensions The company operates a money purchase pension scheme with contributions made of 15 per cent of basic salary.
iv Share options The current share option scheme, which was approved by shareholders in May 2000, permits an individual to receive annually an option over shares worth up to 100 per cent of base salary, subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee.
In addition, the remuneration committee may make a separate grant of options following the recruitment of an executive, in which case the limit will be 400 per cent of base salary.
Of the options, 50 per cent are normally exercisable after three years, with the balance becoming available after five years.
The exercise of options is normally subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which currently requires the companys net asset value per ordinary share to outperform the Capital Growth Index of the Investment Property Databank by an average of 3 per cent per annum over a period of at least three years, measured from the start of the financial year in which the grant was made.
To preserve exibility, the remuneration committee has the ability to alter the performance conditions provided that they are considered no less challenging.
Options granted since December 1993 under a previous scheme may normally only be exercised subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which requires the companys net asset value per ordinary share to outperform the index referred to above by 2 per cent per annum over a period of at least three years, also measured from the start of the financial year in which the grant was made.
25 Directors remuneration report continued The above performance conditions, which apply equally to all the directors, were chosen as it was considered that growth in net asset value is the most appropriate method to measure the companys underlying financial performance.
v Long-Term Incentive Plan The company also operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP which was also approved by shareholders in May 2000.
The LTIP grants an individual a right to receive shares worth up to 100 per cent of base salary per annum, subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The value ultimately received will depend upon the satisfaction of performance conditions which currently require the companys performance to be measured by comparing its total shareholder return performance over a single three year period, beginning at the start of the financial year in which the award is made, with the returns achieved by a group of about 25 of the largest property companies in the FTSE All Share Index.
If the company is ranked below median, nothing vests.
At median, 30 per cent of the value vests and vesting then occurs on a sliding scale until 100 per cent of vesting occurs if the company is ranked in the top 15 per cent of the other companies.
In addition, the companys net asset value per ordinary share must outperform the Capital Growth Index of the Investment Property Databank over the three year period.
Of the value which vests, 50 per cent can be received by the individual after three years, with the balance being deferred until after five years.
The above performance conditions, which also apply equally to all the directors, were chosen as it was considered that a combination of a comparison with the performance of other property companies and growth in net asset value is the most appropriate method to measure the companys performance for the purpose of these awards.
It is considered that the policy in respect of directors remuneration for the forthcoming years is unlikely to change from that outlined above.
The committee will, however, keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as outlined in this report, under review.
The committee consults with the company chairman and managing director, as appropriate, with regard to its proposals for the remuneration of the executive directors.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors The remuneration for non-executive directors consists of fees for their services in connection with board and board committee meetings and, where relevant, for additional services such as chairing a board committee.
The current fees were approved by the board in 1997 having taken independent advice.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any bonus or share option schemes.
Service contracts The terms and conditions applicable to the employment of Messrs Butler, Hugill and Phillips, three of the executive directors, are set out in letters from the company dated 10 April 1995, 10 March 1992 and 10 April 1995 respectively.
In all three cases, the employment with the company may be terminated by either party giving not less than six months written notice.
There are no provisions for compensation for loss of ofce.
There are no written agreements with E Bernerd, the other executive director, or any of the non-executive directors.
26 Total shareholder return The following graph charts the total cumulative shareholder return TSR of the company for the five year period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2002 compared with the TSR relating to the FTSE 250 index and the FTSE Real Estate index.

Fees of 2,000 2001 47,000 have also been paid to Ariel SA, a Swiss based company of which BJ Webb is president, for services provided to Global Switch, now a subsidiary undertaking and previously a joint venture investment of the company.
In common with the practice at that time, the options granted in December 1993 were not subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The exercise of all other options is dependent upon the performance of the group.
The options granted in July 2000 and May 2001 were granted under the terms of the current scheme and the options granted in September 1997 and March 1999 were granted under the terms of the previous scheme.
The performance conditions relating to these schemes are summarised above.
The mid market value of the companys shares on The London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2001 was 267.5p per share and was 302p per share at 31 December 2002.
The market value range during the year was between 239p and 379p per share.

No allocations were made in either 2001 or 2002.
Deferred Bonus Plan Awards have been made to directors under the terms of a deferred bonus plan whereby part of the directorsannual bonus is used to purchase ordinary shares of the company: the shares are then released in equal instalments over a three year period and forfeited if the directors resign from the company.
The shares held under the plan at 31 December 2002 which are still to be released to the directors are as follows: 1999 2000 award award Total E Bernerd 6,932 9,636 16,568 RE Butler 5,201 9,606 14,807 WN Hugill 5,201 9,606 14,807 D Phillips 5,201 9,606 14,807 No awards were made for 2001 or 2002.
