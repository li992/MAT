The Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration policy applying to the Executive Directors and key executives and determines the levels of salaries, bonus payments, share options, pension contributions and other benefits in kind.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-executive Directors of the Company: Sir Michael Beavis Chairman, Dr D R Ebsworth appointed on 11 April 2002, Mr R S Harris and Dr K R Mansford.
In addition, Dr A N Karabelas served on the committee until 27 March 2002.
The Remuneration Committee seeks advice from Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive remuneration and share schemes consultancy.
Halliwell Consulting provides the Company with advice in relation to remuneration and share schemes and provides no other services.
The Remuneration Committee confirmed their appointment during the year under review.
When the Remuneration Committee is considering matters concerning key executives below Board level advice is sought from Mr M Ashton Chief Executive Officer.
During the year the Company complied with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the recommendations of the Combined Code on Directors remuneration annexed to the Listing Rules for listed companies issued by the Financial Services Authority.
In accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the following sections of the Remuneration Report are subject to audit:- Directors Remuneration, Pensions, Conditional Holdings, Options over shares in the Company and SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share bonus plan.
The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committees policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys comparator group: Base Salary Annual Bonus Potential Share Incentives Between Median Upper Quartile Upper Quartile Lower Quartile The international nature of some of the companies constituting the comparator group means that the Company cannot provide the level of share incentives within current UK corporate governance best practice offered by these companies to their executives.
In order to remain attractive to the type of executive talent required to grow the Company, the Remuneration Committee has determined to set the base salary between the median and the start of the upper quartile.
However in calculating the level of potential annual rises in base salary the Remuneration Committee looks at the median on median rise in the comparator group to ensure that over a period of time the level of base salary does not rise towards the upper quartile.
In order to ensure that there is a significant performance element to the package, the Remuneration Committee has implemented a challenging bonus arrangement providing significant reward for exceptional performance coupled with competitive performance option grants in terms of the UK market.
In line with this policy, the Remuneration Committees view is that shareholders interests are best served by increasing the element of performance compensation.
Consequently, in 2002, it has increased the bonus potential from 50% to 75% with the intention to increase the maximum bonus potential to 100% in the future and has been providing performance option grants each year.
If option grants to executives of the comparator companies and the Company are valued using Black-Scholes methodology and the cash value of these options added to base salary and bonus to give a total cash value for the package, the Company is positioned between the lower quartile and the median.
remuneration 38 report SkyePharma annual report 2002 SkyePharma annual report 2002 For the year to 31 December 2002, the charts below demonstrate the amount of annual compensation which is performance related and the effect of the Remuneration Committees policy of maintaining median salary level increases whilst increasing the bonus potential available to executives for improved performance.
The substantial changes impacting on international pharmaceutical companies over the past 24 months coupled with the increasingly international nature of the Companys operations has resulted in a review by the Remuneration Committee of the constituents of the comparator group.
Following this review, a new comparator group has been established which it is intended will be used to benchmark elements of the Companys remuneration in 2003 and subsequent years.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee when determining base salary are:- the median rise in the level of base salary for a similar position within the comparator group the individual Executive Directors performance the responsibilities of the respective Executive Directors Performance Bonus Bonuses are paid, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, in recognition of the Directors contribution to the success of the Company and the achievement of specified objectives.
In 2002 the primary performance targets were:- move towards profitability divisional financial targets achievement of pre-determined operational milestones primarily related to the signing of new deals the average share appreciation performance of six selected companies compared to the Company 1 Powderject, Inhale Therapeutics, Aradigm, Alkermes, Emisphere and CIMA The annual bonus for approximately 25 senior executives is provided through the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
The Plan is designed to align the interests of participants with those of shareholders by encouraging executives to build up and maintain shareholdings which are meaningful in the context of their remuneration.
The Plan currently requires a deferral of 50% of each annual net bonus in the form of Company shares Executive Shares.
The Company currently provides one Matching Share for each Executive Share acquired calculated on the gross bonus deferral.
The Matching Shares will be released after three years provided that the executive remains in employment and the corresponding Executive Shares have not been sold.
The release of Matching Shares is not subject to additional performance criteria because the Remuneration Committee believes that the performance conditions which have to be satisfied for the payment of any bonus are sufficiently challenging to justify the total bonus payment and additional Matching Shares.
The bonuses for the Executive Directors were: Element I R Gowrie-Smith M Ashton D Nicholson Executive Chairman Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Bonus 143,726 178,815 91,962 %age of Salary 34% 49% 49% Upper Quartile Bonus %age 45% 40% 40% of Salary comparator group Value of Matching Shares 71,863 89,408 45,981 Currently executives who remain in employment with the Company have retained all their Executive Shares.
For 2002 the maximum bonus paid was 49% and 73% of base salary including the value of Matching Shares.
1 Renamed Nektar Therapeutics on 15.01.03 remuneration 40 report continued SkyePharma annual report 2002 SkyePharma annual report 2002 The performance measures for bonus payments are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company and therefore that they continue to remain challenging.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the types of performance measures used for the Year 2002 bonus remain appropriate for the Year 2003 bonus.
For 2003, the maximum bonus payable will be 100% of salary for exceptional performance.
It should be noted that the increased bonus potential has been mirrored by an increase in the level of performance required and therefore a corresponding increase in the difficulty of reaching the required level.
Option Schemes Executive Directors and senior executives participate in the SkyePharma Executive Share Option Scheme, the European and North American Scheme and the SkyePharma PLC 1999 Share Option Scheme as appropriate.
Element I R Gowrie-Smith M Ashton D Nicholson Executive Chairman Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Option Grant %age of Salary 200% 200% 200% Lower Quartile Option Grant 278% 278% 200% comparator group The Remuneration Committee has set the level of option grants to the Executive Directors of the Company at the lower quartile compared to the comparator group.
This level is competitive within the UK market and is acceptable to UK institutions but is relatively low in comparison to the US components of the comparator group.
The performance condition on option grants to senior executives is that vesting is dependent upon total 3 shareholder return performance against the comparator group.
No options will vest for below median performance.
50% of options will vest for median comparative performance with 100% of options vesting for upper quartile comparative performance straight line vesting between the two points.
The Remuneration Committee believes that comparative total shareholder return is the most appropriate measure to ensure that shareholders and Executive Directors interests are aligned.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the adoption of a comparative total shareholder return measure encourages senior executives to improve the Companys profitability and earnings per share and also on a comparative basis to deliver at least median share price performance against the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee satisfies itself that the recorded total shareholder return is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
All options granted to executives during 2002 have been made on this basis and vest after three years on a scale between 0% and 100% depending on the Companys performance relative to the performance of the comparator group.
To assess whether or not the performance condition has been met, the Remuneration Committee measures the companys total shareholder return over a fixed 3 year period from date of grant to prospective date of vesting in comparison to that of the comparator 4 group.
These calculations shall be independently tested and audited by the Companys advisors, Halliwell Consulting.
If the stringent performance requirements are not met at the end of the performance period, all options will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee will be reviewing all the Companys share incentive and retention arrangements during 2003 in light of the proposed changes to the accounting treatment of options.
It is the objective of the Remuneration Committee whilst taking into account shareholders interests both in terms of dilution and Profit & Loss cost to ensure that the Companys policy in respect of share arrangements is competitive in the market place.
3 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the 41 three year performance period capital growth and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively with the company achieving the best return ranked number 1.
4 The calculation of total shareholder return shall be in accordance with the principles set out in The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Total Shareholder Return performance graph The graph below shows the TSR performance of the company in comparison to the FTSE Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology index and the comparator group over the past 5 years:- Total Shareholder Return from 1 January 1997 % FTSE Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Sector 300 SkyePharma PLC Comparator Group Index 250 200 150 100 50 0 -50 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 The Remuneration Committee consider the FTSE Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology index a relevant index for total shareholder return comparison disclosure required under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 as the index members represent the broad range of UK quoted pharmaceutical companies.
As detailed earlier in the report the Company considers its TSR performance for option grants in comparison to that of a comparator group.
Share Purchase Plan The Companys intention is to encourage share ownership at all levels of the business, thereby aligning all employees interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly, the Company introduced the SkyePharma International Share Purchase Plan the Plan which was launched in February 2002.
All employees including all the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Plan under the arrangements introduced in their respective countries.
The Plan complements the Option Schemes as it is more focused on employee retention.
Under the Plan, employees are given the opportunity of purchasing Company shares up to a maximum of 1,500 per year or local currency equivalent.
The Company will then match each share purchased with an award of Matching Shares.
The maximum ratio of Matching Shares to employee purchased shares is two to one although the current ratio adopted by the Company is one Matching Share for each share purchased.
The Matching Shares are subject to a three year holding period.
Normally, the Matching Shares will only be released at the end of this holding period if the corresponding employee purchased shares have not been sold and the employee is still in employment at that time.
The release of Matching Shares is not subject to additional performance criteria in line with UK Inland Revenue rules and normal UK practice.
As at 31 December 2002, 120 employees have elected to participate in the Plan and have purchased 132,282 shares.
The Company has also provisionally awarded 132,282 Matching Shares.
Pension The Company makes contributions into individual personal pension schemes for Executive Directors at a defined percentage of salary, excluding bonus and other forms of remuneration.
The Executive Directors do not participate in any Company sponsored pension plans and are expected to make their own pension arrangements.
The Company contributions for 2002 in respect of Executive Directors are:- Element I R Gowrie-Smith M Ashton D Nicholson Executive Chairman Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Contribution 53,232 45,850 23,580 %age of Salary 12.5% 12.5% 12.5% remuneration 42 report continued SkyePharma annual report 2002 SkyePharma annual report 2002 Directors Service Contracts All Executive Directors contracts are for a fixed period of one year from date of appointment, and will continue thereafter unless terminated by at least 12 months written notice.

However, all Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss in accordance with general legal principles in the event of their cessation of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control.
