Remuneration report Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year, all of whom are independent non-executive directors, were, Sir Chips Keswick, Mr B L Staples and, from 1 December 2002, Mr J W Leng.
The committee consulted the Chairman, Mr G J Allen, on various matters and the Chief Executive, Mr M J Lamb, regarding the remuneration of the other executive directors.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Mr T J Slack, who acts as its secretary.
Deloitte & Touche, was appointed by the committee to provide general advice on executive directors remuneration to the committee.
Deloitte & Touche was also engaged to provide other services to the Company during the year, namely to advise on senior employee remuneration and to conduct due diligence work in relation to certain possible corporate transactions.
Statement of policy Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Board and the policy is to pay an appropriate level of remuneration on a comparative basis for their work on the Board and its committees.
There were no increases in non-executive directors remuneration during the year.
No part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company and they do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company.
Non-executive directors do not take part in any Board discussion or vote relating to their own remuneration.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for an initial period of three years.
After their initial term, non-executive directors appointments are reviewed on an annual basis.
The appointment of the Chairman is renewable on an annual basis.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation or removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or compensation in relation to the early termination of any non-executive directors appointment.
There is a provision to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are as follows: Date of letter of appointment Unexpired term as at 31 December 2002 Mr G J Allen: As Non-executive Director 10.05.01 1 year 5 months As Chairman 06.06.02 5.5 months Sir Chips Keswick 07.05.02 5.5 months Mr J W Leng 06.11.02 2 years and 11 months Mr B L Staples 10.06.01 5 months Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
The normal approach is to set basic pay at median levels for each executive position and to allow them to earn higher levels of remuneration through performance related elements of the remuneration package.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements and participation in an executive share option scheme and a long term incentive plan.
Performance based remuneration under the annual bonus arrangements and long term incentive plan combined is worth up to a maximum level of 110% of basic salary on an annual basis for Mr M J Lamb and Mr T J Slack, and up to 90% in the case of Mr R B Pointon.
In addition, executive share options were granted in the year subject to performance conditions and represent a potentially significant element of total remuneration.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and has reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK groups of a similar size and complexity.
In this connection, Deloitte & Touche have prepared comparative studies for the committee on an annual basis in recent years.
Consistent with our policy, the executive directors, Mr M J Lamb, Mr R B Pointon and Mr T J Slack, have rolling service contracts subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
All such contracts allow the Company to elect to make payment in lieu of notice but do not include any other specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
The contracts automatically terminate at normal retirement age, which is 60 for each of the executive directors.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age are as follows: Date of service contract Period to normal retirement age as at 31 December 2002 Mr M J Lamb 1 February 1999 18 years Mr R B Pointon 1 February 1999 4 years 2 months Mr T J Slack 1 February 1999 3 years 9 months The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minima, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
32 Remuneration report Remuneration report continued Executive directors are awarded annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the challenging targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
The policy is for annual bonus targets to relate to corporate financial measures, such as profit, cash generation, relative share price performance against the FTSE Engineering Sector Index and to the achievement of strategic objectives.
The bonus maximum for 2002 was 60% 2001: 50% of salary for Mr M J Lamb and Mr T J Slack, to each of whom bonuses of 26.5% 2001: 28% were paid, and 40% 2001: 30% for Mr R B Pointon, to whom a bonus of 15.9% 2001: 17% was paid.
Annual bonuses are non-pensionable except in the case of Mr R B Pointon.
The other executive directors agreed to substitute higher potential bonuses for pensionability of future annual bonuses in 2000 but it was not thought reasonable to force a change in existing terms upon Mr R B Pointon, who elected to retain his then existing 30% pensionable bonus arrangement.
The policy is to make all new appointments on the basis of non-pensionable bonus arrangements.
Annual bonus arrangements for 2003 are structured and targeted in the same manner as those applicable in relation to 2002.
Each executive director is eligible for the grant of executive share options awarded under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme.
Options granted under this scheme are subject to performance conditions on exercise, currently a tiered performance condition related to above inflation growth in earnings per share over three financial years.
This measure has been chosen because it reflects real improvement in earnings and is well recognised and understood as an appropriate performance measure for executive share options.
For options granted over shares worth up to one times salary, vesting requires growth in earnings per share of at least 6% above the rate of increase in the UK Retail Price Index RPI over a three year performance period.
The hurdle doubles to 12% growth above RPI for awards worth between one and two times salary, and rises to 24% for awards between two and three times salary.
The Remuneration Committee has a policy of awarding annual share option grants.
Grants at the maximum level would be worth up to three times salary.
The level of grants is individually determined for each executive director and the awards made during the year were below the maximum.
Details of share options granted in the year are set out on page 37.
Options are priced at full market value without discount.
There is no retesting and options will therefore lapse if applicable performance conditions are not met in the relevant three year performance period.
The Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme is available to executive directors and other senior executives of the Group.
Outstanding options granted under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme before September 2001 were subject to performance related conditions and only become exercisable if growth in earnings per share during any three consecutive financial years over a period of ten years exceeds growth in RPI by at least 6%.
This was chosen as the appropriate measure at a time when grants were limited to an aggregate level of shares for all outstanding share options of four times salary based on the option price.
The method adopted in 2002 to assess whether performance conditions attached to options under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme were satisfied involved adjusting basic earnings per share for goodwill amortisation and for exceptional items and rationalisation restructuring costs.
The result, which was reported as adjusted earnings per share in the 2001 Annual Report, was believed to be more representative of underlying performance than basic earnings per share and was further adjusted for share option purposes to eliminate the impact of foreign income dividends paid in 1997 and 1998.
Such foreign income dividends are not expected to reoccur and an adjustment for them was made to ensure consistency over the performance measurement period.
The auditor reviewed the reported adjusted earnings per share and confirmed that the adjustments made were fair and reasonable.
This approach is consistent with the prior year.
The outcome was that performance conditions attached to share options were not satisfied with respect to the three year performance period ending 31 December 2001.
Apart from those options granted in 1996, performance conditions have not been met in relation to any executive share options.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option 1985 Scheme, which operated between 1985 and 1995 and was the forerunner to the current share option scheme, were not subject to performance conditions.
This was in line with comparable share option schemes set up in the 1980s when shareholders approved the scheme.
A new long term incentive plan LTIP was approved at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 17 May 2002.
The LTIP allows cash awards to senior executives, including executive directors, up to a maximum potential value of 50% of salary for each year of participation.
The policy is to make an annual LTIP award to each executive director up to one year prior to his or her normal retirement date.
LTIP awards to executive directors are subject to performance conditions related to the economic profit of the Group as a whole.
Economic profit was chosen because it combines profitability with return on capital in a single measure and is being used across the Group as a management decision-making tool.
Any amounts payable to executive directors will be based upon net operating profit after tax of the Group derived from the audited financial statements and adjusted as appropriate for goodwill.
A capital charge will then be applied at the weighted average cost of capital for the Group to invested capital including all goodwill.
The performance measurement period is normally three years but the scheme allowed for a two year performance period in respect of initial LTIP awards made in 2002.
Such initial awards and standard three year awards were made to executive directors in 2002, details of which are shown in the table on page 38.
The net of tax value of LTIP payments earned by the executive directors will be invested in market purchases of the Companys ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are to be made through an employee trust and held for a three year period.
After that period, an executive director will receive a matching award of one additional share for every four.
LTIP payments earned by executive directors are subject to performance conditions and must normally be put into the deferred share plan, pursuant to which no further performance conditions are attached to the one for four matching share awards.
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Group's UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20 per cent below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees generally to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
The executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan covering UK employees of certain operations.
In May 2003 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3000 and 1.2% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2002.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Each of the executive directors also participate in the plan by making the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.

Pension entitlement Executive directors participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 60, although they may elect to receive a pension at any time after age 57 without a discount.
On retirement, pensions are guaranteed for five years, and on death a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension.

The graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return over the five years ended 31 December 2002 with that for the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE Engineering Sector Index.
The FTSE Engineering Sector Index was chosen as a comparator index because it offered a reasonable reflection upon the relative performance of the Company and is used as one of the performance measures for the purpose of annual bonuses.
In 2002 the Company outperformed against that index by 36%.
The FTSE All Share Index was chosen as it is a relevant broad equity market index.
