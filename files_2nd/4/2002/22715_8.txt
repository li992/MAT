REMUNERATION COMMITTEES REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 This report is prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the various requirements of the UK Listing Authority and the Companies Act.
In accordance with the regulations the following sections of this report have been subject to audit: Directors Share Options Long Term Incentive Plan Directors emoluments and pensions The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee were approved by the Board and include responsibility to make recommendations, for approval by the full Board, for the Companys share option schemes, bonus schemes and remuneration for all Executive Directors and key senior executives.
The Committee is made up solely of Non-executive Directors and currently comprises R D Clegg Chairman, L G Elson and H H Newman.
P E Owen was a member of the Committee until he became Executive Chairman on 25 November 2002.
REMUNERATION STRATEGY The Company operates an integrated remuneration strategy that is based on a set of core principles whilst retaining sufficient flexibility to remain effective in response to changing market and business conditions.
The policy is aimed at ensuring that the Company is in a position to attract highquality candidates to Director and executive positions from both the Lloyds and general insurance markets and from a wider sphere where appropriate.
The policy intends to ensure that, once employed, the Directors and executives are aligned with the goals of Shareholders and are motivated to deliver superior results.
In attracting and retaining suitable candidates, the Company seeks to maintain a position in the market paying annual salaries at or around the market median.
In sustaining this position, on a regular basis the Company obtains and analyses a range of salary survey data and, from time to time, seeks the advice of remuneration and recruitment professionals to augment the surveys.
In addition to taking a competitive position on annual salaries, the Company offers a benefits package that is pitched above the market median and typically includes a non-contributory pension scheme, a fully expensed motorcar or a cash allowance, and permanent health and medical insurance.
The Companys strategy is to establish rolling contracts with 12 months notice from either party.
In order to align the Directors and executives with the goals of Shareholders and to underpin a high achievement culture the Company has in place the following schemes: An Executive Share Option Scheme designed to encourage performance that optimises shareholder value.
An Executive Bonus Scheme combining annual Company financial performance based on the achievement of profit targets and the personal performance of the Director or executive in achieving objectives and promoting Company strategy.
A Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which is designed to motivate Directors and executives to develop and execute strategies that deliver sustained and superior business performance over a three-year period.
The Companys broad policy with regard to the annual remuneration of Executive Directors is to achieve a 50 50 split between guaranteed and variable remuneration.
This is in line with the advice of remuneration specialists and creates an environment within which contributions to shareholder value can be properly recognised and rewarded.
The Committee does not anticipate any material policy changes in the foreseeable future.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Non-executive Directors are entitled to an annual fee and reimbursement of their expenses.
The fee is reviewed annually, with the aid of external consultants, and the level is set to reflect the time devoted to the Companys affairs.
There are no contractual termination payments.

He was appointed Chairman on 23 January 1996, a position from which he stepped down on 12 April 2002.

Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 19 REMUNERATION COMMITTEES REPORT CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 SHARE OPTION SCHEMES There have been no options granted during the year under the 1995, 1996 and 1997 Share Option Schemes.
Only those options granted prior to 1 January 1998 have met the performance criteria under these schemes.
During the year, options were granted under the 2001 Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
As stated in the April Prospectus the Committee considered that, as the prices of the current share options were substantially below the current market price, in order to motivate the Executive Directors properly, options would be granted at levels of up to three times salary initially and thereafter, along with other senior executives, Executive Directors would be considered for annual grants of options of up to one times salary.
Grants of options were made on 31 May at 50p each, compared to the market price of 62p, under a Shareholder resolution passed at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 20 May.
The options vest 50% after three years, 25% after four years and the final 25% after five years.
Options are only exercisable if the equity market capitalisation exceeds 300m and is maintained at that level for a period of 30 days.
In the event of a change of control the vesting and performance restrictions fall away.
N A Utley received 1,500,000 options and M G Dawson received 1,476,000 options.
The Committee adopted this performance target because it felt that a near threefold increase in the market valuation of the Company since the announcement of the Cash Placing and Placing and Open Offer was a challenging target, achievement of which would be very much to the benefit of the Shareholders.
A target relating directly to increase in profits or in earnings per share or in total shareholder return was not thought to be appropriate as the Company was just emerging from a major restructuring.
On appointment to the Company, J Morley was granted options over 313,433 shares at a price of 67p per share.
These options have the same performance and vesting terms as described above.
P E Owen was granted options over 974,025 shares at a price of 77p per share, on 30 December 2002.
The options set out below were granted at nil cost.
The highest and lowest prices during the year were 147.50p and 36.00p.
On 31 May 2002 B M Watkins was too close to retirement to be granted share options: instead he was granted a deferred cash bonus represented by 150,000 shares and he will be entitled to the value of that number of shares at the middle market price at the date of his retirement.
Mr Owen was due to be awarded share options at the date of his appointment as Executive Chairman, however, the Company was in a close period at the time.
Options were subsequently granted at the same level of three times salary but the share price had risen in the meantime.
Taxable compensation for the lower number of options and the higher option price will be payable as and when the options are exercised.
EXECUTIVE BONUS SCHEME The Executive Bonus Scheme is designed to achieve superior Company performance by motivating Directors and senior executives to optimise both the overall financial performance of the Company and to achieve personal objectives and targets.
The targeted return on capital employed is 15% after tax, over the insurance cycle with the target being adjusted each year depending on position within the insurance cycle.
This years personal objectives were set by the Remuneration Committee.
Bonus recommendations for each Executive Director were made to the Committee by the Company Chairman on the basis of the overall financial performance of the Company against return on capital employed targets for the year and on the Directors personal contribution and achievement.
For the 2002 year, half of the Directors bonus was dependent upon the achievement of Company financial performance and half on his personal performance against objectives and targets and contribution to corporate strategy.
With regard to the portion of the bonus related to the financial performance of the Company, Directors could achieve a bonus level between 100% and 125% of basic salary if the Company exceeded its targeted return on capital employed.
In the case of 2002 the 125% level was achieved.
The 2002 year will be the final year in which the Company operates the Executive Bonus Scheme under its existing format.
From 2003 an amended Scheme and the Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme, details of which are set out below, will replace it.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 21 REMUNERATION COMMITTEES REPORT CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 AMENDED EXECUTIVE BONUS SCHEME Amended executive bonus arrangements will come into force for the 2003 financial year and onwards.
In most respects the Executive Bonus Scheme will operate as previously: however, from 2003 the bonus recommendations for Directors will be based on a split of three-quarters of the overall bonus being based upon the Companys financial performance and one-quarter of the bonus will be based on the personal achievements of the Director.
This is felt to be a more appropriate balance in aligning the performance of Directors with the interests of Shareholders.
For each Director, the maximum bonus payable will be capped at 100% of base salary.
Whilst the bonus recommendations will be made on this basis, in making awards, the Remuneration Committee will take into account overall corporate performance and the total contribution of each Director.
Bonus levels can range from zero, if a targeted minimum Company financial performance hurdle is not achieved, to 100% if financial targets are exceeded combined with an outstanding personal contribution.
These changes to the Executive Bonus Scheme will be implemented for the first time in respect of the 2003 financial year with bonuses paid in the Spring of 2004.
EXECUTIVE DEFERRED BONUS SCHEME At the last Annual General Meeting, the Shareholders approved the introduction of a new executive bonus scheme for Executive Directors and other senior employees the Cox Insurance Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme.
The Remuneration Committee was advised on the establishment of the Deferred Bonus Scheme by: 1 Mr Denis Walker, an independent HR consultant.
Mr Walker has subsequently joined the Group as Chief Operations Officer in the Retail Division.
2 Slaughter and May, Solicitors, in relation to the rules of the scheme and the plan.
Slaughter and May are the Groups main corporate legal advisers.
They advise the Company on a regular basis and in particular advised on the Cash Placing and Placing and Open Offer and the Syndicated Bank Finance and the Lloyds Agreement in the Spring of 2002.
The Scheme enables Directors and senior executives to exchange for shares or share options a portion of any bonus received under the Executive Bonus Scheme.
These shares or options will be matched by the Company with bonus shares or options.
The ratio of matching or bonus shares made available by the Company will be determined annually by the Remuneration Committee.
For 2003, the first year of operation, the ratio of matching has been agreed at one for two and there are no additional performance criteria.
A summary of the rules of the scheme is set out below.
Summary of the main provisions of the Cox Insurance Deferred Bonus Scheme the Scheme as approved at the AGM on 11 July 2002 Administration of the Scheme A Committee of the Board of Directors, the majority of whose members will be Non-executive Directors, will administer the Scheme.
Eligibility Any employee including an Executive Director of any member of the Group is eligible to participate in the Scheme.
A Director may only participate if he is required by his employment to devote substantially the whole of his working time to his duties to the Group.
Invitation to participate An Eligible Employee who accepts an invitation to participate must agree to forgo a part of the cash bonus to which he might otherwise be entitled.
Grant of Awards Under the Scheme an award to an Eligible Employee will be in the form of a Bonus Award and a Matching Award.
No awards may be granted more than ten years after the date of the first awards under the Scheme are granted.
The Committee shall only grant awards in the six weeks following the date on which the results of the Group for the financial year are announced to the Stock Exchange unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
Awards are personal to the Participant and his personal representatives and may not be transferred.
Awards Awards may be granted either by the Committee or by the Trustee of the employee trust.
However the Trustee may not grant an Award without the agreement of the Committee beforehand.
An Award consists of the right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company in respect of the element of bonus deferred, which will be matched by the Company on an up to one for two basis.
The form of the Award may be either an option or a contingent right to shares.
The number of shares comprised in the Bonus Award and a Matching Award will be determined in accordance with the basis set out in the invitation but may not exceed: a in the case of a Bonus Award, such number of Shares as have an aggregate Market Value on the fourth Dealing Day following the announcement of the results to the Stock Exchange as equals the amount of the bonus which the Eligible Executive has agreed to forgo: and b in the case of a Matching Award, such number of Shares as the Committee may decide not exceeding one-half of the number of Shares subject to the Bonus Award.
Each Matching Award may be subject to one or more performance targets, which will determine whether, and to what extent, a Participant will become entitled to receive the Shares.
The Committee has the discretion to vary the Performance Targets or other conditions if it feels that it is fair and reasonable to make such a change.
The Grantor must inform the Participant of any change in the Performance Target or other conditions which may apply to his Award.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 22 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 The Performance Period of a Matching Award will be decided by the Committee at the time of the grant.
The Performance Period will not be less than two years starting with either: a the Award Date: or b the financial year of the Company in which the Award Date falls.
The Performance Period may differ for each target where the Matching Award is subject to more than one Performance Target.
Vested Shares Under the Scheme the Vested Shares of a Matching Award are the Shares which may be released to the Participant or in respect of which he may exercise his Award, determined, where relevant, according to the Performance Target.
If a Participant ceases to be employed by any member of the Group before the Certification Date, i. e. the date when it is determined whether any Performance Target has been met, if there is any change of control of the Company, or the Company goes into liquidation before the Certification Date, then the number of Vested Shares will be time apportioned in accordance with the formula outlined in the Scheme Rules.
Exercise of Awards Awards may be exercised in whole or in part, and to the extent that an Award has not been previously exercised, it may be exercised again.
Awards may not be exercised if they have lapsed under any Scheme Rule.
Awards may not be exercised and shares may not be released to a Participant during a restricted period, except with the consent of the Committee or any other person nominated by the Committee.
If an Award lapses as a result of a restricted period, the Committee may extend the period within which the Participant may exercise the Award until three months after the end of the restricted period.
Shares Application will be made for the listing of any new shares issued under the Scheme.
Such shares will rank equally with shares in the Company then in issue save as regards any rights attaching to the shares by reference to a record date prior to the issue of such shares.
Termination of employment If a Participant ceases to be employed by any member of the Group he shall always be entitled to the benefit of his Bonus Award.
If a Participant ceases so to be employed, his Matching Award will lapse unless: a he ceases to be employed by reason of death, permanent ill health, permanent injury or permanent disability: b the Company or business in which the Participant works ceases to be owned or operated by the Group: c the Committee decides otherwise for any other reason at its discretion.
If the Participant ceases to be employed for one of these reasons then, after the Certification Date, any Vested Shares the subject of a Matching Award will be released or may be exercised in accordance with the Scheme Rules.
If a Participant ceases to be employed by any member of the Group by reason of death, or dies at a time when any relevant right has not lapsed, then its period for exercise will be extended from 6 to 12 months.
Change of control Special circumstances apply if there is a change of control in the Company, a court approved arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985, or a winding-up of the Company.
Bonus Awards will be released after any of the relevant events outlined happens.
Bonus Awards will be exercisable within specified periods after the relevant event occurring.
Vested Shares will be released after the relevant event occurring, in accordance with the Scheme Rules.
No Awards will be released or will become exercisable if the Company is under the control of another company, the Shareholder of the Company prior to the change of control will immediately afterwards own at least 50% of the shares in that other company, the participants are offered compensation which the Committee considers to be fair and reasonable, and the Committee decides these provisions will apply.
Variation of capital In the event of a variation of the Companys share capital or in such circumstances as the Board considers appropriate, the Board may adjust the number of Shares over which awards have been granted.
Amendments and termination The Rules of the Scheme may be amended by the Committee in any way.
No amendment to the advantage of employees or Participants may, however, be made without prior consent of the Shareholders of the Company in a general meeting except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the Scheme and amendments to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for Participants or for any member of the Group.
No amendment will prejudice the subsisting rights of any Participants under the Scheme except with the prior consent of each Participant so affected.
The Board must notify Participants in writing of any change which affects their rights.
The Board may end the Scheme at any time.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 23 REMUNERATION COMMITTEES REPORT CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 Limits The nominal amount of shares issued by the Company when aggregated with the number of new shares issued or issuable pursuant to rights granted in the previous ten years under any other share option or share incentive scheme made available by the Group, may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The nominal amount of shares issued by the Company when aggregated with the number of new shares issued or issuable pursuant to rights granted in the previous ten years under any other share option or share incentive scheme made available by the Group in respect of discretionary schemes, may not exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
THE LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN At the last Annual General Meeting, in addition to the Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme, the Shareholders also approved the introduction of a new long term incentive plan, the Cox Insurance Executive Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee in respect of the LTIP were the same as for the Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme.
The Plan is designed to focus performance on creating sustained but accelerated shareholder value by the achievement of a stretching, cumulative, three-year profit target for the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004.
If the target is achieved or exceeded a Retail Profit Pool will be established and Directors and senior executives will be eligible to receive a cash award that will be payable over a three-year period following the achievement of the profit target.
A bonus pool of 2m will be created for achieving the base line cumulative profit of 150m plus 20% on any additional profit over this figure, up to a profit of 190m and 10% of any profit beyond 190m.
The Committee has agreed the allocation of basic cash awards from the Retail Profit Pool and has granted Messrs Utley, Owen, Morley and Watkins 22%, 20%, 8% and 8% respectively with 32% split amongst the Retail executives and the remaining 10% held at the Committees discretion.
During the Summer it became clear that a Commercial Run-Off Pool, as set out in the summary of rules below, was not a viable concept and consequently Messrs Dawson and Lange have not been invited to participate in the LTIP.
Good leavers will receive a pro-rata payment in 2005 or earlier in the event of a change of control.
In the event of a change of control of the Company taking place before 31 December 2004, to reflect the immediate release of shareholder value, a Sale Compensation Pool will replace the Retail Profit Pool.
The sum available in the Sale Compensation Pool will be determined by the price per share paid by a new owner but there will be no Compensation Pool at a sale share price of less than 68.5p per share.
This share price reflects the same target market value of the Company as used for the share option grant 300m discounted by 12.5% pa, representing the Companys view of the required return on capital.
The compensation pool will be 5% of the value achieved by the sale over the threshold payment for a share price up to 1.00, plus 6% of the value between 1.00 and 1.10, 7% up to 1.20, 8% up to 1.30, 7% up to 1.40, 6% up to 1.50 and 5% thereafter, subject to the total compensation pool being not more than 2.5% of the equity value of the Company.
As with the Retail Profit Pool, the Committee has agreed the allocation of awards from the Sale Compensation Pool.
The allocations reflect both the lost opportunity for each Director to earn a bonus related to the cumulative profit target and the prominence of the roles that would be performed by each Director in a transfer of ownership and the expected contribution that would be made to the process.
However, the Committee will retain a proportion of the Compensation Pool for allocation to augment awards to Directors and senior executives who have made exceptional contributions.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, agreed allocations from the Sale Compensation Pool are as follows.
For illustrative purposes, minimum allocations at sale prices of 90p, 100p and 110p are set out for each director: J Morley At each of the share prices above, Mr Morley is guaranteed a minimum allocation of 160,000.
P E Owen At a sale price of 90p per share, Mr Owen is guaranteed an allocation of 1,043,000: at a sale price of 100p per share 1,906,000 and at a sale price of 110p per share 3,269,000.
B M Watkins At each of the share prices above, Mr Watkins is guaranteed a minimum allocation of 160,000.
N A Utley At a sale price of 90p per share, Mr Utley is guaranteed a minimum allocation of 702,300: at a sale price of 100p per share 940,000 and at a sale price of 110p per share 1,105,640.
Retail executives At each of the share prices above, a group of key Retail executives are guaranteed a combined total minimum allocation of 640,000.
Discretionary sums At a sale price of 90p per share, the Committee would have a discretionary sum available of 347,700.
At a sale price of 100p per share, the Committee would have a discretionary sum available of 675,000.
At a sale price of 110p per share, the Committee would have a discretionary sum available of 882,360.
These sums will be allocated to any participant other than PE Owen, based on the criteria described earlier.
A summary of the Long Term Incentive Plan rules is set out below.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 24 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 Summary of the main provisions of the Cox Insurance Long Term Incentive Plan the Plan as approved at the AGM on 11 July 2002 Administration of the Plan A Committee of the Board of Directors, the majority of whose members will be Non-executive Directors, will administer the Plan.
Eligibility Any senior executive of any member of the Group who is required to devote substantially the whole of his working time to his duties to the Group.
Nature of Awards Each Award comprises a Basic Award and a Discretionary Award.
A Basic Award is the right to receive a cash payment in specified circumstances.
A Discretionary Award is the right to be considered for an additional cash payment whenever a Basic Award is paid, but may be nil.
In the case of the retail lines business, payment will be based on achieving or exceeding a cumulative profit of 150m over the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004.
In the case of the commercial business, payment will be based upon a part of the cumulative profit over the same period attributable to the run-off of that business.
The Board has yet to decide the amount of that profit.
On a change of control of the Company, the cumulative profit targets will be cancelled and replaced by a compensation pool based on the equity value of the Company over 211m.
The Remuneration Committee will have discretion as to the allocation of individual Basic and Discretionary Awards.
Grant and payment of Awards Under the Plan the Company must give written notice to each Eligible Executive to whom a Basic Award has been granted of the terms of that Award, including whether it is made in respect of both the Group Retail Profit Pool and the Commercial Run-Off Pool.
The Company may grant the recipient of a Basic Award different percentages in respect of different Pools: the recipient of a Basic Award must be granted a Discretionary Award.
Under the Plan, as soon as possible after 31 December 2004, the Committee will calculate the amount payable in respect of the Participants Basic Award and will decide whether any amount is payable in respect of his Discretionary Award.
In respect of the Compensation Pool the Company will pay the aggregate amount of the Basic and Discretionary Awards to the Participant in cash immediately.
In respect of the other Pools, the Company will pay 50% of those amounts in cash immediately, 25% of those amounts on the first anniversary of the date of payment of the 50% and the remaining 25% will be paid on the second anniversary of the date of payment of the 50%.
A Participant can receive payment either: a from the Group Retail Profit Pool and or the Commercial Run-Off Pool: or b from the Compensation Pool but not from both a and b.
Awards granted under the Plan are personal to the Participant and his personal representatives and may not be transferred.
Leaving employment If a Participant ceases to be employed his Award will lapse unless: a he ceases to be employed by reason of death, permanent ill health, permanent injury or permanent disability: b the Company in which the Participant is employed ceases to be owned or operated by the Group: c the Committee decides otherwise.
In such cases the Participant will as soon as possible after the Certification Date receive, in accordance with the Rules of the Plan, a time apportioned part of his Basic Award in a lump sum.
He may also receive a Discretionary Award.
Change of control Special circumstances apply where there is a change of control of the Company or where any person, already having control of the Company, makes an offer to acquire all the shares of the Company.
In such circumstances, the Group Retail Profit Pool and the Commercial Run-Off Pool will cease to exist and will be replaced by the Compensation Pool.
Variation of capital In the event of a variation in the share capital of the Company or in such circumstances as the Board considers appropriate, the Board may make such adjustment to Awards which have been granted as it considers appropriate.
RE-FINANCING OF THE COMPANY The negotiation of the Lloyds Agreement, the revised Syndicated Banking Facilities and the Cash Placing and Placing and Open Offer required an exceptional amount of work on the part of the Executive Directors and the Non-executive Chairman.
As advised in the prospectus, Mr Owen was paid a one-off bonus of 250,000 for the successful implementation of this re-financing.
The Committee met subsequently to the successful conclusion of the exercise and agreed to award bonuses to the Executive Directors involved in recognition of the exceptional performance involved.
Bonuses of 184,500 and 125,000 were paid to Messrs Dawson and Utley respectively.
