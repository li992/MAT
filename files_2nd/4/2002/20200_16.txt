Increases in pension benefits are shown in the directors pensions table below.
2 Pension related payments to L Arnold and S Hester are set out in directors pensions below.
Directors pensions Executive directors are eligible to join one of the Companys pension schemes.
The following table shows an analysis of the accrued pension benefits as at 31 December 2002 for executive directors participating in the Companys defined benefits pension schemes during the period.
Further information concerning the Companys pension schemes is set out in note 52 to the financial statements.
1 The increase in accrued pension during 2002 represents the increase in the annual pension which each director would be entitled to receive from normal retirement age less the statutory inflationary increase of 1.7%, where relevant, if he she had left service voluntarily at 31 December 2002 or at his actual retirement date if earlier.
3c-Remuneration report AW2 5 3 03 3:50 pm Page 83 THE ABBEY NATIONAL GROUP REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued 83 2 The transfer value of the increase in accrued pension represents the current capital sum which would be required, using demographic and financial assumptions, to produce an equivalent increase in accrued pension and ancillary benefits, excluding the statutory inflationary increase, and after deducting members contributions including Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Although the transfer value represents a liability to the Company, it is not a sum paid or due to be paid to the individual director and cannot therefore meaningfully be added to the annual remuneration.
3 The accrued pension as at 31 December 2002 represents the annual pension which each director would be entitled to receive from normal retirement age if he she had left service voluntarily at 31 December 2002 or at his her actual retirement date if earlier.
4 In some cases the figure for the increase in accrued pension during 2002 which appears in the table does not equal the difference between the total accrued pension as at 31 December 2002 and the total accrued pension as at 31 December 2001.
The difference arises where the increase in accrued pension is stated after deducting the statutory inflationary increase which would have been applied to the deferred pension entitlement had the director left at the start of the year.
This deduction had been made where directors have been in service for the whole year, and is made in order to present a figure showing that element of the increase which results from an extra full year of service and from changes in remuneration.
The statutory inflationary increase amounted to 1,778 for Y Jetha, 2,466 for M J Millington and 1,436 for M A Pain.
5 T C W Ingram did not participate in the Companys defined benefits pension scheme.
His pension arrangements were on a defined contributions basis.
However, the Company agreed to provide additional benefits as if he were participating in the defined benefits scheme.
6 Additional Voluntary Contributions made have been included in the above table where these payments result in an increase in the value of the directors pension entitlements.
7 As a result of their early retirement, the 2002 increase in transfer value of accrued pension for Ian Harley, John King and Ian Treacy is 1,858,944, 683,369 and 646,571, respectively.
This arises partly from the pension payments above, partly from normal contributions during the year, with the remainder of the increase due to the transfer value at 31 December 2001 having been calculated in the usual way using actuarial assumptions including a normal retirement age.
If early retirement in 2002 had been assumed in calculating the transfer value at 31 December 2001, the transfer value at that date would have been significantly higher.

The shares awarded form part of directors emoluments in the year in which they are received and are disclosed at the value of the shares on the date of receipt by the directors.
3 The aggregate maximum value of the conditional rights and shares held in trust shown above, based on the maximum number of shares that are receivable by the directors if the Company is ranked in the top quartile of both the relevant comparator groups, and on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2002, the last day of trading in 2002, 518p 2001: 980p, would have been 383,025 2001: 5,551,141.

The directors do not receive any of the shares if the Company is ranked below the median of both the relevant comparator groups.
Shares held in trust are not subject to any further performance criteria.
4 The entitlement of D G Jones over the conditional rights held at 31 December 2002 are subject to the relevant performance criteria being met.
Such entitlement to the conditional rights has been determined pro-rata to the period of service completed within the three year performance period to which those rights relate.
5 By virtue of their being potential beneficiaries of the Trust, each executive director is deemed, for the purpose of the Companies Act 1985, to have an interest in the shares held in the Trust.
At 31 December 2002, the Trust held 1,559,738 ordinary shares 31 December 2001: 604,362 ordinary shares for the above-named directors.
