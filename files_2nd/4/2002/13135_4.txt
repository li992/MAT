The report complies with the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Information relating to the emoluments of the directors on pages 18 to 20 and directors interests in share options on pages 21 and 22 has been audited.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Committee is responsible for recommending to the boards the remuneration in all its forms, and the terms of the service contracts and all other terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors, and for providing advice to the Chief Executive Officer on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of executives at a senior level below the board.
The Committee is chaired by Rolf Stomberg and throughout 2002 consisted wholly of independent non-executive directors: John Brock, Roelof Nelissen and Rolf Stomberg.
The Committee has appointed Towers Perrin, an external consultancy which has wide experience of executive remuneration in multinational companies, to advise in developing its performance-related remuneration policy.
Towers Perrin also provides actuarial and other Human Resources consultancy services direct to some Reed Elsevier companies.
In addition to Towers Perrin, the following provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year: Jean-Luc Augustin, Human Resources Director: Christopher Thomas, Director, Compensation and Benefits: and Crispin Davis, Chief Executive Officer.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE BEST PRACTICE PROVISIONS The Committee has complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice, issued by the UK Financial Services Authority the Combined Code, during 2002.
In relation to disclosure of directors remuneration, Reed Elsevier PLC, a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange, has complied with Schedule B of the Combined Code.
REMUNERATION POLICY The remuneration policy, which also applies to the 2003 financial year and future years, is as follows: In determining its policy on senior executive remuneration, including that of the directors, the Committees principal objectives are to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre and experience needed to shape and execute the strategy and deliver shareholder value in the context of an ever more competitive and increasingly global employment market.
The Committee also has regard to, and balances as far as is practicable, the following objectives: i to ensure that it maintains a competitive package of pay and benefits, commensurate with comparable packages available within other leading multinational companies operating in global markets: ii to provide a consistent approach towards senior executives, including the directors, irrespective of geographical location: iii to ensure that it encourages enhanced performance by directors and fairly recognises the contribution of individual directors to the attainment of the results of Reed Elsevier, whilst also encouraging a team approach which will work towards achieving the long term strategic objectives of Reed Elsevier: and iv to link reward to individual directors performance and company performance so as to align the interests of the directors with the shareholders of the parent companies.
In order to meet the above objectives, the remuneration of executive directors comprises a balance between fixed remuneration and variable performance-related incentives.
The policy is that target performance-related incentives for executive directors should equate to approximately 70% of total remuneration.
Remuneration consists of the following elements: Base salary, which is based on comparable positions in leading multinational businesses of similar size and complexity.
Salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee.
A variable annual cash bonus, based on achievement of stretching revenue, profit and cash driven targets and individual performance-related targets.
Targets are set at the beginning of the year by the Committee.
Effective from January 2003 the Committee has adopted a policy of common levels for both annual and longer term incentives for executive directors, reflecting the global nature of the role of each director.
As a consequence, from 2003 the annual bonus payable to a director will be 72% of basic salary at target and 90% at maximum.
A bonus investment plan, introduced in 2002, under which directors and other senior executives are able to have up to one half of their annual bonus paid in Reed Elsevier PLC Reed Elsevier NV shares.
Subject to remaining in employment, at the end of a three year period, the participants will be awarded an equivalent number of Reed Elsevier PLC Reed Elsevier NV shares.
Share options, where the directors and other senior executives are granted options annually over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV at the market price at the date of grant.
The Committee approves the grant of any option and sets performance conditions attaching to options.
A longer term incentive arrangement LTIP under which a one-off grant of options of between 10 and 20 times salary was made during 2000 to 40 senior executives.
The options were granted at market value at the date of grant, and are exercisable after five years, subject to the achievement of highly demanding performance conditions.
Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, where different retirement schemes apply depending on local competitive market practice, length of service and age of the director.
The only element of remuneration that is pensionable is base salary.
16 REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2002 140350 pp12-23 27 2 03 8:41 pm Page 17 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT At the forthcoming Annual General Meetings of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV authority will be sought to implement a new longer term incentive compensation structure for directors and other executives.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the new structure will be available for use with effect from 2004.
The first part of the proposal relates to a new share option scheme for approximately 1,300 participants, to replace the present scheme which was introduced in 1993.
This scheme would grant options annually over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV at market value, with the level of shares capable of being granted determined by earnings per share growth in the three years prior to grant.
The second part of the proposal relates to a new LTIP for approximately 40 senior executives, including directors, who can most directly affect the performance of Reed Elsevier.
Awards under the LTIP would consist of a conditional award of shares and the grant of ten year options at market value, split approximately equally based on implied values.
Participation would be dependent on individual performance and the accumulation of a shareholding in Reed Elsevier PLC and or Reed Elsevier NV in accordance with company guidelines.
The exercise of LTIP awards would be subject to the achievement of demanding earnings per share targets.
A detailed explanation of the proposal and the reasons for the new longer term incentive structure is set out in the respective Notice of Annual General Meeting of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The graphs below show the Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV total shareholder return performance, assuming dividends were reinvested.
The top two graphs compare the Reed Elsevier PLC performance with the performance achieved by the FTSE 100, of which Reed Elsevier PLC is a member, and the Reed Elsevier NV performance with the performance achieved by the Amsterdam Stock Exchange AEX Index, of which Reed Elsevier NV is a member, for the three years 2000-2002.
This period reflects the implementation of the new strategy, announced in February 2000, by the current management team.
The other two graphs show the performance over the five years 19982002.
For the three year period since 1 January 2000, the total shareholder return for Reed Elsevier PLC was 43%, significantly outperforming the FTSE 100 which saw a negative return of 35%.
For Reed Elsevier NV, the total shareholder return in the same three year period was 22%, also significantly outperforming the AEX Index which saw a negative return of 43%.

REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2002 17 140350 pp12-23 27 2 03 8:41 pm Page 18 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT SERVICE CONTRACTS Each of the executive directors has a service contract, the notice periods of which are described below: M H Armour was appointed a director in July 1996.
His service contract, which is dated 7 October 1996, is subject to English law and provides for a notice period of twenty-four months, which reflects the normal practice at the time of his appointment.
C H L Davis was appointed a director in September 1999.
His service contract, which is dated 19 July 1999, is subject to English law and provides for a notice period of twelve months.
D J Haank was appointed a director in November 1999.
His service contract, which is dated 15 November 1999, is subject to Dutch law and provides for six months notice and, in the event of termination without cause by the company, eighteen months salary and employers pension contributions would be payable by way of liquidated damages.
A Prozes was appointed a director in August 2000.
His service contract, which is dated 5 July 2000, is subject to New York law and provides that, in the event of termination without cause by the company, twelve months base salary would be payable.
G J A van fide Aast was appointed a director in December 2000.
His service contract, which is dated 15 November 2000, is subject to English law and provides for a notice period of twelve months.
The notice periods in respect of individual directors have been reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee believes that as a general rule for future contracts, the notice period should be twelve months, and that the directors should, subject to practice within the country in which the director is based, be required to mitigate their damages in the event of termination.
The Committee will, however, have regard to local market conditions so as to ensure that the terms offered are appropriate to recruit and retain key executives operating in a global business.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS Executive directors may, subject to the approval of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, serve as non-executive directors on the boards of up to two non-associated companies and may retain remuneration arising from such non-executive directorships.
The Committee believes that Reed Elsevier can benefit from the broader experience gained by executive directors in such appointments.
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the boards with the aid of external professional advice.
Non-executive directors receive an annual fee and are reimbursed expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provisions, share options or other forms of benefit.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service.
EMOLUMENTS OF THE DIRECTORS The emoluments of the directors of Reed Elsevier Group plc including any entitlement to fees or emoluments from either Reed Elsevier PLC, Reed Elsevier NV or Elsevier Reed Finance BV were as follows: a Aggregate emoluments 000 000 2002 2001 2002 2001 Salaries and fees 3,009 2,790 4,784 4,492 Benefits 91 75 145 121 Annual performance-related bonuses 1,453 1,056 2,310 1,700 Pension contributions 267 218 425 351 Pension to former director 231 241 368 388 Total 5,051 4,380 8,032 7,052 No compensation payments have been made for loss of office or termination in 2001 and 2002.
C H L Davis was the highest paid director in 2002.
He had no gains on the exercise of share options.
c Pensions The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the executive directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with those provided by other multinational companies in its principal countries of operation.
The policy for executive directors based in the United Kingdom is to provide pension benefits at a normal retirement age of 60, equivalent to two thirds of base salary in the 12 months prior to retirement, provided they have completed 20 years service with Reed Elsevier or at an accrual rate of 1 30th of pensionable salary per annum if employment is for less than 20 years.
The target pension for C H L Davis at normal retirement age of 60 is 45% of base salary in the 12 months prior to retirement.
In 1989, the Inland Revenue introduced a cap on the amount of pension that can be provided from an approved pension scheme.
M H Armours, G J A van fide Aasts and C H L Daviss pension benefits will be provided from a combination of the Reed Elsevier Pension Scheme and the companys unapproved, unfunded pension arrangements.
D J Haank is a member of the Dutch pension scheme, and his pension at normal retirement age of 60 will be up to 70% of his final annual salary.
The target pension for A Prozes, a US based director, is US$300,000 per annum, which becomes payable on retirement only if he completes a minimum of seven years service.
This pension has no associated contingent benefits for a spouse or dependents, and will be reduced in amount by the value of any other retirement benefits payable by the company or any former employer, other than those attributable to employee contributions.
The pension arrangements for all the directors include life assurance cover whilst in employment, an entitlement to a pension in the event of ill health or disability and, except in the case of A Prozes, a spouses and or dependents pension on death.
The increase in the transfer value of the directors pensions, after deduction of contributions, is shown below: Increase in Transfer value of Transfer value of Transfer value of transfer value Accrued annual Increase in increase after accrued pension accrued pension during the period pension as accrued annual deduction of 1 January 31 December less directors at 31 December pension during directors 2002 2002 contributions 2002 the period contributions M H Armour 1,038,761 1,036,652 5,012 117,136 21,486 181,377 C H L Davis 1,233,292 1,779,585 543,391 140,015 50,904 636,158 D J Haank 1,366,599 1,353,976 12,623 146,814 25,982 239,619 A Prozes G J A van fide Aast 113,891 191,063 74,270 24,185 12,432 94,659 Increase in Transfer value of Transfer value of Transfer value of transfer value Accrued annual Increase in increase after accrued pension accrued pension during the period pension as accrued annual deduction of 1 January 31 December less directors at 31 December pension during directors 2002 2002 contributions 2002 the period contributions M H Armour 1,651,630 1,648,277 7,969 186,246 34,163 288,389 C H L Davis 1,960,934 2,829,540 863,992 222,624 80,937 1,011,491 D J Haank 2,172,892 2,152,822 20,070 233,435 41,312 380,994 A Prozes G J A van fide Aast 181,087 303,790 118,089 38,454 19,767 150,508 The transfer value in respect of individual directors represents a liability in respect of directors pensions entitlement, and is not an amount paid or payable to the director.
The movement in transfer values during the year includes a restatement of the transfer values based on the methodologies prescribed by the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
SHARE OPTIONS Options over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV have been granted to executive directors under the Reed Elsevier Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme, in which executive directors and other senior executives participate.
The scheme grants options at the market price at the time of grant, which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Since 1999 all executive share options have been granted subject to the performance condition that the compound growth in the average of the Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV adjusted EPS i. e. before amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets, exceptional items and UK tax credit equalisation in the three years immediately preceding vesting must exceed the compound growth in the average of the UK and Dutch retail price indices by a minimum of 6%.
The terms of the Reed Elsevier Group plc option schemes were approved by the shareholders of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV in 1993.
Under arrangements operating until 1999, options to subscribe for Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV shares have been granted to Dutch based executive directors and other senior executives.
Prior to 1999 options were granted at the market price at the time of the grant and were exercisable for a period up to five years from the date of grant.
Following the introduction of new tax laws in the Netherlands, the Committee decided that Dutch based executive directors and senior executives granted options during 1999 could elect to take either a five year option at an option exercise price representing a premium of 26% to the market price, or a ten year option at market price, or a combination of both.
No grants under such arrangements have been made since 1999, as all executive share options have been awarded through the Reed Elsevier Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme since that date.
Options over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV have been granted under the Reed Elsevier Group plc Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIP.
Implementation of the LTIP was approved by shareholders of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV at their respective Annual General Meetings in April 2000.
The terms of the LTIP permitted a one off grant of options to be made to executive directors and a limited number of key executives during the year 2000.
Grants were made to key executives responsible for reshaping the business, executing the strategy for growth announced in February 2000 and producing a sustainable improvement in shareholder value.
All grants under the LTIP were approved by the Committee, and the grant to any one individual ranged from 10 to a maximum value of 20 times salary.
Participants in the LTIP are required to build up a significant personal shareholding in Reed Elsevier PLC and or Reed Elsevier NV.
At 1 executive director level, the requirement is that they should own shares equivalent to 1 2 times salary, to be acquired over a reasonable period.
An option under the LTIP may only be exercised during the period 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005, and then only if the performance targets noted below have been satisfied.
These targets were chosen at the inception of the LTIP in 2000 in order to provide an appropriate balance between operational focus and producing a sustainable improvement in shareholder value over a five year period.
The first performance condition requires the achievement of 20% per annum compound total shareholder return TSR over three years from a base point of 436.5p for a Reed Elsevier PLC share and 10.73 for a Reed Elsevier NV share, being the respective share prices on 2 May 2000.
In the event that the required TSR is not achieved in the first test period of 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003, the TSR test and performance period will be extended by 1 year and, in the event of TSR not being achieved during such extended period, the TSR test and performance period will be extended by a further six months to 30 June 2005.
The TSR growth requirement over any such extended performance period will be correspondingly increased by 20% per annum.
The second performance condition requires executive directors to achieve individual performance targets.
If the required TSR and individual performance targets are not achieved, the entire option will lapse.
Options have also been granted over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC under the Reed Elsevier Group plc UK SAYE Option Scheme, in which all eligible UK employees are invited to participate.
The SAYE Scheme grants options at a maximum discount of 20% to the market price at the time of grant, and are normally exercisable after the expiry of three or five years from the date of grant.
No performance targets attach to options granted under this scheme as it is an all employee scheme.
The middle market price of a Reed Elsevier PLC ordinary share during the year was in the range 487.5p to 695.5p and at 31 December 2002 was 532p.
The aggregate notional pre-tax gain made by the directors on the exercise of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV share options during the year was 306,843 487,880.
There have been no changes in the options held by directors over Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV ordinary shares since 31 December 2002.
