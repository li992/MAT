Report on Directors Remuneration Introduction Although the Companys financial year-end was 29 December 2002, this report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of accounting periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be received.
The auditors report to the Company's members on the auditable part of the Directors' remuneration report and state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
Members: D C Bonham, R S Braddock, D A R Thompson and R M Carr Chairman: R S Braddock The members of this Committee at the date of this Report all held office at the year-end.
Dr F B Humer was also a member of the Committee and its Chairman until his resignation as a Director on 17 January 2002.
No other person was a member of the Committee at a time when any matter relating to the Directors remuneration for 2002 was considered.
R S Braddock was appointed as Chairman on 8 February 2002.
The Remuneration Committee reviews and approves the annual salaries, incentive arrangements, service agreements and other employment conditions for the Executive Directors and makes recommendations to the Board on executive pay.
Information prepared by independent consultants and survey data on the remuneration practices of comparable companies are taken into consideration.
The Remuneration Committee met five times in 2002.
All the members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors, which is in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code.
None of them has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
Employees of the Company who attended some or all of the meetings and who provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year were: J M Sunderland Chief Executive R J Stack Chief Human Resources Officer P A Cartmell Director of Business Risk Management M A C Clark Group Secretary and Chief Legal Officer D D Mackinlay Group Remuneration and Benefits Director P A Cartmell, M A C Clark and D D Mackinlay were appointed by the Company and have the appropriate qualifications and experience to advise the Committee on relevant aspects of the Company's policies and practices and on legal and regulatory issues.
The Company appointed and the Committee sought advice from Towers Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc. and Slaughter and May.
Towers Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc. have attended meetings of the Committee and provided advice, primarily in the area of employee benefits, to Cadbury Schweppes operations in Europe and North America.
This advice included information on the remuneration practices Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 45 Report on Directors Remuneration Remuneration Committee continued of consumer products companies of a size and standing similar to those of the Company, including competitors and other businesses which trade on a worldwide basis.
Slaughter and May have advised the Committee on legal and regulatory issues but have not attended meetings of the Committee.
Towers Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc. also provided advice to the Group during 2002 in respect of employee benefits and remuneration policies.
Slaughter and May provided a range of legal services to the Group during 2002.
Remuneration Policy The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the remuneration practices of the Company are competitive, thereby enabling the Company to attract and retain high calibre executives and at the same time protect the interests of shareholders.
These policies apply for 2003 and are expected to apply for subsequent financial periods subject to the proposed review of reward arrangements mentioned below.
The percentage of each of the Executive Directors overall pay which is dependent on performance is substantial and has increased over recent years and the overall reward structure is designed to be competitive for an international confectionery and beverages company.
The reward structure for Executive Directors now provides: a basic salaries which are competitive against the appropriate comparators: b annual incentives which directly support the achievement of Managing for Value MFV operating targets and, through the Bonus Share Retention Plan, encourage Directors shareholdings: c long-term incentives which are directly aligned with the MFV objective as: rewards from executive share options only arise from increases in value: the Long Term Incentive Plan rewards Directors only when shareholder returns are in the top half of the comparator group: d a contract notice period of one year under Directors service agreements: and e pension arrangements.
The ways in which these components apply to the Executive Directors, collectively and individually, are summarised in the sections of this Report set out below.
The reward structure for around 30 senior executives below Board level is identical although the size of the awards under the Annual Incentive Plan, Long Term Incentive Plan and share option plans may differ.
These senior executives are also invited to participate in the Bonus Share Retention Plan at the same matching level.
Their salaries are reviewed each year against external data to ensure that they are paid competitively.
The Company has adopted voluntary guidelines to encourage share ownership by senior managers.
These guidelines call for Executive Directors to hold shares in the Company equivalent to four times annual basic salary.
The current remuneration policy was last reviewed in 2000 and it has served the Company well in enabling it to attract, motivate and incentivise senior executives of the calibre required to drive the business forward.
One of the key principles established in 2000 was that the Company should have a reward structure in place that would be appropriate and competitive in all of the locations in which Cadbury Schweppes operates.
This is important to the business because, although the top team comprises executives from a number of different national backgrounds, the senior executive group should be encouraged to perform and also be incentivised as a cohesive team.
Since the remuneration policy was last reviewed, the extent of the Companys activities outside the UK has increased and continues to increase.
In 2002, the Americas contributed over 60% of Operating Profit and we expect this to increase in future, following the completion of the acquisition of Adams.
46 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 There are also aspects of the existing package which some shareholders may consider to be out of line with their preferred practices and, consequently, the Board and Committee are undertaking a thorough review of the total reward arrangements in place for Executive Directors and other senior executives of the Group during 2003.
Our intention is to consult with shareholders during the latter half of this year and present proposals for change at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
In the meantime, the current reward arrangements described in the balance of this report will continue to apply.
Salaries for Executive Directors In setting the basic salary of each Director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account market competitiveness and the performance of each individual Director, together with any changes in position or responsibility.
This structure is consistent with the reward structure in place for executives below board level, and that paid by comparable companies.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive benefits in kind and these are detailed in the table on page 52.
Annual Incentive Plan Annual incentive targets are set each year to take account of current business plans and conditions, and there is a threshold performance below which no award is paid.
Awards are based on financial tests subject to appropriate adjustments as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The 2002 Annual Incentive Plan awards reflected the growth in Group Economic Profit, which was the key performance measure, and in Group Net Sales Value.
The target incentive award for an Executive Director is 60% of basic salary.
However, in the case of exceptional results the annual incentive payment may increase up to a maximum of twice the target.
Incentive awards to Executive Directors for 2001 and 2002 averaged 56% and 49%, respectively of basic salary.
As detailed under Retirement Benefits on page 49, annual incentive awards to Directors are pensionable up to 20% of basic salary for UK Directors and up to 100% for US Directors.
Bonus Share Retention Plan The Bonus Share Retention Plan BSRP enables participants to invest all or part of their Annual Incentive Plan award and receive such award in the form of Cadbury Schweppes ordinary shares deferred shares rather than cash.
All shares under the BSRP are purchased in the market and held in trust until the end of the three year period.
At the end of the period the Company will provide participants with three additional shares for every five deferred shares.
If a participant leaves the Company during the three year period, the participant forfeits part of the additional shares and in certain cases it is possible that all of the additional shares and the deferred shares may be forfeited.
The BSRP is available to a group of approximately 180 senior executives and aims to encourage participants to reinvest a cash award into the Companys shares.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 1997 and revised in 2000 to be better aligned with the Company's reward philosophy.
In particular, because of the reintroduction of share options, the maximum value of an award was reduced from 100% to 80% of basic salary.
Participation in the LTIP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In 2002, grants for the 2002-2004 performance cycle were made to 31 senior executives, including five Executive Directors.
Details of LTIP interests are set out in the table on page 53.
The LTIP operates over a three year performance cycle with a new cycle starting each year.
An award consists of the contingent right to receive an amount equal to the market value, at the end of each performance cycle, of a designated number of ordinary shares.
The maximum number of ordinary shares which can be released in respect of each performance cycle is calculated using 80% of the participants basic salary at the start of the performance cycle and the share price at that time.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 47 Report on Directors Remuneration Long Term Incentive Plan continued Each award is subject to objective performance criteria determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The current performance criteria are based on total shareholder return that is, share price growth plus reinvested dividends TSR and a minimum requirement that the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share over the performance cycle exceeds the rate of inflation over the same period by at least 2% per annum compound.
A relative TSR measure ensures executives will only be rewarded if the Companys market performance is greater than the median of comparable companies.
Earnings per share was chosen as it ensures awards vest when underlying performance of the business is sound.
For LTIP cycles prior to that for 2001-2003, meeting the performance criteria for the TSR measure and earnings per share measurement of 2% growth resulted in the vesting of Part I of the award, and meeting the requirement for the growth in the Companys earnings per share of 4% growth resulted in the vesting of Part II of the award.
For the 2001-2003 cycle onwards, the whole award depends only on meeting the TSR and earnings per share performance criteria for Part I.
If the performance criteria are not satisfied in the initial 3-year performance period, the vesting of the award will be deferred on an annual basis for up to three years.
The same performance tests would be applied over four, five or six years for example, comparing the performance in 2000 with that in 2004, 2005 or 2006 and if the performance test is not met after year six the award will lapse.
The Companys TSR over each performance cycle is compared with a weighted average TSR performance of a peer group of both UK and non-UK fast moving consumer goods companies weighted 75% and 25% respectively.
These companies have been selected to reflect the global nature of the Companys business and are as follows: UK Based Companies Non-UK Based Companies Weighted 75% Weighted 25% Head Office Location Allied Domecq Campbell Soup US Associated British Foods Coca-Cola US Diageo Colgate-Palmolive US Northern Foods General Mills US Reckitt Benckiser Groupe Danone France Six Continents Heinz US Tate & Lyle Hershey Food US Unilever Group Kellogg US Uniq Nestl Switzerland Whitbread PepsiCo US Pernod Ricard France Procter & Gamble US Sara Lee Corp US Suedzucker Germany TSR performance must be at the 50th percentile of the peer group to earn the minimum of 50% of the award.
Above this percentile the awards increase on a straight line basis.
For performance at or above the 80th percentile the award will be earned in full.
All of the LTIP award is paid in ordinary shares at the end of the performance cycle.
One half of these shares is placed in trust and released two years later, assuming that the participants employment with the Group has not been terminated for cause during that period.
During the deferral period, participants accumulate dividend equivalents on shares held in trust which are paid at the end of the deferral period.
Share Options Under the Share Option Plan 1994 option grants were made to Executive Directors in 2002 as shown on page 56.
No rights to subscribe for shares or debentures of any Group company 48 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 were granted to or exercised by any member of any of the Directors immediate families during 2002.
Consistent with best practice, it is the Remuneration Committees intention that grants will continue to be made annually, including to Executive Directors, in the future.
Such grants will normally be within a range equivalent to between two times and four times salary.
The Remuneration Committee, in making option grants, sets the performance target to be achieved before such options can be exercised.
Options cannot be exercised unless and until the percentage growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years has exceeded the rate of inflation over the same period by at least 2% per annum compound.
This criterion was chosen to ensure options can only be exercised when the underlying performance of the business is sound.
Further details on share plans are provided in Note 30 to the Financial Statements.
Retirement Benefits The Company operates a number of retirement programmes throughout the world.
Pension benefits reflect local competitive conditions and legal requirements.
J M Sunderland and D J Kappler participate in the UK pension arrangements.
J F Brock, who resigned as a Director on 19 December 2002 and as an employee on 29 December 2002, R J Stack and H TStitzer participate in the US pension arrangements.
Further details ofthese arrangements are set out on page 54.
In the UK, annual incentive awards of up to 20% of basic salary are pensionable.
Given the large proportion of total remuneration which is variable pay, the Remuneration Committee considers that it is appropriate for a proportion of such pay to be pensionable.
Pension arrangements in the US provide that all of any incentive awards under the Annual Incentive Plan are pensionable and the pensionability of such incentive awards in the UK and US is consistent with long standing arrangements for the Companys other senior executives.
Service Contracts The Companys policy on the duration of Directors service contracts which are only entered into with Executive Directors is that such contracts should expire in the year in which the Executive Director reaches sixty years of age.
Notice periods do not exceed one year.
The service contracts include provisions on non-competition and non-solicitation.
These provisions state that if the Executive Director leaves voluntarily he will not for a period of one year after leaving be engaged in or concerned directly or indirectly in any business concern which is in competition with the Company.
Also the Executive Director agrees for a period of two years after termination of employment not to solicit or attempt to entice away any employee or Director of the Company.
If any Executive Directors employment is terminated without cause, or if the Director resigns for good reason as defined in the contract other than following a change of control, payment of twice basic salary would be made.
Such payment would be less than one years total remuneration on which a termination payment would otherwise be based.
Termination payments of twice total remuneration would be made if within two years of a change of control, the Executive Directors employment were terminated without cause, or if the Director resigned for good reason as defined in the contract.
Service contracts are an important part of the overall remuneration package and change in control provisions are common for major US public companies.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the current form of contract, which incorporates these terms, will assist the Company in motivating and retaining key executives and also in attracting other senior executives from an increasingly global and competitive marketplace.
The Committee will, however, keep this and further developments under review.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 49 Report on Directors Remuneration Service Contracts continued All the Executive Directors who served during the year have service contracts with the Company on these terms.
These contracts can be terminated by the Company at any time on twelve months notice or will otherwise expire in the year in which the Director reaches sixty years of age.
All the contracts are dated 1 March 2001 and the approximate unexpired term of each contract as at 3 March 2003 is as follows: D J Kappler 4 years R J Stack 7 years HTStitzer 9years J M Sunderland 2 and a half years The service contracts of R J Stack and H T Stitzer, who are proposed for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting, contain the terms outlined above.
In addition, under their secondment arrangements, R J Stack and H TStitzer are entitled to six months employment with their employing company in their home country if there are no suitable opportunities for them when their secondments end.
Performance Graph The following graph showing the Company's performance measured by total shareholder return TSR for the five years to 29 December 2002, compared with the TSR performance of the FTSE 100 companies over the same period, has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Total shareholder return is share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
The FTSE 100 has been selected for this comparison because this is the principal index in which the Companys shares are quoted.

Subject to certain conditions, and unless otherwise determined by the Board, each Executive Director is permitted to accept only one appointment as a 50 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 non-executive director in another company.
The Executive Director is permitted to retain any fees paid for such service.
Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
It is the policy of the Company to appoint Non-Executive Directors for an initial period of three years.
Unless otherwise determined by the Board the maximum term is nine years.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole in the absence of the Director concerned and within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
To ensure that the interests of the Non-Executive Directors are aligned with those of the shareholders, all Non-Executive Directors have chosen to utilise a percentage of their fees between 10% and 50% to purchase shares in the Company.
Commencing with the payment of quarterly fees at 31 March 2002, ordinary shares in the Company have been and will continue to be bought within five business days of each relevant payment.
Each Non-Executive Director has undertaken to hold such shares during his or her appointment as a Non-Executive Director.

All the participating Directors have elected to receive their awards under the Annual Incentive Plan in the form of shares under the terms of the BSRP, as described on page 47. g Allowances and benefits include housing and other expatriate allowances.
Such arrangements are necessary to ensure that the Companys senior management is not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which result in higher costs and taxation than could have been the case if they had remained in their home country.
h The Company agreed to a payment of $985,000 655,714 to J F Brock equal to one year's basic salary as compensation for loss of office.
Also included under Compensation for loss of office and other benefits is an amount of 45,485 for accommodation costs and legal fees paid on his behalf.
Under his service contract J F Brock is entitled to liquidated damages equal to twice his basic salary if his contract is terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason.
The Remuneration Committee considered that the payment of one year's basic salary represented reasonable mitigation under the circumstances.
See page 49 for a description of Service Contracts.
Following the cessation of his employment the Company also provided him with 161,538 shares in satisfaction of his LTIP awards under Part I of the 2000-2002 cycle, the 2001-2003 cycle and the 2002-2004 cycle.
The share awards for the 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 cycles were pro-rated based on his leaving date.
The value of all these shares at the mid-market price of 3.91 per share on 30 December 2002 is included under the column above entitled Payments for accrued benefits on cessation of employment.
In accordance with the BSRP rules, following his resignation the Company also released to him 364,661 shares with a value of 1,425,824 based on the mid-market price of 3.91 per share on 30 December 2002 in satisfaction of his basic and matching awards, such matching shares being calculated on a pro-rata basis up to his date of leaving, and 86,918 shares with a value of 339,849 based on the mid-market price of 3.91 per share on 30 December 2002 in satisfaction of his LTIP awards held in trust.
The BSRP shares are based on his Annual Incentive Plan awards for 1999, 2000 and 2001 and were disclosed as part of his remuneration in the Companys report and accounts for each of those years.
The LTIP awards held in trust were similarly disclosed in the report and accounts for 2000 and 2001.
In addition, as noted on page 53, J F Brocks award under Part II of the 2000-2002 cycle of the LTIP will vest in March 2003 and he will receive the whole of the award immediately.
He will also receive a payment for his earned pension rights as noted on page 54.

Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 53 Report on Directors Remuneration Pensions J M Sunderland and D J Kappler are members of the Cadbury Schweppes Pension Fund CSPF and the Cadbury Schweppes Supplementary Pension Scheme.
These are defined benefit retirement plans with a pension paid on retirement based on salary and length of service.
Members contribute 5% of salary and pensionable bonus to CSPF.
The target benefit is two-thirds of pensionable earnings current basic salary and three years average of pensionable bonuses.
The normal retirement age is 60.
J FBrock, who resigned on 19 December 2002, R J Stack andH TStitzer are members ofthe US Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP as well as the US cash balance pension plan and excess plan.
The SERP is a defined benefit retirement plan with a pension paid on retirement based on salary and length of service.
Combined benefits are 50% of a three year average of final pensionable earnings after 15 years service and 60% after 25 or more years service.
R J Stack and H TStitzer may retire at age 60 without a reduction factor applied to accrued benefits.
The SERP has a ten year vesting period and the benefits of these three Executive Directors are fully vested.

Under the standard terms of the US pension plans he is entitled to an immediate pension, calculated by applying an early retirement reduction to his accrued pension entitlement, which may in turn be taken in the form of a single capital lump sum.
The actual lump sum payment is calculated by reference to long-dated US Treasury bills at the time of retirement.

c The accrued pensions represent the amount of the deferred pension that would be payable from age 60 if the Directors left service at the relevant date.
