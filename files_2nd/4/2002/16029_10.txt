TRA V IS PERKINS PLC Remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2002 Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosures of directors remuneration in respect of periods ended on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the board has applied the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company at which the financial statements are presented for approval.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of the Remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration and nominations committee The Committee consists of Mr. P. J. Maydon as chairman from 1 January 2003, together with Messrs. M. B. Dearden and T. E. P. Stevenson from 1 January 2003.
These directors are non-executive and have no day to day involvement in the running of the business, no financial interest in the business except as shareholders and no conflicts of interest arising from other directorships.
Written terms of reference for the Committee have been approved by the board of directors.
The Committee has been advised on directors remuneration packages by three external consultants, namely, Mercer Human Resources Consulting, Hay Group and New Bridge Street Consultants.
In addition, Mr. A. S. Pike, the company secretary and Mr. R. Tansey, the group HR director have advised the Committee from time to time as requested.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The companys policy on executive remuneration is to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay over the short and long term, to attract and retain high quality executives with an appropriate blend of skills and experience.
It aims to reward executives in line with the median of the FTSE 250 companies and of a selected comparator group.
The Committee believe this will enable the company to recruit and retain staff of high quality, contributing to the delivery of long-term shareholder value.
As a consequence the companys focus is on the following elements of the remuneration package: Basic pay: to remain competitive in the labour market: Annual bonus payment: to provide additional short term remuneration which directly reflects company and individual performance: Share options: through the regular grant of options to reward outstanding business performance over the longer term: Pension arrangements: to enable directors to make appropriate provision for retirement.
A significant proportion of a directors total remuneration package is variable being subject to the achievement of business and individual objectives.
It is the Committees intention to continue with this policy in the future.
Basic salary A directors basic salary is determined by the Remuneration and Nominations Committee annually and when an individual changes role.
Salaries are reviewed in November each year, with increases taking effect from 1 January in the following year.
The review carried out in November 2002 showed that the salaries of the executive directors had become out of line with the policy of the Committee, as described above, due mainly to the rapid growth in the size and profitability of the company.
It was considered important that this position be corrected.
As a result their new salaries from 1 January 2003 are - J. P. Carter 200,000, P. N. Hampden Smith 250,000 and F. J. McKay 425,000.
31 TRA V IS PERKINS PLC Annual bonus payments The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met if a cash payment is to be made.
It believes that any annual bonus award should be related to the interests of the companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is shareholder value.
Hence, bonus payments for all executive directors are based on a formula related to the level of net earnings per share achieved by the group.
There is also an element within the payment dependant on the achievement of individual objectives.
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid is 55 per cent of basic annual salary.
In order to determine whether the conditions for payment have been met, the Committee assess both business and individual performance against predetermined objectives.
Share options For many years, the company has further motivated directors and senior executives through granting them share options.
The executive share option scheme adopted in 2001, which covers all executive directors and other senior executives, provides for the grant of options on an annual basis, with a value limit up to twice basic salary.
Currently, for all eligible executives, options may only be exercised if the growth in the companys earnings per share as reported in the companys published accounts exceeds inflation by at least 9 per cent over a three year period.
In the case of executive directors and certain other senior executives, achievement of this target will allow only 50 per cent of options to be exercised.
For all options to be exercisable, earnings per share growth must exceed inflation by at least 15 per cent over the three year period.
Between 9 per cent and 15 per cent the number of options exercisable is calculated on a straight line basis.
The Committee believes that these performance conditions, which are kept under review, are closely linked to shareholder value and are, currently, sufficiently demanding.
Under the 1995 executive share option scheme, options granted prior to 1998 were not subject to performance conditions.
Those granted between 1998 and 2000 are exercisable if the growth in the companys earnings per share exceeds inflation by at least 6 per cent over a 3 year period.
The Committee considers these arrangements to be in line with market practice at the time the grants were made.
Pension arrangements The general policy is for executive directors to be members of the companys final salary pension scheme and to accrue benefits at a rate of 1 30th of pensionable salary for each years pensionable service after appointment as a director.
As with all other members, their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and a payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Except in the case of Mr. F. J. McKay, the pension arrangements provide for a pension in retirement based on the directors length of service in the group pension scheme and the average of the best three of the last ten years of pensionable salary.
Mr. F. J. McKay has been guaranteed, on retirement at age 60, a pension of thirty per cent of his final pensionable salary including the pension from a previous employment.
This pension will be funded partly by the group scheme and by separate funded and unfunded arrangements established for him.
In the event that a directors pension benefits are limited by the Inland Revenue pensions cap, the general policy is to pay an age related annual salary supplement.
Mr. P. N. Hampden Smith receives such a salary supplement.
For many years, bonus payments to executive directors and management formed a part of scheme members pensionable emoluments and both the group and the employee contributed a proportion of any such bonus to the scheme funds.
On 1 December 1995, the company changed its policy so that, from that date, for pension scheme members not then eligible for bonus payments and for all future entrants to the pension scheme, any such bonus payments that they may later become entitled to, would not form part of their pensionable salaries.
This does not affect scheme members, including executive directors, eligible for bonus payments prior to 1 December 1995 who will continue to have such payments treated as part of their pensionable salaries.
There have been no changes in the basis of directors pension entitlements during the year.
Except as described above for Mr. F. J. McKay, there are no unfunded pension commitments or similar arrangements for directors.
32 TRA V IS PERKINS PLC Service contracts The companys policy for executive directors is to have contracts which are not for a fixed period, and which are terminable on 12 months notice from the company, and 6 months from the director.
It is not the policy to specify what compensation would be payable on termination by the company.
If such compensation was due, it would be calculated by reference to the unexpired part of the notice period, and the directors salary and other benefits, including pension rights, taking due account of the directors duty to mitigate his loss.
Service contracts do not specify any particular level of compensation in the event of termination following change of control of the company.
Each of the executive directors has a service contract, the date of which is shown below, which will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
J. P. Carter 6 August 2001 P. N. Hampden Smith 8 October 1996 F. J. McKay 1 November 1999 Non-executive directors The policy of the board is to recruit non-executive directors of the highest calibre, with a breadth of skills and experience appropriate for the companys business.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a period of 3 years, at the end of which the appointment may be renewed by mutual agreement.
It is the boards policy that non-executive directors will not serve for more than 9 years.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board, and in 2002 the board received advice on this remuneration from Hay Group Limited.
Each non-executive director receives an annual fee, and from January 2003, Mr. M. B. Dearden and Mr. P. J. Maydon will receive an additional fee for chairing the Audit Committee and the Remuneration and Nominations Committee, respectively.
Mr. E. C. Adams will also receive an additional fee for chairing the companys pension trusts.
