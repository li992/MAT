The Hon James Grant 10.05.03 3 months The Remuneration Committees policy is and has been that executive Mr Nordmann 22.12.03 3 months directors service contracts should be for a rolling term, subject at any Mr Veilleux 10.05.03 3 months time to a 12-month notice period from the Company.
In the event of termination for cause no such notice period would apply.

In accordance with policy, the revised contracts Grant, who is a partner of a Canadian law firm with which the Group allow the Company, at its discretion, to pay up to a maximum of incurred professional fees during the year, are given in the directors 12 months salary, 12 months maximum annual bonus, 12 months report on page 7. pension contribution and up to 12 months of the actual cost to the employee of the other contractual benefits to which the director is entitled, in the event of termination, as payment in lieu of notice.
The Committee takes the view that this approach will enable contractual termination to be managed fairly and appropriately taking into account individual circumstances.
As part of its review and in light of growing business uncertainty in the pharmaceutical sector, the Remuneration Committee also decided that it would be in shareholders interests to provide in the directors service contracts that, in the event of a change of control of the Company and the termination, other than for cause, by the Company of an executive directors employment within 12 months thereof, the executive in such circumstances would be entitled to receive 24 months salary and 24 months bonus, inclusive of all other benefits.
Executive directors would not be entitled, in addition, to any other severance arrangements.
The Committee takes the view that this level of enhanced compensation is in the interests of shareholders on the grounds that it both reduces the potential for insecurity and enhances levels of commitment.

18 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Directors remuneration report Notes i These options have been granted over shares in Shire Holdings Limited, a previous holding company of the Group.
The exercise of these options is not subject to any performance criteria and results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in the Company.
ii Options granted under the Executive Scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options will become exercisable.
iii Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
The exercise of options under this Scheme is not subject to any performance criteria.
iv These options have been granted over shares in Shire Laboratories Inc. SLI, formerly Pharmavene Inc. a US company acquired by the Group on 23 March 1997.
Exercise of these options results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in the Company.
As a result of the acquisition of SLI, and in accordance with the terms of the original SLI Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to performance criteria.
v These options have been granted over shares in Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, a US company acquired by the Group on 23 December 1999.
As a result of the acquisition of Roberts, and in accordance with the terms of the original Roberts Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to any performance criteria.
vi Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme following the Companys 2000 Annual General Meeting are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year period.
If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options will be exercisable.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of these options will become exercisable.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company, held on 5 June 2001, a resolution was passed to permit the grant of options under the 2000 Executive Scheme to be made subject to performance criteria being satisfied prior to the date of grant.
Subsequent to the passing of this resolution options have been granted based on performance criteria being satisfied before grant, namely that the Companys share price had increased by an annualised compound rate of 20.5% over a minimum three-year period.
During 2002, the performance criteria were again reviewed to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which the Company operates.
Given the Companys development it was felt appropriate that an EPS based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore option grants made after July 2002 will only become exercisable in full if the Companys EPS growth exceeds the RPI over a three-year period for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% The adoption of the new criteria applies to all options granted from August 2002 onwards.
vii Following the acquisition of BioChem Pharma, Inc. on 11 May 2001, the BioChem Plan was amended such that options over BioChems common stock became options over ordinary shares of the Company.
All BioChem options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition and were not subject to any performance conditions.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the BioChem Plan.
viii Under the Stock Purchase Plan options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment date the first day of the offering period or the exercise date the last day of the offering period, whichever is the lower.
The offering period is for 27 months.
The exercise of options under this plan is not subject to any performance condition.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2002 was 3.975 and the range during the year was 8.835 to 3.755.
Performance conditions attaching to awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on page 12.
