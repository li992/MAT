Remuneration report The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board and sets out the remuneration policies operated by the Company and details the remuneration of each director.
The Remuneration Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Board has an established Remuneration Committee, the members of which are disclosed on page 27.
New Bridge Street Consultants have been appointed during the year by the Remuneration Committee to provide general advice on directors remuneration and specifically to advise on, and assist with, the introduction of the proposed new Executive Share Option Scheme and the Performance Share Plan.
New Bridge Street Consultants provide no other services to the Company.
Remuneration policy In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors, the Committee has regard to two fundamental principles: The importance of attracting, motivating and retaining management of the highest calibre: and Linking reward to the Groups performance.
The Committee has applied these principles to develop remuneration packages which: provide a competitive base salary designed to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre and to reflect their role and experience: provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets, reflect the Companys objectives and recognise the importance of providing sustained motivation of management to focus on annual, as well as longerterm, performance: and align the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Committees approach is that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration package should be linked to performance, through participation in short term and long term incentive schemes.
The Committee determines remuneration packages with regard to the prevailing pay and benefits conditions across the Groups markets.
Remuneration package of executive directors The main components are: Base salary and benefits Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee after a review taking into account the individuals performance, market trends and the performance of the Group as a whole and, where relevant, the performance of the business for which the executive is responsible.
For guidance, the Committee has regard to available research and published remuneration information on companies within the same industry and markets in the countries in which the executives are based.
A summary of the benefits payable to executive directors is given on page 33.
Bonus schemes All of the executive directors participate in a Group Annual Cash Bonus Scheme based upon achievement of individual objectives and financial targets profit before tax and management charges linked to Group and, in the case of directors with operational responsibilities, regional performance.
This may result in the payment of cash bonuses of up to 25% of base salary for on-target financial performance, with the opportunity to earn higher bonuses for exceptional performance.
Additionally, the executive directors with operational responsibilities Adrian Chedore, Bruno Kemoun, Eryck Rebbouh and David Verklin participate in a separate deferred annual bonus scheme based on the financial performance of the businesses for which they are responsible.
The payment of half of any such bonus is deferred for one year.
This deferred bonus will normally be forfeited in the event that the director leaves the Group.
29 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Remuneration report continued Share-based incentives aExecutive Share Option Schemes Grants of options have been made by the Committee under the Executive Share Option Schemes which were introduced in 1995 the 1995 schemes and the Aegis Group Management Incentive Scheme which was adopted in May 1998 the MIS scheme.
Options under the 1995 schemes are granted on an annual phased basis.
Options under the MIS scheme have been used by the Committee to further incentivise executive directors and other senior executives as and when the Committee considers necessary.
Details of options granted to executive directors in 2002 and previous years, are set out on pages 34 and 35.
Exercise of options is subject to the achievement of specific, demanding performance conditions, achievement of which will be checked by New Bridge Street Consultants, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
The following performance conditions apply to options granted under the 1995 schemes: That Earnings Per Share growth over the performance period exceeds a composite retail price index plus 5% per annum.
The composite index is determined by weighting indices calculated for selective countries to approximate the source of the Groups turnover.
The country indices are calculated from official retail inflation data, adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations against sterling: and That the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance must be greater than that of the FTSE 100 company ranked 33rd over the performance period.
The following performance conditions apply to options granted under the MIS scheme: That the Companys TSR over the performance period must be not less than 15% per annum compound: and That the Companys TSR over the performance period must at least match that of the FTSE Actuaries 350 Index.
b Leveraged Investment Plan Under the Aegis Group Leveraged Investment Plan the LIP executive directors and other senior executives may lodge shares and or vested options with the trustees of the plan.
These are then held by the trustees over a three year performance period.
At the end of the performance period the executives shares and or options will be released and a matching award of additional shares may be made to the executive.
The extent of any matching award of additional shares will be dependent on the achievement by the Company of a return on earnings before tax, depreciation and amortisation performance condition against an industry comparator group.
Awards of matching shares are made on a sliding scale.
The following performance conditions apply to any award of Matching Shares under the LIP: EBTDA performance compared to the median Number of Matching Shares as a percentage performance of the comparator group of shares and or options lodged At or below median nil Between 101% and 110% of median 20% Between 111% and 120% of median 50% Between 121% and 150% of median 100% More than 150% of median 150% The comparator group of companies comprises: Cordiant Communications Group plc Publicis Group S. A. Dentsu Inc. Taylor Nelson Sofres plc Havas S. A.
The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. Omnicom Group Inc. WPP Group plc New Executive Share Incentive Schemes Following a review of the current, aforementioned, incentive schemes, the Committee has concluded that shareholders approval should be sought at the 2003 Annual General Meeting for the adoption of a new Executive Share Option Scheme and a new Performance Share Plan.
The proposed new schemes will replace all of the existing schemes and are designed to reflect changes in the guidelines issued by institutional shareholders and developments in market practice.
No further awards will be made under the existing schemes, although awards granted in the past will continue to be exercisable in accordance with the rules of each respective scheme.
30 Remuneration report continued Summaries of the proposed new schemes are set out in the accompanying Circular dated 26 March 2003 and the key points are as follows: Executive Share Option Scheme The option price will be the market value of the Companys shares shortly before options are granted.
The value of the shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year may not normally exceed three times basic salary.
Exercise of options to be granted in 2003 will be based upon the Companys earnings per share EPS growth relative to inflation RPI, and the following performance conditions will apply: Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of option grants exercisable 3% 0.5 x salary 3% to 5% 0.5 to 1 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis 5% to 10% 1 to 2 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis 10% to 15% 2 to 3 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis Performance conditions will be tested after three years, from the year in which awards are made.
If they are not satisfied at the end of the third year, the performance conditions may be retested after a further one year from the same fixed base point but to the extent that they are not then met, the options will lapse.
The number of new issue shares which may be allocated over a 10 year period under this scheme and any other share schemes operated by the Company will be limited to 16% of the issued ordinary share capital from time to time.
Performance Share Plan The value of shares which may be conditionally awarded to an executive in any financial year may not normally exceed two times basic salary.
The extent to which awards to be granted in 2003 vest will be determined partly by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The following TSR targets will apply: TSR performance relative to peer group Proportion of award vesting Median or below nil Median to 1st or 2nd nil to 50% pro rata, on a straight-line basis 1st or 2nd 50% The following companies will be included in the peer group for calculation of TSR performance: Cordiant Communications Group plc Pearson plc Dentsu Inc. Publicis Groupe S. A. Grey Global Group Inc. Reed Elsevier plc Havas SA Taylor Nelson Sofres plc The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. Viacom Inc. IPSOS S. A. VNU N. V. The News Corporation Limited WPP Group plc Omnicom Group Inc.
The next table sets out the EPS performance targets: Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of award vesting 3% or less nil 3% to 15% nil to 50% pro rata, on a straight-line basis 15% 50% 31 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Remuneration report continued These performance conditions will be tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which awards are made.
There will be no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the awards will lapse.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS growth are the most appropriate methods of assessing the Companys relative returns to shareholders and its underlying financial performance.
The assessment of these performance conditions will be carried out by New Bridge Street Consultants, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.

Performance graph The following graph illustrates the Companys total shareholder return since 1 January 1998 relative to the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Aegis Group plc is a member of the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index and the Remuneration Committee considers that a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return relative to similar businesses is more appropriate than a comparison with a general FTSE Index, in order to reduce the impact of general stock market trends.
