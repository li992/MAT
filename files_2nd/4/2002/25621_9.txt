40 Performance graph The Company is required to include a performance graph to measure its performance against corporate indices.
JLT has been the best performing stock in the FTSE 350 over the past five years with a total shareholder return of 377% as the graph below demonstrates.
Jardine Lloyd Thompson Total Shareholder Return from 1998 to 2002 1800 The graph plots the comparison of the Total Shareholder Return TSR of JLT since 1st January 1998 against the 1600 TSR of the FTSE 100, 250 and All Share Indices rebased to JLTs actual TSR value at that date.
1400 Total shareholder return TSR refers to share price growth and assumes dividend is reinvested over the relevant period.
1200 TSR return for JLT of 377% over the period compared to a negative total shareholder return of 13% and 11% for the 1000 FTSE 100 and All Share Indices and a return of 3.3% for the FTSE 250 Index source: datastream.
800 In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 100, 250 and All Share Indices are the most appropriate indices against 600 which the total shareholder return of JLT should be measured, as there is no directly comparable quoted peer group for the 400 Company in the UK.

Pension Increases: LT pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum subject to Inland Revenue limits.
JLT pensions accrued after 6 April, 1997 are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% per annum compound.
Discretionary benefits: There are no discretionary benefits taken into account when calculating transfer values.
JLT pensions accrued before 6 April 1997, are guaranteed to increase in payment as follows: Pension in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension: 3% per annum compound Guaranteed Minimum Pension accrued after 6 April, 1988: in line with the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 3% per annum compound.
Retirement rights: The Directors have no guaranteed right to early retirement.
Mr K A Carter exercised his right to draw his pension from 1st January 2002 and from that date no further contributions to the scheme were made on his behalf.
Transfer value: The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he she retired at the end of the year.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the cash equivalent of the directors pension benefits which would be offered by the Trustees of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme to another pension scheme as consideration for the other scheme taking on the liability for providing the directors pension benefits at retirement.
The transfer value itself does not represent an actual sum payable to the individual director as part of pay and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
