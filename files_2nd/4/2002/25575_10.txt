Directors Remuneration Report It is intended that this report should comply with the provisions of the Combined Code the Code, the Directors Report regulations 2002 and the FSA Listing Rules.
The law requires the groups auditors to audit certain disclosures within this report.
Where disclosures have been audited they are indicated as such.
Introduction and objectives The remuneration committee is a standing committee of the board, chaired by Kenneth Inglis, an independent non-executive director.
Its other members are Sir David Kinloch, an independent director and Mr Bedell-Pearce, an independent non-executive director.
During the year Mr Sweetland, a non-executive director, served as a member of the committee.
Mr Sweetland, an executive director of Friends Provident plc, is not independent and accordingly the constitution of the committee did not meet the requirement of the Code for the entire year.
Mr Sweetlands membership of the committee during the year reected the involvement of Friends Provident plc as a 67% shareholder and was considered appropriate by the board.
Mr Sweetland stood down as a member of the committee on 20 December 2002 following the appointment of Mr Bedell-Pearce, a further independent non-executive director on 18 December 2002.
The committee, which has detailed written terms of reference which are reviewed annually, has been established by the board to: a recommend to the board the companys policy on directors remuneration: b ensure that the companys executive directors and senior employees are fairly rewarded and that a significant proportion of executive directors remuneration is linked to the groups corporate, and their individual, performance: c demonstrate to shareholders that the remuneration of executive directors and senior employees of the company is determined by a committee of board members who have no personal interest in the level of remuneration of the companys executive directors or senior employees and who will pay due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the company: and d ensure that full consideration has been given to Section 1B of the Codes best practice provisions as annexed to the Listing Rules.
46 ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 During the year the remuneration committee received advice from Ernst & Young LLP and Shepherd Wedderburn in relation to the design and adoption of new employee share schemes.
In addition the committee was provided with independent remuneration research undertaken by Mclagan & Partners and DLAMCG Consulting, leading rms of executive remuneration consultants to assess comparability of the companys remuneration policies to the marketplace and in particular the remuneration policies of the companys competitors.
Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration The boards remuneration policy relating to the forthcoming financial year and subsequent financial years is that individual rewards and incentives should be aligned with the performance of the company and with the interests of shareholders.
Within this policy the board has put in place a number of remuneration and employment policies which apply to all employees, including executive directors.
These policies enable the company to recruit, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals who, in turn, will facilitate the companys pursuit of its corporate goals.
The policies are designed to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are aligned with the performance of the company and reect the companys financial and duciary responsibilities to its shareholders, clients and employees.
In framing the policies, the board takes full account of the various codes and guidelines outlining leading practice, the industry environment in which the company operates and the companys requirements in terms of its operating plan, longer term strategic goals and its position within its industry peer group.
In designing schemes of performance-related remuneration and in preparing this report the board and the remuneration committee have complied with the provisions of the Combined Code the Code and the FSA Listing Rules.
Within these policies the remuneration committee ensures that executive directors and certain other senior employees are fairly rewarded for their contribution to overall performance and will, on behalf of the board, with the aid of independent remuneration research, determine the remuneration of executive directors and certain senior employees.
Such remuneration will comprise basic salary, pension provision, annual bonus and any awards under the long term incentive plan or grants under the option scheme.
ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 47 Directors Remuneration Report Policies on the individual elements of remuneration and employment: a Salaries The salaries of all employees, including executive directors, are reviewed annually and are determined by reference to external market research.
The companys policy is to pay salaries which, when taken together with other benets, will provide a remuneration package that is competitive in the asset management sector.
b Bonus The size and distribution of the bonus pool is recommended by the remuneration committee to the board for consideration and approval.
In considering the size and in determining the distribution of the bonus pool, the committee considers the performance of the business, the need to recruit, motivate and retain high-calibre individuals, the arrangements operated by the companys competitors and the need to maintain an appropriate balance between salary and performance-related remuneration that ensures the achievement of objectives is rewarded.
During the year, subject to eligibility, certain employees were entitled, through the Staff Share Ownership Scheme, an approved profit sharing scheme, to take part or all of their bonus in ordinary shares of the company at the current prevailing market price.
Under the Staff Share Ownership Scheme, employees, including executive directors, were able to elect to take part of their bonus payment, up to a maximum of 3,000 or, if greater, 10% of salary, subject to an annual ceiling of 8,000, in the form of Ordinary Shares in the company.
During the year 147,280 Ordinary Shares at 2.16 and 11,102 Ordinary Shares at 2.725 were purchased in the market for employees under the Scheme.
Approved profit sharing schemes have now been phased out by the Inland Revenue following the introduction of the share incentive plan by the Finance Act 2000 and no tax free awards are able to be made under an approved profit sharing scheme after 31 December 2002.
The Staff Share Ownership Scheme is therefore now closed to new members.
48 ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 c Deferred bonus As at 4 March 2003 the following deferred bonus arrangements are in place for all executive directors in respect of the financial years ending in December 2003 and December 2004.
The payment of all deferred bonuses is conditional upon the director being employed by ISIS and not under notice of termination of contract where such notice has been given by the director throughout the relevant financial period and at the date of payment.

Both schemes are all employee share schemes and all employees including executive directors who meet certain criteria are eligible to participate.
The savings-related share schemes were introduced to replace the Staff Share Ownership Scheme following its closure on 31 December 2002 and accordingly neither scheme was operational during the year.
It is intended that both schemes will be activated following the announcement of the groups year end results.
ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 49 Directors Remuneration Report e Share incentive schemes On 20 December 2002 shareholders approved the adoption of a share option scheme, the ISIS Asset Management plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2002 Executive Scheme and a share award scheme, the ISIS Asset Management plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
In both cases participation is entirely at the discretion of the board based on an assessment of individual contribution to the group during the year.
The introduction of the new share incentive schemes increases the potential for greater importance to be placed upon the performance related element of total remuneration.
By combining grants and awards under the share incentive schemes and by using appropriate performance criteria, the remuneration committee will ensure that the schemes usage is part of a balanced and well thought out remuneration policy.
The quantum of the combined award can be inuenced by the desired positioning relative to the market in terms of overall package value, the desired mix between the elements of remuneration within a given package value, the limitations of best practice on award levels for executive directors, the strength of the performance conditions applied in the schemes, and dilution limits to protect shareholder value.
In order to ensure that the assessment of performance conditions detailed on pages 51 to 53 is independent, Ernst & Young LLP will report to the remuneration committee as to whether the performance criteria under both the 2002 Executive Scheme and the LTIP have been met.
The share incentive schemes were introduced to replace the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, details of which can be found on pages 51 to 53.
Neither of the new share incentive schemes were operational during the year.
It is intended that option grants will be made under the 2002 Executive Scheme following the announcement of the groups year end results in March 2003 and that no further grants will be made under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme.
50 ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Policy on grants and awards under the Share incentive schemes The companys policy for the granting of options under the 2002 Executive Scheme and awards under the LTIP is that grants and awards are based on an assessment of individual contribution to the business and independent advice obtained on current remuneration practices.
Each year the remuneration committee will recommend to the board the individuals to whom options should be granted or LTIPs awarded.
Participation under the 2002 Executive Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan is limited so that the market value of shares over which a participant may be granted options or awarded LTIPs annually does not exceed an amount equal to 2.5 times and 2 times respectively the participants base salary at the relevant grant or award date.
The current intention is, however, that following any initial grant or award such as for the purposes of his or her recruitment, the board will only make annual grants or awards up to, in aggregate, a maximum of one times the participants base salary.
In the event that exceptional circumstances exist that require the board to exceed the annual grant or award of one times annual base salary any excess will be subject to more challenging performance conditions.
Following the acquisition of RSAI, commitments were made to grant share options to the value of 2.5 times base salary to Messrs Talbut and Criticos.
The board intend that participation in the LTIP will be limited to the senior management team.
No options or awards will be granted at a discount and no re-testing will be performed under either scheme.
2002 Executive Scheme The Exercise of options granted under the 2002 Executive Scheme will be dependent on the achievement by the company of specified thresholds of earnings per share before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional costs EPS growth in excess of the growth in the Retail Price Index RPI over a three year performance period commencing on the first day of the accounting period in which the grant was made.
An option will not become exercisable unless the growth in the EPS of the company over the period exceeds the growth in the RPI over the same period by 9%.
Where that 9% target is achieved, one half of the number of ordinary shares forming the option will become exercisable.
ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 51 Directors Remuneration Report For an option to become exercisable in full, the growth in the EPS of the company over the period must exceed the growth in the RPI over the same period by a minimum of 24%.
The number of ordinary shares the subject of an option which will become exercisable will increase on a sliding scale as illustrated below if the growth in the EPS exceeds the growth in the RPI by between 9% and 24% over the performance period.
The EPS measure is chosen because it is designed to enable the 2002 Executive Scheme to reward sustained improvement in the groups underlying financial performance.
52 ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Long Term Incentive Plan Vesting of the ordinary shares that are the subject of an award under the Long Term Incentive Plan will be dependent upon the total shareholder return TSR of the company compared to the TSR of the other companies who formed the FTSE 250 Index at the start of each performance period the comparator companies over a three year performance period commencing on the first day of the accounting period in which the award was made.
In order to determine how much of an award will vest, the remuneration committee will compare the TSR of the company with that of the companies that constituted the FTSE 250 Index published by the London Stock Exchange plc immediately before the date of the award.
At the end of the performance period, the company and each of the comparator companies the comparator list will be listed and ranked in accordance with the growth in their TSR over the performance period.
The number of ordinary shares which will vest will depend upon the ranking of the company in the comparator list in accordance with the vesting table below, described as follows.
For below median TSR performance no awards will vest: for TSR performance between the median and twenty-fourth centile 125th and 60th position in the index awards will vest on a straight-line basis between 35% for median and 100% for twenty-fourth centile.
The TSR measure reects the movement in the value of shares plus any dividends declared during the relevant period.
It is, therefore, chosen as the performance measure for the Long Term Incentive Plan as it is directly related to movements in shareholder value.

ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 53 Directors Remuneration Report Performance Graph The graph below compares the performance of the company for the five financial periods ending 31 December 2002 based on the TSR for each period assuming all dividends are reinvested to ordinary shareholders compared with the TSR for each period on a notional investment made up of shares of the group of companies from which the FTSE 250 Index of companies is calculated.
The FTSE 250 Index has been chosen as the comparator index as it is the index that includes the company and is considered an appropriate benchmark as there are very few comparable listed asset management businesses.
It is therefore the group against which the Long Term Incentive Plan is measured.
54 ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 f Policy on other benets The company provides all staff with life assurance cover.
The companys policy in relation to cars is to provide them only to employees where the use of a car is essential to the fullment of their role.
The company is currently phasing out the provision of non-essential cars as they fall to be replaced, offering an annual cash allowance instead.
g Policy on pension The companys policy on pension provision is to provide a means whereby each employee either receives a pension at retirement age or funding to operate a money purchase pension plan.
New employees are provided with funding to enable them to operate a money purchase pension plan.
The funding rate varies according to the age of the employee.
Pension payments are based on basic salary and no other cash payments or benets are pensionable.
h Policy on non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive directors fees for the year to 31 December 2002 are set out on page 58.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts.

Non-executive directors must submit to re-election at least every three years and are not eligible for bonuses or participation in savings related share schemes or share incentive schemes.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to join any of the companys pension schemes.
No pension contributions are made on their behalf and no nonexecutive director receives a salary from the company.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole within the limits stipulated in the companys Articles of Association.

ISIS ASSET MANAGEMENT plc REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 55 Directors Remuneration Report i Policy on contracts of employment The companys policy regarding contracts of employment is that all senior employees, including executive directors, should be offered rolling contracts of no longer than twelve months.
Where it is commercially appropriate to protect the company by entering into a longer-term contract with any employee, including an executive director, it will be for a longer initial period, reverting to align with the companys policy thereafter.
The remuneration committee, in considering contracts, has regard to compensation commitments in respect of termination and believes that these are best addressed by restricting the term of the contract.
In the event of a termination, the remuneration committee would consider all the relevant factors and seek a just solution.
Statement on executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment Mr P A K Arthur, Mr K J Back, Mr H Carter, Mr N Criticos, Mr I J Paterson Brown and Mr R Talbut have current service contracts with the company that are for a rolling period of one year, details of which are summarised below.
