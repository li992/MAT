Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in compliance with the UKLA Listing Rules and the new Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
In accordance with these Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Companys AGM in May.
Details of the resolution can be found in the Circular accompanying this report.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors and its members throughout the year were Mr Collum Chairman, Mr Jackson and Dr Jaffe.
The Committee meets no less than twice a year and seeks independent advice, where appropriate, for the purpose of determining all aspects of the remuneration of each Executive Director.
The remuneration of each Executive Director is determined by the Committee including the award of annual bonus, deferred bonus and share options, as are the terms of their service agreements.
When appropriate, the Committee invites the views of the Group Chief Executive Dr Fellner, Group Human Resources Director, Mr Peter Nicholls, and commissions reports from expert remuneration consultants.
In determining salary and bonus levels for 2002, the Company appointed Arthur Andersen and subsequently Deloitte & Touche to advise the Committee.
During 2002 Arthur Andersen also provided general taxation advice to the Company.
The Committee also recommends to the Board the fees paid to the Chairman.
The members of the Committee do not participate in determining or recommending their own fees.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board on the joint recommendation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors In determining the Groups policy, and in constructing the remuneration arrangements of each Executive Director, the Board, advised by the Committee, aims to provide remuneration packages that are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the highest calibre.
To achieve this objective, the Committee takes account of information from internal and independent sources.
The total remuneration of each individual Executive Director is benchmarked against the relevant sector.
Celltech is one of Europes largest biotechnology companies and also operates a significant business within the US.
Celltechs policy is to provide remuneration generally at levels that are broadly aligned with the mid-points for equivalent roles in comparable companies in Europe and the US.
A high proportion, in excess of 40%, of the total remuneration is performance-related.
Performance measures are balanced between absolute financial measures and sector comparative measures to achieve maximum alignment between executive and shareholder objectives.
Base salaries can be supplemented by performance-related bonuses.
Performance objectives are set at the start of each year.
All medium long-term incentives are delivered in the form of Celltech shares and share options.
In order to link further each Executive Directors interests to the interests of its shareholders, Celltech expects Executive Directors to commit to building and maintaining a personal shareholding of one times salary.
For 2003 and subsequent years, the Companys policy on the remuneration of any person who serves as an Executive Director of the Company is as follows: Components of the remuneration package The principal components of Executive Directors remuneration packages are base salary, short term incentives, medium long-term incentives, and pension benefits.
The policy in relation to each of these components, and key terms of the various incentive and benefit programmes, is explained further below.
Base salary Base salaries are reviewed annually taking into account recommendations on individual performance and salary levels in comparable companies.
In formulating its decision the Committee takes into account appropriate benchmarks, currently the UK pharmaceutical sector and a bespoke UK FTSE comparator group consisting of the larger 50 constituents of the FTSE mid-250 index and the smaller 30 constituents of the FTSE 100 index.
These benchmarks were chosen at a time when Celltech was number 84 in the FTSE 100.
Whilst the pharmaceutical sector benchmark provided a useful reference point, there were very few companies within the identified comparator group that were comparable to Celltech in terms of size and complexity.
On the other hand, the bespoke FTSE analysis, whilst not providing sector-specific benchmarks, is based on comparator companies which are more comparable to Celltech in terms of company size and are therefore, potentially, more relevant benchmarks.
Each Executive Directors base salary is broadly aligned with the mid-points of the bespoke UK FTSE comparator group and an adjusted version normalised to reflect company size and complexity.
Base salaries aligned with these mid-points, combined with cash and deferred bonus incentives, continue to provide competitive compensation packages, in which performance-related components represent a substantial element.
30 Celltech Annual Report 2002 Annual performance bonus Executive Directors are eligible for an annual discretionary bonus, whereby individual performance objectives for each Executive Director are established at the beginning of the financial year.
Performance-related payments may be paid annually, dependent upon achievement measured against objectives, and are limited to a maximum of 40% of basic salary for each Executive Director with a maximum of 50% in the case of the Group Chief Executive.
The objectives are set by reference to a combination of corporate and individual performance.
Deferred bonus Executive Directors are also eligible to participate under Celltechs Deferred Bonus Plan the Plan under which awards may be made over shares having a value of up to 100% of the Directors annual cash bonus, which, as stated above, is itself based on individual performance objectives being met and is not therefore subject to any further performance conditions.
Awards vest in two equal tranches, on the first and second anniversaries of the date on which the award is made and on vesting, the award converts to a share option which is exercisable over 10 years.
Participation is at the discretion of the Committee.
Celltech operates the Plan in order to provide additional incentives to its key senior executives, recognising that the retention and recruitment of such employees is critical to the Companys long-term success.
Longer-term performance incentives Executive Directors are also incentivised by the grant of share options.
Executive options are granted under the rules of the Celltech Group plc 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders at the AGM in 2001.
The allocation of discretionary share options takes into account the future potential contribution of each Director.
Options are subject to a performance requirement determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Currently this performance requirement is that options granted under the Scheme will only become exercisable if Celltechs share price has exceeded the median growth in share price of a comparator group of companies over a period of three to five years from the date of grant of the options.
The performance criterion is measured cumulatively over the performance period, which means that if the performance criterion has not been met on the third anniversary of the date of grant, the options may still be capable of exercise provided that the performance criterion is met during the performance period commencing at the date of grant and ending on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
If the performance measure has not been met after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant of the option, the option is not normally capable of exercise other than for a period of six weeks prior to expiration of the options on the tenth anniversary of their grant when options are capable of exercise without restriction save for continued employment.
It is believed that measurement of performance from a fixed date, coupled with nonexercisability of the options after five years if the target has not been met, reflects the core principles of the ABI Guidelines.
The Committee reviews annually the most appropriate performance measures based upon which options may be granted and or become exercisable.
The Committee has concluded that whilst it is utilising income generated from its pharmaceuticals business primarily to fund its Research and Development R&D programmes for its new products, the most appropriate measure of performance remains share price growth against a group of comparator companies of a similar size.
It will continue to review whether, at an appropriate time in the future, growth in earnings per share may become a more appropriate measure.
The comparator group selected for performance measurement is a total of approximately 70 to 80 companies, comprising larger members of the FTSE mid-250 index and smaller members of the FTSE 100 index.
This comparator group is different to that used for base salary and is reviewed at the time each grant of options is made.
Performance will be measured by calculating the share price growth for each company within the comparator group.
The median ie, the middle when ranked from highest to lowest of the calculated growth figures will be taken and will then be compared with share price growth, over the same period, for Celltech.
The current constituents of the comparator group applicable to 2002 awards, excluding the Company, are: Hanson Granada Imperial Chemical Industries Smith & Nephew Wolseley Scottish & Newcastle Gallaher Group United Utilities Friends Provident Next Safeway P&O Princess Cruises Morrison Wm Supermarkets ARM Holdings Rolls-Royce Hays Enterprise Oil Northern Rock Capita Group Man Group now Shell Resources plc Innogy Holdings now RWE AG Canary Wharf Group Sage Group British Airways Shire Pharmaceuticals Group EMI Group British Land Co Corus Group Extel Severn Trent Brambles Industries Bunzl GKN Johnson Matthey Bradford & Bingley International Power Electrocomponents Rexam Daily Mail & General Trust Emap Tomkins Associated British Ports Signet Group United Business Media Whitbred Rank Group Misys Provident Financial RMC Group Peninsular & Oriental Steam Nav Co Carlton Communications BPB Lonmin CMG now Logica CMG Liberty International Holdings Schroders Tate & Lyle Slough Estates Hammerson Chubb Associated British Ports Hldgs Kelda Group Pilkington Serco Group AWG Trinity Mirror Britannic Debenhams BBA Group Spirent Alliance UniChem Aegis Group Amec Smith WH Group Celltech Annual Report 2002 31 Directors Remuneration Report continued The limit on the market value of shares which may be placed under option annually for each Executive Director is set by the Committee.
The overriding limit on the grant of options to an individual in any year under the 2001 Scheme is normally four times remuneration except in very exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
This limit does not include options granted solely for the purpose of compensating UK employees for the cost of bearing Celltechs liability to employers National Insurance Contributions.
In practice, this limit is not likely to exceed two times a participants annual remuneration ie, salary plus annual cash bonus opportunity.
Options, that are over shares worth more than two times remuneration, will be subject to more demanding conditions.
It is the current policy that for such options, share price growth must exceed the median by at least 5%.
Executive Directors also hold options under the Celltech Chiroscience 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Celltech Group 1993 Executive Share Option Scheme.
The performance conditions applicable to options under these schemes are set out on page 38.
Options are no longer granted under these schemes.
Since 2001 executive options have been granted under the Celltech Group plc 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme for eligible employees and Directors.
Under this Scheme all eligible Directors and employees are invited to subscribe for options which may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
This is an all-employee plan to which performance conditions do not apply.
Full details of Directors interests in ordinary shares of the Company together with options granted and exercised in 2002 are set out on pages 35 to 37.
Pensions and other benefits audited Executive Directors, other than Dr Fellner, participate in the Executive Director tier of the Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme CP&LAS.
The CP&LAS is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational pension scheme providing a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary by Normal Retirement Age NRA.
The NRA in the Executive Director tier of the Scheme is 60.
Dr Fellner is a member of a contributory money purchase scheme funded with the objective to provide a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary by a normal retirement age of 60.
The potential benefits arising from the CP&LAS for the Executive Directors in 2002 were as follows: Name M Lee P V Allen Age 44 47 Service 4 years 11 years Accrued pension as at 1 1 02 10,342 31,452 Inflation 175 534 Increase in annual pension accruing in 2002 3,259 3,297 Accrued annual pension as at 31 12 02 13,776 35,283 Transfer value of accrued pension at the start of the year based on market conditions at 31 12 01 88,781 294,874 Employee contribution 5,796 5,796 Increase in cash equivalent transfer value of pension arising in 2002 less member contributions paid in 2002 19,643 20,708 Transfer value of accrued pension at the end of the year based on market conditions as at 31 12 02 114,220 321,378 The increase in transfer value of pension arising in 2002 less member contributions paid in 2002 was 21,309 for Dr Lee and 24,660 for Mr Allen.
Appointment of Directors and service contracts Service contracts for Executive Directors including those subject to re-election at this years AGM provide for 12 months notice of termination, other than in the case of Dr Fellner where the notice period is two years.
The notice period in Dr Fellners service contract was in line with market practice at the time of his appointment and there are no plans to change it, particularly as he will succeed Mr Jackson as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, at which time the notice period will no longer apply.
The Committee has determined that all future appointments to the Board will be on the terms of a contract that can be terminated by the Company at any time on one years notice.
Typically, on termination, Directors have been paid contractual benefits salary, bonus and non-cash benefits in lieu of 12 months notice.
