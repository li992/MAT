REMUNERATION REPORT GENERAL POLICY In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors, the remuneration committee has regard to two fundamental principles: the importance of recruiting and retaining management of the highest calibre: and linking reward to the Companys performance.
The committee has applied these principles to develop remuneration packages which: provide a competitive base salary designed to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre and to reflect their role and experience: provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets, reflect the Companys objectives and recognise the importance of motivating management to focus on annual, as well as longer-term, performance: and directly align the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
REMUNERATION PACKAGE The four components of the remuneration package are base salary and benefits, annual cash bonus, long-term incentive arrangements and pension.
The following sections provide an outline of current practice with regard to each component.
BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the committee after a review of the individuals performance and market trends.
For guidance, the committee has regard to available research and published remuneration information on comparable companies.
Salary policy within the rest of the Group is also taken into consideration.
Benefits typically include a car and life, disability and health insurance.
The value of benefits is not pensionable.
The executive directors waived any increase in base salary for the year under review.
M P Green and G M Murphy have also waived any increase in base salary for the 2002 03 financial year.
ANNUAL CASH BONUS The directors annual performance-related cash bonus scheme provides executive directors with an incentive to achieve demanding short-term performance targets.
The bonus earned, which is not pensionable, depends principally upon the Companys performance as measured against a specific target or targets set by the committee each year.
For the year under review, the scheme provided for a bonus of up to 100 per cent of salary, and the targets related to operating performance and individual objectives.
M P Green, G M Murphy and P C Murray have waived any bonuses they earned under the scheme.

34 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS Share options Directors can participate in the Sharesave scheme and options granted to them under that scheme are included in Table 2.
They can also be granted options under the Carlton Executive Share Option Scheme 1999.
During the year under review directors were granted options under this scheme, details of which are included in Table 2.
These options were granted as part of a phased grant.
The exercise of executive share options is subject to satisfaction of performance conditions set by the committee.
This figure represents the difference between the market price of option shares at the exercise date and their exercise price.
It does not represent the net proceeds received as no account has been taken of option shares which have been retained, the tax liability or, where option shares have been sold, the sale commissions and expenses.
It includes gains on exercise by the following individuals who ceased to be directors during the year i B A Cragg: gains of 82,192 on the exercise of his vested DABS and LTIS awards and 86,780 on the exercise of DABS and LTIS awards that were permitted to vest early and were exercised during the year: and ii N N Walmsley: gains of 103,959 on the exercise of his vested DABS and LTIS awards and 119,251 on the exercise of DABS and LTIS awards that were permitted to vest early and were exercised during the year.
2 The market price of an Ordinary share on 30 September 2002 was 109p and the range of prices during the year to 30 September 2002 was between 106p and 286p.
3 There have been no changes in these interests between the year end and the date of this document.
35 Deferred Annual Bonus Share plan DABS The plan, which operates on an annual basis, provides that a participant may choose to invest up to 50 pr cent of his net i. e. after tax annual cash bonus to purchase Carlton Ordinary shares bonus shares.
The investing participant is then conditionally awarded a number of Carlton Ordinary shares restricted shares with a value that is the gross i. e. pre-tax equivalent of the annual cash bonus so invested.
Provided the bonus shares are retained for three years and the participant remains employed by the Group for four years, the restricted shares will vest and thereafter become available to the participant.
The directors interests in non-vested restricted shares conditionally awarded under this plan are shown in Table 3.
Long-Term Incentive Share plan LTIS During the period, no awards were made under the LTIS plan.
It is intended that no further awards will be made in future under this plan.
The LTIS plan provided for a participant to be conditionally awarded a number of Carlton Ordinary shares with a value equating to a percentage of his her base salary.
The percentage was determined by the committee.
Provided the participant remained employed by the Group for four years, the Companys performance, measured on the basis of total shareholder return TSR i. e. share price movement and dividends paid against the FTSE-100 companies over a three year performance period, determined what proportion if any of the award would vest at the end of four years.
The proportion and targets were determined by the committee.
The directors interests in non-vested shares conditionally awarded under this plan are shown in Table 3.

These have since been converted into options over Ordinary shares.
The options are exerciseable at a nominal price and subject to certain conditions being satisfied as summarised above.
2 These conditional awards take the form of options granted over Ordinary shares.
The options are exercisable at a nominal price and subject to certain conditions being satisfied as summarised above.
3 During the year, the last conditions relating to these options were satisfied, they vested and accordingly they are now disclosed in the Options Table 2.
The aggregate value of options which vested during the year was 161,822 2001: 522,000.
They all related to M P Green 2001: 269,000.
These value figures are based on the market price of an Ordinary share on the relevant vesting date.
They are notional figures as value is not realised until the option is exercised.
Upon exercise, the value is disclosed in the Options Table 2, and may differ from such notional value, depending on the share price movement in the intervening period.
37 The Carlton Equity Participation Plan EPP The EPP received shareholder approval at the AGM on 1 March 2001.
A summary of the main features of the plan is set out below.
Participation in the EPP applies to executive directors and selected senior executives.
Participants invited to take part in the EPP are required to commit Carlton shares EPP shares by a specified date to qualify for a matching award.
Normally a participant is entitled to commit EPP shares to a value of up to 100 per cent of basic salary save for the first award where the maximum EPP share commitment was to a value of up to 200 per cent of basic salary.
A matching award comprises both an award of free shares in the form of a nil-price option and an option grant over shares at market value.
The extent to which a matching award will vest depends on the participant retaining his her EPP shares and the performance conditions relating to the matching award being satisfied.
The maximum matching award will be free shares equal in number to three times the EPP shares and options at market value over an equal number of shares.
The principal performance conditions applicable to the first awards will be measured on the basis of the Companys TSR performance against that of other major UK media companies and the FTSE-100 companies.
None of the matching award will vest if the Companys TSR is below median for the media comparator group.
On 5 December 2001 the first awards were made under the terms of the EPP, including to the directors as shown in Table 4.

Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase in line with inflation up to 5 per cent a year.

OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS Executive directors are encouraged to accept non-executive directorships offered by FTSE-100 and FTSE-250 companies and other organisations which provide industry experience or public service.
Outside appointments are subject to prior Board approval, taking into account existing duties and potential conflicts of interest.
