At 31 March 2002 the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST held options over 1,868,203 ordinary shares of the Company under the SAYE scheme 2001 2,027,481.
Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 of the Companies Act, the executive directors are deemed to be interested in these shares.
2 Mr and Mrs Michael Spencer own approximately 42% of IPGL which in turn owns approximately 98.4% of INHBV.
Accordingly Mr and Mrs Spencer are deemed by Schedule 13 of the Companies Act to be interested in all the shares in the Company held by IPGL and INHBV.
A Trust fund, of which their children are beneficiaries, holds a further 10,000 shares.
David Gelber owns 2.7% and Declan Kelly owns 2.1% of IPGL.
3 The decrease in the interest of Michael Spencer during the year was due to minority shareholders of INHBV exchanging those shareholdings for ICAP shares.
It does not represent a diminution in the economic interest of Messrs Spencer, Gelber and Kelly in the share capital of the Company.
4 Robert Knox III is a director of Zions which owns 5.24% of the Company.
5 The board has decided that all contracts or other forms of arrangement whereby a director or other employee governed by the Model Code may become entitled to receive or become obliged to make a payment calculated by reference to the Companys share price or movements thereof should in future be subject to the provisions of the Model Code, so far as the Company is concerned, and that in future any such transactions by directors would also be announced in the same manner as if they were dealings in securities.

On 10 December 2001 David Gelber entered into a down spread bet on the equivalent of 60,000 ICAP shares at 851.5p.

The above directors have indicated that they intend to close the above on exercise of the relevant options.
