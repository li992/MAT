Prudential plc Annual Report 2002 41 Remuneration Report continued for year ended 31 December 2002 Directors Pensions and Life Assurance It is the Companys policy to offer executive directors the facility to save for retirement through efficient pension vehicles.
Changes were introduced by the UK Government in 1989 which restrict the pension provision which can be made under Inland Revenue approved pension schemes for new entrants after 31 May 1989 to benefits on annual basic salary up to a threshold known as the earnings cap.
The earnings cap for the 2002 2003 tax year is 97,200 per annum.
For this reason UK executive directors employed since 1989 are offered a combination of Inland Revenue approved pension schemes and supplementary provision.
UK Inland Revenue Approved Pension Schemes Executive directors are eligible for one of two Inland Revenue approved pension schemes on the same basis as other employees.
The Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS is a non-contributory defined benefit scheme, which provides a pension of 1 60th of Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of service on retirement at age 60 with an option to commute pension for a tax free cash sum.
The scheme also provides on death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary, a spouses pension of the greater of 25 per cent of pensionable salary or 54 per cent of prospective pension at 60, and childrens pensions of the greater of 8.33 per cent of pensionable salary or 18 per cent of prospective pension at 60 in accordance with the scheme rules.
On death in retirement, a spouses pension of 50 per cent of the pension available at retirement before commutation is payable and a lump sum is also payable if death occurs in the first five years of retirement.
Some of the pension payable is guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices Index capped at five per cent, but in recent years all pensions in payment have been increased fully in line with the Retail Prices Index.
Mark Tucker, having commenced employment before 1989, is eligible for benefits from PSPS on all basic salary.
Philip Broadley and Mark Wood are eligible for benefits from PSPS on basic salary up to the earnings cap.
Jonathan Bloomer only receives a lump sum death benefit of four times basic salary up to the earnings cap from PSPS.
The M&G Group Pension Scheme MGGPS is a contributory defined benefit scheme that provides a target pension of 2 3rds of Final Pensionable Earnings on retirement at age 60 for an employee with 30 years or more potential service.
The MGGPS also has an option to commute pension for a tax free cash sum.
The scheme provides on death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary and a spouses pension of 50 per cent of prospective pension at 60.
Some of the pension payable is guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail Prices Index capped at five per cent, but in recent years all pensions have been increased fully in line with the Retail Prices Index.
Members currently contribute 2.4 per cent of basic salary towards the cost of the benefits.
Michael McLintock is eligible for benefits under MGGPS on basic salary up to the earnings cap.
US Directors Clark Manning participates in the JNL Defined Contribution Retirement Plan which is a US tax qualified defined contribution plan a 401k plan under which the total Company contribution for 2002 was 13,973.
Supplementary Arrangements David Clementi is provided with a salary supplement, part of which is a contribution to a personal pension, and life assurance provision of four times his annual fees under the Prudential Supplementary Life Assurance Scheme PSLAS.
The premiums paid by the Company to this scheme are a taxable benefit.
Jonathan Bloomer, Philip Broadley, Michael McLintock and Mark Wood are entitled to taxable salary supplements calculated on a formula based on their basic salary not covered for pension benefits under a UK Inland Revenue approved scheme.
These directors may elect to have this salary supplement paid directly to them or to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS established in their name.
In either case it is a taxable emolument.
In addition, these directors are eligible for death benefits broadly equivalent to the PSPS death benefits both the lump sum and the capitalised value of spouses and childrens pensions on that part of their basic salary not covered by the Inland Revenue approved scheme under the Prudential Supplementary Life Assurance Scheme PSLAS.
Clark Manning is provided with life assurance cover of two times basic salary.
