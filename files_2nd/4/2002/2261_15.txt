Report on remuneration The management resources committee The management resources committee MRC comprises all the independent non-executive directors with the exception of the Group chairman, Rob Margetts.
Its members are Gran Lundberg Chairman, Fabiola Arredondo appointed November 2001, Julie Baddeley, Matthew Miau appointed January 2002, and Chris ODonnell.
Roberto Mendoza was appointed a non-executive director in October 2002 and has become a member of the MRC.
Until their retirement on 18 January 2002 Harry Groome and Howard Macdonald had been members of the MRC.
Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the MRC they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The Group human resources director, Rob Lourey, attends in an advisory capacity and acts as secretary.
Remuneration policy The MRC sets the overall remuneration policy of The BOC Group and makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration.
It meets approximately six times a year.
The terms of reference conform with best practice.
The MRC determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team including basic salary, performance-related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension benefits.
The MRC does not retain remuneration consultants but appoints professional external advisors as it sees fit.
During the year professional advice was sought from external consultants Deloitte & Touche.
These advisors did not provide any other services to the Group.
The MRC is also provided with information and data from national and international surveys on executive pay and conditions such as those provided by Towers Perrin, Mercer Human Resources consultants, Watson Wyatt and Monks Partnership Limited.
The MRC also reviews the remuneration of the Group chairman following a recommendation from the chief executive and senior independent director, though the board as a whole determine the non-executive directors fees.
The fees of the non-executive directors are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to The BOC Groups affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed companies.
Non-executive directors fees will be increased from 30,000 to 37,000 per annum and the committee chair fees increased from 5,000 to 8,000 per annum, effective 1 January 2003.
These increases, after tax, will be used to acquire shares in the company which will be held by the non-executive directors for the remaining period of their term of office with the company.
BOCs remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and retain executives of the highest calibre so that The BOC Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
In setting remuneration levels the MRC takes into account the remuneration practices found in other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity and seeks to benchmark its whole remuneration at about the median level for this group.
During the year the MRC carried out a review of executive remuneration packages and decided that a realignment was necessary to support the companys business strategy to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency and to ensure that the packages were market competitive.
In reaching its conclusions the MRC took the view that performance related remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration thereby aligning the interests of directors with those of shareholders, which would be reflected through share price growth and dividends.
As such, a proposal will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to adopt new long-term incentive arrangements.
These arrangements are intended to encourage innovation and value-added growth and strengthen the link between short-term performance and sustainable improvement in shareholder value over the longer term.
The performance measures for the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP will be based one third on Earnings Per Share EPS before exceptional items, one third on Return on Capital Employed ROCE before exceptional items and one third on the companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to industry based comparator groups that is, an index of FTSE based manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group.
The performance measure for the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS 2003 will be assessed on the growth in basic EPS before exceptional items as reported in the annual report and accounts.
The MRC consider these performance measures to be important drivers of sustainable improvement in shareholder value that focus executives attention and effort on profitable growth and capital efficiency in both the short and long term.
Details of the arrangements are summarised in the chairmans letter and explanatory notes to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
The MRC believes that executives interests in long-term share price performance is an important link to future organisational performance.
Additionally, the MRC encourages the executive management group to grow personal shareholdings in the business over time.
It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding equivalent in value to one years gross salary.
The MRC believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive package will facilitate the building of such a shareholding over a period of time.
Remuneration components Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median market rates drawn from external market data and take account of an executives experience, responsibilities and performance.
Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Executive salaries are normally reviewed annually by the MRC.
Remuneration for those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOCs health care insurance scheme and, where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing and childrens education fees.
These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the international assignment programme.
Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies.
Benefits in kind do not form part of pensionable earnings.
56 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Variable compensation plan The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable compensation bonus plan.
The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans.
The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an annual basis by the MRC and performance against these targets is reviewed by the MRC on a six monthly basis.
The MRC considers that a six monthly review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year.
The targets are based on EPS before exceptional items and ROCE before exceptional items at Group level.
Bonuses are assessed two thirds on these financial targets with the remaining third based on personal objectives derived from BOCs strategic priorities, including safety and growth initiatives.
Executives can be awarded an annual bonus of 80 per cent of salary for the achievement in full of both stretch financial targets and their personal objectives.
Bonuses in excess of 80 per cent of salary can be paid for exceptional financial performance.
There is a threshold performance level below which no bonus is paid.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid half yearly following the MRC review.
Details of the payments to directors are included in the directors remuneration for the year.
Retirement benefits Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC senior executive pension scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension arrangement.
Where necessary, the directors pensionable pay is limited by the earnings cap provisions of the Finance Act 1989.
In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the pensions cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.
This supplement is recorded in the directors emoluments and is not taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
In the US, the BOC Top-Hat pension plan is an unfunded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit pension arrangement.
Details of the individual directors pension arrangements are shown on page 58.
Service contracts The companys policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the attainment of retirement age.
In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the companys policy is that it should be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months notice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of salary, and certain benefits, for the notice period.
All current executive directors have service contracts which are summarised on page 58.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service.
They do not participate in the Groups variable compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they receive any benefits in kind.
Share option plans Executive directors and other eligible employees participate in The BOC Group Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS which was introduced in 1995.
The scheme uses newly issued and purchased shares.
The MRC sets out the guidelines for the awards each year.
The guidelines take account of personal performance and local market practice.
Options are granted at the full market value of the companys shares at the time of grant and are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant subject to the performance condition, set by the MRC, being met.
The options vest when the companys EPS growth before exceptional items is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI by three per cent per annum over any three year performance period.
The MRC considers this performance condition to be a challenging performance hurdle when compared to the companys ten year EPS compound annual growth rate before exceptional items of around four per cent.
The performance measure is assessed annually and is based on basic EPS before exceptional items as reported in the annual report.
In countries where it is not appropriate to grant share options, grants are made as share appreciation rights and, on exercise, the gain is delivered in cash.
The rules for such grants are similar to those for share options.
Subject to shareholder approval of the proposed ESOS 2003 no further options will be granted under this scheme.
Prior to 1995 options were granted to executive directors under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1994 Executive Option Scheme and the Executive Share Purchase Plan.
In line with market practice at that time the vesting of these awards is not subject to performance conditions.
UK based directors are also eligible to participate in the Inland Revenue approved BOC Savings Related Share Option Scheme which is open to all UK employees with one years service or more.
Percentage This graph shows BOCs TSR performance compared to the 40 FTSE 100 index TSR over the last five years.
TSR is defined 30 as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
This provides 20 a basis for comparison as a relevant equity index in which 10 BOC is a constituent member.
The company believes that 0 other indices and time periods display aspects of relative -10 performance on a more appropriate basis see Group -20 chairmans statement and LTIP proposals.

Under the plan the shares awarded vested after two years provided a performance condition was met.
The performance condition required EPS growth before exceptional items to equal, or exceed, the growth in the RPI by three per cent per annum over a two year period.
Details of awards made to directors prior to their appointment to the board and which vested during the year are shown on page 63.
No further awards will be made under the plan.
Share incentive unit plan Between 1989 and 1995 awards were made to executives under an incentive arrangement linked to the growth in the companys share price.

The amounts shown as converted to cash in the year include interest earned from the date of conversion.
The share incentive unit plan provides for cash payments to executives based on increases in the share price over a period of up to eight years from the time of grant.
Grants under the plan were made between 1989 and 1995 to supplement or substitute for grants under the share option schemes.
No grants have been made since 1995.
Executives may elect to convert share incentive units to cash provided that the units have been held for three years.
The fixed cash sum, determined by reference to the share price on the date of election over and above the original grant price, will earn interest at one per cent above the HSBC base rate.
A full cash payment can only be received by an executive after eight years but limited early payments may be made in certain circumstances between the fourth and eighth years, at the discretion of the management resources committee.
The plan includes significant forfeiture penalties in the event that an executive leaves the company other than on retirement before the expiration of the eight year period.
On normal retirement, or earlier at the discretion of the management resources committee, an executive will normally continue to participate in the scheme so long as he observes a non-compete covenant in favour of the company.
Full payment will be made at the eighth anniversary or earlier at the discretion of the management resources committee.
Former directors were granted their share incentive units when they were executive directors of the company.
