20 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Report of the Boar Report of the Board on d on Dir Directors ectors Remuneration Remuneration For the year ended 31 December 2002 Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises the three independent non-executive directors, D A Haxby, B Cottingham and N N Broadhurst.
D A Haxby acts as Chairman to the Committee.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the company other than as a shareholder, nor have they any day-to-day involvement in the running of the business or conicts of interests arising from cross-directorships.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No director plays a part in discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the executive directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted the Chief Executive about its proposals.
The Committee also sought advice from Monks Partnership in their consideration of executive directors remuneration packages for 2002 and 2003.
No other services were provided by Monks Partnership during the year, although subsequent to their appointment they were acquired by the companys external auditors, .
In addition, during the year M W G Collins, Director Treasury & Risk Management, has performed some financial modelling for the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration Policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre necessary to maintain the groups strong growth and profit performance and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors: Basic salary and benets: Annual bonus: Long term incentives: and Pension and life assurance arrangements.
The companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related.
As described below, each of the executive directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 75% of their basic salary, together with the benets of participation in long term incentive arrangements.
The fees paid to non-executive directors are determined by a committee of the board comprising the executive directors.
During the year this committee sought advice from Monks Partnership in their consideration of an appropriate level of fees and M W G Collins, Director Treasury & Risk Management, independently gathered information on the fees payable in similar companies for comparative purposes.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 21 Basic Salary and Benets The basic salary for executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee, prior to the beginning of each year, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual director and having regard to relevant market comparisons from independent sources based on objective research.
The policy is to provide basic salaries in the range of median to upper quartile levels by comparison to relevant comparable companies.
There is the potential for upper quartile earnings when justied by corporate and individual performance.
Following the Committees review in late 2002, the board agreed the following changes to the annual salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2003: 1 January 1 January 2003 2002 000 000 S P Mahon 420 350 M W G Collins 205 165 J J Corr 210 175 I S Cummine 275 220 In making these recommendations to the Board, the Remuneration Committee took account of the outstanding performance of the group over a number of years, including 2002.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benets in kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus The targets which trigger annual cash bonuses are set by the Remuneration Committee.
In 2002 these targets comprised the following three internal measures of performance: i the groups actual earnings per share growth: ii funds utilisation efficiency as measured against budget: and iii the achievement of each directors personal objectives.
The maximum potential bonus payment to executive directors is restricted to 75% of their basic salary, in respect of the three elements in aggregate.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Long Term Incentives The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders, and provides the opportunity for longer term motivation and retention.
Restricted Share Scheme This scheme, established in 1994, is structured to provide longer term incentives for the attainment of improved group performance over an extended period.
The participants include the executive directors and some other key senior executives who are best placed to inuence such performance.
In relation to the awards made contingently under the scheme, each participant is notionally awarded shares up to a financial limit of four times basic annual salary.
The limit is calculated by reference to the market value of the shares subject to the award on the date it is made.
The number of long term incentive shares which a participant ultimately receives will depend upon performance over a period measured by real growth in earnings per share.
Earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as stated in the group financial statements subject to any costs or payments to the restricted share scheme being disregarded, and subject also to the Remuneration Committee making such adjustment as it sees t to take account of any material short term effect arising from an acquisition or any exceptional item of profit or loss in the groups financial statements in a particular year.
Any such adjustment to earnings per share by the Remuneration Committee would be made in consultation with the external auditors.
The shares will not vest absolutely in the participants until after the end of three years and then only if they are still in the groups employment at that time.
The rules cover the possibility of shares vesting at an earlier date in the event of death, or employment 22 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Report of the Boar Report of the Board on d on Dir Directors ectors Remuneration Remuneration ceasing because of injury, disability or normal retirement.
In the event of a change of control of the company, any shares already awarded as a result of the performance goals having been attained will vest in the participants.
Any balance of the notional award for future accounting periods will not vest.
The participants have no voting rights or entitlements to dividends in respect of the shares until they vest.
Earnings per share growth is believed by the Remuneration Committee to be an appropriate measure upon which to base the groups success over time because earnings per share is a widely used statistic in gauging a companys performance and in valuing its shares.
Earnings per share must grow by a minimum pre-determined amount, set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the award, over a three year performance period before participants will become entitled to any shares.
Target earnings growth has been as follows: Three year Notionally awarded Earliest vesting date target earnings growth January 1999 i April 2002 45% January 2000 i April 2003 50% January 2001 i April 2004 45% January 2002 ii April 2005 45% January 2003 ii April 2006 45% i In excess of the increase in the Retail Price Index.
ii In excess of the increase in the Retail Price Index to the extent that it exceeds 5%.
The provisional award of shares is established by comparing the actual earnings growth achieved by the company against the pre-determined target set for the relevant period.
The maximum award will be made where the target has been met or exceeded.
If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than the target, then the provisional award will be reduced on a straight line basis, such that where the earnings growth is less than 50% of the target, no provisional award is made.
When the provisional award has been calculated, the earnings growth achieved by the company is then compared with the aggregate earnings growth achieved by the constituent companies included in the FTSE All Share Index and the Speciality and Other Financials Index.
If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, the provisional award is reduced by 1% for every 4% by which the earnings growth of the company falls below that of the constituent companies in either index.
The provisional award may be reduced by a maximum of 25% as a result of this comparison.
Equally, if the earnings growth achieved by the company exceeds that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, then the provisional award is increased by 1% for every 4% by which the earnings growth of the company exceeds that of either index, subject to the original notional award not being exceeded.
Awards are at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which determines from time to time which executives shall be invited to participate and the level of awards of shares to be made to each of them.
The scheme operates in conjunction with an employee benefit trust, the trustee of which is Cattles Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cattles plc.
The directors of the trustee company are the members of the Remuneration Committee, all of whom are nonexecutive directors of the parent company, and none of whom is a beneciary under the scheme.
The Trust purchases shares in the market for the purpose of the scheme, hence there is no issue of new shares.
The Trust will at no time hold more than 5% of the issued share capital of Cattles plc.
The scheme is funded by loans from the company to the Trust, which then acquires Cattles plc shares for the purpose of the scheme.
The loans are repayable over the life of the scheme out of contributions from Cattles plc, which are taken as a charge against profits each year.
The accounting treatment of the shares held by the Trust and the underlying loan are dealt with in the financial statements in accordance with UITF 13 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
Cattles Employee Sharesave Scheme This scheme was introduced in 1993 to enable all employees, including executive directors, with more than two years service at the date of invitation, to enter into a SAYE savings plan.
At the end of five years, participants can exercise an option to acquire shares in the company at a xed price determined at the outset of the savings contract in accordance with the scheme rules.
The exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions, in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 23 The timing of invitations under this scheme is determined by the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
Invitations were circulated to qualifying employees in 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in UITF 17 Employee share schemes, not to apply that abstract to the Inland Revenue approved Cattles Employee Sharesave Scheme.
The lifespan of the 1993 sharesave scheme was for a xed period of 10 years, expiring in 2003.
Consequently, a resolution will be put forward at the forthcoming annual general meeting to seek shareholders approval to replace the existing scheme with the introduction of a new Employee Sharesave Scheme.
Cattles Employee Share Scheme 1994 This scheme, introduced in 1994, was a profit sharing scheme, whereby an amount of up to 5% of pre-tax profits was set aside each year to acquire shares in the company to be held in a trust on behalf of eligible employees.
The total amount to be set aside was determined by the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
The amounts attributable to eligible employees were determined by a formula linked to their salaries and the profit performance of the operating unit in which they were employed.
The scheme was open to all employees, including executive directors, with three years service in the Cattles plc group at the end of the financial year to which the allocation relates.
The actual allocation took place in the following financial year.
The beneficial UK tax reliefs available to employees under the 1994 profit sharing scheme were withdrawn by the Inland Revenue for any appropriation of shares after 31 December 2002.
Consequently, a resolution will be put forward at the forthcoming annual general meeting to seek shareholders approval to replace the existing scheme with the introduction of a new Employee Share Incentive Plan.
Executive Share Option Schemes Executive directors and senior executives do not participate in the Executive Share Option Schemes subsequent to their being invited to participate in the Restricted Share Scheme referred to above.
No executive directors have options outstanding or unexercised under either the 1994 or the 1996 schemes.
Grants of options to other senior executives of the group are made by the Remuneration Committee under two schemes.
These are the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1994, an Inland Revenue approved scheme, approved by the shareholders in 1994, and the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1996, approved by the shareholders in 1996.
The 1996 scheme was introduced to enable grants of options to be made, where appropriate, in addition to those granted under Inland Revenue approved schemes.
The exercise of options under both schemes is dependent upon the achievement of performance criteria consistent with the recommendations of the investment committees representing institutional shareholders.
Pension and Life Assurance Arrangements S P Mahon, J J Corr and I S Cummine have individual personal pension plans into which, from 1 January 2002, the company has contributed 20% of basic salary.
M W G Collins is a member of the Cattles Staff Pension Fund and is subject to the statutory pension cap.
He therefore receives payments representing 20% of the difference between his basic salary and that cap for contribution to additional pension schemes.
No other payments to directors are pensionable.
Cattles Staff Pension Fund is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational pension scheme with a contribution rate of 5% of pensionable salary from the employee.
Its main features, which apply to all members on the same terms, are: i pension is payable at normal pension age of 65 at 1 60th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40 60ths ii death in service life assurance cover is provided at four times pensionable salary iii pension is payable in the event of early retirement due to ill health and to spouse on death of member The directors are provided with death in service life assurance cover of four times basic salary.
24 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Performance Graph of Total Shareholder Return Five Years to 31 December 2002 In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 250 index is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of Cattles plc should be measured because it is an index containing similar-sized companies to Cattles plc.
Over the last five years, Cattles plc has generally outperformed the FTSE 250 index.
Cattles plc has shown an improvement in total shareholder return during 2002 compared with a decline in the shareholder return of the FTSE 250 index: 250 200 150 100 50 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 CATTLES PLC Total Return Index FTSE 250 Total Return Index Source: DATASTREAM Datastream Service Contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors service contracts should be rolling contracts requiring a notice period of one year to be given by the company and six months to be given by each director.
Each of the executive directors entered into service contracts, including these terms, on the date of their appointment to the Board.
In order to reect changes in other terms agreed since the original service contracts were entered into and to incorporate changes in employment legislation, the executive directors have entered into new service contracts on 5 March 2003.
The company has the right to terminate a directors employment by paying to the director the remuneration which he would have been entitled to receive from the company in respect of the relevant period of notice.
P M Kirby and N J Seel retired from the Board on 1 May 2002 and their contracts were terminated on that date.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of one year, renewable annually, with the intention that they will serve for a minimum period of three years.
They are subject to re-election at an annual general meeting at least every three years in common with all directors.
They do not have service contracts and may not participate in any bonus scheme, share scheme, pension scheme, car scheme or healthcare scheme operated by the company.
The dates of their letters of appointment are: B Cottingham 30 June 1999: D A Haxby 22 June 1999: and N N Broadhurst 23 March 2001.
Reasonable expenses that they may incur in the furtherance of their duties are repaid by the company.

However, for 2002, there is no difference between the two sets of gures, as stated in 000. ii P M Kirby and N J Seel retired from the Board on 1 May 2002.
Under the terms of his employment in March 1998, P M Kirby was guaranteed a pension on retirement equivalent to that which would have been payable under the pension scheme of his former employer, with the associated cost being borne by the company.
Following the retirement of P M Kirby, a payment of 467,954 was made to the Cattles Staff Pension Fund to meet the contracted annual pension payment to that director.
The value of this contractual commitment is included within the transfer value at 31 December 2002, stated in the table above.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2002 29 The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G Collins and P M Kirby is the amount that would be paid each year to the director in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of him having left service at the end of the year.
In respect of N J Seel, the accrued pension entitlement is the actual pension in payment, following his retirement on the grounds of ill-health during the year.
The accrued entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements earned as an employee, prior to becoming a director, as well as those earned for qualifying services after becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement in respect of qualifying services represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benets that they earned in respect of qualifying services.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benets in respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
