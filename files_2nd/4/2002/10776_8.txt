N BROWN BACK END 2002 28 5 02 9:51 am Page 31 Remuneration report This report is given on behalf of, and has been approved by, the board of directors.
The remuneration committee of the board the committee comprises Robert Youngjohns Chairman, Ivan Fallon, Lord Stone of Blackheath and Lawrence Ziman, all of whom the board considers to be independent.
The committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day to day involvement in running the business.
Members of the committee are shown on page 24 and its remit is described on page 29.
"Following the publication in June 1998 of the Combined Code ""the Code"" relating to corporate governance, the board have reviewed the groups compliance with the Code on remuneration related matters."
With the exception of the inclusion of annual bonuses in the definition of pensionable salary see below, the group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and senior executives The group aims to attract, motivate and retain executive directors and senior executives by offering them competitive remuneration packages which are linked to individual and corporate performance.
The main elements of these packages are described below.
Basic salary Salaries are established by reference to individual performance and external information for executives of comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size, in particular those existing in the home shopping and retail market sectors.
Annual performance related bonus In addition to basic salary, each executive director and senior executive participates in one of a number of annual performance related bonus schemes.
Each scheme is designed to stretch the performance of the executive and is linked to the growth in annual profit and the achievement of other business targets.
These targets are reviewed and agreed by the committee at the beginning of each financial year.
A proportion of the total amount of bonus earned by each executive director and senior executive net of tax is transferred to a deferred annual bonus scheme, under which it is invested in the companys shares on behalf of the executive which are held for a two year deferral period.
In addition, the invested shares are matched by a contingent award from the company of free shares whose value equates to the gross value of the amount transferred into the deferred scheme by the executive.
The free shares will vest at the end of the two year deferral period provided the executive has remained in employment and has not withdrawn any of the invested shares beforehand.
The total level of bonus for executive directors is capped at 65% of annual basic salary.
23% of the total amount earned is transferred to the deferred annual bonus scheme.
Long term incentive share plan Executive directors and certain senior executives are eligible to participate in the groups long term incentive share plan.
The plan provides appropriate incentives to reward sustained success through the achievement of challenging business targets, thereby better aligning the interests of shareholders and executives.
Eligible executives are awarded rights to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, none, some or all of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which, if at all, the performance condition set by the committee at the time the allocation is made is satisfied.
The performance condition is geared to the amount by which the annual rate of growth in the groups earnings per share exceeds that of the Retail Price Index by a minimum of 3%, measured as the average annual performance over the three year period.
In the case of awards made prior to 2000, the number of shares received by executives will be enhanced by 50% if the entitlement is not taken up until two years after the end of the performance period.
Executive directors and senior executives eligible to participate in the long term incentive plan may also participate in the companys executive option schemes see below.
However, before permitting an individual to participate in both the long term incentive plan and the executive option schemes, the committee will carefully assess the expected value of the combined total award, particularly if it exceeds the maximum value possible from either scheme individually.
N Brown Group plc 31 N BROWN BACK END 2002 28 5 02 9:51 am Page 32 Remuneration report Executive share option schemes The Company operates two discretionary share option schemes, the company share option plan, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue and has replaced the previous approved executive share option scheme 1990, and the unapproved discretionary share option scheme 2000, which has replaced the previous unapproved scheme.
The rules of the approved plan and the unapproved scheme mirror each other.
The approved plan permits the grant of options to an individual up to a maximum value of 30,000 which are potentially capable of exercise without incurring any income tax liability.
For newly appointed or promoted eligible executives, options will be granted over the companys shares, at the prevailing market price at the time of grant of the options, to those who have met or exceeded individual performance objectives after an initial qualifying period of service.
Subsequent grants are normally made at regular intervals thereafter, dependent on individual performance.
The options can normally only be exercised after they have been held for three years provided the option holder is still employed by the group and will lapse after having been held for ten years.
Under the new executive share option schemes, the maximum value of awards made to an executive in any financial year will not exceed twice their annual rate of remuneration salary plus bonuses and commissions.
However, it is envisaged that, under normal circumstances, it will not exceed their annual rate of remuneration.
Options granted under the new executive share option schemes contain a condition that they are normally only capable of being exercised if, over a fixed period of three complete financial years, the growth in the groups earnings per share exceeds that of the Retail Price Index by at least 9.2% equivalent to 3% per annum compound growth.
Savings related share option scheme The group operates an Inland Revenue approved savings related share option scheme for the benefit of group employees, provided they have completed at least six months service.
Eligible employees, including executive directors and senior executives, may be granted options over the companys shares at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing market price at the time of grant of the option, which subject to certain conditions can be exercised after either three or five years.
Approximately 30% of eligible group employees currently participate in the scheme.
32 N Brown Group plc N BROWN BACK END 2002 28 5 02 9:51 am Page 33 Remuneration report Pension schemes The group operates a number of Inland Revenue approved pension schemes for the benefit of all eligible employees.
The executive directors are members of the N Brown Group Pension Fund the fund, which is a defined benefit scheme.
It provides for them a normal retirement 1 2 age of 60, a pension accrual rate based on 40th of pensionable salary to give a maximum pension of 3 rds pensionable salary at normal retirement date, including retained benefits and a lump sum death benefit of four times pensionable salary.
All members of the fund pay contributions at the rate of 6% of pensionable salary.
The group bears the cost of providing the lump sum death benefit and the balance of contributions necessary to finance fund benefits.
Prior to 27 February 2000, the fund rules incorporated annual bonuses in the definition of pensionable salary for all executive directors and certain senior executives, to reflect the groups philosophy of linking a significant proportion of their overall remuneration package to business performance and the achievement of demanding targets.
However, with effect from the above date, annual bonuses are now excluded from the definition of pensionable salary for all new executive directors and other group executives.
The fund was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 January 2002.
Eligible employees who would otherwise have been entitled to join the fund are now able to join a new defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme.
Benefits in kind Other benefits in kind are provided to executive directors and senior executives commensurate with their position, principally a company car, permanent health insurance and private medical expenses cover.
Service contracts The current Chief Executives service contract provides for a notice period not exceeding two years.
The committee considers this period to be appropriate for the director concerned in view of his considerable experience of the home shopping market and his valuable contribution to the company as Chief Executive.
The board now has a policy of limiting new executive directors contractual notice periods to one year or less except in exceptional circumstances, in which case the period would reduce to one year or less after an appropriate initial term.
