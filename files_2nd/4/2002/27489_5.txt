The value of the bonus matching award is derived from the annual bonus criteria relating to the year on year increases in the Groups pre-tax profit on ordinary activities and is therefore dependent on corporate performance.
The release of bonus matching share awards at the end of the three year restricted period is not dependent on the satisfaction of a further performance condition.

Rights lapsed during 2002 represent awards granted in 1999 which matured in February 2002 which led to the release to participants of 41.5% of shares originally awarded, the remaining 58.5% of ordinary shares have lapsed.
The gross awards granted in 2000 shown above, matured in January 2003 and led to the release at 6.10 per share of 100% of shares originally awarded.
Subject to the performance criteria being met, other awards may be exercised during the three month period commencing on the third anniversary of the award dates.
The awards will lapse if they are not exercised during these times.
Further awards have been granted in January 2003 at 6.10 per share as follows: A J Applegarth 86,066 D F Baker 57,377 R F Bennett 57,377 27 Directors Remuneration Report continued In 2001 as part of his termination arrangements Mr L P Finn, the former Chief Executive, received a payment of 150,000 on account of his LTIP entitlement.
The number of shares released to Mr L P Finn on maturity of the 1999 awards has been reduced accordingly to take account of this.
No further reduction is required from January 2000 and February 2001 awards.
The number of shares under Mr L P Finns outstanding awards was scaled down in accordance with the plan rules on his retirement in February 2001 to reflect the proportion of the performance period for which he was in service.
Following this reduction the number of shares which vest on maturity is calculated on the same basis as for other participants.
There were no variations made in the terms and conditions of the plan interests during 2002.
The number of shares comprised in an award is calculated by reference to a percentage of salary.
"Shares may only be released if demanding performance targets are achieved and if the participant remains in employment, except in certain ""good leaver"" circumstances."
Performance is measured over a three year period on the basis of Total Shareholder Return, comparing the Companys performance to that of the other companies in the FTSE 350 Index at the date of the award.

The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
The Listing Rules also require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent the sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less Directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits during the year after deducting the Directors personal contributions to the scheme.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits excluding inflation that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in transfer values and thus includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value over the year, as well as the value of the additional accrued entitlement earned in the year.
Arising from Mr Bennetts unfunded arrangement in addition to the Companys scheme benefit set out in the table above he has an estimated accrued annual entitlement at 31 December 2002 of 140,340.
This is based on his total pensionable service of 9 years 2 months and his pensionable service of 19 years 5 months at the rate of accrual of 1 60th per annum and 5 years 1 month at the rate of accrual of 1 36th and his pensionable earnings above the earnings cap.
The contributions cost during the year in respect of this unfunded arrangement amounted to 67,660 for the Company and 10,910 for Mr Bennett.
