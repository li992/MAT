Report on directors remuneration Introduction The information included in this report is not subject to audit other than where specifically indicated.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of independent non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to be decided.
The non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee, throughout the financial year, were Sir Nigel Mobbs Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Mr Tim Melville-Ross and Mr Mark Nicholls.
Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at least annually.
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon the advice and services of Mr Malcolm Harris Chief Executive on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment.
The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion, appointed the services of Towers Perrin to advise on director remuneration and the establishment of a long term incentive plan.
Towers Perrin do not provide any other services to the Group.
The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration Schedules A and B appended to the UKLA Listing Rules.
The remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee settles and implements the remuneration policy for executive directors and senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee takes independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders: maintain a package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to further the success of the Company.
The remuneration package consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees BRICS, pension, participation in share options, a share incentive plan, and a long term incentive plan.
The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of the share option scheme and the long term incentive plan.
These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report.
Granting of share options and awards under the long term incentive plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors in the direction of improved profitability and enhanced shareholder return.
The conditions are designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the long term incentive plan to vest an independent view provided by the Companys auditors, as independent experts, is required certifying achievement of the relevant performance conditions.
This independent view is evidenced by the completion of formal certificates signed by the auditors.
The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the long term incentive plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent.
This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement against the performance conditions.
There is currently no intention to amend or adjust the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a director to share options or awards under the long term incentive plan.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 37 Report on directors remuneration continued The remuneration policy continued The Remuneration Committee aim to balance appropriately those elements of a directors remuneration which are subject to explicit performance conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance.
In addition to basic salary and benefits in kind, each executive director can earn an annual performance bonus capped at a maximum of 50% of basic salary 60% for the Chief Executive, can be granted share options up to a maximum value equal to one years basic salary exercise price equal to market price on the date of grant, and can be allocated an award under the long term incentive plan up to a maximum value equal to 75% of basic salary.
By virtue of the various elements of directors remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is not guaranteed.
The policy in respect of contracts of employment is one of rolling twelve month contracts with notice periods of up to twelve months.
For non-executive directors these contracts are established for a period of up to three years duration.
Details of these contracts and agreements are given later in this report.
Performance graph As required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following table includes a performance graph comparing, over the last five financial years, the Total Shareholder Return of an ordinary share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the Total Shareholder Return of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials index.
This comparable index is appropriate given that the Remuneration Committee has considered an appropriate comparator group of companies for benchmarking performance.
This comparator group is currently made up of ten UK listed housebuilders, all of which are included in the FTSE Construction and Building Materials index.
The ordinary shares of Bovis Homes Group PLC are included within the FTSE Building Materials and Construction Index.
As such, the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index is considered by the Remuneration Committee to be a representative comparator for Total Shareholder Return performance.

uk Report on directors remuneration continued Pension All the executive directors are senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme.
This is a contributory, defined benefit scheme which is funded, and approved by the Inland Revenue.
Pensionable earnings are basic pay, and as a result of length of service there are no executive directors subject to the statutory earnings cap, with the exeption of Mr StephenBrazier and Mr DavidRitchie.
Normal retirement age for senior executive members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1 45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
In previous year's accounts, disclosure of directors' pension benefits was made under the requirement of the UKLA Stock Exchange Listing Rules.
These requirements are still in place, but it is now also necessary to make disclosures in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The information below sets out the disclosures under the two sets of requirements.

Long term incentive plan Introduction A long term incentive plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and established on 10 May 2000.
Under the rules of the scheme a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when the award was made, not exceeding 75% of basic salary.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards may only be exercised at the end of three years.
There is no cost to the participants in the scheme to exercise the awards.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised will be determined by two measures of performance: total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Companys TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid during the three year period assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares.
The Companys ranking amongst the comparator companies will determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows: TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised 1st position 50% of the shares in the award 2nd position 45% of the shares in the award 3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award 4th position 30% of the shares in the award 5th position 20% of the shares in the award 6th position 15% of the shares in the award Page 42 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
uk Report on directors remuneration continued Long term incentive plan continued The group of comparator companies is as follows: Comparator companies Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p. l. c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Westbury plc Wilson Bowden plc Wilson Connolly Plc George Wimpey PLC The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Companys average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows: EPS growth % of total award which can be realised Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award Minimum EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% above RPI respectively.
Where EPS growth falls between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust.
The grant price of the awards is set as the market value of the shares at the date the shares are purchased by the trustee.
The cost of these shares is amortised through the profit and loss account over the three year performance period.
The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised.
An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.

uk Report on directors remuneration continued Share options held by directors audited All of the share options granted by the Company were granted at the market price prevailing on the date of grant, with the exception of Save As You Earn options which were granted at a 20% discount to the market price prevailing on the date of grant.
There was no payment required to secure the grant of any share options.
There was no change in the terms and conditions of either the Executive Share Option Scheme Exec or the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme SAYE during the financial year.
Other changes in the directors interests in the ordinary shares of the Company arose on 8 April 2002 with the allocation of shares under the Companys Profit Sharing Scheme.

There were no other changes in the above holdings of share options between 31 December 2002 and 7 March 2003.
Share options held under the Executive Share Option Scheme can be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum 2% per annum for share options granted before 2001 over three consecutive years.
Assuming this condition is satisfied, share options may under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the dates of grant.
Share options held in the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme, which are not subject to performance conditions, may under normal circumstances be exercised during the six months after maturity of the agreement.
For directors who retired during the financial year, they had the opportunity to exercise their accrued rights under the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme for the six months after their retirement.
Hence, Mr Ron Walford, Mr Mike Sharpe and Mr John Emery exercised their accrued rights during 2002, the balance of their entitlement lapsing.
