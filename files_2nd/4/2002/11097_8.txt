NEXT PLC REMUNERATION REPORT This report contains the information required by the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with the Listing Rules throughout the year under review.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups executive directors.
The members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors of the Company and are listed in this Annual Report, they have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters addressed by the Committee and have no conflicts of interest arising from crossdirectorships.
Remuneration policy It is the objective of the Committee to reward directors competitively.
It is the practice to review the remuneration of directors on the same basis as any other employee of the Company and this takes into account a review of the performance of the individual and of the business.
A remuneration review is carried out by the Committee at least annually.
The other factors taken into account by the Committee in setting remuneration levels include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are as follows: Salary Salaries of directors are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, having taken advice from external professional sources.
They are also tailored to individual experience, ability and performance.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors annual performance related bonus scheme is based on a formula measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is principally earnings per share before tax, which must increase by RPI and 2% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula has been determined by the Committee and includes an upper limit of 50% of salary.
Long term incentive plan A long term incentive plan was introduced for executive directors and senior executives in 1997 following approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Each year appropriate targets relating to the performance of the Group over the next three years, the performance period, are set.
Performance is measured by comparing Total Shareholder Return against approximately 20 other listed retail companies.
The maximum award possible for each performance period is 100% of basic salary, however, the Committee has restricted the maximum award possible to 70% of basic salary for all performance periods commencing prior to January 2002.
For performance below the median ranking company no award will be made.
For performance equal to the median the entitlement will be 30% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
No entitlements will be earned unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
Any entitlements earned will be payable in Next plc shares or cash, at the Companys discretion.
Entitlements earned will not be pensionable and will be based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals may not be included in the plan and receive grants under the Companys 1995 Share Option Scheme in the same year.
1995 Share Option Scheme The Companys 1995 Share Option Scheme was first established in 1984 and was renewed in 1995 by shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
The scheme provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum value of Inland Revenue approved share options which may be granted to any employee is restricted to 30,000.
In addition unapproved options can be granted under the scheme, the maximum number being calculated by a formula which restricts the aggregate option exercise price to four times total remuneration of the employee less the value of any outstanding approved share options.
It is not the practice to grant the maximum number of options allowable to any employee in one year.
Grants are generally made annually and no employee holds the maximum allowable.
No options were granted to directors in the year under review.
Employees may not receive option grants under the scheme and be included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
Sharesave Option Scheme The Companys Sharesave option scheme was renewed in 2000 by shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to the Inland Revenue maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are exercisable either three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% as permitted by Inland Revenue regulations.
Sharesave options granted to executive directors in the year under review are detailed below.
Group pension scheme Executive directors are eligible for membership of the Next Group Pension Plan which has been approved by the Inland Revenue and which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
fourteen NEXT PLC REMUNERATION REPORT The trustee of the scheme is a limited company, Next Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
All the directors of the Trustee are appointed and can be removed by Next plc.
The Chairman of the Trustee is a non-executive director of Next plc and the Board of the Trustee includes a member of the scheme, a pensioner member and an independent director.
The director of the Trustee who is also a full time employee of Next plc does not receive any additional salary or fee for his services.
Other directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services.
The schemes investments are kept entirely separate from the business affairs of the Next Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the schemes funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
Defined contribution section From 1 October 2000 employees of the Group have been offered the opportunity of joining a defined contribution section of the scheme.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous 1 April is payable along with the current value of the members fund, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members on 30 September 2000 but will be continued for the benefit of existing members.
The section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings including bonus for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 60.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependents pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest, is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouses pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post 1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current scheme members basic pay, overtime and annual performance bonus are included in calculating pensionable earnings but no other items of remuneration are taken into account.
With the exception of two employees who had prior agreements, the inclusion of annual performance bonus in pensionable earnings is limited to a maximum of 35% of an employees annual salary in any year.
The inclusion of bonus in pensionable earnings has been the practice for many years and is appropriate for Next where a significant element of employee earnings is dependent on productivity or profit performance.
The Remuneration Committee believe that the Company should continue with established precedent.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Companys regular cost contribution rate is 12.3% of pensionable earnings.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the schemes financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2001 which has been subject to an updated estimate to the Groups year end date of 26 January 2002.
The March 2001 valuation concluded that the scheme continued in surplus but in view of the longer term outlook, the Company had recommenced contributions with effect from 1 April 2000 at a reduced rate equivalent to that contributed by the members.
From 1 April 2001 the rate was increased to 10% of pensionable earnings and will be further increased to 12.3% with effect from 1 April 2002.
Members who joined the scheme after May 1989 and before 1 October 2000 are subject to the Inland Revenue salary cap for approved pension schemes which is set at 95,400 per annum for 2001 2002.
Members subject to the cap are provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement in relation to that part of their earnings which exceeds the cap, where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings in excess of the cap.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is presented below.
Notice periods Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Group on giving two years notice.
The Committee considers that notice periods of two years are reasonable and in the interests of all parties to attract and retain high calibre directors.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director that full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car, private medical insurance, reimbursement of annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and favourable terms in purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive.
Remuneration of the other non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
They do not have contracts of service, are not eligible for pension scheme membership, and do not participate in any of the Groups bonus, share option or other incentive schemes.

Long term incentive plan Estimated monetary values were included in the January 2001 Remuneration Report for the three year performance plan which matured at that date based on a share price of 849p on 19 March 2001.
Awards were made subsequent to the Report on 30 March 2001 when the share price was 886p.
Adjustments to the estimated monetary value together with the final award have, therefore, been included in the table below.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2002.
The Total Shareholder Return of the Company over this period ranked between fourth and fifth when compared to the group of 19 other listed retail companies.
Accordingly the maximum award equivalent to 70% of basic salary is expected to be made to the participants in the plan which is payable in Next plc shares or cash, at the Companys discretion.
The awards will be made during 2002 and an estimated monetary value is shown below based on the share price of 988p on 18 March 2002.
Awards to the executive directors would be as follows: January 2002 January 2001 Actual Estimated Adjustment Final no.

A charge of 4,150,000 2001: 3,850,000 has been made in the accounts in respect of the estimate of the amount for awards relating to the year, of which approximately 2,281,000 2001: 2,138,000 related to the executive directors.
Awards under the long term incentive plan are not pensionable.
Directors pension entitlements All executive directors are members of the Next Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 60 for members who joined before 1 October 2000.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 per annum, pensionable earnings are based on an average of the best consecutive 36 or more months earnings in the ten years prior to retirement.
sixteen NEXT PLC REMUNERATION REPORT The Listing Rules in respect of the disclosure of directors pensions benefits require disclosure of sufficient information to make a reasonable assessment of the increase in transfer value of a directors pension entitlement during the year, and also the amount of the increase in the accrued pension to which a director has become entitled during the year.

Mr D C Jones pension is not subject to actuarial reduction if he should retire before age 60 and in the event of ill-health the pension payable would be based on service to age 60.
His final pensionable salary definition includes benefits in kind and all annual performance related bonus payments which are not limited to 35% of salary in this respect but remains subject to Inland Revenue limits.
