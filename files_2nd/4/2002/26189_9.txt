Law Debenture Remuneration report Dear Shareholder In accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the Companies Summary Financial Statement Amendment Regulations 2002, I submit the remuneration report for The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. for 2002.
With effect from financial years ending 31 December 2002, listed companies are required under the new Regulations to present a remuneration report, which must contain specific and detailed information about the way directors of the Corporation are remunerated, and the amounts they receive.
Some of the information is historical, some forward looking.
Those sections that have been audited in accordance with the Regulations are shown at the top of each relevant paragraph.
As required by the Regulations, the remuneration report will be put to shareholders for approval as an ordinary resolution at the annual general meeting.
Douglas McDougall Chairman, Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee - membership and advisers The board has delegated responsibility for consideration of all matters relating to directors' remuneration to a Remuneration Committee.
All of the members of the Committee are non-executive directors, being at the date of this report Mr Douglas McDougall Chairman, Mr Armel Cates and Mr Ken Inglis.
Each of these served throughout the year to 31 December 2002.
There were no other members of the Committee during this period.
The Committee met three times during the year.
The Managing Director attended all meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the Chairman although she was not present when details of her own remuneration were discussed and Mr Robert Williams, an executive director, attended one meeting at the invitation of the Chairman.
The Managing Director, Mr Williams, and the Company Secretary provided advice when called upon to do so.
As for external advisers, the Committee appointed Lesley Pearson, a Remuneration Consultant, to undertake a salary benchmarking exercise, and Linklaters to advise on the Executive Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme, both of which were adopted by the shareholders at the 2002 AGM.
Linklaters did not provide any other advice to the Committee, although it does provide advice on certain trustee and other matters to the Corporation and various subsidiaries, fees incurred in respect of such work generally being recoverable by Law Debenture from other parties.
The Committee complies with the principles of good governance and Code of Best Practice in the listing rules of the Financial Services Authority.
To the extent required by statute, disclosures in this Remuneration report have been audited - the independent auditors report appears on page 34.
The Corporation's remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee and the board recognise that the Corporation and its subsidiaries work in competitive markets.
The aim of the Corporation is to ensure that remuneration packages offered to executive directors and senior executives are competitive, and designed to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the highest calibre.
The Remuneration Committee operates, and will continue in the future to operate, in accordance with key principles which are: Remuneration packages should be competitive but not extravagant, and should broadly be in line with average packages in the markets in which Law Debenture operates: There should be a clear link between total remuneration and performance.
27 Law Debenture The major components of Law Debenture's remuneration packages for executive directors and senior executives comprise: basic salary: general bonus scheme which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2003 AGM may be invested in a Share Incentive Plan, calculated by reference to the success of the Corporations trustee and related businesses: executive share options, granted periodically and phased in over a period of years, with demanding performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee: discretionary bonus based upon trustee and related business performance and the attainment of personal targets: pensions provision in a funded non-contributory, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational pension scheme: and participation in a Sharesave Scheme.
Details of the policy applied in each component are outlined below.
These apply to the executive directors only.
Non-executive directors receive flat rate fees as described elsewhere in this report, but do not receive any other benefits.
The executive directors during the period of this report were: Mrs Caroline Banszky appointed to the Board on 29 January 2002, and as Managing Director on 9 April 2002 : Mr Christopher Duffett Managing Director until 9 April 2002.
Due to deteriorating health, Christopher Duffett went on permanent sick leave from 9 April 2002.
He remained an employee, receiving full pay for six months from that date, then transferring to the Corporation's Disability Income Plan where, in agreement with the Plan insurers, the Plan will pay him 60.5% of his leaving salary until he reaches his normal retirement date in August 2003.
The impact of this on his benefits is described more fully below.
Mr Robert Williams part time executive director.
The policy applied in respect of each component of the remuneration package for the executive directors is as follows.
Basic salary Basic salaries are set at levels consistent with individual performance, and the market rates applicable to jobs of similar complexity and responsibility.
To measure this, the Remuneration Committee engages an independent Remuneration Consultant.
The salaries of the executive directors, which are described at paragraph 10 below, are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The executive directors also received non-pensionable cash payments being a car allowance, and in the case of Mr Duffett, a mortgage subsidy.
These are included within salary fees at paragraph 10.
Non-cash benefits include private health cover, life insurance cover and the Disability Income Plan.
The estimated money value of these components is set out in the table at paragraph 10.
General bonus scheme Mr Williams participates in the Corporation's general bonus scheme on the same basis that applies to all members of staff.
A cash payment will be made in April 2003.
The amount of the payment is not guaranteed and will be calculated by reference to a number of factors relating to the trustee and related businesses, including profitability and the growth in profits.
The bonus is paid as a percentage of basic salary, and all qualified employees receive a bonus calculated at the same percentage.
In 2003, the general bonus scheme payments to Mr Williams and to all other members of staff will be 6% of basic salary.
There are no performance conditions specific to any individual in order to qualify for receipt of a general bonus payment, although certain qualification conditions do apply.
In particular, an executive director and any other staff member must have been employed for at least three months at the close of the financial year.
He she will receive a pro-rated payment for the period that he she was employed during the year, if more than three months but less than twelve, and entitlement to the payment will be withdrawn if the executive director is not employed, or has given, or been given notice to leave, as at 31 March 2003.
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2003 AGM, participants in the general bonus scheme, including Mr Williams, will be entitled to place all or part of their general bonus scheme payment into an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan.
28 Law Debenture Mr Duffett was entitled to participate in the general bonus scheme until he went on sick leave 9 April 2002 and will accordingly receive in April 2003 a payment of 6% of his pensionable salary, pro-rated for the period 1 January to 9 April 2002.
Executive share options A summary of executive share options granted in previous years to the executive directors is set out at paragraph 12 of this report.
The performance conditions that apply before an executive director is entitled to exercise his her options are as follows: Options granted in 1994, 1995 and 1998 tranche A The performance criteria in respect of these options have already been met and Mr Duffett the only executive director who received options in these years is entitled to exercise options as described in paragraph 12.
His entitlement to exercise remains in place until 23 February 2004, being six months after his normal retirement date.
Options granted in 1998 tranche B Mr Duffett is the only executive director to have received 1998 tranche B options.
The performance conditions for these run for five years, until 4 December 2003 and are that trustee profits must have grown at a rate of inflation plus 5% over the period.
However, since this date is after Mr Duffett's normal retirement date, then under the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme applicable when these options were granted, he can exercise his 1998 tranche B options at any time between his normal retirement date and 23 February 2004, being six months later, irrespective of whether the performance conditions are met.
Options granted in 2002 Options were granted to Mrs Banszky in 2002, as set out at paragraph 12.
The options will become exercisable from 2 August 2007, but only if the profits of the trustee and related services of the Corporation and its subsidiaries grow at an annual rate of 4% plus inflation over the five years ending 31 December 2006.
The 'profits of the trustee and related services' mean the amount shown as such in the notes to the Corporation's consolidated accounts.
If this condition is not met in the year ending 31 December 2006, it will be successively re-tested at the end of the next two years as necessary, using the annual average rates then applicable.
If the condition is still not met following re-testing, the options lapse.
Options granted or to be granted in 2003 No options have been granted to executive directors in the year 2003 up to the date of this report.
No executive director has a contractual entitlement to receive a grant of executive share options in any given year, so it will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee as to whether or not grants of options are made under the Executive Share Option Scheme later in the year.
Should a grant be made, then performance conditions will be set which are no less challenging than those attaching to the grant of options in 2002.
No options on shares have been granted to Mr Williams under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Senior Executive Discretionary Bonus Scheme Mr Williams and Mrs Banszky are entitled to receive discretionary bonuses incentive payments in 2003 at whatever time and of whatever amount the Remuneration Committee decides is appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion in respect of their performance in 2002.
These payments will be made in March 2003 and were 55,000 for Mrs Banszky and 4,000 for Mr Williams.
In assessing what bonus or incentive payment should be awarded, account is taken of any factors that the Remuneration Committee reasonably consider appropriate, including the financial performance and position of the company and performance against any objectives that have been set.
A number of the Corporation's senior executives are similarly entitled.
There is no contractual entitlement that says an incentive payment must be paid in any given year, and entitlement is lost if, on the date that incentive payments are paid, a participant is no longer employed by the Corporation, or either the participant or the Corporation has served notice to terminate employment.
Incentive payments are not taken into account in calculating pension contributions.
The discretionary bonus payment received in 2002 by Mr Williams was 4,000, which together with his general bonus, gave him a total bonus of 8,276.. Mrs Banszky did not receive any discretionary bonus in 2002.
Up to the allowable limit, her bonus of 55,000 in respect of 2002 and payable in 2003, will be eligible to be placed in the Share Incentive Plan.
Mr Duffett received 17,000 in 2002 in respect of his employment in 2001, which combined with his general bonus, gave him a total bonus of 33,524.
He will not receive a discretionary bonus in 2003 in respect of his employment during 2002.
Save As You Earn SAYE Sharesave Plan Subject to eligibility conditions concerning length of service, the executive directors in common with all of the members of staff are entitled to participate in the Corporation's SAYE Scheme.
The extent of participation by the executive directors in the Scheme, including a list of the numbers of shares over which they hold options as part of the Scheme, is shown in the table at paragraph 13.
In 2002, the shareholders approved the introduction of The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. SAYE Share Save Scheme 2002.
This replaced a similar scheme that had operated since 1993.
Under the terms of the Scheme, which is approved by the Inland Revenue under paragraph 1, Schedule 9 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, eligible participants including executive directors are entitled to make monthly savings direct from post tax pay, with a guaranteed tax-free return after five years.
The amount to be saved can range from 5 per month to a maximum of 250 per month.
On joining the scheme, savers are given an option to acquire shares in the Corporation at the end of the five year saving period, at a price fixed at the beginning of the saving period.
The fixed price is the net asset value per ordinary share on the date when eligible participants are invited to join the plan.
Invitations to participate are issued annually to eligible employees, but the total monthly payments that any individual makes in respect of the aggregate of all years in which they have chosen to participate must not exceed 250.
At the end of the five year saving period, participants receive a tax free bonus equal to 6.2 further months' savings.
Under the terms of the 1993 predecessor scheme - in which Mr Williams is a participant - the tax free bonus was 9 months' savings for schemes started in 1998, and 7.5 months for schemes started in 1999, 2000 and 2001.
The number of shares that participants can purchase after five years is determined at the beginning of the saving period by the total amount to be saved plus the bonus, divided by the option price.
At the end of a saving period, participants may choose to apply the amount saved to exercise the options over the shares notified at the outset of the saving period, or they may choose to relinquish their options in favour of receiving a cash repayment of all of their contributions, plus the bonus.
Pensions provision Mrs Banszky is a member of the Corporation's funded non-contributory, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational scheme.
Details of her membership of the scheme are contained in the table at paragraph 10.
The rules relating to the earnings cap currently 97,200 per annum mean that Law Debenture has to restrict the pension benefit payable to the Managing Director.
Pursuant to her service contract and as compensation for the effect of this restriction, the Corporation pays the Managing Director a cash non-pensionable amount equal to the sum of 20% of the difference between i the Inland Revenue permitted maximum for the time being and ii her base salary.
In addition for 2002 only, she was paid 5 per cent of the cap.
These amounts are paid monthly in arrears accruing from day to day after the deduction of income tax and national insurance.
30 Law Debenture For the period from 9 April 2002 to his normal retirement date, Mr Duffett remains a member of the Corporation's pension scheme.
No additional pension contributions have been made on his behalf.
He has not received any retirement benefits, nor will he do so until he reaches normal retirement date.
Details of his membership of the scheme are contained at paragraph 11.
Mr Williams is not a member of the Corporation's pension scheme.
Reflecting this, his basic salary contains an element in lieu of a contribution on his behalf to a pension scheme.
Service contracts Details of the executive directors' service contracts are as follows: Date of Contract Notice Period Mrs Caroline Banszky 9 November 2001 6 months Mr Robert Williams 26 February 2002 6 months The executive directors employment is not for a fixed term.
There are no contractual provisions for compensation payable upon early termination with notice of the contract.
There is an entitlement to receive salary and benefits during the period of notice, which may be paid 'in lieu' of all or part of any period of notice.
There are no entitlements to payments of any sort in the event that the Corporation summarily terminates an executive directors employment.
In the event that the Corporation gives the Managing Director notice to terminate employment within twelve months of any change in control of the company, the company must give not less than twelve months written notice, and the same arrangements for receiving salary and benefits during this period including payments 'in lieu' also apply as described above.
Remuneration of non-executive directors The non-executive directors are paid a single, flat fee for their services, as set out in paragraph 10.
They may also claim travelling expenses.
The fee for the Chairman reflects the additional responsibility and time commitment required of him: the fee for Mr Edwards reflects the fact that he is also Chairman of L. D. C. Trust Management Limited, the principal management company overseeing the trustee and related businesses.
The fees are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee, on advice from the executive directors, who from time to time undertake comparative studies to ensure that the Corporations fee levels are consistent with the marketplace.
The fees were last reviewed in July 2001.
There are no current plans to review the fees during 2003.
The flat fee is not contingent upon attendance at a set number of board meetings: all directors are expected to attend all meetings, barring unforeseen circumstances.
The attendance record of the non-executive directors at meetings of the Corporation's board is as follows: Number of Board meetings attended in 2002 Mr DCP McDougall 9 9 Mr AC Cates 9 9 Mr J Edwards 8 9 Mr KWB Inglis 9 9 31 Law Debenture Each non-executive director is appointed for an indefinite term, subject to periodic re-election by the shareholders in accordance with the Articles of Association.
There are no provisions in any of the non-executive directors' letters of appointment for compensation payable on early termination of the directorship.
The graph shows the total shareholder return of a nominal holding of 1,000 of Law Debenture's shares measured against the total shareholder return of a nominal holding of 1,000 invested in the FTSE All Share Index over a five year period.
The data for Mr Duffett covers the period until he ceased to be a director 9 April.
The data for Mrs Banszky covers the period from the date that she became a director 29 January.
No director received compensation for loss of office, or any other payments in connection with the termination of qualifying services.
Benefits other than in cash are: private health cover Mr Williams and Mr Duffett only : life assurance and Disability Income Plan Mrs Banszky and Mr Duffett : board dinners all directors.
Total salary fees compromises basic salary plus non-pensionable cash allowances as set out in paragraphs 1 and 6, totalling 2,477 for CCB Duffett, 34,272 for Mrs Banszky and 7,920 for Mr Williams.
