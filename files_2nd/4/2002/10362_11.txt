They confirmed that the new performance targets were stringent when compared to those used by other companies.
They also recommended that the individual maximum value of Type I options should be increased.

42 Misys Annual Report 2002 PENSIONS The pension plan is in a defined contribution structure.
In the years prior to 1999, the contribution level from the Company was designed to provide the executive Directors with approximately two-thirds of the final base salary at normal retirement date, plus spouses pension, death in service benefits and post-retirement increases of 3% per annum.
The appropriate Company contribution rate was reviewed every two years and adjustments made as appropriate.
The recommended increases in contributions in 1998 and 2000 were considered out of step with the market and, pending more detailed review of the issue, were not implemented.
The review has now been completed, with the result that: 1.
With effect from 1 June 2001 the pension contribution payable to existing Main Board Directors has been fixed at 40% of base salary.
This is lower than the contribution rate over the last five years and the implied benefit target is cancelled.
In compensation for the above changes to their terms and conditions, the Main Board Directors have together received a one-time payment to their individual pension arrangements totalling 3.7m as set out in the table of Directors Emoluments on page 39.
These payments were agreed following consultation with the Institutional Investment Committees.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS Service agreements for the executive Directors are subject to 12 months notice from either party.
Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment which are subject to termination by either party giving not less than six months notice and each appointment is subject to review every two years.
Executive Directors are permitted to accept non-executive appointments by prior agreement with the Board.
It is normal practice for executive Directors to retain fees received for nonexecutive appointments.
Details of external appointments are shown in the Directors Profiles on page 33.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES Non-executive Directors fees are determined by the Board on the basis of independent advice on current levels in similar businesses.
Fees are reviewed every year.
The basic annual fee for the senior non-executive Director for the financial years 2001 and 2002 is 50,000.
The basic annual fee for other non-executive Directors was 23,625 for 2001, increased to 30,000 for 2002, following advice from independent remuneration consultants.
Supplementary fees may be paid for Committee Chairmanship and for special duties beyond that normally expected of a non-executive Director.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for pensions incentives or similar payments.
They are entitled to receive out-ofpocket travel and accommodation costs in connection with the performance of their duties.
