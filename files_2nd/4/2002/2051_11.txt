60 BG GROUP PLC 2002 remuneration report Introduction This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
The first part of the report provides details of BG Groups remuneration policy.
The second part provides details of the remuneration, service contracts and share interests of all the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2002.
The Directors confirm that this report has been drawn up in accordance with Schedule B of the Combined Code.
Responsibility for reviewing Group remuneration strategy and policy, recommending any changes and approving individual remuneration packages for Executive Directors rests with the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive Directors and meets on at least four occasions each year.
The members are: Peter Backhouse, David Benson, Sir John Coles, Paul Collins, Elwyn Eilledge Committee Chairman, Sir Richard Giordano, Keith Mackrell, Dame Stella Rimington and Lord Sharman: Emma Nichol, Company Secretary, attends as secretary to the Committee.
Frank Chapman, Chief Executive, Peter Duffy, Executive Vice President Human Resources, and Cathy Aldwinckle, Head of Compensation and Benefits, attend these meetings as required and provide information and advice to the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions.
The Remuneration Committee also meets without management and receives i information and independent executive remuneration advice from an external consultancy firm, Towers Perrin, whose appointment was approved by the Remuneration Committee.
During 2001, the Remuneration Committee reviewed BGs global remuneration strategy and proposed some changes, principally to our long-term incentive schemes.
Those changes were approved by shareholders at the 2002 Annual General Meeting and have since been ii implemented.
Other than as detailed on page 63, no changes are proposed to the remuneration policy this year.
The Committee will review the policy on a regular basis and recommend changes as and when appropriate in forthcoming years.
REMUNERATION POLICY BG needs to be able to employ and retain international employees of the highest calibre with the necessary skills, capabilities and experience to execute its business strategy and thereby deliver strong growth.
The catchment area for recruitment is increasingly outside the UK and the required talent is scarce.
The overriding objectives of our remuneration policy are to enable the recruitment and retention of this limited executive resource and to reinforce our strong performance ethic.
Accordingly, the central premise of our remuneration policy is that, whilst reward arrangements should be market competitive, employees should look to performance related incentives rather than base salaries to achieve above average reward.
To implement our policy, we have a well-developed, company-wide performance management system and we operate three complementary performance related incentive schemes for executives.
The three schemes are the Annual Incentive Scheme AIS, the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and the Company Share Option Scheme CSOS.
These schemes form a significant proportion of the total reward package for executives.
The AIS is designed to focus executives on the business priorities for the financial year and to reinforce our individual performance culture.
iii The aim of the LTIS is to motivate participants to maximise total shareholder return TSR as measured against a comparator group of international oil and gas companies over a period of three years.
The CSOS aims to drive real earnings growth over the long term, the iv mechanism used for measuring this being published earnings per share EPS growth relative to the growth in the retail price index, excluding mortgage interest repayments RPIX.
Further details of the AIS, the LTIS and the CSOS can be found on pages 61 to 63.
The varying performance periods and performance conditions of the three schemes combine and complement each other to enable the measurement and reward of both shortand long-term performance and of absolute AIS, sustained CSOS and comparative LTIS financial performance.
The Remuneration Committee considers that this combination of performance measures aligns executives interests with those of shareholders and establishes a clear link between pay and performance.
Components of Remuneration The current remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises performance related and non-performance related components.
The performance related components are the performance related incentive schemes referred to above and the non-performance related components are base salary, taxable benefits and pension entitlements.
In addition, the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Companys all-employee share schemes.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group and the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code have been taken into account in determining the remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
The proportion of each Executive Directors total remuneration that is performance related is significant even for target which is based on budget performance.
For stretch significantly above budget performance, the amount of remuneration payable is higher as is the proportion that is performance related.
New legislation the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 requires us to explain the relative importance of those elements of remuneration which are, and those which are not, performance related.
In fulfilling this requirement, we have had to make a number of assumptions, including what the Companys share price growth will be over the next three years and what our total shareholder return will be relative to that of a comparator group of companies.
Based on such assumptions, the average proportion of remuneration that is performance related for target performance is approximately 45% for Executive Directors.
For stretch performance, the average is about 75%.
i Towers Perrin also provides some general compensation and benefits advice and information to some of our overseas activities and is responsible for the administration of some of our share schemes.
ii Details of these changes can be found on pages 52-55 in the Companys 2001 Annual Report and Accounts.
iii TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a companys shares over a period.
It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value of the shares and other payments to, or by, shareholders within the period.
iv EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year excluding exceptional items by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 61 Base Salaries Executive Directors salaries are reviewed each year on 1 April and this review takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
In line with our remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee benchmarks Executive Directors salaries against a comparator group.
Given BGs international presence and position roughly in the middle of the FTSE 50, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to reference Executive Directors base salaries for the 1 April 2002 salary review against the median of the FTSE 50.
We will use the same comparator group for the 1 April 2003 salary review.
Annual Incentive Scheme The Company operates a cash-based Annual Incentive Scheme AIS, which provides an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 100% of base salary.
At the start of the incentive year 1 January, based on the Companys business priorities, the Remuneration Committee sets both the performance measures and the targets.
These targets ensure that incentives at the higher end of the range are payable only for demonstrably superior Company and individual performance.
For the Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee, the financial performance measure for the 2002 incentive year was EPS, adjusted to take into account the volatility of upstream commodity prices.
For the 2003 incentive year, the Remuneration Committee has agreed that the financial performance measures for Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive i Committee will be EPS again adjusted for commodity prices and return on average capital employed ROACE.
When determining incentive payments, the Remuneration Committee considers health, safety and environmental performance in addition to absolute and underlying financial performance.
When setting targets for 2002, the Remuneration Committee could not have foreseen the introduction of the North Sea tax surcharge.
The Remuneration Committee therefore decided to exclude the adverse effects of the surcharge when it determined the 2002 AIS payments.
Payments in respect of the 2002 incentive year will be made in April 2003 based on 2002 results.
Long-Term Incentives Estimated Present Value During 2001, the Remuneration Committee sought external, independent advice from Towers Perrin to establish an objective measure to describe the value at the time of grant or allocation of long-term incentives which may, or may not, pay out in the future.
This measure is referred to as the Estimated Present Value EPV.
The EPV takes account of the risk that all grants and allocations may be forfeited.
This EPV is then used to determine the appropriate levels of face value CSOS grants and LTIS allocations.
The changes approved by shareholders last year enable the Remuneration Committee to make awards under both schemes, up to a maximum combined EPV of 175% of base salary each year.
However, we stated the intention of the committee that long-term incentive grants in 2002 would not exceed a maximum combined EPV of 130% of base salary.
The actual maximum combined EPV granted during 2002 was slightly less than 130%.
Each year, the Remuneration Committee decides on the appropriate blend of CSOS grants and LTIS allocations that will be made to Executive Directors within the maximum combined EPV.
Awards will always be made under both schemes, with not less than one-third and not more than two-thirds of the total combined EPV being delivered by either scheme.
When making this decision, the Remuneration Committee takes a number of factors into consideration including cost, the need to remain within scheme dilution limits and the performance conditions considered to be key to BG Groups strategy at the time of the allocation or grant.
For the 2002 awards, the Executive Directors received two-thirds of the total combined EPV through the LTIS and one-third through the CSOS.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS Currently, a limited number of high performing employees deemed to be making a significant contribution to the Companys long-term TSR performance are allocated Company shares under the LTIS.
This allocation marks the beginning of the performance period.
The Companys TSR performance against that of a comparator group over the three year period will determine what proportion of the allocated shares will be transferred into the ownership of the employee.
The Remuneration Committee considers that measuring performance against a comparator group of companies ensures that executives are rewarded not solely based on BG Groups performance but also relative to the performance of the other companies in the comparator group.
The TSR performance is measured by the independent external corporate broker, Hoare Govett Limited, a subsidiary of ABN Amro Holding NV.
The LTIS comparator group for the 2002 allocation comprises 21 international oil and gas companies including BG Group plc of which 12 ii are headquartered in the USA, three in the UK and six elsewhere in Europe.
This group has been chosen because the Remuneration Committee believes that it comprises our major business competitors i. e. those companies against which BG is compared by shareholders.
i Average capital employed consists of total shareholders funds plus net borrowings averaged between the start and end of year.
ROACE represents total operating profit before exceptional items less BGs share of net interest receivable and payable by joint ventures and associated undertakings and the interest charge relating to the unwinding of discount on provisions as a percentage of average capital employed.
ii A different comparator group was used for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 allocations.
62 BG GROUP PLC 2002 remuneration report continued The other companies in the comparator group are as follows: Amerada Hess Corporation El Paso Corporation Repsol YPF SA Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ENI SpA Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. BP plc ExxonMobil Corporation Shell Transport & Trading Co. plc Burlington Resources Inc. Kerr McGee Corporation Statoil ASA ChevronTexaco Corporation Marathon Oil Corporation TotalFinaElf SA ConocoPhillips Petroleum Norsk Hydro ASA Unocal Corporation Duke Energy Corporation Occidental Petroleum Corporation For the 1999, 2000 and 2001 allocations, the Remuneration Committee set the following performance conditions: 100% of the allocated shares will be transferred only if upper quartile TSR performance is achieved: only 40% of the allocated shares will be transferred if median TSR performance is achieved.
A proportion of between 40% and 100% of the allocated shares will be transferred for between median and upper quartile performance: where TSR performance is below the median, all of the allocated shares will be forfeited.
There is no retest provision.
The performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee for the 2002 allocation are more stringent than for previous allocations and are as follows: 100% of the allocated shares will be transferred only if Number One TSR performance position is achieved: 75% of the allocated shares will be transferred if upper quartile TSR performance is achieved.
A proportion of between 75% and 100% of the allocated shares will be transferred for between upper quartile and Number One performance: only 30% of the allocated shares will be transferred if median TSR performance is achieved.
A proportion of between 30% and 75% of the allocated shares will be transferred for between median and upper quartile performance: where TSR performance is below the median, all the allocated shares will be forfeited.
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the performance conditions had been met at the time.
An allocation of shares was made under the LTIS in October 1999 to UK payroll employees and overseas employees above a certain level of seniority.
The performance period for the allocation ended on 30 September 2002.
BGs final position in the comparator group meant that 46% of the original allocation of shares was put into trust on behalf of participating employees.
Subject to the rules of the LTIS, the shares will be transferred to those employees in October 2003.
Company Share Option Scheme CSOS Approximately 1 200 employees are currently eligible to participate in the BG Group CSOS including UK payroll employees and overseas employees above a certain level of seniority.
The Company grants an option over its shares to each eligible employee and the option price is set at the fair market value at the time of the grant.
As described below, the CSOS measures performance according to EPS growth relative to the growth in RPIX.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the inclusion of an EPS performance measure ensures that executives only receive rewards when the Company has achieved sustained earnings growth during the performance period.
To the extent that the performance target has been met three years from the date of grant, the option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time up to the expiry of ten years from the date of grant.
In 2002, the levels of grant made to individual employees were differentiated based on each individuals performance to date and expectation of future contributions.
For the 2002 grant, the Remuneration Committee set the following performance targets, which it considers to be particularly demanding.
These targets also apply to the 2000 and the 2001 grants: for all of the option to become exercisable, the Company must achieve EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus 30%: only half of the option will be exercisable if EPS growth over three years is RPIX plus 15%.
A proportion of between half and all of the option will be exercisable if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus between 15 and 30%: if the Companys EPS growth over three years is less than RPIX plus 15%, all the option will be forfeited.
Fixed point retesting is allowed in years four and five, in which EPS growth of RPIX plus 40% or plus 50% respectively must be achieved for all the option to become exercisable.
This ensures that management is motivated to make the right decisions for the long-term growth of value without compromising the stretching performance conditions.
At the end of year five, the option will be exercisable only to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
In the event of a change of control, exercise of the option under the CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the performance conditions had been met at the time.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 63 Currently, grants to individuals under the CSOS are subject to a limit based on the aggregate of awards made within the preceding 12 month period.
This is inconsistent with the individual limit contained in the LTIS, which is based on allocations made in a calendar year.
This timing differential limits the Remuneration Committees flexibility when apportioning the combined EPV of awards appropriately between CSOS and LTIS on an annual basis.
It is therefore proposed to amend the CSOS to bring the grant basis into line with the LTIS, such that the limits on grants to individuals will be based on grants made in a calendar year for both schemes.
Approval will be sought from shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting to this amendment.
This will ensure that the Remuneration Committee has the flexibility under each scheme to determine the appropriate blend of awards under CSOS and LTIS that may be made to Executive Directors.
This is a technical, rather than substantive, amendment.
It will not result in increased annual grants being made.
All-Employee Share Schemes In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently provides two all-employee share schemes for its UK employees, the Share Incentive Plan SIP and the Sharesave Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The BG Group SIP is approved by the Inland Revenue.
There are two parts to the SIP the Partnership Shares Plan and the Free Shares Plan.
i Partnership Shares Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan.
Shares are currently purchased every six months using employees accumulated deductions and placed in trust.
The third Partnership Share purchase was made in October 2002.
Sixty-one per cent of eligible employees participate in this plan, of which 66% are contributing the maximum of 125 per month.
ii Free Shares A Free Shares award of 983 shares was made in May 2002 to all eligible employees in the UK based on BGs performance during 2001.
These shares will be held in trust for up to five years.
For 2002, the Board will allow awards of Free Shares in the Company to be made up to a value of 3 000 the statutory limit for each individual.
All eligible employees will receive the same number of shares.
This number will be determined based on the extent to which the Company has met the agreed profit targets for 2002.
Sharesave Scheme The Company continued to operate the BG Group Sharesave Scheme in 2002.
The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue and provides for eligible employees to acquire the Companys shares with the proceeds of a monthly savings contract.
The contract period is three or five years.
Eighty-one per cent of eligible employees currently participate in the Sharesave Scheme, contributing an average monthly payment of 207 the maximum being 250.
Employee Profit Sharing Scheme This scheme ceased to operate at the end of 2000.
During 2002, shares allocated to participants in respect of the 1998 scheme were released and transferred into their names.
Shares held in respect of the 1999 and 2000 schemes will be released to eligible participants in 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Shareholding Guidelines During 2002, shareholding guidelines were introduced for Executive Directors, Group Executive Committee members and certain other senior employees to encourage substantial long-term share ownership.
These require that over a period of five years Executive Directors build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value equivalent to twice base salary.
The required holding for other members of the Group Executive Committee is one-times base salary.
The guidelines require that, in relation to 2002 and future LTIS allocations, vested shares net of tax should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached.
Service Contracts The Executive Directors service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Remuneration Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to manage the Company.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a notice period of one year is appropriate.
The Executive Directors service contracts contain change of control provisions.
Should the Directors employment be terminated within 12 months of a change of control, they are entitled to liquidated damages.
The amount of liquidated damages is equal to one years then gross salary and a credit of one years pensionable service less any deductions the employer is required to make, which the Remuneration Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss.
The Remuneration Committee considers that these clauses assist with recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the best interests of shareholders.
Other than change of control clauses, the Executive Directors service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event of early termination.
When calculating termination payments, the Remuneration Committee takes into account a variety of factors including individual and Company performance, the obligation for the Director to mitigate his or her own loss for example by gaining new employment, the Directors age and length of service.
Further details of the Executive Directors service contracts can be found on pages 65 and 66.
64 BG GROUP PLC 2002 remuneration report continued Non-Executive Directors The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high calibre with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
Non-executive Directors are generally appointed for an initial three year period.
The terms of their engagement are set out in a letter of i appointment.
The initial appointment and any subsequent re-appointment is subject to election or re-election by shareholders.
The letters of appointment do not contain notice periods or provision for termination payments.
ii Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee.
Additional fees are also payable, for example, for chairing a committee of the Board or acting as Deputy Chairman.
The level of Directors fees is reviewed against market practice every two years, taking into account the required time commitment.
The next review takes place this year.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.

66 BG GROUP PLC 2002 remuneration report continued Change of control As described on page 63, the Executive Directors employment contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company: or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert: or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company other than a subsidiary or associated company.
A change of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that company including its subsidiaries is transferred to another company unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if and, only if through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned by substantially the same shareholders, as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors employment contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any deductions the employer is required to make and shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights or statutory employment protection claims.

BG GROUP PLC 2002 67 DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN SHARES UNDER THE NEW LONG TERM INCENTIVE SCHEME Notional allocations of shares Notional Notional Notional Notional Notional Notional made on allocations allocations allocations allocations allocations allocations 1 Oct 1999 of shares of shares of shares of shares of shares of shares and subsequently made on made on made on as at made on as at reconstituted i 3 Nov 2000 1 Mar 2001 22 Nov 2001 1 Jan 2002 5 Sep 2002 31 Dec 2002 ii iii Ashley Almanza 12 086 7 570 29 848 49 504 274 272 323 776 iv Andrew Bonfield 141 322 175 037 316 359 ii iii Frank Chapman 164 306 181 700 225 706 571 712 611 286 1 182 998 ii iii William Friedrich 113 289 180 489 223 403 517 181 450 881 968 062 Or at date of appointment if later.
i The October 1999 notional allocation was reconstituted after demerger using the average share prices of the first ten days of trading of the shares of the Company and Lattice Group plc immediately following demerger, as proportions of the aggregate of the two to produce the appropriate factors for adjustment.
As a result, the initial allocation price was decreased from 376.46p to 245.73p and the initial allocation was increased by a factor of 1.532008 in the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme.
As a result of the performance criteria measured in October 2002, 46% of this notional allocation of shares is now subject to the one year retention period the remainder of the allocation has lapsed.
These shares will be transferred to the Executive Directors on 1 October 2003 when the retention period ends.
ii The transfer of shares is dependent on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of a three year performance period followed by a further one year retention period, except for the awards made in September 2002, for which no retention period applies.
The performance periods end in November 2003, November 2004 and September 2005 respectively for the notional allocations made in November 2000, November 2001 and September 2002. iii Dividends paid on shares held in trust may, at the discretion of the trustees, be reinvested in BG Group plc shares by the trustees and held on behalf of the Executive Directors until the normal release date of the respective allocations.
On 23 December 2002, the trustees reinvested the interim dividend as follows: Ashley Almanza 33 shares, Frank Chapman 449 shares and William Friedrich 309 shares.
iv Andrew Bonfield ceased to be an Executive Director on 16 August 2002 following his resignation.
As a result of his resignation, all his notional allocations lapsed immediately.
The notional allocation of shares received by Andrew Bonfield in March 2001, following his appointment as Executive Director, was in line with the allocations made to the other Executive Directors in November 2000, following the demerger of Lattice Group plc.
The allocation made to him in November 2001 was made partly under the terms of the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme and partly as a special one-off allocation on identical terms.
The latter was made following consultation with the Financial Services Authority and served to bring his allocation in line with the allocations of the other Executive Directors.
Market prices at the date of the awards were as follows: 3 November 2000 265.5p, 22 November 2001 261p, and 5 September 2002 251.75p.
Market price at the date of the reinvestment of dividends was as follows: 23 December 2002 263p.
The performance conditions for the Scheme are set out on pages 61 to 62.
DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN ORDINARY SHARES None of the Executive Directors hold options under the Executive Share Option Scheme and no grants have been made under that scheme since 1994.

OTHER INTERESTS There have been no changes in the interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings between 1 January 2003 and 21 February 2003.

PENSIONS All the Executive Directors were members of the BG Pension Scheme throughout the year.
They are all subject to the earnings cap, which is a restriction on the amount of pay that can be used to calculate pensions payable from a UK tax approved pension scheme.
The Company has agreed to increase their retirement benefits including contingent death benefits by means of an unapproved arrangement, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme, to at least the level which would otherwise have been provided had they not been subject to the earnings cap.
Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for these post-retirement benefits.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 69 The arrangements for Frank Chapman and William Friedrich have not changed during the year.
They provide an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension equivalent to two-thirds of their final 12 months salary on retirement from BG at age 60, inclusive of pension rights earned either in previous employments or previous pension arrangements.
On appointment as an Executive Director with effect from 1 August 2002, Ashley Almanzas pension arrangements were aligned with those of the other Executive Directors.
Prior to that date he accrued benefits on the standard basis applicable to UK employees.
As for all members of the BG Pension Scheme, if the Company consents to retirement, no actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable from age 55, provided 10 years service has been completed with the Group which includes pensionable service transferred from previous employment.
Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation.
An adult dependants pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to retirement age.
On death in retirement an adult dependants pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the members pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum.
Andrew Bonfield was entitled to pension arrangements on the same basis as the other Executive Directors.
However, when he left the Company on 16 August 2002, he had completed less than two years pensionable service.
A member leaving in such circumstances may request a transfer payment within a specific period but this opportunity was not taken up.
He therefore received a refund of his own contributions and has no continuing entitlement to benefits under the BG Pension Scheme or the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme.
Directors pension provisions were as follows: Total Directors Increase in accrued contributions pension annual in year to in year to pension at 31 Dec 2002 i Age at 31 Dec 2002 i iii 31 Dec 2002 Retirement 000 31 Dec 2002 000 pa 000 pa age a b Ashley Almanza 4 39 7 7 28 60 Frank Chapman 15 49 57 55 210 60 William Friedrich 15 53 37 35 194 60 a Actual increase.
b Increase net of price inflation.

iii The increase in pension and transfer value for Frank Chapman and also for William Friedrich arises from the fact that his pensionable service has increased by one year and his pensionable salary has increased during the year, and not from any change to his pension promise.
However, as at 31 December 2001 Frank Chapmans pensionable salary was restricted by notional Inland Revenue limits.
This resulted in a reduced accrued pension and transfer value at that date, but the limits did not impact on his 31 December 2002 pensionable salary.
Consequently, his increase in accrued pension and transfer value over the year reflect not only a year of pension accrual but also the change from a pensionable salary which was limited to one which was not.
If the effect of the latter is removed, his increase in accrued pension over the year is 33 000 and his increase in transfer value is 459 000. iv The transfer values shown at the end of 2001 and 2002 represent the value of each Executive Directors accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date.
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with guidance note GN11 issued by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, it is Company policy to allow each of them to accept one external appointment as a non-executive director of another company, the fees for which would be retained by the individual Director.
