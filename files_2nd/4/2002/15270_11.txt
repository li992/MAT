Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2002 26 27 The following report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which came into force in August 2002 and satisfies the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr P. S. Wood who took over as Chairman from Dr M. J. Peagram on 6 March 2002, Mr P. J. Welch and Mr G. Montezemolo.
The Committee is responsible for determining the companys policy on executive remuneration and the specific remuneration for each of the executive directors including pension rights.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the group.
The Committee was assisted in its deliberations on directors remuneration by Monks Partnership Monks.
With the approval of the Remuneration Committee, Monks have been retained by the company and during the year provided general executive remuneration advice for salary review purposes and specific remuneration advice in connection with the recruitment of senior executives.
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors, including members of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during 2002.
Remuneration Policy The companys policy is to structure executive pay in such a way that key executives may be recruited, motivated and retained through being offered remuneration packages that are competitive.
For that purpose, the Committee uses data provided by external independent surveys relevant to the industry or sector in which each Yule Catto subsidiary operates.
While not adopting set formulae, the Committee is also sensitive to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group when considering annual salary increases and total remuneration.
The major element of the remuneration package of senior executives is a competitive basic salary, which is reviewed with effect from 1 January each year.
For executive directors this review is conducted with the assistance of an annual independent survey of salaries at UK industrial and service companies with a similar profile to the company in terms of overseas operations, turnover and market capitalisation plus UK chemical companies.
The survey presents market guidelines for basic pay and increases in basic salaries for executive directors in the UK during the previous 12 months.
The Committee then use this information to recommend basic salaries for the executive directors, in line with the Boards policy of awarding for good performance a basic salary of approximately the market median for companies of a similar size and complexity.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee has overseen the introduction of special incentives, which are designed to reward the achievement of predetermined targets by the individuals concerned.
These incentives, which were designed in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A to the Code of Best Practice, currently comprise annual cash bonuses and membership of one of two shareholder approved longer-term incentive plans the Share Plans.
Annual cash bonuses The annual cash bonus payment for the executive directors is an amount equal to the percentage of basic pay calculated by reference to the annual growth in the companys adjusted earnings per share after deducting the annual rise in the rate of headline inflation RPI multiplied by a factor of 2.5 subject to a limit of 50% of basic pay.
For divisional chief executives, managing directors of subsidiary companies and senior head office employees the annual cash bonus payments are based on appropriate profit and cash flow targets and personal business objectives.
In 2002 the bonuses were subject to limits of 40%, 30% and 30% of basic pay respectively.
The structures of the bonuses and awards under it are reviewed periodically and are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Share plans The Share Plans comprise the Performance Share Plan the Performance Plan and the Longer-term Deferred Bonus Plan the Deferred Plan.
The Performance Plan was introduced in 2002 following shareholder approval at that years Annual General Meeting and covers the executive directors, divisional chief executives and senior head office employees.
An award consists of a right to acquire shares which can be exercised for a nominal price, subject to the company satisfying performance conditions.
For awards made in 2002 an award will vest in respect of 100 per cent of the shares only if the companys adjusted earnings per share over a three year period ending on 31 December 2004 has increased by at least 50% compared with the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2001 with adjusted earnings per share to be calculated on a consistent basis.
The award will not vest in respect of any shares unless the companys earnings per share over the same period has increased by at least 30 per cent at which point the award will vest in respect of 30 per cent of the shares under the award.
The proportion of the award which will vest for an increase in the companys earnings per share over the same period between 30 per cent and 50 per cent will be calculated on a straight line basis.
In addition an award which vests in accordance with these targets will only be exercisable and allocated shares may only be transferred as to one half after the third anniversary of the date the award is made and as to the remaining half after the fourth anniversary of the date the award is made.
The Remuneration Commitee will set performance conditions for future awards under the Performance Plan such that they will only normally be exercisable if stretching earnings per share growth targets are met.
The value of shares awarded under the Performance Plan in any financial year to any individual may not exceed 100 per cent of his annual salary excluding benefits in kind.
The Performance Plan replaced the companys Longer-term Performance Share Plan which covered the same group of executives.
Awards made under that plan in 2001 which also consisted of the right to acquire shares which could be exercised for a nominal price are still subject to the company satisfying performance conditions.
Those performance conditions are measured by comparing the growth in adjusted earnings per share with that of a similar group of UK and continental European chemical companies over a three year period subject to such growth being not less than 2% above Note inflation in each of the three years.
If the companys earnings per share growth is in the top quartile of the comparator group over that period, the participant may receive the full number of shares awarded to him or her: if worse than the 60th percentile in the comparator group, the participant will receive nothing.
Between the 25th and 60th percentiles, the proportion of the maximum award will be calculated on a sliding scale with 100 per cent of the maximum award payable at the 25th percentile and 20 per cent payable at the 60th percentile.
In addition an award must be exercised as to one third after each of three, four and five years.
The value of shares awarded under the Longer-term Performance Share Plan in any financial year to any individual could not exceed 50% of his annual salary excluding benefits in kind.
In 2002 the performance conditions relating to the awards made in 1999 were assessed.
As a result of the growth in the companys earnings per share over the three year period from 1999 to 2001 ranking it eighth in the comparator group of twenty six companies each participant received 87% of the shares awarded in 1999.
When it considered the replacement of the Longer-term Performance Share Plan the Remuneration Committee was particularly conscious that a new share plan for the companys key executives should be competitive and align executives interests with those of shareholders.
It also considered that it was not presently practical to set a performance condition by reference to the performance of a comparator group of companies as consolidation in the companys sector over recent years has made it increasingly difficult to compile a stable comparator group.
Further, awards using the performance conditions attaching to awards under the Longer-term Performance Share Plan could vest in part even where the companys performance was below median performance in the comparator group.
For these reasons the performance conditions for awards under the Performance Share Plan will only normally be exercisable if stretching earnings per share targets are met.
The Deferred Plan covers managing directors of subsidiary companies and an award takes the form of a right to acquire shares in the company which can be exercised for a nominal price after three years.
The value of shares subject to an award is determined by reference to sustained growth in the profit before tax set at a minimum of 5% per annum of the company or subsidiary for which the participant works by reference to a base year determined at the date of grant.
The value of shares subject to an award may not exceed 20% of any participants base salary excluding benefits in kind in any year.
During 2002, 298,807 shares and 5,372 shares were awarded under the Performance Plan and the Deferred Plan respectively.
Executive directors are entitled to participate in grants of options made under the companys Savings-Related Share Option Scheme as and when these are made.
