As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The adjusted basic earnings per share figure for 2001 has been recalculated to take account of the adoption of FRS19 thereby reducing the figure from 7.3p to 6.8p, and a further reduction of 0.2p to 6.6p in order to exclude those operations that were discontinued in 2001.
