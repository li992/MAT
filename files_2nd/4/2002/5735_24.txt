also provided Exel with independent Exel plc Annual report 2002 Governance 37 The Remuneration Committee believes that its current remuneration policy meets its current objectives but is mindful that the dynamic market conditions of the industry in which Exel operates require the Committee to ensure that the approach to remuneration is adapted as necessary.
The Committee is committed to consulting with shareholders appropriately and in accordance with best practice.
Performance graph The graph below shows the total shareholder return TSR performance of an investment of 100 in Exel shares over the last five years compared with an equivalent investment in the FTSE 350 index.
TSR is essentially defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
The FTSE 350 was selected as the most appropriate broad equity market index because Exel is a constituent member and the Committee believes that this broader index is a more appropriate benchmark for performance over a five year period.
The FTSE 350 is also the index used for the purposes of the Exel Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.

Performance linkages Each element of the reward package supports the achievement of key business measures, as illustrated in the table below.
Element Structure Purpose Performance standard Base salary Fixed: Reflects the competitive market rate for the job, the Individual or business short-term individuals contribution and the Companys ability to pay performance Annual Variable: Rewards the delivery of operational financial goals Earnings per Incentive short-term share growth and Plan profit before tax Executive Variable: Directly links to long-term growth strategy through share Earnings per Share medium price growth share growth Option long-term Aligns executives with shareholders interests Scheme Long Term Variable: Aligns executives with shareholders interests Relative total Incentive Plan medium Supports superior business performance in relation shareholder return and long-term to comparator companies earnings per share growth The Committee intends that at least half of total compensation should be linked to corporate performance.
Exel plc Annual report 2002 38 Governance Remuneration elements a.
Base salary External remuneration consultants regularly provide the Remuneration Committee with market data based on the appropriate peer groups.
The Remuneration Committee takes into account individual performance and the pay position described above before deciding individual salary awards.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
Annual Incentive Plan The Remuneration Committee approves the maximum award levels under the Annual Incentive Plan and the business financial measures against which performance will be assessed.
The maximum level of award will be 75% of base salary in 2003.
The performance measures are the growth in management profit before tax of the business units and Exels growth in earnings per share EPS.
c. Medium to long-term incentive Exel delivers its medium to long-term share-based incentives through the Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 ESOS 2001 and or the LTIP as detailed in paragraphs d. and e. below.
The decision as to whether to use the ESOS 2001 and or the LTIP is determined by the Remuneration Committee based on what is considered most appropriate to motivate executives to achieve the businesses objectives taking into account internal and external business and market conditions.
d. Share options Executive Directors and other eligible employees participate in the ESOS 2001, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2001.
The link between share price and option gains provides a built-in performance driver for recipients and directly aligns them with shareholders interests.
The price at which shares may be acquired by the exercise of an option under the ESOS 2001 is determined by the Board before its grant, and is no less than the middle-market quotation of Exel shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the dealing day immediately preceding the grant date or the average of such quotations over the three dealing days immediately preceding the grant date.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS 2001 is subject to a specific performance requirement relating to growth in the Companys EPS before net non-cash pension credit or charge, exceptional items and goodwill relative to inflation measured by the UK Retail Price Index RPI.
The following targets apply: Average growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation Proportion of options exercisable 5% or more pa 100% 3-5% pa pro rata between 33% and 100% 3% pa 33% Less than 3% pa Nil The Remuneration Committee believes that EPS is the most appropriate performance condition for the ESOS 2001.
Executive Directors receive awards under the plan only when there has been an increase in the profitability of the Company as set out in the table above.
The performance condition is measured from a fixed base point ie the EPS for the financial year before options are granted and will initially be compared with the EPS three years later.
To the extent that the performance condition is not satisfied in full after three years, the Remuneration Committee believes that it is appropriate for the performance condition to be retested after the fourth and fifth financial years but, if it is not met after the fifth financial year, the options will lapse.
Vested options will expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant.
The plan uses newly issued shares and shares purchased in the market.
Share ownership through share options is extended to all UK employees through the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2002.
The Company complies with the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers as regards the limit on dilution of 10% of issued share capital under all share plans in any 10 year period.
Exel plc Annual report 2002 Governance 39 e. Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 1996 Annual General Meeting.
Participants who have received provisional awards of shares in the Company are able, subject to satisfying the relevant performance conditions, to take the shares into their own names four years after the date of grant.
Until that time, the shares are held in a trust which has an independent trustee.
Dividends on the shares are reinvested to acquire further shares which are added to the shares a participant may receive.
The performance conditions, which must be satisfied before the shares vest, relate primarily to TSR, which measures growth in Exels share price and dividends over the three year period following an award.
There is an additional performance condition relating to growth in EPS, a long-term aim of the Company.
The extent to which the award is available to participants will be determined primarily by the Companys TSR in comparison with that of companies in the FTSE Mid 250 index for the earlier awards and the FTSE 350 index for the most recent award.
Relative TSR has been chosen as the most appropriate performance measure because it requires the Company to have outperformed its peers before any rewards are received by executives.
Achievement of performance against the comparator group is tracked and advised by external advisers.
The annual awards since 1996 have been of shares with a value of 100% of basic salary and will vest in full only if, once the relevant companies are ranked by TSR, the Company is ranked in the top 10%.
A total of 40% of the shares will be available if the Company is ranked in the top 50% of companies.
Between these two points, the higher the decile in which the Company is ranked, the greater the number of shares that will be available.
No shares will be released if the Company is ranked below the top 50%.
Moreover, no award will be released to a participant if, for the third financial year after the base year, underlying EPS does not exceed the EPS for the base year by at least the percentage increase in the RPI over the same period plus 6%.
This ensures that no award is released under the LTIP unless there has been an acceptable level of underlying financial performance.
In certain compassionate circumstances, participants who leave employment will still be entitled to some benefit at the end of the four year period.
However, if they were not in employment for all of the first three years of that period, their benefit will be scaled down to reflect their shorter service.
It is the Remuneration Committees intention to grant further awards under the LTIP in 2003.
Whilst the Committee believes that the performance conditions currently in place are both appropriate and challenging, it intends to make the following amendments to the performance and vesting criteria.
The EPS performance criteria will be strengthened such that no award may be released to a participant if, for the third financial year after the base year, underlying EPS does not exceed the EPS for the base year by at least the percentage increase in the RPI over the same period plus 9%.
In respect of the TSR measure, no awards will vest for below median performance and awards will vest at 40% for 50th percentile performance.
Vesting thereafter will be on a straight line basis, rather than a stepped basis, up to 100% for 90th percentile performance.
The LTIP remains unaltered in all other respects.
Whilst it is the Committees intention to grant further LTIP awards in 2003, it will continue to review whether this is the most appropriate mechanism to align our senior executives with the interests of shareholders and motivate them to further improve business performance in the longer-term.
f. Pensions and other benefits The Remuneration Committee is responsible for ensuring the appropriate application of Exel s approach to retirement benefits for executive Directors.
All executive Directors participate either in the UK or US pension plans entitling them to final salary-related and or defined contribution benefits.
Normal retirement age is 60 under the plans, although the normal retirement age is 62 for the defined contribution plan of which Mr Edwards is a member.
Retirement benefits are designed to be both locally competitive and cost effective.
The Company has announced its intention to introduce new defined contribution pension arrangements from 1 April 2003 for newly recruited employees in the UK businesses.
There will be no change to the defined benefit arrangements for existing UK employees, ie those employed on or before 31 March 2003.
Further information on the executive Directors pensions is detailed below.
Directors are provided with permanent health insurance, private medical cover, life and death in service cover and cars or car allowances in line with competitive practice.
Directors in the UK are eligible to participate in Exels Savings Related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as all UK employees.
Exel plc Annual report 2002 40 Governance 3.
Service contracts With effect from 31 December 2002, all contracts with executive Directors are rolling and subject to a maximum of 12 months notice of termination if given by the Company and six months notice of termination if given by the executive Director.
The Company may elect to terminate the employment of an executive Director early by a making a payment to him calculated by reference to the value of salary and bonus entitlement which he would have received during the unexpired portion of the notice period, b enhancing his pensionable service under the Company pension scheme so that he is treated as if he had remained in employment during the unexpired portion of his notice period: and c continuing to provide him with medical insurance, permanent health insurance, company car or car allowance and death in service benefits for the unexpired portion of his notice period or paying him in lieu of such benefits a, b and c above are referred to as the Compensation.
In addition, both John Allan and David Riddle are entitled to liquidated damages calculated in the same manner as the Compensation in the event that they are constructively dismissed or dismissed in breach of contract.
In the event that the Company wishes to terminate the employment of an executive Director within 12 months after a change of control, it must serve 21 months notice upon him.
All contracts with executive Directors provide for the payment of liquidated damages, calculated in the same manner as the Compensation in the event of a the early termination of the contract by the Company within 12 months after a change of control: or b the executive Director serving a 60 day counter-notice on the Company within five months of the Company serving 21 months notice on him: or c the executive Director terminating the contract within one month following a change of control in the case of John Allan and David Riddle only.
In the event that the Company chooses to enforce restrictive covenants against an executive Director following termination of his contract, then the Company shall pay to the executive Director compensation calculated in the same manner as the Compensation for the duration for which the Company chooses to enforce the restrictive covenants up to a maximum of six months.
This provision does not apply to Bruce Edwards.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board consider it important, in line with the recommendations of the Code, to employ executive Directors under contracts which are, under normal circumstances, terminable on 12 months notice or less and which provide explicitly for compensation payable in the case of early termination and are also mindful of the need to retain executive Directors of appropriate calibre, expertise and experience in a highly competitive global market.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board consider that the incorporation of the protection on change of control outlined above is in the best interests of the Company for the following reasons: a it provides security for executive Directors in the event of a change of control or potential change of control, helping them to focus on the management of the business of the Company: b it is considered appropriate to increase the notice period of executive Directors following a change of control in order to reflect the historical practice of the Company which entitled executive Directors to 24 months notice of termination of employment, and which practice was amended on 31 December 2002, when Messrs Allan, Coghlan and Riddle agreed to reduce their notice entitlement under normal circumstances to 12 months: and c it encourages the retention of executive Directors during the period of a change of control or potential change of control.
Future executive appointments to the Board would be expected to have notice periods of 12 months unless, in order to attract candidates of sufficient calibre, it is considered necessary to offer a longer period initially.
The dates of the contracts the executive Directors have with the Company are shown in the table below: Executive Contract date J M Allan 1 October 1994 J B Coghlan 16 October 1995 B A Edwards 30 April 2000 M P Fountain 31 December 2002 D E Riddle 1 October 1994 I R Smith 31 December 2002 Exel plc Annual report 2002 Governance 41 The non-executive Directors each have a letter of appointment containing a reciprocal, rolling one month notice clause and are subject to the Companys Articles of Association.
The remuneration for non-executive Directors consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board committee meetings.
The non-executive Directors fees are determined by the Board after taking into account competitive levels, the responsibilities and time commitment of the non-executive Directors.
The Chairman of the Board is paid a fee of 150,000 per annum.
The other non-executive Directors each received a fee of 28,000 for their general Board duties in 2002.
In addition, any non-executive Director who chaired the Audit Committee or the Remuneration Committee for a full year was paid an additional 5,000.
Annual fees paid to non-executive Directors in the year ended 31 December 2002 are set out in the table below.
The service contracts of the executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the non-executive Directors will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Mr Devaney resigned as a Director on 30 September 2002.
Mr Rich was appointed as Chairman on 1 October 2002.
The main non-cash benefits for executive Directors are car and fuel allowances, insurances relating to medical, dental, ill health, death in service, key man and life assurance.
In order to be market competitive, the two executive Directors based in the US also receive additional benefits such as club membership and appropriate expenses relating to financial planning and family travel.
Directors pensions Mr Allan, Mr Coghlan, Mr Riddle and Mr Smith are members of the Ocean Nestor Pension Scheme.
The scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational pension scheme.
Benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits as applicable.
Mr Fountains pension is achieved through a combination of the MSAS Cargo International Inc retirement programme and the MSAS Cargo International Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan.
Mr Fountain does not pay contributions to the plans.
Exel plc Annual report 2002 42 Governance The main features of the plans, as they apply to Directors, are: Ocean scheme MSAS schemes Normal retirement age 60 60 Pension accrual 1 30 of final salary for each year of service 70% of final five years average salary inclusive of any benefits accrued from Primary Social Security provided the executive has completed at least 20 years of pensionable service Early retirement reduction 2% pa for each year under age 60 5% pa for each year under age 60 Ill health pension Projected pension without reduction Not applicable Life assurance Four times salary Available outside the plan Spouse dependant pension Payable on death Payable on death Pension increases Lower of RPI or 5% Not applicable Mr Allan, Mr Coghlan and Mr Smith have pensions which are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap, which is currently 97,200, and additional pension provision is by way of defined contributions to their funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes FURBS.
Mr Riddle is not affected by the earnings cap.
Mr Edwards is a member of the qualified and non-qualified Exel Inc retirement programmes, which are defined contribution plans.
US legislation in respect of qualified retirement plans provides that a maximum of US$200,000 of salary can be used to calculate employer contributions towards the programme.
There are other applicable levels and limits that further restrict the amount of employer and employee contributions to a qualified plan.
Mr Edwards benefits are accordingly financed through a qualified plan, and also a non-qualified plan to which contributions are paid in excess of the limits.
Mr Edwards benefits in the combined plans provide for an overall matched employer contribution of 5% of remuneration per annum.
In addition, Mr Edwards is eligible for an annual profit sharing contribution which is paid into his qualified plan account.
Defined benefits The following table sets out information on the defined benefit elements of Directors pensions.

This represents the value of the increase of the pension over the year in the first column above assessed at 31 December 2002 and does not take into account any change in the transfer value basis ie financial conditions over the year.
The change in the transfer value reflects both the increase in accrued pension over the year offset by changes to the transfer value basis over the year.
In particular, for Mr Coghlan, the effect of the fall in the equity market outweighed the increase in accrued pension, and as a result the effect of the change in the transfer value was negative.
Exel plc Annual report 2002 Governance 43 Defined contributions During 2002, 21,000 was paid by the Company in respect of Mr Edwards defined contributions, as well as 89,000, 65,000 and 51,000 in respect of the defined contributions to the FURBS for Mr Allan, Mr Coghlan and Mr Smith respectively.
Share options Executive share options Details of executive options granted to the Directors under the 1984, 1994 and 2001 Executive Share Option Schemes and the former Exel 1992 Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS 1992 are set out below: Total options At 1 Jan At 31 Dec Exercise Exercisable at 31 Dec 2002 Granted Exercised 2002 price p from Expiry date 2002 1 J M Allan 50,000 50,000 249 7.10.1997 6.10.2004 39,466 39,466 375 16.10.1998 15.10.2005 180,343 180,343 786 27.4.
Mr Allan exercised options on 24 June 2002 when the mid-market closing price of Exel shares was 831p.
Mr Edwards exercised options on 29 May 2002 when the mid-market closing price of Exel shares was 892p.
No executive share options, held by the executive Directors, lapsed during the year.
The last grant of options under the ESOS 1994 was made in March 2002.
For those options granted under this plan which have been exercised, the performance condition required to be satisfied was that, at the date of exercise, the underlying EPS must have exceeded the increase in the RPI by 6% over the preceding three year period.
There is one remaining executive who holds options granted under the ESOS 1984.
In contrast to the ESOS 1994, the vesting of options is not subject to any performance criteria.
At the time of the merger in May 2000, Mr Edwards chose to convert some of his executive options over former Exel shares, granted under the ESOS 1992, into options over shares in the new Company in accordance with the merger offer.
The performance calculation at that time showed that the options were exercisable in full.
The performance criteria was based on growth in shareholder value ranked against a peer group of 23 companies.
If former Exel was ranked in the top eight companies then 100% of options were exercisable.
The performance condition attaching to the grants of options under ESOS 2001 is described above.
No options vest if EPS has grown by less than three per cent a year in excess of inflation over a three year period.
All the options vest if EPS growth exceeds 5% a year in excess of inflation.
Exel plc Annual report 2002 44 Governance Savings-related share options The Directors held the following interests in savings-related share options at the year end: Total options At 1 Jan At 31 Dec Exercise Exercisable at 31 Dec 2002 Exercised 2002 price p from Expiry date 2002 J M Allan 1,653 1,653 586 1.12.2004 31.5.
Mr Coghlan exercised options on 11 March 2002 when the mid-market closing price of Exel shares was 850p.
In relation to the executive Directors, no savings-related share options were granted or lapsed during the year.
Options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price at the date of grant and the number of shares granted is calculated according to the projected savings plus bonus at maturity.
The mid-market closing price of Exel shares at 31 December 2002 was 688p and the range of closing prices during 2002 was 591.5p to 950p.
Long Term Incentive Plan No provisional awards under the LTIP were made during 2002.
The number of shares ultimately transferred to each Director depends on certain performance conditions being met.
The Remuneration Committee previously resolved that 85% of each of the awards made on 3 May 1996, 6 August 1997, 16 March 1998 and 5 May 1998 should vest after three years and may be released to participants one year later.
The relevant performance criteria for the award made on 15 March 1999 were not satisfied and therefore the award lapsed on 15 March 2002.
The awards held by the executive Directors are as follows: At 1 Jan Reinvested Shares At 31 Dec Qualifying 2002 dividends Lapsed released 2002 period ends J M Allan 62,660 1,041 63,701 3.5.
At the year end, Mr Smith was the only executive Director who held an award which remained available for release.
