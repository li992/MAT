14 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Remuneration report Strategy The success of Marks & Spencer is dependent upon the skill and experience of motivated employees throughout all levels of the business, and it is part of our strategy to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals who are able to secure the recovery of the business and continuously build for the future.
The level of remuneration and benets we offer is key to supporting this objective and maintaining our market position as an employer of choice.
The Board has adopted the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration as set out in the Combined Code.
The Remuneration Report follows the provisions in Schedule B to the Code.
Remuneration Committee the Committee The Committee comprises Dame Stella Rimington Chairman, Brian Baldock, Tony Ball and Jack Keenan appointed September 2001.
It recommends to the Board the reward framework to allow the Company to attract and retain its executive directors and senior management, giving due regard to the financial and commercial health of the Company.
The Committees approach reects the Companys overall philosophy that all employees should be appropriately rewarded, in particular for delivering superior performance which contributes to improved business results.
The Committee keeps itself fully informed of all relevant developments and best practice in the eld of remuneration and seeks advice where appropriate from external advisors.
Remuneration policy The Company aims to align the interests of all employees closely with the interests of shareholders in securing the Groups recovery.
Total remuneration comprises xed pay, variable pay and benets.
The performance-related element now forms a more significant proportion of the total potential package and, consistent with the focus on delivering results, is set against agreed targets to deliver improved business performance.
There are two components to variable pay: annual bonus and long-term incentives in the form of share schemes.
profit sharing and SAYE schemes, encouraging employees at all levels to acquire and hold shares in the Company, are key elements of the policy.
Employees have maintained their strong commitment to share ownership in recent years, and currently 42,700 employees hold approximately 31 million shares in their own right and 31,000 employees hold options on 78 million shares under the SAYE scheme.
Salaries and benets Salaries and benets for executive directors are reviewed annually.
Salaries are benchmarked against equivalent market salaries for companies with a similar turnover and market capitalisation and are currently set around the median point of the comparator group.
The salaries are set by the Committee after consideration of the Company performance, market conditions, the level of increase awarded to employees throughout the business and the need to reward individual performance.
With the exception of his personal remuneration, the Chairman assists the Committee in this review.
Annual Bonus Scheme The Annual Bonus Scheme is designed to reinforce the relationship between individual and corporate performance and reward.
The targets are determined annually by the Committee and incorporate a mixture of financial measures and business targets.
The achievement of targets for all executive directors is assessed by the Committee.
The current maximum bonus for directors is 50% of base salary for on-target performance and up to 100% for exceeding targets.
All staff are now eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus Scheme.
Bonus payments are based on measurable achievement of challenging financial and business targets, set in the corporate operating plan each year and approved by the Board.
com 15 Chairmans bonus Under the terms of Luc Vandeveldes service contract, on recruitment in February 2000, the Company set strategic and qualitative targets for the award of his first annual bonus in 2001, which were subsequently met.
However, in advance of the Committee meeting in May 2001 to determine his bonus award, he informed the Committee that he wished to: Waive any entitlement to a bonus for the year under review.
This included 100% of 13 months salary totalling 704,000 and an opportunity to enhance this, over time, by a further 112,000: Reduce his notice period entitlement from 12 months to nine months.
Last year the Committee agreed the following in relation to the Chairmans bonus for the year to 30 March 2002: Award bonus of 100% of annual salary if financial targets set by the Committee were met: Add to this bonus potential a sum equal to half of last years waived bonus 352,000 if those same financial targets were met: Issue shares to him in May 2002, equal to the value of the other half of the waived bonus 352,000.
Long Term Incentive Plan To align directors remuneration more closely with shareholders longer term interests, the Company has an Executive Share Option Scheme with stretching earnings per share targets and will propose at this years AGM to introduce a Long Term Incentive Plan in the form of an Executive Share Matching Plan with total shareholder return measured against comparator groups of companies see AGM Notice of Meeting booklet for further details.
Shorter term shareholder interests are aligned through the cash bonus scheme which is linked to financial performance on an annual basis.
Executive Share Option Scheme Executive Share Option Schemes, open to all senior management, have operated for over 20 years.
In order to provide more exibility and a closer link with Company performance, the latest Scheme was approved by shareholders at the AGM in July 2000.
Details of the Scheme are given in section 6 of this report.
Shareholding policy A requirement has been introduced this year that the executive directors within five years of 1 June 2002 or within five years of appointment whichever is the later should hold shares whose market value at that time is equivalent to or greater than their then current gross annual base salary.
New directors Alison Reed, an existing member of senior management, was appointed to the Board as Finance Director on 11 July 2001.
Laurel Powers-Freeling was recruited and appointed to the Board on 6 November 2001 as Chief Executive of Marks & Spencer Financial Services.
Further details of the terms of her appointment can be found in section 2 of this report.
Jack Keenan was appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 1 September 2001.
Paul Myners was appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 2 April 2002.
Service contracts All members of senior management have service contracts.
These contracts can be terminated with 12 months notice from the Company.
Exceptions may exist where new recruits have been granted longer notice periods for the initial period of their employment.
No directors currently have a Service Contract entitling them to more than 12 months notice.
Luc Vandeveldes contract entitles him to nine months notice.
Non-executive directors The non-executive directors have service agreements with the Company for an initial three-year term which is terminable on three months notice.
They do not participate in any of the Companys Share Schemes nor the Annual Bonus Scheme.
The Chairman and the executive directors determine the remuneration of non-executive directors.

His annual salary was increased from 650,000 to 700,000 with effect from 1 March 2002.
2 With effect from 1 January 2002, Roger Holmes annual salary was increased from 425,000 to 450,000.
His emoluments for 2001 include compensation for loss of earnings from his previous employer of 654,000, awarded on his recruitment.
3 Laurel Powers-Freeling was appointed to the Board on 6 November 2001 on an annual salary of 320,000.
In compensation for loss of future earnings from her previous employer she has received: a payment of 100,000 included under benets and a further 100,000 included under bonus.
See section 2 Recruitment of executive directors.
4 Alison Reed was appointed to the Board on 11 July 2001 on an annual salary of 330,000.

6 Jack Keenan was appointed as a non-executive director on an annual fee of 34,000.
7 Robert Colvill retired from the Board on 31 December 2001 but remained as a full-time employee until 31 March 2002 to oversee the transactional elements of the business restructure as well as continuing to manage Financial Services whilst succession was secured.
His annual cash bonus was therefore set against transaction targets relating to the business restructure.
The Committee decided that as he agreed to remain with the Company beyond his normal retirement date, a compensatory payment should be made of 15% of his salary for the period from 1 July 2000 to 31 March 2002 for the self-funding of his pension arrangements included under benets.
Emoluments for the 3 months to 31 March 2002 are shown under section 5 Former Directors.
8 In line with all other employees, executive directors are allocated profit sharing based on a percentage of their earnings following the qualifying period.
Further information on profit sharing is given in note 11c of the financial statements.
9 Benets include the provision of cars, fuel and travel.
Included in the benets for Luc Vandevelde is a supplement of 16% of base salary to compensate for the fact that he is not a member of the Company Pension Scheme.
In addition, under the terms of his service contract, the Company provides accommodation in London on which he is assessed for tax.
A payment is also made to Roger Holmes, Alan McWalter and Laurel Powers-Freeling in respect of pension in the form of a supplement of 10% of the difference between the pension earnings cap and their base salary see section 4 Pensions.
Laurel Powers-Freeling is also provided with accommodation in Chester, to accommodate her working pattern two days in London, three days in Chester the location of our Financial Services operation.
A taxable benefit arises which is met by the Company.

An explanation of the bonus awarded to Luc Vandevelde is given on page 15.
No bonus was awarded last year.
See footnote 3 above in relation to Laurel Powers-Freeling and footnote 7 in relation to Robert Colvill.

She was appointed as a director on 6 November 2001 on the following terms: salary of 320,000 p. a. : payment of 100,000 as compensation for loss of future benets from her previous employer included within benets in section 1 : a guaranteed bonus of 100,000 as compensation for loss of bonus from her previous employer and in lieu of joining the 2001 02 annual cash bonus scheme included under bonus in section 1 : supplement of 10% of the difference between the pension earnings cap and her base salary see section 4 Pensions included within benets in section 1 : and award of shares under 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme with a market value at the date of employment of four times base salary see section 6 Long-term benets.
3 Termination payments As disclosed in last years Annual Report, a total of 2,742,000 was paid to directors who retired during last year as compensation for termination of their service contracts 12 months salary and benets and loss of pensionable service.
In addition to last years payments the directors listed below are entitled to compensation for the senior management bonus payable for this financial year on a pro-rata basis as shown: Bonus compensation 2002 000 Retired directors retirement date Clara Freeman 18 September 2000 65 Guy McCracken 18 September 2000 97 Peter Salsbury 18 September 2000 140 Roger Aldridge 19 July 2000 48 Joe Rowe 19 July 2000 48 Total 398 4 Directors pension information The executive directors, management and employees except for staff employed by Marks & Spencer Outlet Ltd all participate in the Companys dened benefit Pension Scheme provided their date of permanent appointment was prior to 1 April 2002.
The Scheme is non-contributory and the subject of an Independent Trust.
The normal retirement age under the Pension Scheme for senior management is 60 to harmonise with the Company contractual retirement age.
For all other employees the normal retirement age is 65 previously 60 but for those employees who joined the Scheme prior to 1 January 1996 their accrued rights were not affected by this change.
The Pension Scheme enables members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary in the 12 months ending at normal retirement date after 30 years service.
For employees including senior management who joined the Scheme prior to 1 January 1996 no actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable from the age of 58.
Employees who joined the Scheme on or after 1 January 1996 are subject to an actuarial reduction in their pension if payment starts prior to their normal retirement date.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 p. a. the pensionable salary is usually based on an average of the earnings over the last three years to retirement.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable, together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members prospective pension at the age of 65 60 for senior management.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension is paid equal to two-thirds of the members current pension.
In the event of death after leaving service but prior to commencement of pension, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the accrued preserved pension is payable.
In all circumstances, childrens allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 16.
Substantial protection is also offered in the event of serious ill health.
Post-retirement increases for pension earned from 6 April 1997 are awarded on a statutory basis.
For pension earned prior to 6 April 1997 it was the Companys practice to award discretionary increases, usually in line with ination.
With effect from 26 July 2000, it was agreed that, in future, all pension earned for service prior to 6 April 1997 would be guaranteed to increase by the rise in ination, up to a maximum of 3% per annum.
Increases beyond this gure will continue to be reviewed on a discretionary basis.

This measurement date accords with the Listing Rules.
2 The pension entitlement shown above is that which would be paid on retirement based on service to 30 March 2002 or date of retirement from the Board if earlier.
3 Luc Vandevelde does not participate in the Company Pension Scheme see section 1, footnote 9.
4 Roger Holmes, Alan McWalter and Laurel Powers-Freeling are subject to the pension earnings cap 95,400 at 30 March 2002 which is reviewed annually by the Government.
5 The pensions for Roger Holmes and Alan McWalter are based on a uniform accrual of two-thirds of the pension earnings cap less the pension which they have accrued from membership of previous employers pension schemes see section 1, footnote 9.
6 Pension gures are from 11 July 2001 when Alison Reed was appointed director.
7 Pension gures are to 31 December 2001 when Robert Colvill ceased to be a director.
Having reached the normal retirement age for senior management, his accrued entitlement has increased over last year because i the pension, having been deferred has, in line with normal practice, been increased by a late retirement factor and ii an increase has been applied in line with the pension increase for all pensioners see also section 1, footnote 7.
8 The pension entitlement shown excludes any additional pension purchased by the members Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Employees joining the Company after 1 April 2002 will, on completion of one years service, be invited to join the new, contributory Retirement Plan.
The Plan is a dened contribution arrangement, where employees may choose to contribute between 3-6% of their salary, and the Company will contribute between 6-12%.
The employee will be free to choose, from a range of investment vehicles, where the total contribution will be invested.
The Companys dened benefit pension scheme was therefore closed to new members on 31 March 2002.
During the one year waiting period before joining the Plan, the employees will be covered for death in service by a capital payment of twice salary, increasing to four times salary from the date of joining the Plan.
com 19 5 Payments to former directors Details of payments made under the Early Retirement Plan and other payments made to former directors during the year are: Paid in Paid in year 2001 000 000 1 Early retirement pensions payable until James Beneld 22 April 2009 70 68 Lord Stone of Blackheath 7 September 2002 93 91 Derek Hayes 19 November 2008 65 63 Chris Littmoden 28 September 2003 88 85 Keith Oates 3 July 2002 174 170 Unfunded pensions 2 Clinton Silver 88 86 Lord Sieff of Brimpton n a 61 Other 3 Robert Colvill 177 n a 4 Chris Littmoden 87 5 Sir David Sieff 13 n a 1 Under the Early Retirement Plan the Remuneration Committee could, at its discretion, offer an unfunded Early Retirement Pension, separate from the Company pension, which was payable from the date of retirement to age 60.

2 The pension scheme entitlement for Clinton Silver is supplemented by an additional, unfunded pension paid by the Company.
3 Robert Colvill retired from the Board on 31 December 2001 but remained as an employee until 31 March 2002 to complete the restructuring announced in March 2001.
The above payment comprises salary, profit share, benets and bonus for that three-month period see section 1, footnote 7.
He continues as non-executive Chairman of Marks & Spencer Financial Services as long as is necessary to facilitate a smooth management transition on an annual fee of 45,000.
4 As an ex-patriate director Chris Littmoden was entitled to have local tax obligations paid for by the Company.
Since he left the Company, the local tax authorities have informed us that an additional settlement was due in relation to the period 1995 to 1997 inclusive.
The amount shown above includes an element of interest due and was settled by the Company during the year.
5 Sir David Sieff continued to use his company car throughout the financial year.
6 Long-term benets All the share schemes of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. were adopted by Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. as part of the capital reorganisation in 2002.
The Company operates two types of share option schemes: i SAYE Scheme A Save As You Earn SAYE Option Scheme approved by shareholders in 1981 and renewed by shareholders in 1987 and 1997.
The Scheme is open to all employees, including executive directors, who have completed one years service and who open an approved savings contract.
Inland Revenue rules limit the maximum amount which can be saved to 250 per month.
When the savings contract is started options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will buy when the savings contract matures: options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
ii Executive Share Option Scheme, approved by shareholders in 2000 The current Executive Share Option Scheme is open to all senior management.
Annual awards of up to 150% of basic salary may be offered based on performance and, for exceptional performance, grants of up to 300% of basic salary may be awarded.
The performance targets for the current Scheme are: earnings per share growth of at least ination plus an average of 3% per annum for 50% of each grant, measured from a xed base of 14.5p or current EPS if higher: earnings per share growth of ination plus an average of 4% per annum for the other 50% of each grant, measured from a xed base of 16.5p or current EPS if higher.
Since the 1996 Finance Act, grants of Inland Revenue Approved options have been limited to 30,000.
Grants in excess of this limit, will be unapproved options, which confer no tax advantage on the participants.
Earlier Schemes The Company has operated Executive Option Schemes for over 20 years following shareholder approval for the first scheme in 1977.
The Remuneration Committee has imposed performance criteria for the exercise of all options granted since 1996 and the performance targets for earlier schemes are described below: 1997 Scheme The first grants under this scheme were in June 1998 and no options have been granted since June 2000.
Options are subject to the following performance targets on exercise: Tier 1 Options: earnings per share growth over three years of at least ination plus an average of 3% per annum: Tier 2 Options: earnings per share growth over five years which would place the Company in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 companies.
20 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Remuneration report 6 Long-term benets continued 1984 and 1987 Schemes The last grants under these schemes were awarded in June 1997.
The performance targets for the exercise of options granted in 1996 and 1997 are: Earnings per share growth of at least ination plus an average of 2% per annum.
Participants who hold options under the 1984 and 1987 Schemes will continue to be bound by their Maximum Option Value MOV of four times earnings, and may only exercise options up to this value, after which any outstanding options lapse.
Following the introduction of the current Scheme the Remuneration Committee decided that MOV will no longer increase with earnings.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, directors can take their options for all schemes into retirement.
Options held under the 1984 and 1987 Schemes continue to be bound by MOV and can be exercised subject to the option period.
For options held under the 1997, and current Schemes, options lapse if they are not exercised within 12 months of retirement.
Directors long-term benets The options detailed in the table below may not be exercisable for any one of the following reasons: i their value is in excess of the MOV: ii the options have not been held for three years and therefore cannot be exercised under scheme rules: or iii the options have not met the appropriate performance criteria.
During the year, David Norgrove exercised an Executive Share Option and an SAYE contract making a total gain of 4,000.
No other director exercised Executive Share Options or SAYE contracts in the year under review.
The market price of the shares at the end of the financial year was 385.25p: the highest and lowest share prices during the financial year for either Marks and Spencer p. l. c. or Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. were 395.5p and 235.3p respectively.
2 Options are carried into retirement under the terms of the various schemes see above.
