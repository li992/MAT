42 Directors Remuneration Report In accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, shareholder approval of this remuneration report will be sought at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
The report has been approved by the board.
The remuneration committee, which met on four occasions during the year, determines the remuneration, benefits and terms and conditions of service of the executive directors and makes recommendations to the board with regard to the companys policy on executive directors remuneration.
The membership of the committee consists of Mike Smith chairman, Jeff Edington and Peter Hooley, each of whom is an independent non-executive director.
Mr Hooley replaced the Lord Rockley as a member of the committee on the latters retirement at the 2002 annual general meeting.
The committee also considers the remuneration salary, bonus and share option grants for senior managers reporting to executive directors as recommended to it by the chief executive.
The relationship between the board and the committee is governed by formal terms of reference which have been reviewed and updated during 2002.
Under these terms, the committee is entitled, among other things, to avail itself of external legal or other professional advice at the companys expense.
Remuneration Policy The companys policy is to recruit, motivate and retain executive directors of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, increasingly linked to measured performance.
More specifically, the current strategy is to position base salaries at the median of the market and to provide an opportunity to earn a total cash payment i. e. base salary and annual incentive at the upper quartile for high performance.
Remuneration is also linked to performance through participation in a long term share incentive plan which ensures that directors interests are closely aligned with shareholders interests.
In considering remuneration matters, the committee has received advice from Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow and reports from Executive Remuneration Review a joint venture owned by New Bridge Street Consultants and Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, Inbucon Meis and Inbucon Administration.
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow were appointed by the committee.
None of the foregoing provided other services to the company during the year.
However BWCI Trust Company Limited, formerly Bacon & Woodrow Trust Company C. I.
Limited, acted as trustee and administrator of the Cobham Employee Share Trust which was established in 1997 in connection with the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
After the year end the committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide consultancy on remuneration matters.
The committee also consulted with Gordon Page and Allan Cook and they attended one or more of the committees meetings on matters which did not directly affect them.
No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The board, through the committee, will continue to consult with principal shareholders when it is considering structural changes to its policy on executive directors remuneration.
The main elements of directors remuneration are described in the paragraphs that follow.
Remuneration information and details of directors interests in Cobham ordinary shares are set out in tables 1 to 6 on pages 46 to 49.
Basic Salary Basic salaries are reviewed annually, usually in November.
The committee takes into account internal and external advice and data from a range of companies as well as personal performance and business responsibilities.
The company participates in the annual survey of directors remuneration carried out by Executive Remuneration Review and receives the full survey results together with a pay review pack in respect of the remuneration of each executive director.
Annual Performance-related Bonus The company operates an annual cash bonus scheme for its executive directors.
Bonuses are awarded by the committee having regard to the performance of the group, the individual and, in the case of executive directors with specific subsidiary company responsibilities, the performance of the relevant subsidiaries.
Bonuses in respect of the year under review were capped at 60% of basic salary save for Gordon Page and Giles Irwin whose bonuses were capped at 100% of basic salary in view of their ineligibility, as a result of proximity to retirement, to receive an award during the year under the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
The policy in respect of the payment of bonuses for 2003 is the same as for 2002 with pro-rata awards being considered for Gordon Page and Giles Irwin.
In the cases of Gordon Page, Allan Cook and Giles Irwin the constituent elements of their bonus plans are earnings per share in excess of inflation, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives for each individual.
Up to 75% of the maximum achievable bonus is determined by the companys financial performance with the balance being attributable to the achievement of personal objectives.
COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 43 Annual Performance-related Bonus continued In the cases of Robin Clark, Geoffrey Cooper and Alex Hannam the constituent elements of their bonus plans are earnings per share in excess of inflation as for other directors, net profit against budget for the group of subsidiary companies for which they are operationally responsible, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives for each individual.
Up to 75% of the maximum achievable bonus is determined by the financial performances of the company or the relevant subsidiary groups, as appropriate, with the balance being attributable to the achievement of personal objectives.
Personal objectives for the other executive directors are set by Gordon Page and Allan Cook and agreed with the committee.
Those for Allan Cook are set by Gordon Page and agreed with the committee, and those for Gordon Page are set by the committee, after consultation with Allan Cook.
Performance Graph The graph set out below is required by the Regulations and illustrates the performance of the company and a broad equity market index over the five year period commencing on 31 December 1997.
The FTSE 350 Index, of which the company has been a constituent throughout the period in question, is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index against which the companys performance should be graphed having regard to the size of companies it contains and the fact that it includes most of the companies which form the comparator group for the purposes of the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid.
This graph looks at the value, by the end of 2002, of 100 invested in Cobham plc on 31 December 1997 compared with that of 100 invested in the FTSE 350 Index.
The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year ends.
Pensions Executive directors may join the Cobham Executives Pension Plan the Plan at the invitation of the company.
The Plan is established under trust, contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and approved by the Inland Revenue under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
All the executive directors, with the exception of Geoffrey Cooper, who has a personal money-purchase pension scheme, are members of the Plan.
The Plan provides benefits for executive directors on final pay principles against a normal pension age of 60 with retirement before that age being subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensionable earnings are taken as the members basic annual salary at each April, restricted Value 44 Directors Remuneration Report continued Pensions continued where applicable to the earnings cap.
The rate at which members are required to contribute to the Plan is 7% of pensionable earnings.
Annual bonus payments are not taken into account when calculating pensionable earnings.
Retirement pension accrues at 1 30th of pensionable earnings for each year of service in the Plan with, where applicable, a further 1 60th of pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service within the main Cobham pension plan.
At retirement, members may commute a portion of their pension for a cash sum.
All pensions in payment relating to post April 1997 rights are increased in line with the retail price index, subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum, with the balance of pension being increased at 3% per annum.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings is payable together with a spouses pension of two thirds of the members prospective pension.
On death after retirement, a spouses pension is paid at the same rates as applied to the members pre commutation pension.
Similar spouses pensions are payable on the death of a deferred pensioner prior to retirement.
The company establishes funded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes by which additional retirement provision is made on money purchase principles for each member whose entitlement under the Plan is restricted by the earnings cap.
Payments are made to these schemes on the basis of actuarial advice.
Currently, schemes have been established for Gordon Page, Allan Cook, Geoff Roe and Alex Hannam.
Details of company contributions made in the year are set out in table 2 b on page 47.
The policy in respect of newly appointed directors is that contributions should normally be 2% of annual basic salary per month.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was operated again during the year under review.
Under the LTIP which has been approved by shareholders Cobham ordinary shares may be conditionally awarded to participants.
However, they will normally only be entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three year period known as the restricted period if, and to the extent that, certain company performance conditions are achieved.
Awards under the LTIP were made during the year to Allan Cook, Robin Clark and Geoffrey Cooper.
The value of the awards made was limited to 100% of basic salary.
The performance measure applicable to these awards is total shareholder return subject to a minimum level of absolute growth in earnings per share of an average of at least 3% 2% in respect of awards made prior to 2000 per annum above the rate of inflation.
It is intended that awards will be made under the LTIP in 2003 on the same basis as in 2002.
With regard to total shareholder return, each participant will be entitled to 100% of his awards if the companys return over the performance period results in it being ranked in the top quartile of a comparator group comprising companies included in the FTSE engineering sector index in respect of awards made prior to 2000 and in the FTSE All Share aerospace and defence sector and the engineering and machinery sector in respect of awards made after 1999.
If the companys performance is at the median, 30% of the awarded shares will vest 40% in respect of awards made prior to 2000.
Between these two levels, the award will vest on a straight-line scale.
Participants will lose their awards if the companys performance is below the median.
Earnings per share and total shareholder return are considered by the committee to be the most fair and appropriate measures of the companys performance relative to the performance achieved by other comparable companies and of the companys underlying performance.
In assessing whether performance conditions have been met, which they have in the cases of the awards made in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the committee relies upon performance status and verification reports prepared by Inbucon Administration.
Full details of all allocations under the LTIP are set out in Table 5 on page 49.
LTIP Performance The following table contains shareholder return performance information in respect of awards made under the LTIP up to and including 2000.

COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 45 LTIP Performance continued The rules of the LTIP were amended at the companys 2000 annual general meeting in various ways including the removal of a requirement for the awarded shares to be held in trust for a period of up to two years after the expiry of the restricted period and the removal of the ability for participants to receive shares on a matching basis pro rata to investments made by them in Cobham shares.
Other Share Schemes The company grants share options from time to time under the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme 1994.
Participants in the LTIP are not eligible to receive grants of options under this scheme.
Certain executive directors are also participants in the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme and or the Cobham Share Incentive Scheme, both of which are all employee share schemes approved by the Inland Revenue.
Under the former, participants save a fixed monthly sum for three or five years and may use the sum generated by their savings contracts to exercise options which are granted at a 20% discount to market price.
Depending upon the option period chosen, exercise can normally take place after three, five or seven years.
Under the latter, the total value of shares which may be allocated to any one employee in any financial year must not exceed 3,000.
As a consequence of changes in the Inland Revenue regulations, no further allocations of shares will be made under the Cobham Share Incentive Scheme.
The company is considering alternative schemes now permitted by the Inland Revenue.
The abovementioned share schemes have been approved by shareholders and do not contain performance conditions, since the Inland Revenue requires that they must be offered to all eligible employees on the same basis without such conditions.
Service Contracts The boards policy on setting notice periods for new directors is that these should not normally exceed one year.
It recognises, however, that it may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer a longer initial notice period which would subsequently reduce to one year after the expiry of that period.
The service contract of Gordon Page dated 15 October 1991 is due to expire on his 60th birthday in November 2003.
It is the boards current intention that he will become non-executive chairman from that date.
It has been agreed that Giles Irwins service contract dated 15 May 1987 will expire on his 60th birthday in July 2003 and that he will continue thereafter as an employee, but not a director, of the company with responsibility for corporate development.
Robin Clark is employed under a service contract, which is dated 6 May 1993, containing a notice period of two years.
The service contracts of Allan Cook dated 13 June 2001 and Geoffrey Cooper dated 1 June 1989 are terminable on one years notice.
Alex Hannam is employed under a service contract dated 13 February 2003 containing a notice period of two years which reduces to one year after twelve months service.
The board takes the view that the current notice period for Robin Clark, which reflects the position agreed with him in 1993, and for Alex Hannam remain appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.
Subject to earlier termination in accordance with their terms, the service contract of Robin Clark will expire on his 65th birthday and the service contracts of Allan Cook and Alex Hannam will expire on their 60th birthdays.
The service contract of Geoffrey Cooper does not contain an expiry date.
The service contract of Geoff Roe expired by agreement with the company on 30 June 2002 at which time he resigned his executive directorship.
The committee accepts and endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
There are no explicit provisions in directors service contracts for early termination compensation commitments.
Personal Shareholding The committees approach with regard to personal shareholding is to encourage executive directors to acquire and hold, over time, Cobham ordinary shares to the value of at least one years salary.
Non-executive Directors Fees paid to non-executive directors are determined by a committee of the board comprising Gordon Page, Allan Cook and Giles Irwin.
During the year under review each non-executive director received a basic fee at the rate of 20,000 per annum.
An additional fee of 2,000 is paid to the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees.
Fees in respect of the services of Peter Hooley are paid to Smith & Nephew plc.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the companys share schemes, pension schemes or bonus arrangements nor do they have service contracts.
