Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31st December 2002 and which apply to the Company for the first time this year.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles of the Combined Code relating to executive directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to consider and approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee composition and advisors Three independent Non-Executive Directors, MrDE Brill, Mr P J Byrom and Dr A D Portno, comprise the Boards Remuneration Committee.
Dr A D Portno is the senior Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
There have been no changes in the composition or chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee during the year.
The Remuneration Committee operates within agreed terms of reference.
It is responsible for determining the overall remuneration policy in relation to Directors pay, incentives and benefits and also for ensuring the appropriate implementation of that policy.
The Remuneration Committee meets regularly and also periodically instructs external consultants to review the Executive Directors remuneration and the structure of the Companys share incentive schemes.
This review includes a comparison of the Directors remuneration with the remuneration of directors in other companies of a similar size within the sector.
These reviews are undertaken every three years.
The last one, undertaken in September 2001 by Monks Partnership, concluded that the remuneration of the Directors was at an appropriately competitive level and consistent with the Companys overall remuneration policy.
Since the last review, the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration policy remains appropriate.
The following persons provided advice on services that materially assisted the Remuneration Committee in its consideration of Directors remuneration matters during the year: Internal support was provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary.
The Group Human Resources Director, Mr G A Headley, has provided information to the Remuneration Committee on relative pay both within the Wilson Bowden Group and in other organisations, particularly with regard to those sectors in which the Group operates.
MM&K Limited have provided advice on the Regulations and the design and implementation of the savings related share option scheme.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer advised the Company on compliance with the Regulations.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer are the Companys main legal advisors.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Directors remuneration report 41 Directors remuneration report continued Compliance The Company has complied with the Combined Codes provisions relating to Directors remuneration throughout the year.
Remuneration policy General The Companys remuneration policy is designed to provide competitive packages to attract, retain and motivate the best executives.
It is necessary to provide reward schemes that are fully competitive and offer sufficient incentive to secure and retain the services of knowledgeable individuals who have demonstrated a high level of ability and who show considerable future potential.
To ensure the successful growth and development of the Group and maximise shareholder value, the maximum levels of reward are targeted against the delivery of both outstanding personal and corporate performance both in the short and long-term.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
This report sets out the Companys remuneration policy for 2003 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of years after 2003 is required by the Regulations.
The Remuneration Committee is able to state its remuneration policy for 2003 with reasonable certainty, and this policy will continue unless changed by the Remuneration Committee in subsequent years.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
Any changes to policy for years after 2003 will be described in future Directors remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject to shareholder approval.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises four main elements: Basic annual salary and benefits in kind.
Annual performance related bonus, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of salary.
It is Company policy that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
Basic salary and benefits in kind Salary is normally reviewed annually, on 1st October, or when responsibilities change.
In deciding the appropriate levels, the Committee takes into account the external advice it has received and comparable pay levels within the Company and elsewhere in the sector.
In relation to benefits, each Executive Director is provided with an appropriate fully expensed motor car and health care benefits.
42 Directors remuneration report Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Annual performance related bonus Each Executive Directors remuneration package includes a performance related bonus expressed as a percentage of his salary.
The percentage of salary payable as bonus in 2003, is dependent upon the achievement of the performance criteria set out in the following table.
Bonus for Additional bonus Maximum bonus for achieving 80% of for achieving achieving personal Maximum prior year PBT budget PBT business objectives total bonus Director % of salary % of salary % of salary % of salary D W Wilson 10% 25% 50% N H Richardson 10% 15% 10% 50% I Robertson 10% 15% 10% 50% M J Stansfield 10% 25% 10% 60% N J Townsend 10% 15% 10% 50% For the first 5% of Profit before Tax in excess of budget, an additional bonus amounting to 1% of salary for every 1% by which Profit before Tax exceeds budget is payable.
For the next 5% by which Profit before Tax exceeds budget further bonus equivalent to 2% of salary for every 1% of additional profit is earned.
Maximum bonus is only earned on the delivery of all personal objectives and if Profit before Tax exceeds budget by 10%.
Demanding budgets and targets are established by the Board and reviewed at the end of each year to determine the degree of successful achievement.
These performance measures are directly related to the delivery of the Companys strategy and business plan and to achievement of personal and corporate objectives.
Personal business objectives are agreed between the Group Chairman and Chief Executive and each of the Executive Directors at the beginning of each year.
The level of achievement and delivery is measured at the end of the year and confirmed by the Remuneration Committee.
Share incentive schemes Mr N H Richardson, Mr I Robertson, Mr M J Stansfield and Mr N J Townsend all participate in the share incentive schemes listed below.
The performance conditions attached to these incentive plans, the reasons for selecting them and the methods of measuring whether they have been met and why those methods have been chosen are set out below: The Wilson Bowden plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme WBSESOS Shareholders originally approved the WBSESOS at the 2000 Annual General Meeting.
It was amended at the 2002 Annual General Meeting.
Options are granted under the WBSESOS to each of the Companys Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, and to senior management who contribute directly to the successful strategic direction and operational management of the Group.
The performance condition relative to the exercise of options granted prior to 17th April 2002, is that the growth in Earnings per Share shown in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for any consecutive period of three years, starting with the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 3% per annum.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 Directors remuneration report 43 Directors remuneration report continued The performance condition relative to the exercise of options granted after 17th April 2002, is that the growth in the Companys Earnings per Share in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for any consecutive periods of three, four or five years, starting with the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant: i. must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 3% per annum in respect of awards in any one year, the value of which does not exceed the basic annual salary of the executive: and ii.
must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 5% per annum in respect of awards in any one year, the value of which exceeds one times basic annual salary of the Executive.
The value of options granted under the scheme is limited to a maximum of four times annual salary.
The reasons for selecting Earnings per Share as a measure of performance is that it directly reflects operational performance and also is a significant factor in determining the Markets view of the Companys value.
The real growth targets of 3% and 5% respectively referred to above are considered to be appropriate levels of achievement based on current market practice and the advice from the external consultants who assisted in the design of the scheme.
The Remuneration Committee determine whether performance criteria have been satisfied based on calculations performed internally and may request the Companys auditors to report on whether the calculations, and any adjustments required under scheme rules, have been performed correctly.
The Wilson Bowden Performance Share Plan PSP Shareholders approved the PSP at the 2002 Annual General Meeting.
Awards under the scheme are made to each of the Companys Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, and a small number of other senior executives who contribute directly to the successful performance of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee determines an appropriate performance target each year.
The performance criteria applicable in relation to the awards made on 29th August 2002, are that if the growth in the Companys Earnings per Share in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for the period of three years starting with the financial year ended before the date of the award exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period: i. by 30% then 100% of the award will be received: ii.
by 10% then 25% of the award will be received: iii.
by less than 10% then none of the award will be received: and iv.
in respect of increases between 10% and 30%, the award will be received proportionately.
Upon becoming entitled to receive shares following the third anniversary of the start date, 60% of shares vest to the executive immediately: 11.5% on the fourth anniversary: 12.5% on the fifth anniversary: and 16% on the sixth anniversary.
The value of shares subject to awards under the plan may not exceed 100% of annual salary.
The reasons for selecting Earnings per Share as the measure of performance are set out above under The Wilson Bowden plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme and applies similarly to the PSP.
44 Directors remuneration report Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 The Wilson Bowden plc Bonus Shares Matching Scheme BSMS Shareholders originally approved the BSMS at the 1999 Annual General Meeting.
Under the BSMS, participating Directors are required to surrender a proportion of their annual performance related bonus, which is invested in ordinary shares in the Company in quarterly tranches over a three year period.
At the end of the three year period the shares are released to the participants, together with a number of matching shares, provided corporate performance targets have been met.
On the third anniversary of the award, participants are entitled to receive matching shares equal to the number of shares acquired with their surrendered bonus, if at the end of that period the Companys Total Shareholder Return compared with that for the Comparator Group of companies is at or above median.
The Comparator Group of companies comprises: Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p. l. c Berkeley Group plc Bovis Homes Group PLC Countryside Properties PLC Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon plc Redrow plc Westbury plc Wilson Connolly Holdings plc George Wimpey PLC If awards under the scheme are retained until the fifth anniversary, participants who have retained some or all of their shares, become entitled to a retention award equivalent to 5% of the number of shares retained at the fifth anniversary.
This performance test was chosen as Total Shareholder Return aligns management performance with shareholders interests.
The Remuneration Committee determine whether the performance criteria have been satisfied based on reports from HSBC Corporate Finance, the Companys corporate broker, and may request the Companys auditors to report on whether the calculations, and any adjustments required under scheme rules, have been correctly performed.
The Remuneration Committee determined in 2001 that no new awards would be made under the BSMS.
