Remuneration report Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference The Remuneration Committee the Committee is comprised exclusively of independent non-executive directors and its members are: The Rt Hon.
Lord Baker of Dorking CH Chairman W F Blount The Baroness Noakes DBE The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the framework of executive remuneration the policy for approval by the board.
In accordance with the policy agreed, the Committee will consider, recommend as appropriate and approve the conditions of service of the executive directors, including the duration of any service agreements, and the emoluments and other benets payable under such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive arrangements.
It also oversees the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan and option schemes.
During the year under review, the Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Company secretary on matters relating to remuneration.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Company secretary were present at meetings of the Committee but the Chief Executive and the Company secretary were excluded when the Chief Executives performance and remuneration were being discussed.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided or for the day-to-day management of the business.
Committee members receive fees as non-executive directors including a fee for acting as a Committee member, but do not receive any pension entitlements nor any short and long-term performance related incentives.
The fees payable to the Chairman and the independent non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole within the limits set by the articles of association.
The Chairman and the independent non-executive directors do not participate in or vote on any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting Mercer to act on behalf of the Committee in providing independent market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.
Mercer also provides actuarial and consulting services to the Company.
Remuneration policy Hanson operates in competitive and international markets.
To continue to compete successfully it is essential that the Company attracts, develops, retains and motivates talented high-calibre executive directors in the best interests of shareholders.
To ensure that its remuneration rates are competitive, whilst not being excessive, the Remuneration Committee keeps remuneration under regular review in light of emerging best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account of individual performance: i in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity, UK and international companies are paying: ii in the context of packages offered throughout Hanson: and iii to include short and long-term performance related elements, potentially a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and to align the interests of directors and shareholders.
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive policy for directors.
While there is no specic shareholding requirement for directors, shares arising from share based incentive plans are expected to be retained.
Basic salary In setting the basic salary for each executive director, the Remuneration Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the directors experience, performance and responsibilities.
Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
A J Murray was appointed as Chief Executive during the year, having served as Chief Executive of Hanson Building Materials America HBMA prior to his appointment.
The Committee proposes that increases in salary to take A J Murrays salary to an appropriate market rate be staggered, with a review on January 1, 2003 to be followed by a further review in May 2003, the anniversary of A J Murrays appointment as Chief Executive.
The reporting structure having been simplied, no direct successor for A J Murrays former role as Chief Executive of HBMA has been appointed, thus reducing the number of executive directors from five to four, which results in a lower level of overall executive director remuneration.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme for the executive directors and other senior executives is aligned with changes in shareholder value through the economic value added methodology.
The main principle of economic value added is to recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its operating costs and the cost of capital the return that lenders and shareholders expect of the Company each year.
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of bonus.
Each year the participant receives one-third of an accumulated bonus bank, which is updated for the years performance compared to target.
The bonus bank has two main functions: rstly it ensures that individuals do not make short-term decisions such as deferring essential expenditure from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so.
Secondly, the bonus bank can help as a retention tool.
The Committee intends to conduct a full review of the annual bonus scheme arrangements for the executive directors for 2003.
For 2002, A J Murrays target level of bonus was 62.5% of basic salary and for the other executive directors it was 37.5% of basic salary.
For 2003, in recognition of his enhanced responsibilities, the target level of bonus for J C Nicholls has been increased to 50% of basic salary.
For A J Murray, recognising that for part of the year he was Chief Executive of HBMA, the economic value added performance of HBMA determined one-quarter of the addition to his bonus bank with three-quarters of the addition based on the performance of the group overall.
It was the groups overall economic value added performance which determined the bonus bank addition for J C Nicholls and G Dranseld in 2002.
For S N Vivian, Chief Executive of Hanson Building Materials Europe HBME throughout the year, the economic value added performance of HBME in 2002 determined three-quarters of the addition to his bonus bank with one-quarter of the addition based on the performance of the group overall.
In 2003, the groups overall economic value added performance will determine the bonus bank addition for A J Murray, J C Nicholls and G Dranseld.
The bonuses paid in respect of the year to December 31, 2002 to the directors are set out in the table of directors remuneration on page 44.
Remuneration report 39 Remuneration report continued Annual bonus scheme continued Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme, based on improvements in economic value added, are set by the Remuneration Committee, after taking advice from Mercer.
Long Term Incentive Plan Under the LTIP, participants are conditionally awarded shares in the Company at nil cost with the proportion of those shares which may vest subject to the achievement of performance targets over a performance period set by the Committee.
In 2002 a conditional award of shares was made to A J Murray, then Chief Executive of HBMA, of 200% of basic salary and to the other executive directors of 100% of basic salary.
No conditional option grant under the share option plan was made in 2002 to A J Murray similarly for other US-based executives.
The conditional awards made in 2002 are subject to performance criteria and the Committee determined that 50% of the conditional award should be subject to the attainment of an economic value added target and 50% to a total shareholder return TSR target.
The Committee chose these performance measurements as it believed they correlate clearly with the creation of shareholder value.
For the conditional award made in 2002, the economic value added target requires an improvement in economic value added over a period of three years based on the results for the year to December 31, 2001.
For this measurement, a linear vesting schedule applies in order that only a small proportion of the award will vest at the minimum performance level with the maximum award vesting only on the achievement of substantial performance improvement.
A similar economic value added target is in place for the award made in 2001.
On attaining the minimum economic value added improvements of 10.6m for the 2001 award, and 8.8m for the 2002 award, 25% of the respective awards, subject to the economic value added measurement criteria, will vest.
100% of the awards subject to this measurement will vest on the attainment of economic value added improvements of 28.4m and 23.4m for the 2001 and 2002 awards, respectively.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid on the assumption that such dividends are reinvested in Hanson shares during the performance period.
For the TSR measurement in 2002 and similarly for the awards made in 2000, for which 100% of the award is subject to a TSR performance measurement criteria, and 2001 the conditional awards made will vest only if Hanson achieves a TSR over the three-year performance period, from the date of the award in March 2002, which is greater than the TSR achieved by at least 50% of the members of a comparator group of international building materials companies at the date of the award the comparator group.
If so 30% of the award will vest.
All of the award will vest if the Company achieves a TSR over the performance period which is greater than that achieved by 80% of the comparator group over the same period.
Between these two points the award will vest in the proportion of 2.33% of the award for each 1% improvement in the Companys ranking.
In 2000, the comparator group consisted of 24 companies, including Hanson.
These included 11 UK building materials companies in the FTSE350 Index Aggregate Industries, Blue Circle, BPB, Hanson, Hepworth, Novar, Pilkington, RMC, Travis Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley, six European building materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index CRH, Dyckerhoff, Heidelberger, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger, five US businesses Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Southdown, Texas Industries and Vulcan and two Australian building materials companies Boral and CSR.
In 2001, Blue Circle and Southdown were removed from the comparator group following takeover and in 2002, Hepworth was also removed from the comparator group following takeover.
There is no retesting of performance under either the economic value added measurement or the TSR measurement.
The table below shows the conditional interests in shares of directors relating to awards made under the LTIP in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.
Following the end of the three-year performance period for the conditional award made in 1999, approximately 850,000 shares vested on September 17, 2002 in the participants, including the directors as set out in the table below.
For G Dranseld and J C Nicholls, the performance criteria was based on Hansons TSR for the three-year performance period.
This ranked below 50% of the members of the comparator group for the 1999 award and, therefore, in accordance with the performance criteria none of the shares subject to this performance measurement vested.
For A J Murray and S N Vivian, the performance criteria for the conditional award made in 1999 was based on cash returns on cash invested by HBMA and Hanson Quarry Products Europe respectively over a three-year performance period, being on the same basis as other executives within their respective operating companies.
For A J Murray 100% of his conditional award vested and for S N Vivian 37% of his conditional award vested with the balance of the award lapsing.
Both A J Murray and S N Vivian retained all the shares arising and elected to satisfy their income tax liabilities separately.
Notes 1 A J H Dougal left the Company on May 14, 2002.
He retained entitlement to the conditional shares awarded to him under the LTIP.
The awards outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance conditions as outlined above.
None of the 1999 award made to A J H Dougal vested resulting in the lapse of a conditional award over 47,872 shares.
2 The relevant market price at the time of the conditional award in 2002 was 461.75p per share.
40 Remuneration report Long Term Incentive Plan continued From and including awards made in 2000 under the LTIP, the performance measurement was the same for all participants.
As outlined above, the awards for the operating company participants in prior years were based on cash returns on cash invested, with vesting determined by a proportion one-third of an accumulated bonus bank.
Following the vesting of the 1999 award in 2002, due to the excellent performance of HBMA over the period 1997 to 2000, excess amounts remained in the accumulated bonus banks of some participants including A J Murray.
Along with other US executives in a similar position, the excess in the bonus bank amounting to $709,234, appreciated by any increase in the share price above 349.8p being the relevant price at the time of the 2000 LTIP award, will be received by A J Murray in September 2003, on the third anniversary of the 2000 LTIP award.
Conditional awards under the LTIP will usually be made annually.
In 2003 it is proposed that the conditional award to A J Murray will not exceed 150% of basic salary and for the other executive directors will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Awards vesting under the LTIP are not pensionable.
Share options Share Option Plan Under the Share Option Plan, participants are granted options over a number of shares in the Company but the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three-year performance period set by the Remuneration Committee.
To the extent an option or part of an option becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three-year performance period it will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to directors in the years ending December 31, 2001 and 2002 were the same as for the awards made in 2001 and 2002 under the LTIP, as detailed above, with no retesting.
The conditional options granted to directors under the Share Option Plan are shown below: Weighted Balance at Granted Exercised Balance at average Jan 1, 2002 during year during year Dec 31, 2002 exercise price pence G Dranseld 61,272 64,970 126,242 467.4 J C Nicholls 61,272 69,302 130,574 467.2 S N Vivian 57,046 67,136 124,182 467.1 A J H Dougal see note 1 below 84,512 97,456 181,968 467.1 Or date of leaving the Company, if earlier.
Note 1 A J H Dougal left the Company on May 14, 2002.
He retained entitlement to the conditional options granted to him under the Share Option Plan.
The grants outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to performance criteria as outlined above.
To the extent the options become capable of being exercised, these must be exercised within one year of such time or they will lapse.
Under the Black-Scholes option valuation model, on the basis of the Companys three-year share price performance, the value of an option over an ordinary share at the date of grant was equal to approximately 35% of the shares current market value.
On this basis, with no discount to the Black-Scholes value because of the application of performance conditions on exercise, the conditional options granted during 2001 and 2002 at 100% of basic salary had a Black-Scholes value, at the date of grant, of about 35% of basic salary in each case.
The market price at December 31, 2002 was 276p per ordinary share, which compares to the exercise prices of the conditional options granted in 2001 and 2002 at prices of 473.3p and 461.75p per share respectively.
Grants of conditional options under the Share Option Plan are considered annually in conjunction with the awards to be made under the LTIP.
In 2003 it is proposed that the conditional option grant to A J Murray will not exceed 125% of basic salary and for the other executive directors will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan will not be pensionable.
Executive Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for ordinary shares granted to directors under the Executive Share Option Schemes are shown below.
No performance conditions apply to the right to exercise the options granted and no further grants will be made under these schemes, the last grant having been made in December 1995.
Notes 1 An option held by A J Murray over 13,858 ordinary shares granted on January 12, 1993 at a subscription price of 424.9p per share lapsed on January 11, 2003.
2 A J H Dougal left the Company on May 14, 2002.
His options outstanding, all of which have exercise prices above the market price of Hanson ordinary shares as at December 31, 2002, must be exercised within one year of his leaving or they will lapse.
Remuneration report 41 Remuneration report continued Executive Share Option Schemes continued The range of the market quotations for Hanson ordinary shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Ofcial List, during the period January 1 to December 31, 2002 was 264.5p to 539.5p.
C D Collins exercised an option over 9,082 ordinary shares and surrendered for cash an option over 44,691 ordinary shares, both options being at a subscription price of 424.9p and with a market price on the date of exercise surrender of 511.25p.
G Dranseld surrendered for cash an option over 2,217 ordinary shares, the option being at a subscription price of 397.8p and with a market price on the date of surrender of 511.25p.
The total gains made by directors on options exercised or surrendered for cash under the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Sharesave Scheme during the year were 95,936 155,898.
Gains made under the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Sharesave Scheme are not pensionable.
Sharesave Scheme At December 31, 2002 there were approximately 3,300 participants in the UK Inland Revenue approved savings related Sharesave Scheme.
The options granted to directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Weighted Granted Market price average Range of Balance at during Exercised Exercise at date of Balance at exercise exercise Jan 1, 2002 year during year price exercise Dec 31, 2002 price dates pence pence pence A J Murray 4,620 2,971 4,620 224 501.4 2,971 318.0 12 05-5 06 G Dranseld 7,223 3,099 4,620 224 501.6 5,702 293.8 5 04-5 06 J C Nicholls 2,263 2,263 428.0 12 04-5 05 S N Vivian 7,700 5,165 7,700 224 501.6 5,165 318.0 12 05-5 06 A J H Dougal see note 1 below 7,700 7,700 224.0 6 02-11 02 Or date of leaving the Company, if earlier.
Notes 1 In accordance with the rules of the Sharesave Scheme, on leaving the Company A J H Dougal retained the option over 7,700 shares outlined in the table above.
The option, which matured on June 1, 2002, was capable of being exercised for a period of six months following him leaving the Company.
2 The options granted under the Sharesave Scheme during the year were at an exercise price of 318p per share, being a 20% discount to the market price on August 29, 2002.
Performance review The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE Construction & Building Materials Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2002.

Termination payment is limited to the Chairmans annual salary and benets.
The executive directors are all employed on rolling service contracts, entered into on March 1, 1999, which are terminable at any time by the Company on giving 52 weeks notice or by the director giving six months notice.
Termination payments are limited to the directors normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benets, for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event that the Company terminates the service contracts the service requirements under the Companys LTIP and Share Option Plan will be waived: these awards, however, remain subject to their performance conditions.
Currently, no non-executive directors have service contracts with the Company.
External appointments The Company acknowledges that its executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other leading companies and that such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit of Hanson.
Executive directors are limited to one such non-executive position and the policy is that fees may be retained.
Currently no such non-executive positions are held by any of the executive directors.
Pensions The Chairman and the executive directors are members of dened benefit plans the pension plans which, in accordance with Inland Revenue limits, provide them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement.
The pension plans are contributory to the extent of 5% of pensionable salary which does not include bonuses.
The directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be paid from age 55 in certain circumstances.
The following table gives details for each director of: the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service since December 31, 2001. the increase in the accrued pension net of ination attributable to service since December 31, 2001. the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at December 31, 2002. the transfer value of the increase of the accrued pension net of ination and the directors contributions calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.

His pension after commutation is shown in the column headed Accrued pension at December 31, 2002, above.
The increase in the accrued pension net of ination and the transfer value of this net increase were calculated on the pre-commutation pension.
The transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2002 includes the tax-free cash lump sum entitled to be received by A J H Dougal on retirement.
In respect of A J H Dougals contractual entitlement, a special contribution of 636,700 was paid into the pension plan of which he is a member during the year with any further funding requirement as determined by the actuary to the plan to be met by way of an increase in the rate of ordinary employer contributions over three years.
