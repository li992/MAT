Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
This report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The auditable sections of the report include those relating to directors remuneration and benets, share incentive schemes and pension benets.
Remuneration committee constitution The remuneration committee is the sole determinant of the total reward package for the Groups executive directors.
It complies with best practice provisions in its constitution, operation and review of remuneration policy.
The committee comprises Mr W A C Thomson Chairman, Mr C W E R Buchan and Mr R W Wood.
Mr J A Harvey and Mr M R Arrowsmith attend in order to assist with discussions when requested and the Group HR Director, Mrs J Robbins, attends in the capacity of Secretary.
The committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss both routine and exceptional matters.
There are no plans to amend substantially the purpose and function of the committee.
Directors remuneration policy The Companys aim is to attract, retain and motivate executives capable of achieving the Groups long term objectives.
This is reected in the Boards remuneration policy whereby the objective is to position directors base salaries at or around the market median as dened by surveys which are weighted towards the FTSE 250 and in part towards the logistics sector.
Annual bonus and long term incentive schemes which apply to executive directors only deliver potentially significant additional remuneration related to performance.
For 2003, it is intended to revise the directors annual short term incentive plans S. T. I. P. s to ensure that they become more stretching for exceptional performance, that maximum bonus levels better reect market practice and that Mr M Sprague and Mr S Hammad are incentivised against Group as well as Regional profit targets.
The total remuneration of executive and non-executive directors are reviewed every one and three years respectively.
Key elements of remuneration and benets The following table sets out the relative importance of key elements of the remuneration and benets package of the executive directors in 2002 and how each element is determined.

Annual bonus scheme In 2002 the annual bonus scheme allowed UK based directors to earn up to 45% of basic salary and Mr M Sprague up to 50% of base salary which is more in line with North American market practice.
For UK based directors, bonuses in 2002 were considered against a minimum of three key personal objectives and the achievement of Group and or divisional internal profit targets.
Any bonuses due are paid annually in March or April.
Service contracts The policy is to enter into service contracts with executive directors that are of an indefinite term and normally terminable by either party on 12 months notice.
This rises to 24 months in the event of change of control for existing directors, although this policy will not apply to new directors joining from March 2003 onwards.
In early 2003, Mr M Sprague was offered a new service contract to reect the employment and common law protection applicable in Canada, his country of residence.
The maximum additional cost in the event of Mr M Spragues contract being terminated without just cause has been capped at a further 12 months salary and contractual benets.
All contracts include the option, at the Groups discretion, to make a cash payment in lieu of notice.
The aim is always to mitigate the Companys liabilities in the event of a directors termination.
Executive directors must disclose all interests in other businesses and may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, enter into any related transaction or commercial arrangement.

Levels of remuneration comprise a basic salary or fee only and are determined by the Board, which is guided by competitive market data from remuneration advisers.
In future, remuneration policy may change to pay non-executive directors a basic salary or fee and a supplementary payment for each chairmanship they hold.
Accrued pension benets The UK executive directors were eligible in 2002 to participate in the Companys final salary pension scheme, which is governed by an independent trust.
From 1 November 2002 the member contribution rate for all existing members was increased to 6% from 5% previously of Pensionable Pay in excess of the State Lower Earnings Limit.
The retirement age for directors under the pension scheme is 60, and they can achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at retirement age after 20 years membership, except where limited by the statutory earnings cap.
Modest early retirement reduction factors apply to pensions payable after 20 years service on retirement from age 55.

On death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable.
On death before or in retirement a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pension is payable.
In all circumstances, childrens allowances are also payable.
Post retirement pension increases are guaranteed in line with ination up to 5% per annum.
The trustees general practice has been to award annual increases reecting ination in full.

His deferred pension at the date of leaving was 31,800 pa.

Tibbett & Britten Group plc Annual report and accounts 2002 25 Directors remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plans The Group operates Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs for executive directors and senior managers in the UK, Americas and South Africa which link additional remuneration to the creation of exceptional value for shareholders.
Participants in the UK receive a provisional grant of Ordinary shares in the Company related to between 15% and 100% of basic salary each year, which is held in trust for three years.
The Companys performance for the UK scheme is measured over rolling three-year cycles in terms of total shareholder return relative to the FTSE Mid 250, which the remuneration committee considers represents the peer group for the Company.
The size of the award made when the Plan vests will vary between nil for below median performance and 100% for performance in the Upper Quintile, e. g. position 50 or better out of 250 companies.
Following a review of scheme Rules in 2002, an additional performance criterion was introduced that the Groups Earnings per Share EPS performance should exceed the rise in the Retail Prices Index plus 2% per annum over the period.
The remuneration committee considers this to be a sufciently stretching set of targets to reward exceptional performance only.
For the 1999-2002 scheme, TSR performance was measured between March April 1999 and March April 2002 and led to maximum awards, as detailed below for directors.
TSR performance over this three year cycle is shown graphically in the right hand side graph on the following page.

The actual award for Mr M Sprague in respect of the American operations financial performance over the three year cycle to December 2002 is the equivalent of 21,000, which is payable in 2003.
The American LTIP commenced in 2000 and, subject to performance, provides cash awards of up to 120% of the provisional awards of salary for success against stretching targets for annual and compound profit growth between 20 and 25% growth per annum.
Vesting is permitted of 20% per annum for on-target performance payable at the end of the three year period to those employees still in service.
Subject to the Company achieving EPS performance in excess of RPI plus 2% in each of the three years prior to exercise, the executive share options are normally exercisable only after the expiry of three years from the date of the grant and will lapse if not exercised before ten years from the date of the grant.
No executive share options were issued or lapsed during 2002.
SAYE options are normally exercisable after the expiry of three or five years from the date of the grant and will lapse if not exercised within six months after they become exercisable.
Mr M Evans may continue to exercise options which vest prior to 31 December 2003.
The mid-market price of shares at 31 December 2001 was 597.5 pence and the range during 2002 was 807.5 pence to 382.5 pence.
