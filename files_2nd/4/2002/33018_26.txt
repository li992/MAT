UK Executive Directors Pension Arrangements Sir Tom McKillop is a member of the Companys main UK defined benefit pension plan.
The normal pension age under this plan is 62.
However, a members accrued pension is available from age 60 without any actuarial reduction.
In addition the accrued pension is available, unreduced, from age 57 if the Company consents to a request for early retirement and from age 50 if the retirement is at the Companys request.
On death in retirement, the accrued pension shown is guaranteed payable for the first five years of retirement and then reduces to two-thirds of this amount should there be a surviving spouse or other dependant.
Any member may choose higher or lower levels of survivors pensions at retirement, subject to Inland Revenue limits, in return for an adjustment to their own pension of equivalent actuarial value.
Pensions are also payable to dependent children.
In the event of a senior employee becoming incapacitated from performing his work then a pension is payable immediately as if such person had reached normal retirement age subject to a maximum of 10 years additional service, based on current pensionable salary.
In the event of death prior to retirement, dependants are entitled to a pension of two-thirds of the pension that would have been earned had such person remained in service to age 62 plus a capital sum of four times pensionable pay.
Pensions in payment are increased annually in line with inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, up to a maximum of 5%.
In respect of UK Executive Directors whose pensionable earnings are capped by the earnings limit imposed by the Finance Act 1989, unapproved defined contribution schemes are made available.
Currently, only Jonathan Symonds is affected by this limit.
The Company has agreed to pay annually 50% of base salary in excess of the statutory earnings cap for the pension and associated tax liability, with the intention of providing equivalence of benefits with non-capped UK Directors.
If this does not provide equivalence, the Company has agreed to make up the difference.
The benefits derived from equivalence are shown above as if the scheme was a defined benefit arrangement.
The Company contribution in 2002 in respect of the pension element was $171,000.
Swedish Executive Directors Pension Arrangements Normally, Swedish Executive Directors participate in the collectively bargained ITP pension plan, which provides pensions, dependants pensions and lump sums on death in service.
In respect of those Swedish Directors or former Directors, namely Hkan Mogren, ke Stavling and Claes Wilhelmsson, whose pensionable earnings are or were in excess of the earnings limit imposed by the Swedish Communal Tax Law Kommunalskattelagen, supplementary pension commitments are made.
The Company has agreed to pay 70% of pensionable salary from age 60 to age 65 and 50% of such earnings from age 65.
The ITP provisions are included in this additional commitment.
Paid in pension capital may also be used in the event of retirement or termination before the age of 60.
In the event of long term illness then a pension is payable immediately as if such person had reached the normal retirement age, of 70% of current pensionable salary.
On death in retirement the accrued pension shown is payable to a surviving spouse or other dependant.
In the event of death prior to retirement the accrued pension shown is payable to a surviving spouse or other dependant plus a capital sum of three times pensionable salary less $100,000 if married or two times pensionable salary less $100,000 if not.
com 53 Graph Showing Total Shareholder Return The UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors Remuneration Report of a graph showing total shareholder return TSR over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Companys shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated.
