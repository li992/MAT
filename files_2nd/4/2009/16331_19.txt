Remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the Code.
As required by the relevant legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company to be held on 23 April 2010.
The relevant legislation requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee Chris Bailey succeeded Andrew Walker as the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the April 2009 AGM.
Sir Robert Walmsley joined the Remuneration Committee in January 2009.
The other member of the Committee is Ian Griffiths.
Throughout the year, all the members were independent non-executive Directors.
David Jeffcoat was secretary to the Committee until he retired at the 2009 AGM and was succeeded in the role by David Garbett-Edwards.
Julian Blogh and Douglas Caster also normally attend Committee meetings, except where matters directly relating to their own remuneration are discussed, although they are not formal Committee members.
The remit of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of senior executive remuneration and to determine annually the individual salaries, annual bonuses payable if any, share based incentive awards and other terms and conditions of employment of the executive Directors.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website.
Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, part of Hewitt Associates.
HNBS is appointed by the Committee and provided the following services to the Company during the year: ongoing advice in connection with the operation of the Companys LTIP and share schemes: and remuneration benchmarking services.
In addition, the Committee consults Douglas Caster, Chief Executive, with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages offered to executive Directors and senior executives during the year, except in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package.
This is determined by the Committee, which meets without him for this purpose.
Remuneration policy The Companys remuneration policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling the Company to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre, whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments.
Further details of the remuneration policy applied by the Committee are set out below.
The remuneration practices adopted by a group of equivalent companies that, in the opinion of the Committee, face similar remuneration issues to the Company are considered, together with guidance from HNBS, when the Committee takes account of market practice.
The size and nature of each key element of the remuneration package of the executive Directors is determined following this assessment, with due account also taken of best practice and the particular circumstances and strategic goals of the Company.
It is the aim of the remuneration policy to encourage and reward high performance.
The Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by setting a moderate level of fixed pay, while providing competitive potential levels of total remuneration through short and longer-term incentive arrangements that require the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions.
Therefore, a significant proportion of the executive Directors remuneration is performance-linked, although not in a manner so as to encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking that may be to the detriment of shareholders.
The Committee also ensures that the remuneration policy for senior executives does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
When setting base salaries and the other elements of remuneration for the executive Directors, the Committee ensures that it is kept fully abreast of remuneration practices across the Group as a whole through regular interaction with the Groups HR function in order to ensure that a coherent pay structure applies.
46 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Salaries The executive Directors salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take effect from 1 January in each year.
In addition to the analysis presented by HNBS, the Committee uses published salary surveys and information available in the annual reports of similar companies as sources of salary information.
Specific factors taken into account by the Committee when determining each executive Directors base salary include: the median level of base salary for a similar position within a like group of companies chosen on the basis of size and similarity of operations: the individual Directors performance: his responsibilities: and the relative levels of pay and employment conditions across the Group.
The executive Directors salaries have been reviewed by the Committee which has determined that the following levels should be implemented with effect from 1 January 2010: Douglas Caster 450,000, Paul Dean 278,000, Andy Hamment 235,000.
Douglas Casters salary will reduce by 40% with effect from the April 2010 AGM, after which he will reduce his time commitment to the Group to an average of three days per week.
These salary levels have been set after taking into account the comparative market analysis carried out by HNBS, the performance of each executive Director in 2009 and reflect the crucial role played by these individuals in the Companys continuing success.
The Chairmans remuneration is set by the Committee which meets without him for this purpose.
The remaining non-executive Directors fees are set by a committee comprising the executive Directors.
In all cases, the fee levels are based upon published fee surveys, taking account of individual responsibilities.
Andrew Walker was succeeded by Chris Bailey as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees during 2009 and both received additional fees as a result.
Non-executive Directors fees have been reviewed for 2010 with reference to data regarding fee levels currently earned by the directors of similar companies, selected on the basis of turnover and market capitalisation.
It has been determined that the Chairman should receive a fee of 166,000, whilst the non-executive Directors should each receive 41,000.
Mr. Bailey will receive a further 9,400 for his responsibilities as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Annual bonus scheme Bonus payments in 2009 were based upon the achievement of operating profit and cash flow targets, adjusted where considered appropriate to take account of circumstances where the average actual exchange rates over 2009 varied significantly from the budget on which the initial targets were based.
The maximum bonus for executive Directors was 100% of base salary.
In 2009 the bonus targets adjusted as set out above were a maximum of 25% of salary subject to the achievement of a 89.0m headline profit before tax, and a maximum of 75% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 135.0m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure and purchase of long-term incentive plan shares.
The actual results for the year led to an aggregate bonus pay-out of 67%, of which 25% of salary was due to the profit before tax target being met in full and the balance was linked to achievement against the cash flow target.
The pay-out was below the maximum because the cash performance did not reach the maximum level.
It is intended that the annual bonus scheme for 2010 will be structured in broadly the same manner as set out above i. e. a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary, with bonuses payable by reference to performance against challenging financial targets.
Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan and Employee Share Option Plans The Company operates the following three live discretionary share incentive plans which were all approved in 2007: the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP : the 2007 Company Share Option Plan 2007 CSOP : and the 2007 Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 47 Corporate governance Remuneration report continued 2007 LTIP The sole form of equity-based long-term incentive for executive Directors is the 2007 LTIP.
They do not receive awards under the 2007 CSOP or 2007 ESOS schemes, which provide incentives for less senior employees.
Under the 2007 LTIP, awards of shares are made annually to executive Directors and selected other senior executives.
These awards normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the extent to which a performance condition has been met.
It is the Committees normal policy to grant annual LTIP awards to executive Directors in the form of shares worth 100% of salary.
However, in certain exceptional circumstances the Committee may make awards of up to 150% of salary.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the LTIP scheme has helped to motivate senior executives to drive sustained abovemarket long-term growth in Ultras profits and to generate excellent returns for shareholders as a result.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a change to the methodology for all awards made under the 2007 LTIP.
As explained in previous Annual Reports, this change was made for technical reasons due to the problems with measuring relative EPS performance in the transition to IFRS, permitting the Company to replace its relative EPS target with a relative total shareholder return TSR condition.
Relative TSR now applies to all new awards made under the 2007 LTIP.
The Committee believes that the use of relative TSR has a number of advantages.
These include: aligning the performance objectives of the executive Directors more closely with the interests of the shareholders: being an entirely objective measure of relative performance: reflecting the practice most commonly used by other quoted companies: and reducing the complexity and cost of calculating the vesting result.
The Remuneration Committee has decided to make a minor amendment to the 2007 LTIP awards such that the vesting date of such awards will be accelerated from August 2010 to March 2010 at which date performance against the targets will be known.
The 2007 LTIP participants will be required to settle personally any income tax and national insurance payable as a result of this vesting.
The shares awarded will be held in trust on behalf of the participants until the original vesting date in August 2010.
The shares will be held on the condition that if a participant would have forfeited his original award during the period March 2010 to August 2010 then he would forfeit his vested shares.
Detailed structure of TSR performance condition Under the TSR performance condition, TSR is based upon a comparison of the Companys average share price plus reinvested dividends during the quarter immediately prior to the start of the measurement period and its average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of the three year measurement period.
The resulting TSR will be compared with that achieved by a representative comparator group of companies.
2007 LTIP awards vest as follows: Ultras rank within the comparator group Percentage of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 20% and 100% The Committee reviews the comparator group annually and makes such adjustments as it sees fit for example, to take account of companies which delist during the year.
The comparator groups for measuring relative TSR for the awards made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were: 3 1 Alba Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Telent 1 Amstrad Filtronic Renishaw TT Electronics BAE Systems Halma Rolls-Royce UMECO Charter Hampson Industries Rotork Vitec Group Chemring Group Laird Group Senior Volex Group Chloride Group Meggitt Smiths Group VT Group 2 Cobham Oxford Instruments Spectris Whatman 2 Dialight Psion Spirax-Sarco Engineering Zetex 1 In 2007 group but not 2008 or 2009 groups since delisted before 2008 and 2009 awards granted.
2 In 2007 and 2008 groups but not 2009 group since delisted before 2009 awards granted.
48 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Detailed structure of TSR performance condition continued For the 2010 award, the comparator group of companies has been reviewed and will comprise the following companies: ARM Holdings Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering Babcock International Halma Renishaw Spirent Communications BAE Systems Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce TT Electronics Charter Laird Group Rotork UMECO Chemring Group Logica Senior VT Group Chloride Group Meggitt Serco Group Vitec Group Cobham Oxford Instruments Smiths Group WS Atkins Dialight Psion Spectris In addition to the main TSR condition, an underpin will apply to these awards requiring average annual growth in headline EPS growth of 7% over the relevant performance period.
In the event that this underpin is not met over a specific three-year LTIP measurement period, the level of vesting will automatically fall to zero.
Headline EPS is defined on page 1.
The extent to which awards vest will be verified independently by a third party.
All-Employee Share Plans The executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Inland Revenue approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme on the same terms as other employees.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Company.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, reintroduced during 2007, employees are entitled to save up to 1,200 per annum from net pay towards the purchase of options to buy Ultra shares after a period of either three or five years, depending upon the employees choice.
Senior Executive Share Ownership Guidelines To increase the alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders, the Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline under which all executive Directors will be encouraged to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they acquire on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding equivalent to 100% of base salary is achieved.
Pre-existing shareholdings will be taken into account.
Total Shareholder Return performance graph The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Company in comparison with the FTSE 250 Index over the past five years.
The graph shows the value at the end of 2009 of 100 invested at the start of the evaluation period, in the Company and in the Index.
The Committee considers the FTSE 250 a relevant index for the TSR comparison for these purposes as the Company is a member of the index and because together the index members represent a broad range of UK quoted companies.

In the event of early termination, it is the Committees policy that the amount of compensation paid to executive Directors will be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances, subject to the overriding conditions that: the Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance: the duty of the relevant executive Director to mitigate his loss will be taken into account: and no compensation payment can normally exceed one years salary and benefits.

There are no provisions in their contracts for compensation on early termination.
Directors pension entitlements The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme for current executive Directors, except Paul Dean who participates in a defined contribution plan.
A pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service.
With the Companys consent, executive Directors may retire from age 50.
After age 58, Company consent to early retirement is not required.
Pensions are reduced in the event of early retirement.
Death-in-service cover is a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings.
In addition, a spouses pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Director, a spouses pension of 50% of the Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5%, above which increases are at the Trustees discretion.
