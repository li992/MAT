Report on Directors remuneration Introduction This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years, as well as information on remuneration paid to Directors in the financial year to 27 December 2009.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and in line with the recommendations of the Code and the UKLA Listing Rules.
This report has been approved by the Board and will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2010 AGM.
Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for determining policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior managers.
The Committee is, within this policy, responsible for determining the remuneration packages of individual Executive Directors including the Chairman of the Company and for approving the design and operation of all share-based incentive schemes for Executive Directors and senior managers.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available for inspection on our website.
Remuneration Committee members and advisors The Committee consists solely of the Companys independent Non-Executive Directors, John Hodson Chairman, Michael Shallow, Dianne Thompson and Peter Klauber.
No other person was a member of the Committee at a time when any matter relating to the Executive Directors remuneration for 2009 was considered.
The Committee met five times during the year under review to consider and approve, amongst other things: the conclusions of a benchmarking exercise for Executive Directors and senior management remuneration: proposed salary increases and changes to other compensation elements of the Executive Directors remuneration: liaising with trustees of the EBT regarding LTIP awards to the Executive Directors and senior management: and setting performance measures and targets for the annual bonus arrangements and share-based remuneration and evaluating whether performance conditions have been met for existing remuneration arrangements.
No Committee member has any personal financial interest, con ict of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the year, the Committee has consulted the Executive Chairman on issues where his experience and knowledge have been of bene t to its discussions and he attends the meetings from time to time by invitation.
The Chief Executive Of cer has also been consulted on proposals concerning the remuneration of senior management and likewise he attends the meetings by invitation.
Neither the Executive Chairman nor the Chief Executive Of cer attended the part of the meetings dealing with matters relating to their own remuneration.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee and attends meetings save where his own remuneration is under consideration.
The Committee also received advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, an external consultancy with wide experience of executive remuneration on UK listed companies, whom it appointed whilst the Company was listed on AIM.
This advice related to developing its remuneration policy, particularly in relation to benchmarking the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management.
HNBS has no other connection with the Group.
BDO LLP also provided a broad range of tax, share scheme and advisory services to the Group during 2009.
Remuneration policy principles The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability and transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements evidence a clear link between reward and achievement.
The Committees remuneration policy for senior management, including Executive Directors, is based on the following core principles: total remuneration should be set at a level suf cient to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior employees of the highest calibre: remuneration should be weighted towards variable pay with a below median base salary vis--vis comparable benchmarks and above market incentive opportunity linked to the delivery of superior performance: short and long-term performance targets should be speci c, measurable and fully aligned with the Companys business objectives: signi cant opportunities to acquire Company shares should be provided as part of encouraging a wider share ownership culture: and the interests of management should be fully aligned with those of shareholders.
It is intended that this policy, which has applied throughout the reporting year, will continue to apply for 2010.
Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 39 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report on Directors remuneration continued Remuneration policy is reviewed on a regular basis against the principles set out above and the recommendations included in the Code.
The Committee also takes due account of relevant institutional investor and shareholder representative bodies best practice guidelines.
The current policy is considered to remain appropriate in light of these guidelines and our corporate strategy but it is currently intended that our policies will be revisited in light of any revisions to the Code by the Financial Reporting Council expected May 2010 and likely to apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 29 June 2010.
While not directly relevant to Dominos, the Committee noted the key conclusions of the Financial Services Authority Code and Walker Review during the year and has concluded that Dominos continues to take into account the principles of sound risk management when setting pay.
Regular liaison takes place between the Remuneration and Audit Committees as appropriate as part of an effective remuneration risk assessment process.
In designing an appropriate incentive structure for the Executive Directors and senior management, the Committee endeavours to set challenging performance criteria that are aligned with the Groups strategy for the business and the enhancement of shareholder value.
In line with the Association of British Insurers ABIs Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and it takes due account of issues of general operational risk when structuring incentives.

2 Adjusted EPS means diluted earnings per share before operating and non-operating exceptional items.
Whether particular performance conditions are met is assessed by the Committee following sign off of the audited Annual Report and financial statements.
This process ensures that incentive payments are made following independently audited results being known.
Remuneration received in respect of each of these elements by the Executive Directors is shown on pages 44 to 46.
Balance between xed and variable pay Based on the remuneration structure that was put in place in 2008 and that will continue to operate for 2010, for achievement of target levels of performance, more than 50% of total remuneration will be delivered from performance related elements of our remuneration structure.
For performance above target levels, a higher proportion of total remuneration will be delivered via performance related pay.
The performance conditions for each variable element are the same for each Executive Director.
40 Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Service agreements It is the Companys policy for the notice periods of Executive Directors to normally be of 12 months or less.
The Executive Directors current contracts, which are all dated 13 May 2008, provide for rolling 12 month periods, terminable by the Company giving one years notice, or by the Executive Director giving six months notice.
The contracts include provisions on non-competition and non-solicitation.
If an Executive Directors employment is terminated other than pursuant to the notice provisions in the service agreement or by reason of resignation or unacceptable performance or conduct, for any unexpired notice period the Company will pay a sum calculated on the basis of basic salary and any accrued annual bonus entitlement taking into account bonus payments in the previous three financial years, together with bene ts.
For the purposes of clarity, there is no payment in lieu of any unearned bonus on termination.
There would be no special payments made after a change in control.
Salaries and bene ts in kind for Executive Directors In setting the base salary of each Executive Director, the Committee takes into account market competitiveness and the performance of each individual Executive Director, any changes in position or responsibility and pay and conditions throughout the Group.
With regard to benchmarking Executive Directors remuneration for the purposes of assisting the Committee set pay for the 2010 financial year, the comparator groups considered were an appropriately sized subsection of FTSE 250 companies and restaurant leisure companies with broadly similar market capitalisation or turnover or both.
This approach was similar to that taken in prior years.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors also receive bene ts in kind which principally comprise pension contributions, life assurance, a healthcare scheme and use of a Company car.
Following the 2010 salary review, the salaries that will apply for Executive Directors in the 2010 financial year are set out below the 2009 salaries are also detailed for completeness and shown on page 44.
1 Executive Chairman: 191,000 2009: 190,000 Chief Executive Of cer: 315,000 2009: 262,000 Chief Financial Of cer: 230,000 2009: 215,000 1 In relation to Stephen Hemsley becoming Non-Executive Chairman following the 2010 AGM he will receive a basic fee of 191,000 and will no longer participate in any incentive arrangements.
As disclosed last year, following the Chief Executive Of cers promotion in January 2008, the Committees stated intention was to transition him to a threshold level of pay for a Chief Executive in a FTSE 250 company allowing for the sector in which Dominos operates based on his continued performance in post.
The salary increase awarded during the year re ected this transitioning process and also took into account that i he will assume greater responsibilities following the Executive Chairman becoming Non-Executive following the 2010 AGM and ii Dominos performance under his leadership with the financial year under review being a record year for the Company in terms of its pro t performance and dividend payments.
The increase to the Chief Financial Of cers base pay also re ected his excellent performance in post and the need to ensure a threshold level of base pay is achieved for a company of Dominos size.
The salary increases awarded to both Executive Directors took place following due consideration of the pay budget across all employees within the Group for 2010 and maintained a base pay market positioning that is signi cantly below the median benchmark data presented to the Committee by its independent advisors.
This market positioning is in line with Dominos remuneration policy and the increases were considered fair and reasonable in light of the Committees obligation to retain and motivate the highest calibre executive leadership team.
No changes have been made to any other elements of the Executive Directors remuneration packages.
Annual performance bonus APB Each year, the Committee set annual incentive targets to take account of current business plans and conditions, and there is a threshold performance below which no award is paid.
The purpose of the APB is to reward participants performance over 1 the previous financial year.
In 2009, bonus awards were based solely on achieving and exceeding challenging adjusted PBT growth targets.
Under the APB in 2009, the maximum bonus opportunity available was 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Of cer and 125% of salary for the Chief Financial Of cer.
The maximum bonus opportunity of the Executive Chairman remained for a second successive year unchanged at 100% of salary.
1 Adjusted PBT means pro t before tax and before operating and non-operating exceptional items.
Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 41 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report on Directors remuneration continued Actual APB awards made to Executive Directors for 2009 are shown on page 44 and, at 150% and 125% of salary respectively, 1 re ected adjusted PBT growth performance of 27.8% which exceeded the top end of the targets required for a maximum payout.
The actual pro t delivered during the year under review was a record result for the Company and an exceptional result given it was delivered against a background of dif cult economic circumstances.
With regard to the 2010 bonus structure, to achieve their respective maximum potential APB of 150% and 125% of salary 1 respectively, the Executive Directors will have to achieve or surpass on a sliding scale the adjusted PBT budget gure for 2010, 1 which itself represents a signi cant stretch on the record adjusted PBT gure achieved in 2009 and which the Committee consider 1 to be extremely challenging.
For 2010, adjusted PBT will be retained as the sole performance measure.
On becoming NonExecutive Chairman, the Executive Chairmans current entitlement to an APB for 2010 will cease.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Executive Directors and senior management have historically been eligible, at the discretion of the trustees of the EBT that holds shares for the purpose of operating the Companys share plans, to be awarded an interest in the growth in value of a speci c sub-fund of the EBT reversionary interests, represented by the increase in value of Dominos shares.
The economic impact of the arrangement from a participants perspective is such that subject to achieving the LTIP performance targets, the increase in value of the said sub-fund may be settled on vesting, in the form of shares.
Prior to the Companys Admission to the Of cial List and inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index, awards normally operated with a five 2 1 year performance period with vesting determined by performance against challenging adjusted EPS and adjusted PBT targets.
1 2 For vesting to take place, the Companys adjusted PBT and adjusted EPS were required to double by the end of the five year performance period.
However, vesting could be accelerated if at any time during the performance period, the EPS and PBT targets set were achieved following the publication of the relevant set of Annual Report and Accounts.
Following a review in 2008 of the Companys long-term incentive arrangements vis--vis institutional investors best practice guidelines speci cally those of the ABI and the recommendations set out in the Code, a new LTIP arrangement was introduced in anticipation of the Companys move to the Of cial List.
From 2009 onwards, awards under the revised LTIP continue to be structured as a reversionary interest in the growth in value of a sub-fund of the EBT, as represented by the Companys shares.
The key features of the current LTIP are as follows: Maximum award limit An individuals award is limited to an interest in the growth in value of a sub-fund of the EBT to 300% of salary in any financial year 600% of salary in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment and retention.
Granting awards at up to a value of 300% of salary is considered appropriate by the Committee to ensure that the total remuneration package is competitive and the Company is to be able to continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior executives of the necessary calibre.
This is considered particularly important given the Companys approach to setting base salary at below the median of appropriate benchmarks and was a key issue discussed with the Companys major institutional investors and the key shareholder representative bodies at the start of the financial year under review.
Performance conditions for awards in 2009 2 Performance is tested over three years subject to the following challenging adjusted EPS growth condition: Level of vesting Average annual compound EPS growth Less than RPI 9% 0% RPI 9% 25% RPI 12% or better 100% Between RPI 9% and RPI 12% Straight line vesting between 25% and 100% For the avoidance of doubt, this condition can only be tested at the end of three years with the award lapsing if the condition is not met at that time.
EPS is a key internal long-term measure of financial performance used by the Board.
As a result, the Committee considers it to be the most appropriate measure to use to incentivise and reward Executive Directors and senior 2 management.
The Committee will review the adjusted EPS growth conditions prior to making any awards in 2010 and the targets will be set out in full in next years Report on Directors Remuneration.
42 Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Other share option plans Each eligible employee, including each Executive Director, has the opportunity to participate in the HMRC approved savingsrelated share option scheme Sharesave on the same terms.
Further details on this share plan are provided in note 32 to the financial statements.
The Sharesave options are typically exercisable for six months following an initial three year option period.
Performance targets do not apply to Sharesave.
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Companys unapproved, approved or enterprise management incentive share option plans.
Share-based awards and dilution The Committee ensures that the aggregate of all share-based awards does not exceed the guidelines laid down by the ABI.
These guidelines provide that outstanding awards granted to employees over new issue shares under the Companys employee share schemes when aggregated to new shares issued in relation to exercised historic share awards should not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any 10 year rolling period.
Shares issued or to be issued under awards or options granted before the Company was admitted to trading on AIM in 1999 are excluded from this limit.
Share ownership guidelines The Committee has adopted a formal shareholding guideline that requires that all Executive Directors maintain a shareholding of at least one times their annual salary.
During 2009, all Executive Directors attained such a shareholding.
In addition, the Committee determined in 2009 that from 2010 onwards, the Executive Directors would be required to hold, on the actual vesting of each award, a signi cant proportion of the award in Dominos shares for a minimum period of two years following vesting.
The exact detail is still being worked up but it will be disclosed in full in next years Report on Directors Remuneration.
Retirement bene ts The Committee reviews the pensions arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure the bene ts provided are consistent with those provided by other similar companies and take account of changes in relevant legislation.
The Company does not offer a fide ned bene t pension scheme.
Instead, it makes contributions to an approved pension scheme of the Executive Directors choice.
In 2009, the Company contribution to each Executive Director was 15% of basic salary to the pension plan of their choice.
Save as set out above, there are no other pension arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Executive Directors outside appointments The Committee recognises the potential bene ts to the individual and to the Company of involvement by Executive Directors as non-executive directors in companies outside the Group.
Subject to pre-agreed conditions, and with prior approval of the Board, each Executive Director is permitted to accept one appointment as a non-executive director in another listed company.
The Executive Director is permitted to retain any fees paid for such service.
None of the Executive Directors currently hold any directorships of another listed company.
Non-Executive Directors remuneration Unless otherwise determined by the Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for terms of three years with a maximum term of nine years.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company but their terms are set out in letters of appointment.
There is no provision for termination payments and the appointments are terminable on one months notice.
Consistent with the Boards intention as detailed in the 2008 Report and Accounts that both Colin Halpern and Nigel Wray shall put themselves forward for re-election at each AGM for as long as they remain members of the Board, taking into account the Code provisions A.
7.2 Colin Halperns and Nigel Wrays appointments as Non-Executive Directors were renewed at the 2009 AGM of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with additional fees for chairing of the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
No additional fee is paid for chairing the Nomination Committee.
The Senior Independent Director is, from 2010, also paid a fee given the additional responsibility and time commitment required of this position.
The fees are determined and approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Executive Directors, based on a review of the fees paid in companies of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment of the Non-Executives.
Following a review of Non-Executive fees during the year under review, revised fees will operate for the 2010 financial year.
Fees will increase to a 38,000 base fee with an additional fee of 7,000 payable for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and an additional fee of 5,000 for the position of Senior Independent Director.
None of the Non-Executive Directors participate in the Companys bonus arrangements, share schemes or pension arrangements.
As detailed in the Corporate Governance Report, the role of Chairman is to revert to a Non-Executive position from 30 March 2010 with remuneration being adjusted so a xed fee of 191,000 will operate with the role no longer being entitled to participate in the Companys incentives.
Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 43 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report on Directors remuneration continued Colin Halpern, appointed Non-Executive Vice Chairman in January 2008, is seconded to the Company from HS Real LLC under the terms of a management agreement originally entered into in 1999.
