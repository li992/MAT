The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.

The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives will aim to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to compare remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and models its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee gives full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Code.

For the current year, to 31 March 2010, the executive Directors basic salaries remain unchanged from the previous year.
Lord Rothschild received a salary supplement of 20% of his basic salary, amounting to 80,313 in the year ended 31 March 2009 31 March 2008: 77,224.
This is included in the other benefits figure disclosed above.
The supplement is equivalent to the value of his pension contributions foregone since his election to opt out from the Companys pension scheme following advice received ahead of the pension tax reforms that came into force on 6 April 2006.
The salary supplement shall continue to be paid at the same proportion to salary in future.
For similar reasons, Mr Budge elected for the Group to cease making contributions on his behalf into the defined benefit section of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, with effect from 6 April 2006.
From that date Mr Budge has received a salary supplement equivalent to 42% of his basic salary, or 124,014 for the year ended 31 March 2009 31 March 2008: 119,244.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, has adopted an Executive Bonus Plan.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance in terms of increase in the net asset value per share, with dividends reinvested over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return World Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus to Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is between 7% and 10%.
Mr Breuer-Weil, as Investment Director, is entitled to an annual bonus of twice the amount produced by the same calculation, so that his maximum bonus under the plan is 250% of annual salary.
The bonuses payable under the Plan to Lord Rothschild, Mr Budge and Mr Breuer-Weil in respect of the year ended 31 March 2009 amounted to 278,246 31 March 2008: 334,806, 204,593 31 March 2008: 246,182 and 221,014 31 March 2008: nil respectively.
Mr Breuer-Weils bonus was calculated on a pro rata basis to reflect his appointment as Investment Director on 17 July 2008.
Mr Haysey received a 214413 RIT R&A pp21-pp40 6 3 09 2:25 PM Page 35 35 bonus under the Plan of which 93,521 was in respect of the part of the year ended 31 March 2009 up to his resignation as a Director on 17 July 2008 31 March 2008: 250,096.
In addition to the bonus entitlements under the Executive Bonus Plan, Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge both received a 1,000 bonus which was paid to the Groups employees in December 2008 31 March 2008: 1,000.
Mr BreuerWeil, having been appointed during the year, received a bonus of 500 in December 2008.
Long-term Incentive Plan The adoption of a Share Appreciation Rights plan the SAR Plan was last approved by shareholders on 17 July 2008.
Under the SAR Plan, participants are entitled to elect to receive a cash bonus.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
For directors of the Company and certain other senior executives, this is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for the three year period between the date of grant and the third anniversary thereof.
As at 31 March 2009 the amount accrued in respect of the SAR Plan participations of the Companys executive Directors was 1,867,133 31 March 2008: 4,715,629.
The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the year was 753.5p and the highest was 1,217p.
Should a participant leave his employment involuntarily at any time, the bonus accrued to the relevant date will be payable, subject to there being no grounds for non-payment arising out of negligence or other misconduct.
The following grants of Share Appreciation Rights were made to the Companys executive Directors during the year.

Performance Graph In accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index is shown below.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return World Index in Sterling, the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.
