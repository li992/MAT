annual report & accounts 2009 Remuneration Committees Report Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant provisions of Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 and has been approved by the Board.
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
It will be presented to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2010.
Remuneration Committee Role and Composition The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive Directors, including the setting of competitive salaries, annual performance targets and participation in the Companys executive share-based incentive plans.
The Committee also takes account of remuneration policy for the Companys senior executives generally.
The constitution and operation of the Committee during the year has complied with the Combined Codes guidance on Directors remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are published on the Companys website and are available from the Company on request.
The Committee comprises the non-executive Directors of the Company.
George Helland Chairman and Iain Paterson served throughout the year.
John Hofmeister and John Nicholas, both served on the Committee from their appointment to the Board on 26 August 2009.
Hector McFadyen served on the Committee until his retirement from the Board in September 2009.
The Committee met four times in 2009 with members attending all meetings held during their term in office.
Work during the year The Committees principal activities during the year under review included: Review of the remuneration structure vis--vis business needs.
This led to the introduction of the Performance Share Plan PSP, which was approved by shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting: Consideration and approval of executive Directors salaries and bonuses: Measurement of the performance conditions and determination of vesting levels in respect of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and grants under the executive share option scheme: Approval of awards under the LTIP and PSP: and Approval of the 2008 Remuneration Committees Report.
Advice During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street Hewitt, who were appointed by the Committee, provided advice and assistance on Directors remuneration, executive incentive plans, share scheme matters and, in particular, on the implementation of the Performance Share Plan, which was approved by shareholders in April 2009.
Hewitt did not provide any other services to the Company during 2009.
The Committee also consulted with and received information from the executives during the year but not in respect of their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives, in particular, provide a clear link between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages enabling the Company to attract, motivate and retain executives of high ability, experience and commitment.
The Committee believes an appropriate balance should be maintained between fixed and variable performance related remuneration, with the current balance approximately 32% deriving from salary and benefits and 68% from variable incentives.
uk 27 annual report & accounts 2009 Remuneration Committees Report continued The Committees ongoing approach is to set base salaries within competitive market ranges, combined with realistic reward potential for performance that is outstanding.
Directors remuneration packages consist of an annual salary, health cover, and where appropriate, car and fuel benefits, life and disability insurance, an annual performance-linked cash bonus plan, pension contributions, participation in performance-linked share plans and a long-term incentive plan.
Performance targets are established to achieve consistency with the interests of shareholders with an appropriate balance between long and short-term goals.
In setting the remuneration of individual Directors, the Committee takes account of their role and responsibilities, skills and performance and references credible and established market pay studies.
The Committee also reviews such studies with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet in remuneration levels.
The Committee also has the discretion to take account of social and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration of the executive Directors.
The Committee revised its approach to long-term incentives, after extensive consultation with shareholders in early 2009.
The Committee is of the view that the use of share options and their associated volatility is not appropriate for the Company going forward, while a share-based plan will more closely align executive Directors with shareholders as well as being consistent with FTSE 250 market practice.
As such, a Performance Share Plan proposal was put before shareholders and approved at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, full details of which are on page 29.
Awards under the PSP will replace awards previously made to executive Directors under the existing share option plan.
Consistent with policy on service contracts, executive Directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
Set out below are the key elements of the policy, which will apply in 2010 and subsequent financial years.
However, the Committee considers that an effective policy needs to be kept under review in order to reflect future changes to business needs and the environment in which the Company operates and, therefore, the policy may be amended in the future.
Base Salaries Base salaries are reviewed annually.
In considering appropriate salary levels, the Committee takes into account the remuneration paid by comparable companies in terms of asset size, revenues, profits, the number of employees, market capitalisation and the complexity and international spread of the Groups operations, as well as applicable rates of inflation.
The Companys practice is to target base salaries at the mid-market level in the appropriate market for the executive position.
In determining executive salaries consideration is given to their experience and general personal performance.
The Remuneration Committee is also mindful of pay and conditions for the wider employee population when determining executive remuneration.
Annual Bonus An annual performance-linked cash bonus scheme is in place for the executive Directors.
The scheme, which is not pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive and reward for performance and reflects the competitive markets in which the Group conducts its business.
Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are eligible for a bonus under the scheme when 80% of the Groups budgeted pre-tax profit is achieved.
Below this level no bonus is payable.
The amount payable under the scheme when performance achieves the budgeted pre-tax profit and return on capital targets, is 65% of base salary for Dennis Proctor and 50% of base salary for Peter Rose.
When actual results achieve 120% of these performance targets Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are entitled to a maximum cash bonus of 130% and 100% of base salary, respectively.
The amount of bonus payable, when actual results achieved are between 80% and 120% of performance targets, accrues on a straight line basis.
For 2009, the performance targets were not met in full and this is reflected in the amounts shown in the emoluments table on page 32.
However, shareholders have benefitted from stringent cost management and its impact on return on capital employed ROCE and the positioning of the Company for growth.
The bonus payable therefore reflects the Remuneration Committees view of these positive benefits to shareholders.
Bonus schemes are also in place for the majority of Group employees.
Richard Hunting has no bonus entitlement and his remuneration is wholly non-performance related.
uk 28 annual report & accounts 2009 Remuneration Committees Report continued Long-Term Performance-Related Incentives The Company operates three long-term plans: 1 Performance Share Plan PSP Awards under the new PSP are granted annually and vesting is subject to demanding performance conditions dependent on increased shareholder value.
Awards granted under the PSP, which are subject to a three year vesting period, will only vest based on the Companys total shareholder return performance relative to the constituent members of the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector indices and if the Committee determines the Companys financial performance has been satisfactory.
These indices are considered by the Committee to be appropriate as they compare the Companys performance against other companies in the oil and gas services sector.
Awards vest subject to the schedule outlined below: Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR against the TSR of the members of the Comparator Group % of the Award that Vests Upper quartile or above 100% Between upper quartile and median On a straight line basis between 40% and 100% Median 40% Below median 0% The plan allows for a maximum of share-based awards with a value equal to 200% of annual salary.
In practice, it is the Committees intention that awards will be below this maximum.
2 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is intended to link key executives remuneration to the long-term success and performance of the Group.
The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive pool, which is calculated using the sum of the Groups after tax operating income after deducting a charge for the after tax cost of capital, which for 2009 is at a rate of 7% on average total equity.
The incentive has two components, the first being 2% of the absolute value added, and the second being 5% of the incremental value added.
These performance conditions align the interests of the executives with those of the Group and its shareholders and will only produce value to the participants if value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle and are settled at the end of each cycle either in shares or in cash.
The award for each participant is calculated as a percentage of the incentive pool resulting from the performance of the business over the performance cycle as determined by the Committee.
The pool available for distribution has decreased from 6.2m as at 31 December 2008 to 2.6m as at 31 December 2009.
Following vesting, the amount payable under any single award may not exceed a certain multiple of the base annual salary of each participant.
The maximum award levels under the LTIP rules are 3.5 times annual salary for Dennis Proctor and 1.75 times annual salary for Peter Rose.
The aggregate amount of the pool awarded to participants was 2.5m.
uk 29 annual report & accounts 2009 Remuneration Committees Report continued 3 Share Option Plan The Company traditionally operated an executive share option scheme to provide longer term incentives for executives and executive Directors.
From 2009, executive Directors receive share-based awards under the PSP rather than grants under the option plan.
The right to exercise an option is subject to the growth performance of the Companys basic earnings per share BEPS over a three year period in comparison to that of comparator companies, who comprise UK, US and Canadian oil and gas services companies.
No shares are exercisable if the growth in BEPS does not exceed the rate of inflation by at least 3% per annum over the three year period.
The number of shares exercisable, expressed as a percentage, by a Director can range from nil if the Companys performance is below the median level, to 40% at the median level and up to 100% if the Companys performance is between the median and upper quartile levels of the comparator group.
No further grants will be made under the share option plan.
Directors Shareholding Requirements In order to align the interests of the executive Directors with that of shareholders, each executive Director is required to build up and maintain a holding in the Companys shares with a market value equivalent to not less than one times their annual base salary.
As a result of adverse stock market activity and the reduction of the Companys share price, the market value of the shares held by Peter Rose is currently less than one times his annual base salary.

Directors Service Contracts Executive Directors The Companys policy on executive Directors contracts is to comply with the guidance in the Combined Code.
At 31 December 2009, all executive Directors contracts were in compliance with that guidance.
All the Directors Service Agreements contain standard provisions allowing the Company to terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
uk 30 annual report & accounts 2009 Remuneration Committees Report continued Dennis Proctor entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on 7 February 2001.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA.
Under the terms of the Agreement both Hunting Energy Services Inc and Dennis Proctor are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause which provides for payment of base salary, performance bonus and vacation pay based on an annual entitlement of four weeks.
There are special provisions on a change of control.
These provide for payment of one years base salary together with an amount equal to the average performance bonus paid in the previous two years.
In addition, Dennis Proctor would be entitled to continue to participate in the Group insurance programmes for one year following the change of control and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant option agreement, all stock options and stock based awards granted to him will become exercisable at the date of the change of control and will remain exercisable for one year.
Richard Hunting entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 15 December 1989.
This was amended effective 1 March 2004 whereby both the Company and the Director are required to give one years notice of termination.
Peter Rose entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008.
Under the terms of the Service Agreements for Richard Hunting and Peter Rose, both the Company and the Directors are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Company reserves the right to pay them in lieu of notice whether given by the Company or by them.
The payment in lieu comprises salary only for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus only for Peter Rose.
The Company also has the option to put Richard Hunting and Peter Rose on paid leave of absence on payment of a sum equivalent to salary for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus for Peter Rose based on the previous 12 month period, subject to them complying with the terms of their Service Agreement.
These conditions also apply on termination following a change of control.
In addition, Peter Rose would be entitled to an acceleration of all share options and share-based awards, which would become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for a period of one year following termination.
The Company has authorised the executive Directors to undertake non-executive Directorships outside of the Group provided these do not interfere with their primary duties.
Richard Hunting held an external non-executive position for part of the year and his remuneration in 2009, which he is entitled to retain, was 13,000.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a fixed term of three years and thereafter, subject to approval of the Board, for a further three year term.
Iain Paterson was re-appointed for an additional one year term from 6 June 2009.
