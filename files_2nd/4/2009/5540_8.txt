Directors Remuneration Report Information not subject to audit: Remuneration Committee and advisers The Companys Remuneration Committee the Committee is composed entirely of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Mrs S E Murray, its other members being Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mr D O Maloney.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided.
Mr H V Reid and Mr G E Tuppen attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee except when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committees key objectives are to: n Determine and recommend to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration package for executive directors.
n Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A and B of the Combined Code.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts & Reports Regulations 2008.
The Committee seeks advice relating to directors remuneration from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, a trading name of Hewitt Associates, Inc who were appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Companys incentive schemes and executive remuneration more generally.
In particular, Hewitt New Bridge Street assisted the Committee in its recent full review of the Companys executive remuneration policy, details of which are set out below.
Ernst & Young LLP E&Y have also been appointed by the Committee to provide technical and administrative advice to both the Committee and the Company on the operation of the Companys incentive plans.
E&Y are the Groups auditor and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for the executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account ESG matters or, indeed, any other operational financial risks that relate to the Companys business.
The Committee Chairman liaises with relevant senior managers in the Group to ensure that pay and employment conditions in the Group as a whole are taken into account when framing the executive remuneration policy.
Remuneration Policy Executive Directors The Committee regularly reviews the executive directors remuneration packages to ensure they take due account of the Companys specific circumstances, market practice, the views of its shareholders and are aligned to the Companys key strategic objectives.
A detailed review of the Companys executive remuneration policy has recently been conducted by the Committee, with the assistance of HNBS.
The Committee considered this review timely in light of the challenging trading conditions experienced by all consumer facing businesses which are materially different from the conditions that prevailed at the time of the Committees last review.
When conducting its analysis of market practice, the Committee considered pay practices adopted amongst two comparator groups of companies: i a group of listed companies in the Travel and Leisure sector and ii a broader group of listed companies from the wider market.
Both groups comprised companies of a broadly similar size to Enterprise Inns.

Specifically it was decided that: n There should be no increase in base salaries or pension provision for the financial year beginning 1 October 2009. n The basic structure of the annual bonus in terms of i maximum bonus opportunity, ii the use of both challenging EPS targets and individual strategic targets, and iii a significant element of deferral into shares, should remain unchanged.
n The current approach to long-term incentive provision, which is provided via the regular annual grant of awards under the Companys 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan that only vest in full five years after grant subject to challenging performance conditions, should also be continued.
There have been two minor changes to the detailed manner in which the performance conditions operate as set out in the commentary on pages 32 and 33.
The Remuneration Committees policy will, therefore, continue to be designed to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration arrangements allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the exceptional individuals required to enhance shareholder value.
The fixed elements of the package comprise basic salary, benefits and pensions.
It is the Committees policy that the performance-related elements of the package, comprising short-term cash and deferred share bonuses and long-term share-based awards, should equate to around two-thirds of total remuneration for the executive directors based on an on-target, expected value approach to valuing the package.
The Committee will continue at all times to be mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant companies.
The Committee believes that these performance-related incentive arrangements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between Group and individual performance and align the rewards to executive directors with the long-term interest of shareholders.
The current policy is for share-based awards to be satisfied by the use of existing shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust further details are set out in the Directors Report on page 9.
The executive directors may accept outside appointments provided that such outside appointments do not in any way prejudice their ability to perform their duties as executive directors of the Company.
The extent to which any executive director is allowed to retain any fees payable in respect of such outside appointments, or whether such fees are remitted to the Company, will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows: Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly.
The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually against appropriate comparators and taking account of individual performance.
Benefits include car allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances.
In determining the basic salary for the executive directors the Committee takes account of the changes to individual responsibilities, benchmark data received from its remuneration advisers and current market and economic conditions.
Following the Committees most recent detailed review of pay levels and structure, it was decided that there be no increase in basic salary levels for the financial year beginning 1 October 2009.
Pensions The pension contributions for the executive directors equate to 25% of basic salary.
As previously reported the Committee agreed that, from 1 October 2006, G E Tuppen would receive a sum equivalent to 25% of basic salary in lieu of his pension contributions as a salary supplement this is not included in any bonus and share incentive award calculations.
No changes have been made to executive pension provision following the Committees recent review.

The 2002 Plan adopted at the 2002 Annual General Meeting provided for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives.
n The Enterprise Inns 2005 Annual Bonus Plan and the Enterprise Inns 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan both adopted at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The 2005 Plan replaced the 2002 Plan and no further awards will be made except under the 2005 Plan.
All awards made under the 2002 Plan have now been exercised.
Further details of the Plans are set out below.
Short-term cash and share incentives under the 2005 Plan Under the terms of the 2005 Plan currently in operation executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Committee.
For the year under review the maximum award level under the 2005 Plan for the Chief Executive was 125% of salary.
For the other executive directors the maximum award level was 100% of salary.
Awards under the 2005 Plan are subject to demanding performance targets.
For the year under review, 80% of the executive directors bonus was subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, with 20% subject to challenging individual strategic targets.
60% of any bonus earned is paid in cash, with the remaining 40% deferred into shares a Deferred Share Award.
Deferred Share Awards may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated by reference to performance achieved against the pre-set targets.
The bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 35.
The bonuses paid range from 18% to 23% of salary and were paid for performance against the challenging individual strategic objectives that were set at the start of the year comprising 20% of the total bonus opportunity and which related to key financial, strategic and operational targets.
No bonus was payable in relation to the EPS element of the bonus.
It has been decided that, to further strengthen the alignment of interests between executives and shareholders and to reflect current challenging trading conditions, this entire bonus shall be payable as a Deferred Share Award, notwithstanding the fact that the rules of the bonus plan require only 40% of any bonus earned to be deferred.
Following the Committees recent review of executive remuneration, it was decided to retain the core elements of the executive directors bonus opportunity for the forthcoming year.
As a result, for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2009 i there will be no change in maximum bonus opportunity, ii 40% of any bonus earned will be payable as a Deferred Share Award and iii 80% of the total bonus opportunity will be payable by reference to performance against a sliding scale of adjusted EPS targets and 20% will be payable for performance against individual strategic targets.
Due account was taken of the lower projected EPS result for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2009 when setting the EPS targets in that both i the threshold level of EPS performance, at which point this element of the bonus becomes payable, and ii the higher EPS target, at which point this element of the bonus pays out in full, are more challenging compared to the budgeted EPS than was the case in previous years.
Long-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan Under the 2002 Plan under which no awards have been made since financial year 2003 04, awards of ordinary shares were made to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over three years.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009 31 17092ENTERPRI.
indd 31 03 12 2009 17:16 03 12 2009 17:16 17092 03 12 2009 Proof 8 Directors Remuneration Report To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary averaged over a three year period, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 20% compound 72.8% simple.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
The final award under the 2002 Plan was made in the financial year 2003 04 and was exercised in the year under review.
Long-term share incentives under the 2005 Plan Under the 2005 Plan which is currently in operation, long-term incentive awards have two elements: n an award of Performance Shares worth up to 150% of salary each year : and n an award of Matching Shares linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in Investment Shares, which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that can count as Investment Shares are: n shares subject to the Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Plan: and n shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to the 25% of salary maximum.
Following the Committees recent detailed review of executive remuneration, it was decided that the 2005 Plan remained an appropriate vehicle through which long-term incentives are provided to senior executives.
Past awards made under the 2005 Plan do not vest in full until five years after grant and are subject to challenging adjusted EPS targets and relative TSR-based performance conditions.
The Committee believed that the use of both EPS targets and relative TSR targets was appropriate at the relevant time for the following reasons: n the adjusted EPS targets encouraged the executive team to deliver strong adjusted EPS performance over the three year performance period: and n the TSR targets required the Company to deliver returns to shareholders in excess of the majority of companies in the FTSE 100 index.
For awards made under the 2005 Plan in the past, half of these awards were subject to a performance condition based on average compound annual adjusted EPS growth.
This EPS-based condition measured the Companys average compound annual adjusted EPS growth by comparing the Companys adjusted EPS for the year prior to the date of grant the base year with the adjusted EPS for the third financial year following the base year.
The EPS growth targets to which past awards are subject are as follows: Level of match under the relevant Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award Average compound portion of Performance Share Matching Award Shares: annual adjusted EPS growth Award that vests Investment Shares Less than 7% 0% 0:1 7% 20% 0.4:1 15% 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting occurs if average compound annual adjusted EPS growth is between 7% and 15%.

All awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The Committee seeks independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets are met.
While a main conclusion drawn from the Committees recent review of executive remuneration was that the 2005 Plan should continue as the main long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives, it was decided that minor changes should be made to the manner in which the performance conditions should operate.
First, for the awards granted in December 2008 and, as is currently intended, all future awards, TSR will be calculated by averaging the Net Return Index of each company over the three month period prior to grant and vesting a six month average was used for previous awards, unless the Committee determines that a shorter or longer period is a more appropriate way of ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the Companys TSR performance over the period.
Second, it has been the Committees general policy that no part of the TSR portion of awards should vest unless the Companys adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin.
However, the Committee decided that this underpin should not be applied to the awards made in December 2008.
This decision was made on the basis that, while it was considered important at the time to ensure that the December 2008 awards are consistent with past awards, via the use of the same challenging EPS growth and relative TSR targets, these awards also needed to reflect the circumstances facing the Company at the time they were made and to ensure they constituted an appropriate incentive for the Companys management team.
The Committee is currently considering what performance conditions should apply to awards made in the year beginning on 1 October 2009.
The Committee believes that these conditions must take full account of and be closely aligned with the Companys strategic objectives and the challenging trading conditions being experienced by all consumer facing businesses.
In the event that the Committee concludes that there should be materially different targets applied to these awards than those described above, the Committee will consult with the Companys major shareholders before their grant.
Remuneration Policy Non-Executive Directors The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having taken advice on appropriate levels in light of the time commitment and responsibilities of each individual.
The Chairmans fee is approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
No increases were made to the base level of non-executive directors fees for the financial year beginning 1 October 2009 although changes will be made to reflect changes in individual responsibilities.

There are no special provisions in the executive directors contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
The service contracts of the executive directors include the following terms: Executive Directors Date of Agreement Effective Date Notice Period G E Tuppen 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months D C George 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months W S Townsend 31 October 2000 1 October 2000 12 months The terms of appointment for Mr H V Reid, Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O Maloney take due account of best practice.
Their respective appointments shall continue on an annual basis from Annual General Meeting to Annual General Meeting, subject to re-election, when applicable.
In respect of the Chairman and non-executive directors, the dates on which their appointments took effect and the current expiry dates are as follows: Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Date of Appointment Expiry Date H V Reid 21 January 1997 Terminable on 12 months notice A J Stewart 29 May 2001 Terminable on 6 months notice D A Harding 6 November 2003 Terminable on 6 months notice S E Murray 3 November 2004 Terminable on 6 months notice D O Maloney 10 July 2008 Terminable on 6 months notice Biographical details of all directors can be found on pages 7 and 8.
Forward-looking statement The Committee will keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as detailed in this report, under review during the next year to ensure that the Companys reward programmes remain competitive and provide appropriate incentives.
