Governance Report on Directors remuneration Opening statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee the Committee The Committees role is to govern Executive Directors remuneration and to ensure that the Groups reward strategy helps to drive business performance and shareholder value.
All the Committee members are independent Non-executive Directors, or in the case of Peter Cawdron, who served for part of the year on the Committee and is Chairman of the Board was considered independent on his appointment to that position.
The Committee is committed to clear disclosure of Directors remuneration to shareholders, this report details the individual remuneration of Board Directors and explains the principles and policies that the Committee has applied.
The following points provide important context for the Report on Directors remuneration: The remuneration policies are designed to ensure that a majority of the total reward package is dependent on business performance.
This is clearly reflected in the remuneration for Executive Directors in 2009.
Financial results and the Companys share price performance have had a marked effect on remuneration: For a second consecutive year, there were no base salary increases for Executive Directors: The long term incentive awards scheduled to vest in November 2009 have not met their performance conditions and have therefore lapsed: For the 2008 2009 financial year, annual bonuses were limited to a maximum of 11.5% of base salary for Executive Directors.
This level of payment recognises that whilst financial targets set in summer 2008 were not achieved, due to market conditions that are explained elsewhere in this report, Executive Directors exceeded expectations in particular areas of responsibility that contributed to the overall results of the Company in the year.
It is also worth noting that for the 2007 2008 year no annual bonuses were paid to Executive Directors.
The Committee strongly believes that shareholders interests are best served by ensuring that overall compensation levels remain competitive, and at a level that aids motivation and retention of key high calibre individuals, even during times when Company profitability is falling.
The Committee unanimously recommends that shareholders vote to approve the Report on Directors remuneration.
On behalf of the Board Fritz Ternofsky Remuneration Committee Chairman 38 www.
com Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code the Code relating to remuneration matters.
The report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains the commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The Committee members, who served for all or part of the year, are: Fritz Ternofsky Chairman Peter Cawdron member until 4 November 2008 Mike Foster Tony Rice replaced Peter Cawdron with effect from 4 November 2008 They are all independent, Non-executive Directors, or in the case of Peter Cawdron, was independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, and there are no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and any changes to their service contracts, as well as the remuneration of other senior executives.
The Committee also governs any annual bonus plans, long term incentives and employee share plans.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
Advisers to the Committee The Committee received independent remuneration advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, part of Hewitt Associates Ltd.
This independent adviser was appointed by the Committee and is accountable to it.
Hewitt Associates also provides consulting advice to the Group in respect of its Spirit pension schemes and actuarial, investment and other advice to the trustee of the two Spirit pension schemes.

The Committee also consults with the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary and Group Director of Human Resources.
However, no executive is permitted to participate in discussions or decisions about their personal remuneration.
The Committee met four times during the course of the year.
Remuneration policy The Committees reward policy is designed to help drive business performance and maximise shareholder value.
It is based on the following principles: that remuneration should be viewed holistically Total Reward, taking account of all reward elements: that Total Reward should be set at a market competitive level to retain and recruit people of the required talent and experience: that the package should be structured so that most of Total Reward is dependent on performance: that Total Reward costs should be monitored and controlled: and that Total Reward should support the creation of shareholder value.
Remuneration is benchmarked against two relevant comparator groups: Comparator group 1 Comparator group 2 UK pub, restaurant and hospitality sector UK companies of similar size and complexity to companies examples provided below Punch Taverns in other relevant sectors Enterprise Inns plc Mitchells & Butlers plc JD Wetherspoon plc Whitbread plc Greene King plc Marstons plc Restaurant Group plc Luminar plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 39 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Governance Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued The table below summarises, for 2008 2009, each element of the Punch Taverns Total Reward policy for Executive Directors, and its key features: Component Size Market position Purpose Delivery Other key features Base salary Varies by role In a range from To recognise the Cash.

The bonus opportunity is targeted at the upper quartile level, whilst base salary is targeted in a range of lower quartile to median.
The maximum bonus of 150% of base salary is only payable if individual and Group performance are both above target.
The Committee may award a portion of the annual bonus in shares which must be retained for at least two years, and there will be no matching opportunity on these shares.
The Committee awarded a cash bonus of up to 11.5% of base salary to the Executive Directors for the 2008 2009 performance year.
This was awarded for exceeding specific performance objectives in areas of disposals, certain operational targets and debt reduction.
41 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Governance Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued Long term incentives Policy: maximum long term incentive should be upper quartile, for upper quartile performance Punch Taverns plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2008 Awards made during the 2008 2009 financial year under this LTIP have the following features: performance shares: dependent on Total Shareholder Return TSR performance: maximum award size is 200% of base salary face value : and performance and vesting periods are normally three years.
There are two TSR peer groups, each relating to 50% of the award: a sector peer group and a broad peer group.
One measures the TSR of Punch Taverns plc relative to a peer group of 27 companies in the UK pub, hospitality and retail sectors.
The other measures TSR relative to a peer group of 39 UK companies from a variety of sectors in the same band of market capitalisation as Punch Taverns plc.
These performance conditions were selected by the Committee as they are important measures of the comparative value delivered to shareholders.
The base TSR and end TSR are averaged over a three month period to smooth the effect of unusual price movements.
The table below shows the vesting scale: TSR vesting scale Punch Taverns plc ranking against Comparator group at the end of the performance period Percentage vesting 1 2 Upper quartile 100% 1 2 Median 25% Ranked lower than median 0% 1 Median is defined as rank 14 of 28 in the pub, hospitality and retail peer group and rank 20 of 40 in the multi-sector peer group.
Upper quartile is defined as rank 7 of 28 in the first group and rank 10 of 40 in the second group.
2 Straight line vesting scale between these points.
The Committee has the discretion not to allow vesting of either or both elements of any LTIP award, if, in its opinion, either the Groups underlying financial performance or TSR or both has been unsatisfactory during the Performance Period.
There is no retesting of performance: in the event that performance conditions are not met, awards lapse.
Grants made to Executive Directors during the 2008 2009 year under this LTIP are shown in the table below: Face value Face value at grant Percentage at grant at upper of salary Number at median quartile Name Position awarded of shares performance performance Giles Thorley Chief Executive 200% 631,578 262,500 1,049,998 Phil Dutton Finance Director 200% 421,052 175,000 699,999 Mike Tye Managing Director Punch Pub Company 200% 481,203 200,000 800,000 Roger Whiteside Managing Director Punch Partnerships 200% 481,203 200,000 800,000 It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to make further awards during the 2009 2010 financial year under the 2008 LTIP using performance conditions that are robust and testing, whilst taking account of prevailing industry and market conditions.
Spirit Value Growth Plan SVGP As reported previously, a specific long term incentive plan was approved by the Committee for Mike Tye, Managing Director Punch Pub Company in June 2008.
This was implemented in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.
2, to facilitate the recruitment and retention of an individual Director.
The SVGP is intended to provide a direct alignment between the performance of the Punch Pub Company business and the remuneration of Mike Tye, to assist in driving the performance of this business and its value to shareholders.
com The SVGP has the following main features: limited to one individual Executive Director: linked to the value growth of the Punch Pub Company business, as determined by an independent valuation, and valued as an OpCo, whereby the Punch Pub Company pubs are deemed to be leased from a separate entity: the initial measurement period is the three financial years from August 2008: payment from the plan is 7.5% of the amount of value growth above a hurdle: the hurdle is 6% compound annual growth per annum: and payments from the Plan are in non-pensionable cash and are phased: 60% after the August 2011 year end, and the remaining 40% after the August 2012 year end.
Punch Taverns plc Share Bonus Plan This Plan was approved by shareholders in January 2008, to replace the earlier Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The new Plan enables the Remuneration Committee to award part or all of any annual bonus in the form of the Companys shares, which the recipient is not permitted to sell during a restricted period normally two years.
Executive Directors have not received any awards under this Plan in respect of 2008 2009.
Dilution In accordance with shareholder guidelines, the Committee applies a limit on the amount of shares than can be issued to satisfy all its employee share plan awards of 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any rolling ten year period.
Of this 10%, only 5% can be issued to satisfy awards under the discretionary plans that apply to executives and senior managers only.
The current position against these limits is shown below.
It should be noted that the figures below exclude 1.32% of dilution relating to options granted prior to the Companys flotation in May 2002 and therefore not subject to the ABI guidelines.
Additional dilution during the 2008 2009 financial year Limit Current dilution level included in the previous column 10% in ten years 1.45% 0.87% 5% in ten years 1.27% 0.75% Shareholding requirement The Committee requires that all individuals who participate in the Groups LTIP satisfy a minimum shareholding requirement.
Targets are set to encourage Directors to retain shares received from share incentive schemes.
The table below shows the shareholding requirement for Executive Directors, and their current personal shareholding: Shareholding Current actual requirement To be shareholding Name Position % of base salary achieved by % of base salary Giles Thorley Chief Executive 200% August 2009 99% Phil Dutton Finance Director 150% August 2012 15% Mike Tye Managing Director Punch Pub Company 150% August 2013 6% Roger Whiteside Managing Director Punch Partnerships 150% August 2013 6% The original target date set in 2004 for achieving shareholding targets was 2009, but for those Directors who have recently joined the Board a period of five years has been set.
It should be noted that Giles Thorley has not disposed of any shares in the Company since 24 July 2006, at which date his remaining shareholding represented 337% of his then salary.
Consequently the Committee has determined that the target has been achieved and he will continue to be eligible for award providing that to the extent previous awards vest then sufficient shares are retained to bring the shareholding back to 200% of his then current salary.
It should also be noted that Giles Thorley acquired an additional 206,851 shares for cash in July 2009 which are reflected in the figures above.
Pension Policy: median None of the Executive Directors is accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.
Executive Directors are entitled to receive a defined contribution to pension from the Group of between 12% and 12.25% of base salary.
The Committee has decided to bring this level of contribution more in line with market levels for Executive Directors and it has decided to introduce this change in stages over the next two years.
For the 2009 2010 year, the level of Group contribution will increase to 18% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 16% of base salary for other Executive Directors.
For the 2010 2011 year, these contribution rates will increase to 25% and 20% respectively.
43 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 Governance Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued Benefits Policy: consistent with general market practice The Groups policy is to provide Executive Directors with a market competitive level of benefits, including company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, lump sum life insurance for death-in-service, and income protection insurance for long term disability.
Total compensation Policy: upper quartile but with at least two-thirds of total compensation subject to performance The Committees policy is that Executive Directors should have the opportunity to earn upper quartile total compensation for upper quartile performance.
The table below shows total compensation opportunity for the Companys current Executive Directors and the total actual compensation earned: 2008 2009 Total Total compensation compensation 1 2 Name Position opportunity earned Giles Thorley Chief Executive 1,680,000 681,000 Phil Dutton Finance Director 940,000 465,000 Mike Tye Managing Director Punch Pub Company 1,030,000 503,000 Roger Whiteside Managing Director Punch Partnerships 1,030,000 494,000 1 2008 2009 total compensation opportunity is the sum of: base salary, actual bonus, value of LTIP vested following year end, Group pension contribution and other benefits.
2 Total compensation earned is calculated using: base salary, target bonus and approximate fair value of LTI awards made, Group pension contribution and other benefits.
Other remuneration matters All employee share arrangements During 2008 2009 the Group operated an HMRC Approved Share Incentive Plan SIP which is open to all employees of the Group including the Executive Directors.
Currently, 757 of eligible employees participate in the SIP which provides employees with the opportunity of purchasing 1,500 of shares per annum out of pre-tax salary and the Company awarding additional matching shares on a 1:1 ratio.
These matching shares will normally be released three years after they have been awarded provided that the associated shares purchased by the employee have been retained and provided the employee is still employed by a Group company at this time.
The Group will continue to operate the SIP for 2009 2010.
Directors contracts The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
The Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Group.

com Non-executive Directors fees Policy: median level fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, is determined by the Remuneration Committee based on recommendations from the Senior Independent Director and the Chief Executive within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on the median level of fees payable to peers in the same comparator group as that used for Executive Directors remuneration.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Groups share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join any of the Groups pension schemes.
It is the Boards policy to take into account the following factors in determining the fees of the Non-executive Directors: the median level of fees for similar positions in the comparator group: and the time commitment each Non-executive Director makes to the Group through membership of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
The following table sets out the Non-executive fees for 2008 2009 and the fees for 2009 2010: 2008 2009 2009 2010 Basic fee 42,000 42,000 Senior Independent Director 45,000 45,000 Additional fees for chairing the Audit or Remuneration Committee 10,000 10,000 Additional fees for chairing the Nominations Committee 5,000 5,000 The fee paid to Peter Cawdron, Chairman of the Company, for 2009 2010 will be 155,000 p. a.

The Remuneration Committee considers these to be relevant indices for TSR comparison as the Travel and Leisure Index members represent a range of UK quoted leisure companies, and the FTSE 350 is the index of the 350 largest UK listed companies by market capitalisation.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
The graph shows that at the end of the 2008 09 financial year, a hypothetical 100 invested in Punch Taverns plc on 21 August 2004 would be worth 26, compared with a value of 113 if invested in the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index, and 136 if invested in the FTSE 350 Index, for the same period.
