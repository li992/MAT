reMUNeraTIoN rePorT This remuneration report for the year ended 29 august 2009 has been prepared by the remuneration Committee on behalf of the board for approval by shareholders at the annual General Meeting aGM to be held on 12 January 2010.
The report complies with the requirements of the Listing rules of the UK Listing authority, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups accounts and reports regulations 2008 and the provisions of the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Part 1: Unaudited Information The Remuneration Committee The remuneration Committee comprises the following non-executive directors: adam Crozier Committee Chairman, dennis Millard, Paul Pindar and Sophie Turner Laing appointed on 1 august 2009.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
There were three meetings of the Committee during the year under review.
The individual attendance of the directors is detailed in the table within the Corporate Governance report on page.
The Committee has responsibility for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Company Secretary, reviewing the appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy and administering all aspects of any share schemes in operation for senior management.
The Committee is governed by formal terms of reference which are reviewed annually and can be downloaded from the Companys website at www.
during the year, the Committee appointed deloitte LLP deloitte to provide it with independent advice on directors remuneration and share plans.
deloitte also provides industry and comparative employee remuneration data to debenhams management.
The Committee has also consulted with the Companys Chairman, Chief executive, Finance director and human resources director but not on matters relating to their own compensation or contracts.
deloitte also provided advisory services in respect of corporate tax planning during the year.
The remuneration Committee reviews external data produced through surveys and benchmarking from deloitte about total remuneration in other comparable companies and the elements of that total remuneration, in order to inform its consideration of the remuneration of Company executives.
Remuneration Policy When determining remuneration policy and arrangements for executive directors, the remuneration Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
It is the Companys policy to provide remuneration packages that will attract, motivate and retain high calibre employees in a competitive retail market and, where possible, to do this in the most cost effective way for the business.
In 2008 09, as part of the announcement of a pay freeze for the senior management population, the executive directors also elected to take a pay freeze.
This pay freeze will continue for the executive directors group in 2009 10 although it has been lifted for the rest of the management population.
In addition to basic salary and pension provision, the Company seeks to incentivise its managers through an annual bonus scheme and through its share schemes.
The Committees policy is to weight executive directors remuneration towards performance-linked pay and thus to strike a balance between short and long-term incentives.
For the financial year 2009 10 the Committee intends to implement changes to the performance conditions underpinning the Performance Share Plan and the executive Share option Plan.
This follows further consultation with shareholders in July and august 2009.
No awards have been granted this year under these plans to executive directors.
It has been determined that the Chief executive and Finance director will not be made awards under the Performance Share Plan or the executive Share option Plan in 2009 10.
The deputy Chief executive will be granted awards under the PSP and eSoP with a face value of 7 per cent of base salary under each plan.
The awards will vest subject to stretching ePS growth targets PSP and sustained roCe outperformance eSoP.
Full details of targets will be disclosed in the 2009 10 remuneration report.
The Committee believes that in totality the combined use of performance share awards with an ePS performance measure and share options with a roCe performance measure effectively incentivises management to achieve both share price and efficient earnings returns which are goals aligned with the Companys long-term strategy and shareholder value creation.
Components of Remuneration Base Salary The Committee considers base salary and salary increases for executives based on the median level paid within a group of comparable companies in the FTSe 0 retail sector and in the context of salary increases across the Groups wider employee population.
To ensure the attraction and retention of the quality of individuals required to successfully run the business, the Committees policy is for base pay to be at or close to the market median of companies of a comparative enterprise value.
The Committee believes the benchmarking on the basis of enterprise value captures the capital structure of the Company and better reects the scope, complexity and responsibility of the roles at debenhams.
Base salaries were not increased in respect of 2008 09 and in addition, the executive directors have elected to take a pay freeze for 2009 10 in light of the uncertain market conditions faced by the industry.
Michael Sharps salary increased to 0,000 due to his promotion to deputy Chief executive on November 2008.
Executive Directors Bonus Schemes The annual bonus scheme for executive directors focuses on the achievement of specic numerical business targets.
The maximum bonus potential for 2008 09 was 100 per cent salary and the targets composed of two independent elements: profit before tax and net debt.
7 Debenhams annual report and accounts 2009 Section 3 Management and Governance reMUNeraTIoN rePorT continued profit before tax of 120.8 million post executive bonus has triggered a bonus achievement of.
6 per cent on this target, with the net debt target triggering at 20 per cent of salary.
This, therefore, triggered a bonus award of 6.
an additional award of 166, 9 has been made to Chris Woodhouse, Finance director, in recognition of the exceptional effort on his part in the successful capital raising in June 2009 and the restructuring of the Companys debt.
during the year the Committee reviewed the performance measures for the annual bonus and determined that for 2009 10 bonus would be based on one measure: earnings Before Interest and Tax eBIT performance.
The Committee considered that this approach would better focus executive directors on achieving exceptional earnings performance.
The Debenhams Performance Share Plan the PSP The Committee has discretion to grant awards under the PSP up to a maximum of 200 per cent of base salary to executive directors and other senior executives.
Up to 2 0 per cent of base salary may be awarded in exceptional circumstances e. g. for recruitment.
on vesting, executives may receive shares, the number of which is determined by the extent to which a performance condition is achieved, provided that they remain employed in the Group.
awards under the PSP comprise an option to receive free shares or a nil cost option.
awards under the PSP normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting subject to satisfaction of performance conditions set by the remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and if the remuneration Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
awards made up to date under the PSP are subject to two performance targets.
0 per cent of the award is based on the adjusted earnings Per Share ePS growth of the Company above the percentage increase in the retail Prices Index rPI over a three-year performance period and the other 0 per cent is based on the Companys Total Shareholder return TSr against the weighted TSr of the FTSe 0 General retailers Index over a three-year performance period.
The Committee considers TSr to be an appropriate measure of shareholder value with the FTSe 0 General retailers Index as the comparator.
The Committee determined that a weighted index was a fairer and more reasonable method of determining relative performance as opposed to a conventionalTSr ranking as it factors in the size of each comparator company and therefore the absolute levels of value that each company generates relative to its size.
When determining theTSr requirement for maximum vesting, the Committee took into consideration the historical TSr performance of the comparator companies over the past ten years.
a threemonth average TSr at the start and end of the performance period will be used to mitigate the effect of any short-term share price volatility.
If one or both of the performance conditions are not met at the end of the performance period, 0 per cent or 100 per cent as appropriate of the awards will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.

The trust currently holds 1, 1, 6 shares in the Company.
dividends receivable on the shares held in the Trust are waived on the recommendation of the Company.
In 2008, the Company adopted the debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan.
however, despite consultation with key shareholders in 2008 who were supportive of proposals to grant awards under the Plan during 2008 09, it was decided that due to the then prevailing economic climate the Company should not grant awards under the Plan.
It is the Companys intention to make awards under the debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan in 2009 in using the shares held in the Trust.
The rules of the Plan, allow the remuneration Committee at the date of grant, to determine the vesting period of the option granted.
In 2009, options with an 18-month vesting period, will be granted to a small number of key, senior employees below board level, whom the Company wishes to retain and incentivise in the short to medium term.
Funding of Share Schemes It is the Companys current intention to satisfy any future requirements of its share schemes in a method best suited to the interests of the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares.
Where the awards are satisfied by newly issued shares the Company will comply with aBI guidelines on shareholder dilution.
Current levels of shareholder dilution are 0.
8 per cent of share capital.
Change of Control The rules of the Companys share schemes provide that in the event of a change of control, awards options would vest to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied at the date of such an event.
