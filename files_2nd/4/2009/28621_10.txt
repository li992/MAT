Remuneration report The Board presents the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The aim of the remuneration policy is to provide a competitive remuneration package, having regard to comparable companies in the financial sector, which is suf cient to attract and retain the quality of director needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
2009 saw the publication of A review of corporate governance in UK banks and other financial industry entities by Sir David Walker and a FSA policy statement titled Reforming remuneration practices in financial services.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee has reviewed current remuneration arrangements in light of these reports and is making some changes for 2010 onwards which are explained below.
Remuneration packages Remuneration packages are designed to include xed and variable elements, and to provide rewards for both the long and short term.
The Committee considers that the key objectives of a remuneration package are to motivate directors to generate long-term shareholder value and to increase pro tability.
The first objective is met by long-term incentive plan LTIP awards, providing directors with the opportunity to build a meaningful shareholding in the Company, subject to meeting stretching performance targets.
Executive directors are actively encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding to the equivalent value of at least one years salary within five years of their appointment to the Board.
The second objective is met by pro t share payments.
The proposed introduction of a deferred pro t share element supports both objectives.
The Committee does not speci cally take into account corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when considering the remuneration of executive directors but it is satis ed that the incentive structure does not increase risks in these areas by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
In the light of current economic circumstances, the Committee has considered remuneration arrangements and the risk reward pro le that these present at executive director level, and are comfortable that, with the changes to the pro t share proposed, these arrangements remain appropriate.
Basic salary and bene ts An executive directors basic salary is determined by the Committee and any change implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector.
In view of the trading conditions experienced in late 2008 and in 2009, directors basic salaries were not increased on 1 January 2009 or 1 January 2010.
When setting salary levels, use is made of survey data and information provided by the advisers to the Committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration in respect of other Board positions.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of bene ts including life, private medical and permanent health insurance.
The provision of company cars is being phased out as lease contracts end.
Pro t share For 2009, the following arrangements were in place: Paul Chavasse, Richard Lanyon, Andy Pomfret and Paul Stockton were eligible for a discretionary pro t share payment from a pool of between 1.0% and 2.5% of Group pre-tax pro ts at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, having regard to the contributions of individual participants and the external circumstances in which the Company has operated.
It was anticipated that in a typical year the payment would normally be 1.75% of Group pro ts.
In 2009 502,000 was paid representing 1.7% of continuing Group pre-tax pro t 2008: 591,000, 1.4% Directors with direct responsibility for investment management, unit trust or trust and tax departments Ian Buckley, Andrew Morris, Peter Pearson Lund and Richard Smeeton received a pro t share payment based on the pro ts of the department concerned which may be supplemented by a payment from the pool referred to above.
In 2009 345,000 was paid representing 1.2% of continuing Group pre-tax pro t 2008: 591,000, 1.4% Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 36 Remuneration report Pro t share continued For 2010, changes to the structure will be made.
The Committees view was that payments based on a share of current year pro ts and not revenue remained appropriate and in accordance with best practice.
Whilst the danger of excessive risk taking in generating those pro ts was considered low, it was agreed that a signi cant element of deferral should be introduced.
Awards to all executive directors will be made from one pool of pro ts of 3-5% of Group pro t before tax with an expectation that in a normal year the percentage would be around 4%.
This compares with the total award of 2.9% for 2009, the increase recognising that up to two-thirds of the award will be paid in Rathbone Brothers Plc shares three years after the end of the relevant accounting period.
The cash element may be increased but the total award will be reduced by up to a maximum of one-third if the total award is taken in cash.
Individual awards will be capped at 200% of basic salary.
No performance criteria are attached to the deferred award.
The Committees view was that share price movements re ect the performance of the business and that further performance conditions were not necessary.
Half of the deferred award will lapse if a director is a bad leaver whilst deferred shares will attract the monetary equivalent of declared dividends over the deferral period.
The Committee is comfortable that the overall remuneration opportunity is moderate when compared with the market.

No awards from the current plan will be made after November 2010.
New arrangements which will require shareholder approval are currently being developed.
Under the current LTIP arrangements, executive directors are provisionally awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares at the start of a three-year plan cycle the provisional award.
The maximum value of a provisional award is 75% of a participants basic salary.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant the actual award.
The performance targets used to date have been a mixture of growth in earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR.
TSR is a measure of the overall return to shareholders.
It re ects both the change in the share price and dividends, assuming that they are reinvested.
If a participant ceases to be employed as an executive director by reason of retirement at normal retirement age or earlier with the Companys consent, ill-health, redundancy or death, or any other circumstances which the Committee deems to be appropriate, the Committee may, at its discretion, recommend to the trustee that any distribution be based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but that the actual award be reduced pro rata to re ect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
In all other circumstances, any provisional award would lapse on cessation of employment.
For all awards made since 2005, relative TSR performance has been measured against the FTSE All Share Index.
The use of a peer group rather than a broad index was ruled out due to the small number of similar businesses in the speciality and other finance sector, and the risk that numbers would fall still further due to consolidation.
On 31 December 2008, the trustee held 47,193 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares.
On 12 March 2009, 4,500 shares were awarded to 2006 08 Plan participants.
42,693 shares were held as at 31 December 2009. Dividend entitlements in respect of this holding have been waived and voting rights will not be exercised.

The TSR for the three-year period was -24.84%, which ranked the Company at the 38th percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index.
2008 10, 2009 11 and 2010 12 plan cycles Details of the provisional awards for the 2007 09, 2008 10 and 2009 11 plan cycles are also set out in Table 3.
Were the maximum possible provisional awards to be made in shares to current and former directors, 393,346 ordinary shares 2008: 354,142 would be awarded, representing 0.9% 2008: 0.8% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2009.
In practice, awards under the LTIP are intended to be satis ed using market purchased shares held in trust.
Expected actual awards are dif cult to predict with any accuracy.

Long-term incentive arrangements for Peter Pearson Lund Following his appointment to the Board, Peter Pearson Lund has continued to participate in the Rathbone Unit Trust Management Limited RUTM deferred pro t sharing plan rather than the LTIP.
A deferred pro t sharing pool is allocated to participants on the recommendation of a RUTM Plan Committee.
Allocations are held in trust and invested on behalf of participants.
The release of an award is conditional on continued employment unless the participant is a good leaver.
Funds are released in two equal tranches two and three years after the period end.

This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company.
Performance related SIP shares are also offered to employees if there is year on year EPS growth over the rate of in ation.
SIP shares are included in the table of directors share interests on page 29.
Executive directors may also participate in the HM Revenue & Customs approved Rathbones Savings Related Share Option Plan commonly know as a Save As You Earn or SAYE Plan which was approved by shareholders on 19 November 2009.
An option grant was made on 23 December 2009 at 6.96 being the closing mid-market price on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation less a 20% discount.
Details of grants to directors are shown in Table 5.
Options granted prior to 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group during the period from grant to the date of noti cation of exercise has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Options granted after 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group between the accounting period immediately prior to the option grant and the accounting period immediately prior to the third anniversary of grant has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Option grants to a participant in a ten year rolling period are capped at four times remuneration.
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions in the event of a change of control or the early termination of a participants employment.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding options at the start and end of the year together with details of options exercised during the year are set out in Table 6.
The terms and conditions of all options have remained unchanged during the year.

Of that 15%, not more than 10% applies to shares allotted under share option schemes including the SAYE Plan and not more than 5% to shares allotted under both the LTIP and SIP.
In the ten years to 31 December 2009, options over 2,508,122 ordinary shares 2008: 2,649,537 have been granted, which represents 5.8% of the issued share capital at that date 2008: 6.2%.
1,071,167 ordinary shares 2008: 905,367 have been allotted in respect of the SIP, representing 2.5% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2009 2008: 2.1%.
No shares have been allotted for the LTIP to date with awards satis ed by market purchased shares held in trust.
Pension arrangements UK employees who joined Rathbones prior to 1 April 2002 were offered membership of the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme provides for members to retire at the age of 60 with a pension based on final pensionable salary.
Prior to 1 April 2006, the accrual rate was 1 60th for each year of membership.
With effect from 1 April 2006, employees were given the choice of either remaining on a 1 60th accrual rate but increasing their contribution rate from 5% to 6.5% at 1 April 2006 and to 8% from 1 January 2008 or switching to a 1 70th accrual rate for future pensionable service but continuing to contribute at 5%.
With effect from 1 July 2009, future service bene ts will be based on career average revalued earnings CARE with a normal retirement age of 65 rather than 60.
Details of the Companys contributions are set out in note 25 to the accounts.
Since 1 April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a Group fide ned contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain directors and senior staff, the Group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
Paul Chavasse, Richard Lanyon, Andrew Morris, Peter Pearson Lund and Richard Smeeton are members of the Scheme.
Ian Buckley, Andy Pomfret and Paul Stockton participate in the Scheme for death in service bene ts only.
Ian Buckley and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under self-invested personal pension schemes whilst Paul Stockton is a member of the Group fide ned contribution plan.
Rathbones pays annual contributions of 11.5% of salary to those schemes, subject to HM Revenue and Customs maximum limits, where applicable.
In the case of Peter Pearson Lund, employer pension contributions and death in service bene ts ceased on 31 October 2007.
Additional cash payments are now made by way of a salary supplement in lieu with no overall increase in cost to the Company.
These are disclosed separately in Table 1.
41 Remuneration report Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 Pension arrangements continued The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in Table 7.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
The increases in transfer values are mainly due to changed assumptions for in ation, post-retirement discount rates and future mortality.
Following the introduction of the Governments simpli cation of the pension taxation regime on 6 April 2006 the Company has taken action, where required, to ensure that the pension arrangements for staff conform to the new regime.
Where possible, for all UK employees, death in service cover has been extended to age 65 for those that stay in service beyond age 60.

Pensions will increase at a rate of 5% per annum or the lesser of 5% per annum or the rise in the Retail Price Index if less for pension entitlement accrued after 1 April 2001 or for pension accrued under the Laurence Keen Scheme and being in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension after early retirement subject to HM Revenue and Customs limits.
There is no undertaking or expectation for any other pension bene t to be arranged for any director by the Company.
Service contracts for executive directors The Company has service contracts with its executive directors.
It is Company policy that such contracts should not normally contain notice periods of more than 12 months.
Details of the contracts of employment of directors serving during the year are as follows: Executive director Date of contract Notice period I M Buckley 27 November 2003 6 months P D G Chavasse 5 December 2002 6 months R P Lanyon 10 October 1997 12 months A T Morris 1 July 2003 6 months P G Pearson Lund 5 January 2005 6 months A D Pomfret 1 October 2004 12 months R I Smeeton 9 March 1995 6 months R P Stockton 18 August 2008 6 months There are no provisions within the contracts to provide automatic payments in excess of payment in lieu of notice upon termination by the Company and no pre-determined compensation package exists in the event of termination of employment.
Payment in lieu of notice would include basic salary, pension contributions and bene ts.
There are no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages or any statements in respect of the duty of mitigation.
Compensation payments will be determined on a case-by-case basis in the light of current market practice.
Compensation will include loss of salary and other contractual bene ts but mitigation will be applied where appropriate.
In the event of entering into a termination agreement, the Board will take steps to impose a legal obligation on the director to mitigate the loss incurred.
There are no clauses in contracts amending employment terms and conditions on a change of control.
Executive directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2009 42 Remuneration report Shareholdings New executive directors are encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding at least equivalent to the value of one years basic salary within five years of taking up their appointment.

Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the Board with fees generally being payable to the Company.
An exception is Ian Buckley, who was appointed to the board of NXT Plc prior to joining Rathbones.
Following his appointment as a committee member of the Family Assurance Friendly Society on 14 December 2009, whilst he retains the fee paid of 27,350 per annum, his Rathbones salary has been reduced accordingly.
Remuneration Committee The current members of the Remuneration Committee are the independent non-executive directors Caroline Burton chairman, James Barclay, Oliver Corbett, David Harrel, Mark Robertshaw, Kate Avery and Kathryn Matthews who both joined the Committee on their appointment to the Board on 6 January 2010.

Details of attendance at meetings are shown on page 34.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee has appointed Deloitte LLP Deloitte as advisers to the Committee.
Deloitte attend at least one Remuneration Committee meeting per annum and advise on best practice and latest developments in senior executive remuneration.
Deloitte also provides occasional ad-hoc advice, particularly on share scheme issues, and supplies tax compliance software.
