For option grants prior to September 2001, should both performance criteria not be met by the vesting date, regular retesting was permitted.
For grants made after that date and until 1 June 2005, re-testing was permitted every six months up to a maximum of five years after grant.
If both criteria have not been met by the end of the five-year period the options will lapse.
For grants made after 1 June 2005, no retesting has been allowed under any share option plan.
As from 1 June 2005, a further restriction was brought in so that should any employee leave the Group but be deemed a good leaver under the share scheme rules and hence be entitled to retain their option grant, their grant is subject to a pro-rata reduction based on the number of months employed compared with the three-year vesting period for the option.
The maximum level of grant under the Company share option schemes, in any one year, may not exceed 300% of salary.
The existing share option scheme expired in July 2008 on reaching its tenth anniversary so no more grants may be made under the scheme.
As stated on page 56, it is proposed to set up a new share option plan and rules will be presented to the AGM on 15 July 2009 for the approval of shareholders.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
The Company operates in a rather unusual market so it is not easy to find a specific index for comparison.
However, the Board has chosen the Index as a comparator for its current share awards as it believes that it gives shareholders a reasonable comparison with the total shareholder return TSR of other equity investments in companies of a broadly similar size across all sectors.
The TSR performance has been measured by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The middle market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2009 was 124p.
During the year the share price ranged from a low of 84p to a high of 244.5p.
