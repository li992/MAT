Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2009 59 Directors remuneration continued Details of the GLTI performance shares The number of shares vesting depends on the performance of two measures: free cash flow and relative TSR.
This section sets out how the performance of each of the two measures is calculated.
Underlying operational performance adjusted free cash flow The free cash flow performance is based on a three year cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure.
The definition of adjusted free cash flow is reported free cash flow excluding: Verizon Wireless additional distributions: Spectrum licence costs: Foreign exchange movements over the performance period: and Material one-off tax settlements.
The cumulative adjusted free cash flow target and range for awards in the 2009 and 2010 financial years are set out in the table below: 2009 2010 Vesting Vesting Performance bn percentage bn percentage Threshold 15.5 50% 15.50 50% Target 17.5 100% 18.00 100% Superior 18.5 150% 19.25 150% Maximum 19.5 200% 20.50 200% The target free cash flow level is set by reference to the Companys three year plan and market expectations.
The Remuneration Committee consider the 2009 and 2010 targets to be stretching ones.
TSR out-performance of a peer group median Vodafone has a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile.
As such, the out-performance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure.
The peer group for the performance condition is as follows: 2009 financial year 2010 financial year BT Group BT Group Deutsche Telekom Deutsche Telekom France Telecom France Telecom Telecom Italia Telecom Italia Telefonica Telefonica 1 1 Emerging market composite Emerging market composite Note: 1 Consists of the average TSR performance of three companies: Bharti, MTN and Turkcell.
The relative TSR position will determine the performance multiplier.
This will be applied to the free cash flow vesting percentage.
There will be no multiplier until TSR performance exceeds median.
