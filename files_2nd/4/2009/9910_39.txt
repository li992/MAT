Their appointments may be terminated without compensation in the event of them not being re-elected by shareholders or otherwise in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The fees for the Chairman and the non-executive directors are set by the full Board and are determined by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity and reflect the amount of time they are expected to devote to the Groups activities during the year.

The Chairman receives a fee of 150,000 and non-executive directors receive a basic fee of 40,000 per annum.
A supplementary fee of 4,000 is paid to Committee Chairmen and to the senior independent director to reflect their additional responsibilities.

Investment Companies Index as the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR performance is lower than the median of the comparator group, awards subject to the TSR condition will lapse.
The awards start to vest on a sliding scale if TSR performance is equal to or above the median of the comparator group, with full vesting only if the Companys TSR performance is in the upper decile of the comparator group.
TSR performance conditions changed from 2007 onwards such that for those later awards full vesting is dependent upon an upper quartile TSR performance.
Under the TSR performance conditions of the October 2006 scheme an award of 17.6% 27,500 shares has been earned for vesting in October 2009 by Miles Roberts.
The LTIP award allocated to Ian Johnson in the year lapsed upon his resignation.
This performance measure has been selected as it is consistent with the majority of LTIPs in the same sector and the Remuneration Committee wishes to encourage senior executives to give attention to medium term as well as short term returns to shareholders.
50% of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
Awards subject to the EPS condition will lapse unless the Companys growth in EPS adjusted to exclude the effects of amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items is at least 3 percentage points per annum above the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI, at which level half the awards subject to the EPS condition will vest.
For performance above this level, awards will vest on a rising scale, with full vesting only if growth in EPS exceeds the increase in RPI by at least 5 percentage points per annum for the 2006 and 2008 awards and by at least 8 percentage points for the 2007 and any 2009 awards.
This performance measure has been reviewed again in 2009 and full vesting for the latest awards will be at RPI plus 10 percentage points, with the threshold for awards adjusted upwards to RPI plus 5 percentage points.
This performance measure has been selected because EPS is one of the key performance indicators used in the business and is a measure well understood by the senior executive team.
It is something which they can directly influence.
Under the EPS performance condition no awards have been earned for vesting in 2009.
TSR and EPS performance are measured over the period of three consecutive financial years of the Company beginning with the year of grant of the award.
There will be no re-setting of the performance conditions.
Pensions audited The following table shows details of pension payments into money purchase schemes for the executive directors: Current year payments Director 000 Mr M W Roberts 145 Mr I R Johnson 30 Payments to third parties There have been no payments made to third parties for making available the services of the directors.
