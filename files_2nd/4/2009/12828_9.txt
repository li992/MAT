28 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Review of the year Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements Remuneration committee process The remuneration committee met seven times during the year.
Details of attendance are shown in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 20.
During the year the main items considered were: the alignment on timing of salary reviews, salary changes and bonus payments across the Group: to review and approve awards made under the employee share schemes: the new bonus plan with deferred share element for executive directors: a review of directors fees and remuneration: the remuneration packages for those executive managers who were recruited or promoted during the year: to approve the remuneration proposals for salary rises and bonus payments to employees across the Group: the introduction of a formalised performance appraisal process for directors and senior managers within the Group: the development of an action plan to improve the areas identified in the remuneration committee review: to review and recommend changes to the terms of reference of the remuneration committee to the Board: and to instruct KPMG as consultants, to develop a new performance share plan which will be available to key executives in all Group locations and a share option scheme which can be rolled out on a broader basis to both management and the wider employee base at all Group locations.
Remuneration policy for executive directors Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the highest calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management: basic annual salary: benefitsinkind: annual bonus payments, which cannot exceed 100% of salary: share incentives: and pension arrangements.
Basic salary An executive directors basic salary is reviewed by the committee prior to 1 July, which is the start of the salary year, and should an individual change position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up to date information on a comparator group of companies of similar size and complexity.
Executive directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the AGM.
The salaries were reviewed on 1 July 2009.
The remuneration committee discussed the review for the executive directors and were mindful of the large increases in 2008 following the benchmarking exercise and the general mood of the investor community towards directors remuneration.
As a result of these discussions the committee agreed to recommend to the Board that there would be no increase in the remuneration of the executive directors.
On the recommendation of the remuneration committee the Board decided to maintain the salaries effective 1 July 2009.
Salaries were agreed in Sterling and Euros as shown below: 2009 2010 2008 2009 annual rate annual rate Payable in Sterling Iain Dorrity 300,000 300,000 Peter Finnegan 250,000 250,000 John Sleeman 50,000 50,000 Maarten Henderson 100,000 100,000 Payable in Euros Hubert Aulich 219,095 219,095 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 PV Crystalox Solar PLC 29 Directors Remuneration Report Benefits-in-kind Executive directors receive either a Company expensed motor vehicle commensurate with their seniority or a monthly car allowance.
All other benefitsinkind are available to all employees dependent upon local conditions in their country of employment.
Annual bonus payment An executive director may receive by way of further remuneration a bonus calculated in accordance with Schedule 1 of their contract of service.
There is no contractual right to receive a bonus until it is declared in writing in respect of the financial year to which it relates and such bonus whether declared or not shall not be payable unless the executive director is employed on the date of payment.
At the AGM in May 2009 a new bonus plan with deferred share element for executive directors was approved by the Companys shareholders in the context of bringing the arrangements more in line with market practice and aligning executive directors pay more closely with the interests of the Companys shareholders.
The existing bonus scheme was replaced by a scheme which allows the executive directors to receive a bonus, based in part upon the Companys earnings and in part upon an increase in earnings per share, subject to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
Half of each bonus will be payable in cash and the other half deferred and payable in shares under a new deferred share plan the Executive Directors Deferred Share Plan which will vest after three years.
Awards of deferred shares under the Executive Directors Deferred Share Plan will be satisfied on vesting by the transfer of shares from the existing PV Crystalox Solar PLC Employee Benefit Trust.
The trust has already acquired and will from time to time continue to acquire shares that will be available for award to employees including executive directors.
The following formula is used to calculate the bonus based on the Companys earnings profit attributable to equity holders of the parent : Net profit up Net profit in to first excess of 50 million 50 million rate % rate % Chief Executive Officer 0.084 0.42 Other executive directors 0.070 0.35 During 2008 the bonus scheme allowed a bonus of up to a maximum of 50% of the basic salary subject to deductions for tax and national insurance paid to the executive in June each year subject to the Group having achieved growth in its earnings per share over the previous financial year.
The payout in respect of earnings per share growth under both schemes is the same, in 2008 this amount is paid out in cash and under the 2009 scheme half of the amount is paid in cash and the other half deferred and payable in shares under the Executive Directors Deferred Share Plan.
The payout is calculated according to the following formula: Earnings per share Bonus % growth % over prior year of salary 10% 50% 9% to 10% 45% 8% to 9% 40% 7% to 8% 35% 6% to 7% 30% 5% to 6% 25% 4% to 5% 20% 3% to 4% 15% 2% to 3% 10% 1% to 2% 5% 0% to 1% 0% Pension arrangements The executive directors contracts of service set out their basic salaries from which contributions can be made into the Crystalox Group Personal Pension Scheme or such other pension plan suitable to the executive and his country of residence.
Accordingly, pension contributions made by the Group are included in the basic salary set out in the service contracts.
