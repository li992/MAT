None of the award shares will vest if EPS growth over the three-year period is less than 40% The Committee sets performance conditions each time an award is made under the long-term incentive plans.
EPS growth and TSR are the two performance measures previously applied to the LTIP, the ExEPP and, should it be used, the ESOP.
EPS growth remains substantially within the control of management and therefore the Committee continues to consider it an appropriate measure of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
TSR measures the return on a notional investment in a company over a given period.
TSR is determined by regard to the index measuring the growth in a companys shares price over a period, with the index assuming any dividends paid are reinvested in that companys shares on a net basis on the ex-dividend date.
TSR can be a useful measure of a companys performance relative to others within a selected comparator group.
The vesting schedule above shows how each half of an award could vest at the end of the relevant three-year performance period under the EPS and the TSR performance conditions.
Performance Multiplier Plan awards for 2009 have a stretching EPS performance condition.
The comparator group for 2009 comprised Accenture: Atos Origin: Capgemini: Capita: CGI Group, Computer Sciences Corporation: Dassault Systems: Group Steria: IBM: Infosys Technologies: Indra Sistemas: Misys: Ordina: Sage: SAP: Sopra Group: TietoEnator and Unisys.
