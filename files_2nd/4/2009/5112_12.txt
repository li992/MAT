Executive Director and senior executive salary levels 2 The Company has experienced issues over the retention of members of the Board and Executive Management Team.
Accordingly, with effect Review of the Chairmans fees from 15 May 2009, a number of changes were made to the contractual Annual bonus awards for the financial year ended 30 September 2008 arrangements with the Chief Executive to facilitate retention and a period of continuity.

The report has been prepared in accordance with incentive arrangements and, in particular, the balance between short and the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large long-term incentives in light of the circumstances prevailing each year.
46 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED In response to the difficult trading conditions experienced in the airline industry during the financial year ended 30 September 2008, the Company completed an extensive shareholder consultation prior to the 2009 Annual General Meeting to amend LTIP performance targets applying to future awards.
This enabled the LTIP to take into account the unique short-term challenges that required effective management at the same time as retaining a long-term focus on return on equity ROE which remains a key long-term performance indicator at easyJet.
For the current financial year, the LTIP has again been amended with ROE once more becoming the sole measure of long-term performance as has been the case prior to the financial year under review.
Full details of the targets set for the year under review and those that will apply for awards made to the senior executive team in the current financial year are set out below.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior executives will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and the Committee takes due account of issues of general operational risk when structuring incentives.
The Committee takes account of risk by regular liaison with the Audit Committee to ensure that the remuneration policies adopted do not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.
When setting remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and senior executives for the current financial year, the Committee considered pay and employment conditions elsewhere within easyJet.
The Committee was informed of the proposed salary budget for easyJet as a whole and the changes to pay practices and staffing levels that took place during the year.
These factors were significant contributory factors when determining Executive Directors pay packages for the current year.
The Committee did not consider it appropriate, for example, to award any salary increases for Executive Directors when very limited salary increases were given to other staff.
easyJets normal remuneration policies are summarised below: Element Purpose Policy Delivery Basic salary Reflect the value of the individual and Reviewed annually, effective Cash their role 1 October Paid monthly Reflect skills and experience Agreed when previous results are Pensionable finalised Benchmarked against similar sized companies and industry comparators Targeted at or around median Considers individual contribution Annual bonus Incentivise year on year delivery of Major measure is profit before tax Paid as cash short-term performance goals aligned to long-term targets Not pensionable Other measures based on: May defer up to half of bonus into Revenue LTIP Cost Operational excellence Long Term Incentive Plan Aligned to business plan Subject to stretching ROE targets Annual grant of performance shares Incentivise long-term growth in Subject to 175% of salary Opportunity to defer bonus and easyJets ROE shareholding requirement obtain future matching share awards Pension Provide minimum retirement benefits Defined contribution Monthly employer contribution of 7% of basic salary Opportunity for Executive to HMRC approved salary sacrifice contribute to their retirement arrangement Non contributory Salary sacrifice for employee contributions The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Companys Non Executive Directors, with Non Executive Directors exempting themselves from discussions and voting as appropriate.
When determining the remuneration of Non Executive Directors, account is taken of practice adopted in other similar organisations, committees chaired and anticipated time commitment.
47 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Basic salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and are set taking account of the salary required to deliver an overall total package that reflects a number of factors including: practice adopted in companies of a broadly similar size a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business the competitive environment pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere within easyJet Annual bonus scheme All Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive during the year was 200% of salary, with a 100% of salary maximum for other senior executives.
The maximum will remain at these levels during the financial year ending 30 September 2010.
Bonus targets are aligned with easyJets vision and values, with specific targets around easyJets key performance indicators.
The performance targets that will apply to Executive Directors annual bonus opportunities in the financial year ending 30 September 2010 are as follows: Measure % maximum bonus opportunity Profit before tax 75% Customer targets 10% Operating costs 10% On time performance 5% Descriptions of the Executive Directors performance against the targets set for the year under review are set out in the emoluments table on pages 50 to 51.
Long term incentive plan The easyJet LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and matching shares.
The plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005 and amended at the 2008 AGM with the performance targets further amended during the year under review.
The annual award limit for performance shares is 200% of basic salary.
Matching share awards are linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus into easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
This is the same as in the financial year ended 30 September 2008.
No matching awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 September 2009.
Performance and matching share awards vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the Company achieving the ROE targets.
This measure was chosen as it is a fundamental measure of financial performance and is linked to the generation of shareholder returns.
The Board controls the rate of capital growth and balance sheet gearing, which ensures that ROE remains an appropriate measure of long-term performance.
The targets that applied during the year under review were amended to include short-term targets which reflected current circumstances.
This was considered appropriate due to the difficulties that existed in relation to setting robust long-term targets at a time of exceptional fuel price volatility and uncertain economic circumstances.
easyJets major shareholders and the shareholder protection bodies were consulted on the revisions which are set out under the Executive Directors Share Awards table on page 52.
48 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED LTIP awards to be granted in 2010 Since the Committee now considers it possible to set robust long-term ROE performance targets there will not be a short-term performance element to the targets that will apply during the current financial year.
Instead, the conditions will mirror the structure approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM.
Reverting to the same structure of target as operated immediately following the 2008 AGM is consistent with the future award policy communicated to our major shareholders during the 2009 consultation with the actual target ranges reflecting current economic conditions.
The targets for awards to be made in financial year 2010 with a base year of 30 September 2009 will be: Awards up to 100% of salary Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity year ending 30 September 2012 9.0% 12.0% 15.0% Awards over 100% of salary Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity year ending 30 September 2012 11.0% 13.0% 15.0% ROE continues to be the Committees preferred long-term performance measure for a number of reasons, including: It is a fundamental measure of easyJets underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders It is directly connected to the self-sustaining growth rate of the business and incentivises management to achieve the appropriate balance between growth and returns, to deliver the best shareholder value The performance targets detailed above that apply to the part of an award over 100% of salary are set to be tougher due to the higher potential quantum available.
All employee share plan participation easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Company by the use of a Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Plan.
Take-up of the schemes remains very positive with over 80% of eligible staff now participating in one or more of the plans.
Executive Directors may also participate in these plans which are summarised in the Corporate Responsibility section on page 31.
Previous share awards Executive Share Option Scheme The LTIP replaced the existing Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes the ESOS as the primary long term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and other senior employees although the ESOS was retained for flexibility e. g. options were granted to the Chief Executive under the ESOS on his appointment in 2005.
However, there were no grants during the year and there is no current intention to make regular grants of options under the ESOS.
Shareholding guideline Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 175% of basic salary.
This was increased from 100% of salary following the 2008 AGM.
For senior executives who report to the Executive Management Team and receive LTIP awards, a 50% share ownership guideline will apply.
Pension contributions easyJet makes a contribution for Executive Directors, to a defined contribution pension scheme, of 7% of basic salary.
While individuals are not obliged to make a contribution, easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company paid pension contributions.
Where individuals exchange salary this reduces easyJets National Insurance contributions.
easyJet credits half of this saving to the individuals pension currently 6.4% of the amount exchanged.
External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to accept one appointment on an external board or committee so long as this is not deemed to interfere with the business of the Group.
Any fees received in respect of these appointments are retained directly by the relevant Executive Director.
49 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Service contracts The service contracts of the Executive Directors that served during the year were of no fixed term.
Andrew Harrisons service contract is terminable by the Company giving 12 months notice or by Andrew giving six months notice.
Provisions applying to termination prior to 31 March 2010 On termination of Andrews employment he will receive a pro-rated bonus for the year of his termination based on performance up to the date of his termination.
In addition, the Company has the right to pay Andrew, in lieu of notice and on a monthly basis until he secures commensurate employment, an amount equal to base salary, pension and bonus earned in the previous year.
Provisions applying to termination or resignation after 31 March 2010 In order to facilitate retention and a period of continuity, Andrew Harrisons contractual provisions on termination and resignation were revised on 15 May 2009.
The revised terms provide that in relation to a termination by the Company other than for certain defined bad leaver reasons or on resignation, Andrew Harrison has an entitlement to receive a payment in lieu of notice in respect of the full 12 month notice period with no obligation to mitigate the payment, which would also be provided as a single lump sum.
The payment in lieu of notice would include the value of 12 months basic salary, 12 months pension contributions and the on target level of annual bonus of 100% of salary.
Based on the current level of salary this would amount to 1,220,000.
He would also receive a pro-rated bonus for the year of his termination based on performance up to the date of his termination.
In addition, it was agreed that Andrew Harrison would be considered a good leaver for the LTIP award made in December 2007, subject to the usual pro-rating for performance and service.
This is explained on page 54.
Jeff Carrs contract was changed during the year under review, in line with a new policy for Executive Directors, to be terminable on 12 months notice by both parties formerly six months.
Jeff resigned during the year and his resignation was effective on 25 September 2009.
There were no express provisions for compensation on termination in Jeffs service contract.
No payment was made, or will be made, in relation to his departure.
The Companys relationship with its Non Executive Directors is governed by letters of appointment.
The Non Executive Directors are appointed for a period not exceeding three years and their appointment may be terminated with three months notice without compensation.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou does not have a letter of appointment and his appointment is of no fixed term.
He is however subject to re-election by shareholders every three years, and was last re-elected by shareholders in February 2009, although this does not prejudice his rights under the relationship agreement with the Company disclosed at the time of the Companys IPO, which are set out in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual report on page 40.
Details of the service contracts and letters of appointment currently in place for Directors who served during the year are as follows: Date of current Provision for letter of appointment Unexpired term Notice period compensation Executive Andrew Harrison 15 September 2005 n a 12 months 12 months 6 months amended 15 May 2009 from executive Jeff Carr resigned 25 September 2009 24 November 2004 n a 12 months fro m 6 months 3 December 2008 Non Executive Sir Colin Chandler resigned 1 July 2009 26 September 2007 n a 3 months None Sir David Michels 26 September 2007 12 months 3 months None Sir Michael Rake appointed 1 June 2009 17 April 2009 2 years 9 months 3 months None Dawn Airey resigned 31 December 2008 26 September 2007 n a 3 months None David Bennett 26 September 2007 12 months 3 months None Sven Boinet 11 February 2008 1 year 5 months 3 months None John Browett 27 September 2007 12 months 3 months None Professor Rigas Doganis 26 September 2007 12 months 3 months None Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou n a n a n a n a Keith Hamill appointed 1 March 2009 23 December 2008 2 years 5 months 3 months None Bob Rothenberg appointed 1 August 2009 29 July 2009 2 years 10 months 3 months None Non Executive Directors letters of appointment are aligned to the standard terms appended to the Combined Code.
Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment are available on request from the Company Secretary.
50 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED Total shareholder return Given the nature of easyJets operations, the Committee does not consider that there is a suitable comparator group against which to measure total shareholder return.
However, for completeness, the following graphs show the Companys performance compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 1 and that of a group of European Airlines.
The FTSE 250 has been chosen as it consists of companies of similar size to easyJet.
The group of European Airlines comprises companies operating in a comparable sector.
Note 1: British Airways, Lufthansa-Swiss, Ryanair, Air France-KLM and Iberia have been included in the comparative European Airlines group.
Directors emoluments audited Details of emoluments, paid or payable by easyJet to the Directors of easyJet plc who served in the financial year ended 30 September 2009 are as follows: Pension contributions Salary fee Bonus Total Total 2009 2009 2009 2008 2009 2008 Executive Andrew Harrison 590 1,043 1,633 856 53 41 Jeff Carr resigned 25 September 2009 356 356 441 27 25 Non Executive Sir Colin Chandler resigned 1 July 2009 150 150 201 Sir David Michels 114 114 65 Sir Michael Rake appointed 1 June 2009 23 23 Dawn Airey resigned 31 December 2008 11 11 45 David Bennett 55 55 55 Sven Boinet 45 45 26 John Browett 45 45 45 Professor Rigas Doganis 45 45 45 Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou Keith Hamill appointed 1 March 2009 29 29 Diederik Karsten resigned 21 February 2008 18 Bob Rothenberg appointed 1 August 2009 8 8 1,471 1,043 2,514 1,797 80 66 The table above excludes gains as a result of the exercise of share options.
Details of share options and share awards and any movements during the year are shown on page 52.
Pension contributions for Andrew Harrison and Jeff Carr shown above are greater than 7% of salary as they include half of the National Insurance saving resulting from employee contributions made through easyJets salary exchange scheme equivalent to 6.4% of the sum sacrificed.
Andrew Harrison exchanged 195,000 for additional pension contributions in the year 2008: 187,000 and Jeff Carr exchanged a total of 27,000 2008: 27,000.
There was a pay freeze in place during the year under review for Executive Directors and the wider senior management population.
Andrew Harrisons salary remained at 590,000 and Jeff Carrs salary remained at 360,000.
It is not proposed that basic salary will be increased for Executive Directors in the 2010 financial year.
51 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Achievement of Bonus for 2009 Andrew Harrison will be paid a bonus of 1,042,530 177% of salary in the year ending 30 September 2010 to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2009 2008: 45% of salary.
Jeff Carr resigned on 25 September 2009 and will not be paid a bonus for the year ended 30 September 2009.
This bonus was earned against challenging targets that were set at the start of the financial year under review.
These targets reflected the key short-term objectives of the business arising out of the exceptional fuel price volatility and economic uncertainty that was prevalent at the start of the financial year.
Performance over the year was stronger than the target expectations set at the beginning of the year and resulted in the bonus earned being towards the top end of the bonus range.
In a difficult consumer environment, a strong revenue performance helped to offset an increase in unit fuel costs equivalent to 86.1 million and the Committee is satisfied that easyJets performance is robust in relation to other airlines.
Bonuses were determined by the Remuneration Committee in light of the Companys performance against a range of key financial and operational metrics.
Performance achievement against these key performance indicators is shown below: Directors interests The following Directors hold direct interests in the share capital of easyJet: 30 September 2009 30 September 2008 Sir David Michels 12,100 12,100 Sir Michael Rake 3,100 David Bennett 10,000 10,000 John Browett 4,705 4,705 Professor Rigas Doganis 13,600 13,600 Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou 66,076,451 66,076,451 Andrew Harrison 442,711 682,616 The interests of Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou are held through easyGroup Holdings Limited.
On 12 October 2009, Andrew Harrison purchased 31 partnership shares and was allocated 31 matching shares under the Share Incentive Plan.
On 10 November 2009, Andrew Harrison purchased 34 partnership shares and was allocated 34 matching shares under the Share Incentive Plan.
52 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED Executive Directors are deemed to be interested in the shares held by the easyJet UK Employee Share Ownership Trust, the easyJet Overseas Employee Share Ownership Trust, the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan Trust the Trusts.
At 30 September 2009, ordinary shares held in the Trusts were as follows: Number Share Incentive Plan Trust unallocated as employees are not entitled to these shares until the performance conditions attached to them are met 1,883,799 Total unallocated 1,883,799 Long Term Incentive Plan allocated 292,012 Share Incentive Plan allocated 150,872 Total held by UK Trust allocated 9,229 Total held by Overseas Trust allocated 44,872 Total allocated 496,985 2,380,784 Directors share awards audited Details of share options and share awards under the schemes described above granted to the Directors of the Company and any movements during the year are shown in the following table: Andrew Harrison No.
No Non Executive Director has been granted any share options or awards.
The closing share price of the Companys ordinary shares at 30 September 2009 was 3.79 and the range during the year ended 30 September 2009 was 2.06 to 4.04.

As is usual market practice, the option price for SAYE awards is determined by the Committee in advance of the award, by reference to the share price following announcements of results.
Note 2: Participants purchase shares monthly under the plan and the company provides one matching share for each share purchased.
These are first available for vesting three years after purchase.
The potential vesting of outstanding awards if the performance were based at the end of the year under review is shown at the end of this section.
The performance criteria for vesting of these share options and awards are as follows: Discretionary Share Option Schemes A&B Based on the average annual growth in earnings per share EPS, where no shares vest if EPS growth is less than RPI plus 5%, 30% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 5% and 100% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 20%.
Straight-line vesting will occur between these points.
In relation to the provision, the Committee agreed on 15 May 2009 to facilitate Andrew Harrisons continued service at easyJet and agreed to exercise its discretion to extend the period for which his vested share options can be exercised to six months from the termination date.
Long Term Incentive Plan C&D Awards prior to those made during the year under review were subject to the achievement of the following ROE targets: Threshold Target Maximum Grant date Basis year 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests December 2005 30 September 2006 8.4% 8.8% 10.0% 30 September 200711.8% 12.4%13.0% 30 September 200812.5% 13.2%15.0% December 2006 30 September 2009 12.5% 14.0% 16.5% December 2007 30 September 2010 12.5% 14.0% 16.5% February 2008 30 September 2010 13.5% 15.5% 17.5% Straight-line vesting will occur between the threshold, target and maximum targets set out above.
The returns on equity shown for the February 2008 grant relate to awards in excess of 100% of basic salary.
The December 2006 award is due to vest in December 2009.
The award has performance targets relating to return on equity achieved in the year ended 30 September 2009.
However, the targets have not been met and the award will not vest.
The performance conditions that applied to the awards made during the year under review retained ROE as the primary measure of long-term performance.
However, to enable the LTIP to take into account the unique short-term challenges that the airline industry was subject to during the year under review, additional short-term targets were also set for part of the awards.
The actual targets set reflected the extensive discussions that were undertaken with easyJets major shareholders and the shareholder protection bodies.
Both the range of ROE targets set and the short-term targets were felt to take full account of both i the exceptional volatility in the price of oil and ii economic uncertainty triggered by the banking crisis.
54 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED The actual targets that applied to the awards of performance shares made to Executive Directors during the year under review were as follows: Awards up to 100% of salary Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity year ending 30 September 2011 7.0% 10.0% 13.0% Awards between 100% and 175% of salary Vesting will take place based on the satisfaction of both of the following two targets: The award is subject to scale-back to the extent that a range of performance targets relating to the year ended 30 September 2009 are not met.
Achievement of these targets, at 88.35%, was equal to the percentage of bonus payable, and so the award has been scaled back by 11.65%.
ROE for the year ending 30 September 2011 must be at least 10% in order for the remaining award to vest.
No matching shares were granted in the year under review.
To facilitate a period of continuity and the retention of Andrew Harrisons services to the Company, in May 2009 it was agreed that Andrew Harrison would be treated as a good leaver in respect of the LTIP award performance and matching shares granted in December 2007 upon his departure from easyJet, provided his service is to continue to 31 March 2010.
The maximum number of performance and matching shares covered by this change is 193,325.
Any vesting would be subject to pro-rating for both performance and service.
Based on performance for the year ended 30 September 2009, none of these shares would vest.
With regard to future long-term incentive plan targets, it was agreed with investors during consultation that easyJet would revert to using ROE as the sole performance metric as soon as it was felt practicable to do so e. g. once fuel price volatility had returned to more normal levels.
As a result, the performance targets that are to apply to awards made in the current year will be based on challenging ROE targets alone.
These targets are considered to take into full account the current economic environment.
Chief Executive Officer Recruitment Award E 50% of the award is based on the average annual growth in EPS.
No shares vest if EPS growth is less than RPI plus 5%, 30% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 5% and 100% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 20%.
Straight-line vesting occurs between these points.
Potential vesting of outstanding awards The table below shows how vesting of outstanding share awards plans would take place if the performance was based on that for the year under review.
