Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises all of the Directors of the Company and is chaired by Mr JP Williams.
The Committee met once during the year to review the remuneration of Mr MEDA Walton and in light of his commitment and effort in the current year regarding a number of one-off events including the Zero Dividend Preference share issue and the new bank facilities, it was agreed that he should receive a one-off payment of 20,000.
The basic Directors fee for each Director is 35,000 per annum with an additional fee of 115,000 per annum for the Chairman of the Company.
An additional fee of 6,000 per annum is payable to the Chairman of the Audit, the Valuations and the Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
Separate additional fees of 3,000 per annum are payable to the non-Chairman members of the Valuations Committee.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The policy of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee is that remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to attract Directors to properly oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 30 September 2010 and subsequent years.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee relies mainly on general salary surveys in respect of its consideration of the level of Directors remuneration.
The total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions in the Articles of Association and by shareholders resolutions.
Directors Service Contracts None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company.
No arrangements have been entered into between the Company and the Directors to entitle any of the Directors to compensation for loss of office.
Total Shareholder Return The graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return over the five financial years to 30 September 2009 with the FTSE All-Share Index.
