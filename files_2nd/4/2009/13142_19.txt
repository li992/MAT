Directors remuneration report Introduction from Remuneration Committee Chairman Given the backdrop of the challenging year and volatile business environment described by the Chairman and the CEO, the Remuneration Committee has been actively engaged in the review and management of all of our executive compensation programmes.
First we decided for a second year in a row that there will be no increases in base salaries, except for Erik Engstrom who received a promotional increase on his appointment as CEO of Reed Elsevier.
The continuing volatile economic environment makes the setting of targets and management of performance within a narrow range significantly more difficult.
Therefore, our second action was a decision to flatten the payout slope in the annual incentive plan for 2010.
This means that a smaller bonus would start to accrue for achieving 94% of target and the level of outperformance required to earn a bonus in excess of target has been substantially increased.
In addition, the Committee has determined that for 2010, executive directors will only be able to earn the target bonus if 2010 profit performance exceeds 2009.
The target and maximum bonus opportunities remain unchanged.
Finally, during the year the Committee reviewed the long-term incentive arrangements in the context of the significant changes in the senior leadership team, a challenging business environment with the late cycle impact on our professional markets and Reed Elseviers strategy.
The review resulted in the formulation of a set of proposals for new long-term incentive LTI arrangements on which we consulted with some 30 major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies in the UK, the Netherlands and the US in early 2010.
The input and feedback received during the consultation process shaped the LTI arrangements for which we will be seeking shareholder approval at the Annual General Meetings in April.
The new arrangements are designed to drive sustainable performance in the longer term by focusing on a balance of returns and earnings metrics that hold the executives accountable for the delivery of the strategy.
A detailed description of the new arrangements is set out in the notes to the notices of the Annual General Meetings of shareholders.
In developing the LTI proposals, the Committee was sensitive to and mindful of the need to ensure that the level of the overall incentive opportunity available under the new proposals remains within the parameters of the incentive framework previously approved by shareholders.
In other matters, standard terms and conditions were applied to the retirement of Sir Crispin Davis and the departure of Ian Smith.
Sir Crispins terms were reported in last years remuneration report.
The payment for loss of office provided to Ian Smith, who resigned by mutual agreement, was limited to base salary and benefits.
In accordance with policy, part of the payment for loss of office is subject to mitigation.
All of his share-based incentives lapsed on termination.
As in previous years, our approach to preparing this report has been to meet the highest standards of disclosure, balancing relevant requirements in the UK and the Netherlands, whilst aiming to produce a clear and understandable report.
