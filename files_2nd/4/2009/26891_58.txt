The Merchants Trust PLC Directors Remuneration Report This report is submitted in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 for the year ended 31 January 2009.
The Board The Board of Directors is composed solely of non-executive Directors and the determination of the Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the whole Board.
The Board has not been provided with advice or services by any person to assist it to make its remuneration decisions, although the Directors carry out reviews from time to time of the fees paid to the directors of other investment trusts.
Policy on Directors Remuneration No Director has a service contract with the Company.
The Companys policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears.
There are no long term incentive schemes, bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits and fees are not related to the individual Directors performance, nor to the performance of the Board as a whole.
The Companys Articles of Association limit the aggregate fees payable to the Board of Directors to a total of 150,000 per annum.
Subject to this overall limit, it is the Boards policy to determine the level of Directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to non-executive Directors in the investment trust industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfil, and the time committed to the Companys affairs.
The Board believes that levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract and retain non-executive directors to oversee the Company.
Directors and officers liability insurance cover is held by the Company.
Following the approval of the proposal at last years Annual General Meeting to change the Companys Articles of Association to enable the Company to grant indemnities to the Directors individually, deeds of indemnity have been entered into with the Directors.
Remuneration The policy is to review Directors fees from time to time, but reviews will not necessarily result in a change to the rates.
In accordance with this policy the Board reviewed the fees during the year and agreed not to increase the fees at that time.
As disclosed in last years report, with effect from 1 June 2008 the Directors were paid at a rate of 18,000 per annum, with an additional 3,000 payable to the Audit Committee Chairman, and the Chairman of the Board was paid at a rate of 27,500 per annum.
Prior to that, since June 2006, the rates were: 15,000 for the Directors, with an additional 2,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and 25,000 for the Chairman of the Board.
