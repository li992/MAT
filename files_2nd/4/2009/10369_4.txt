Directors remuneration report Overview Business review Dear Shareholder As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report on Directors remuneration for the year to 31 May 2009.
This past year has been one of transformational change for the Company during which we entered the second phase of our turnaround strategy and completed the signi cant transaction with Allscripts.
As detailed in the Chief Executives report, Misys has developed a exible business model, which has delivered growth even in this dif cult market environment.
The changes implemented in 2008 09 have served us well and provide a robust framework for executive remuneration in Misys, enabling us to continue to attract and retain the best people in our challenging business environment.
The focus of our remuneration practices remains on performance-related remuneration.
In line with the majority of our employees, the Chief Executive and Executive Vice Presidents EVPs have not received base salary increases for 2009 10.
The implementation of the executive and senior manager remuneration architecture agreed by shareholders in 2008 has proved successful and we are pleased to be making awards of bonus matching shares for the first time in 2009.
These awards link share vesting to the delivery of stretching medium-term revenue and operating pro t goals, which complement the longer term earnings per share growth targets in the long-term share incentive plans.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these performance metrics help focus executives on achieving the challenging goals which build shareholder value.
I hope that you will endorse the policies as outlined in our report.
