Report of the Directors Remuneration report Introduction This years Remuneration report is prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 S. I.
2008 410 the Regulations and will be subject to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting the AGM to be held on 17 November 2009.
The key issues to be aware of this year are: 1.
Executive Directors did not receive a salary increase in 2008 and will not be receiving one in 2009.
The Companys final salary pension scheme was closed with effect from 30 June 2009.
No annual bonuses have been paid despite the achievement of cash management targets.
Annual bonus potential has been reduced for the financial year ending 30 June 2010 compared to the financial year ended 30 June 2009.
A bonus clawback provision has been introduced to any annual bonuses paid and to any options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS in respect of the current and future years, subject in the case of HMRC approved options, to the approval of HMRC.
As performance targets have not been met, the Long-Term Performance Plan LTPP award granted in 2006 did not vest.
A t the 2008 AGM, shareholders approved the ESOS and Executive Directors were granted share options under this new ESOS.
These had a lower expected value than the previous LTPP awards.
I n 2009, the Remuneration Committee the Committee will again grant share options rather than LTPP awards, which will have Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Per Share EPS performance conditions.
Remuneration Committee The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for: determining and reviewing the overall remuneration policy of the Company with regard to attracting, retaining and motivating Directors and senior managers of the experience and calibre required: determining and reviewing executive remuneration policy, including the terms and conditions of employment for Executive Directors and their individual remuneration packages: making recommendations to the Board in relation to the remuneration of the Chairman: agreeing targets and benefits in respect of performance related pay schemes for all employees: approving the rules of and the basis of participation in Group share options, long-term performance plans and cash-based bonus incentive schemes and the specific awards, grants and payments made under any such schemes: determining the policy for and scope of pension arrangements for Executive Directors and senior management: agreeing severance arrangements or other compensation for loss of office or early retirement for all employees: the evaluation of Executive Director performance with regard to the award of share incentives, annual bonus and other performance-based remuneration: and obtaining independent professional advice in relation to senior executive remuneration.
The Terms of Reference for the Committee are available from the Companys website at www.
Membership and proceedings of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee during the financial year were Mr R J Davies Chairman, Mr R A Lawson, Mr W Shannon and Mr R MacEachrane.
Mr R A Lawson joined the Committee on 1 July 2008 and Miss T E Bamford joined the Committee on 1 July 2009.
The Committee met on three occasions during the financial year and attendance at each of these meetings is described on page 36 of the Report of the Directors.
All Committee members are considered to be independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committees decisions.
The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered.
The Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue with institutional investors.
In determining future remuneration policy, it will consider both the shareholders vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice The Committee received input into their decision making from Mr M S Clare, the Group Chief Executive, Mrs J Mee, the Group Human Resources Director, and Mr L Dent, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.
Mr L Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee.
In addition, independent advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, advised the Committee in relation to changes to the Companys remuneration policy and on the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements.
Hewitt New Bridge Street did not provide any additional services to the Company.
Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 43 Report of the Directors | Remuneration report Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pension issues and, with effect from 10 July 2004, was appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration policy Each year the Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the context of the business environment, best practice and market trends for the current and subsequent financial years.
The underlying principles remain the same, namely, the Committee believes that executive remuneration should: be fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders: reward the sustained growth and profitability of the business: and conform with market-leading best practice.
The Committee has the discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In addition, the Committee does take into account environmental, social and governance risks when setting any incentive structures for senior management in order to mitigate the possibility of the incentive structures motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Committee also considers the level of pay throughout the Group when setting Executive Directors remuneration.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of the business is determined in no short measure by the skill and commitment of the Executive Team.
The reward policy for Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors of a high calibre within the industrys highly competitive employment market.
Within these broad objectives, the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles: the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets: currently over 50% of the total executive remuneration package is performance based: performance-related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets based on measures of shareholder return.
With the exception of the share options granted in 2008, which were based on a return on capital employed performance metric, the Committees policy is to use a combination of TSR and EPS performance conditions: and total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector.
The remuneration package for Executive Directors The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises: basic salary: annual performance related bonus: long-term share incentives: and pension and other benefits.
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all Executive Directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic salary Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.
Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities, skills and experience and to competitive market practice for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies and also for companies comprising the FTSE 250.
In light of the prevailing market conditions there are no current plans to increase salaries for any employees across the business, including Executive Directors, for the financial year ending 30 June 2010.
Therefore salaries with effect from 1 July 2009 remain as follows: 1 July 2009 1 July 2008 per annum per annum Mr M S Clare 630,000 630,000 Mr M A Pain 350,000 350,000 Mr D F Thomas 400,000 Mr S J Boyes 350,000 350,000 Mr C Fenton 350,000 350,000 Mr M A Pain stepped down from the Board on 21 July 2009.
Mr D F Thomas joined the Board on 21 July 2009.
44 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Report of the Directors | Remuneration report Annual bonus The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business set annually by the Board, including cash generation, operating profit, health and safety, customer service, employee engagement and personal targets.
For the financial year ending 30 June 2010 the Executive Directors maximum bonus has been reduced to 100% of salary 180% of salary in previous years and the target bonus has been lowered from 130% to 75% of basic salary.
The Committee has retained a general discretion in the making of bonus payments, and will consider, among other factors, the underlying financial performance of the business relative to the sector.
The Committee has decided that for any bonuses paid in respect of the financial year ending 30 June 2010 and later years it will retain a power of clawback.
This can be invoked if: a it is necessary to restate the Companys accounts used to calculate a participants bonus, in circumstances where the original over-statement has led to a bonus being paid which would not otherwise have been paid: or b the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in connection with his employment and this related to an act which led to a bonus being paid to him or her.
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that bonuses will be retrospectively recalculated and, if bonus monies have been paid, the participant will be required to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the total amount of the net bonus paid less any bonus that the Committee determines would have been paid regardless of the event in question.
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable.
For the financial year ended 30 June 2009, despite the achievement of the cash management and other non-profit targets, the Committee accepted the managements proposal that no annual bonus should be paid.
In January 2009, it was announced that Mr M A Pain would be stepping down as Executive and Group Finance Director.
On 21 July 2009, Mr D F Thomas took over as Group Finance Director and, in order to ensure an orderly handover of responsibilities, Mr M A Pain agreed to continue his employment with the Group until 31 October 2009.
In consideration of the extension to his remaining in employment beyond his required notice period, the Company agreed to make a one-off payment of 100,000 to Mr M A Pain on 31 October 2009, subject to his employment remaining valid until that date.
Mr M A Pains salary and benefits will continue as normal up until 31 October 2009.
Co-Investment Plan The Co-Investment Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005 and any annual bonus earned above target will normally be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan.
The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan.
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum of four for one for voluntary deferral: matching awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a period of three years.
The relevant performance conditions are the same as those used for the LTPP, as detailed below.
Because the maximum annual bonus for the year ending 30 June 2010 has been reduced to 100% of salary there will be no compulsory deferral of annual bonus into the Plan for this year.
As no bonus is payable for the financial year ended 30 June 2009, no awards will be granted this year under the Plan.
Long-Term Performance Plan The LTPP was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2003.
No LTPP awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 June 2009 and the Committee is not proposing to grant any LTPP awards for the financial year ending 30 June 2010.
Instead the Committee has used and will use the ESOS as described on page 46.
Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year.
Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45 Report of the Directors | Remuneration report Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.
There is no re-testing of performance conditions.
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth.
The Committee considers these targets to be the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of the awards, as they are fundamental measures of the Groups underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
The TSR portion of the awards made in 2006 uses a comparator group comprising listed housebuilders as follows: Berkeley Group, Bellway, Bovis Homes Group, Redrow, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey.
For awards made in 2007, the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award comprises those companies, excluding investment trusts, ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index.
For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total award will vest if the Companys TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper quartile or above against the TSR of the comparator group.
10% of the total award will vest if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median.
The award will vest on a straight-line basis between the upper and lower targets.
For awards made in 2006 and 2007, the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%: for performance in between the awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
The qualifying period for the award granted in 2006 ended on 30 June 2009.
Performance of this award against the constituent TSR and EPS targets was tested after the year end and neither of the targets had been achieved.
Accordingly no part of the 2006 awards will vest.
Executive Share Option Scheme The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2008.
It was the view of the Committee that the focus on share price growth arising from the use of market value options combined with this performance condition would ensure strong alignment with shareholders.
Options were granted in December 2008 following this approval and it is intended to grant further options under the ESOS during the financial year ending 30 June 2010.
Options must normally be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years of grant.
The maximum number of shares over which an employee may be granted options in any financial year under the ESOS will be limited so that the aggregate cost of exercise does not exceed 200% of his annual salary.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee.
For options granted in 2008, 100% of the option will vest if the Return On Capital Employed ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011 reaches 14.5%, 25% of the award will vest if the ROCE reaches 10.5% and no part of the award will vest if the ROCE is below 10.5%.
There will be no opportunity to retest any performance criteria.
ROCE will be calculated as operating profit measured across the whole year to 30 June 2011 divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less any intangible assets being the average of the 12 month end figures during the same year.
The Committee considered that ROCE was the most rounded measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of this award and was satisfied that the ROCE target range represented a stretching target considering the outlook for the housebuilding market.
For options to be granted in the financial year ending 30 June 2010, 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on relative TSR, and 50% on attainment of a target to be based on EPS growth.
For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total award will vest if the Companys TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper quartile or above against the TSR of a comparator group comprising the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts, 12.5% of the total award will vest if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median.
TSR will be calculated as the percentage change in share price plus dividends over a performance period, with the opening share price averaged across the dealing days in the three-month period ending immediately before the start of the performance period and the closing share price averaged over the dealing days in the last three months of the performance period.
46 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Report of the Directors | Remuneration report The EPS element of the award will be divided into three one-year targets with the Committee setting targets annually for the forthcoming year in each year.
Performance against the EPS target for each year will be tested at the end of each year and the award will vest at the end of the three-year performance period in proportion to the level of achievement in each year against the relevant target.
The EPS for the Company will be calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
It should be noted that three one-year targets are only being used because of the current uncertain economic conditions and it is hoped that for future awards there will be greater economic certainty and that the Committee will return to the principle of using a three-year target.
Both performance conditions, once set, will be subject to an overriding Committee discretion to take into account, among other factors, performance relative to the sector and the underlying financial performance of the business including free cash flow.
The Committee chose these targets as the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the current time, as they are a fundamental measure of the Groups underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his previous employers long-term incentive and share option plans, it was agreed with Mr D F Thomas that he would be granted an one-off award that seeks to target benefits equivalent to the options granted under the ESOS in 2008.
In order to satisfy this obligation, Mr D F Thomas will be granted an option by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust and, if and when exercised, will be satisfied from ordinary shares acquired in the market.
The option will be over 666,666 ordinary shares at an exercise price per share of 55 pence.
The option will be subject to the same performance targets as the options granted under the ESOS in 2008 and will be on substantially the same terms and conditions as those options.
The Committee has decided to retain a power of clawback on any ESOS options granted during the financial year ending 30 June 2010 and later years on a similar basis to that described on page 45 relating to the payment of annual bonuses, subject in the case of HMRC approved options, to the approval of HMRC.
Share Option Plan In November 1997, the Company adopted an Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee.
No further options can be granted under the ESOP.
Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged and are set out on page 51.
The award granted to Mr S J Boyes in 2003 vested in 2006 but has not been exercised.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme The Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SRSOS was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2008.
The SRSOS was implemented in order to promote share ownership amongst all employees of the Company, linking employee benefit to the performance of the Company, and to aid retention of staff.
All employees and Executive Directors who work more than 25 hours per week and who have five or more years of continuous service, ending on the date of grant, or such shorter period as the Board may decide, with the Company, or any subsidiary in the Group nominated to join in the SRSOS, are eligible to participate in the scheme.
The Board has discretion to reduce the period of qualifying service and to invite other employees of the Group to participate.
Under the SRSOS, employees can save up to 250 per month for three or five years and receive options to purchase the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% on the market value.
During 2009, 1,792 employees 39% of those eligible applied to participate in the SRSOS.
Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009 2010 The Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009 2010 the 2009 2010 Plan has been established by the Board to enable options to be granted to senior management other than those who participate in the ESOS or LTPP to assist with their retention.
No Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 2009 2010 Plan.
Options under the 2009 2010 Plan will entitle the holder to acquire existing ordinary shares in the Company that will be purchased in the market for this purpose.
Options may not be satisfied either by the issue of new ordinary shares or by the use of ordinary shares held in treasury.
Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47 Report of the Directors | Remuneration report Because the explicit focus of the 2009 2010 Plan is staff retention, there will be no performance conditions imposed.
Awards will be targeted on an individual basis reflecting personal performance and assessment of potential under the Barratt performance management system and will vest after three years subject to continued employment with the Company.
Pension benefits The Companys pension policy for Executive Directors is that they can choose to participate in the Companys money purchase pension plan or receive a cash supplement that does not count for incentive purposes.
The Companys defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants in 2001.
Mr M S Clare is and Mr M A Pain was paid a cash supplement equal to 30% and 25%, respectively, of basic salary per annum.
It has been agreed that Mr D F Thomas will similarly receive a cash supplement of 25% of salary.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2007 showed a deficit of 87.4m calculated on the basis of the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Schemes the Scheme technical provisions.
This was updated to 30 June 2009 by a qualified independent actuary and a deficit of 31.5m is included in the Group balance sheet as shown in note 27 to the financial statements.
The Company and the Trustees of the Scheme have agreed that, with effect from 1 December 2008, the Company will pay, in addition to the joint contribution rate, 13.3m per annum for seven years to address the deficit.
On 14 April 2009, the Trustees agreed with the Company to terminate defined benefit accrual under the Scheme with effect from 30 June 2009, subject to certain conditions, and on 30 June 2009, the Company resolved to exercise its consent under the rules of the Scheme to agree to the closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
The conditions include obligations on the Company to continue paying deficit reduction contributions at a level not lower than the 13.3m agreed in December 2008 and to consult with the Trustees with regard to the funding requirements of the Scheme before the occurrence of any event materially affecting whether positively or negatively the ability of the employers to fund the Scheme which is within the control of the Company.
Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the defined contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009.
During the financial year ended 30 June 2009, Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton were members of the Companys defined benefit section of the Scheme.
This entitlement was based on a 1 60-accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 65.
The entitlement of Mr C Fenton was restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006 and thereafter was calculated by reference to his basic salary.
In lieu of the continued accrual of benefits under the Scheme, Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton are entitled to receive cash supplements equal to 30% of their basic salary per annum.
Only the basic salary element of a Directors remuneration is pensionable.
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for dependents pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.
Service contracts All Executive Directors, with the exception of Mr M A Pain, are engaged on the basis of one-year rolling contracts which can be terminated by twelve months notice given by the Company or by twelve months notice given by the Executive at any time.
Mr M A Pain, who stepped down from the Board on 21 July 2009, could, and did, terminate his contract by giving six months notice.
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination or loss of office due to a takeover bid.
The contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car and membership of a private healthcare scheme.

Barratt Developments FTSE 250 Index Index of Listed House Builders excluding Investment Trusts Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009 49 Value Report of the Directors | Remuneration report Executive Directors Shareholding Guidelines The following shareholding guidelines apply to Executive Directors: within five years of first appointment Executive Directors are expected to hold throughout their remaining period of office ordinary shares in the Company equivalent to 100% of their basic annual salary: for the purposes of determining the requisite level of each Executive Directors shareholding relative to basic salary, the share price will be that prevailing on 30 June in each year: and provided Executive Directors hold the appropriate level of shares they are at liberty to sell shares so as to realise their LTPP awards or upon the exercise of share options subject to the normal Listing Rules and Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules requirements for Director shareholdings.
Both Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton met the shareholding guidelines until the recent economic downturn which resulted in an unprecedented reduction in the share price in early 2008.
The Committee is not currently expecting Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton to purchase additional shares to respond to this temporary position on the basis that no annual bonus has been paid and the 2006 LTPP awards did not vest, and will review the position on or after 30 June 2010.

The total pension accrued is the amount that the Director would have accrued if he had left the Scheme at the end of the year, when the Scheme closed.
The increase in the pension is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Value Amendment Regulations 2008.
The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The inflation figure used of 5% is based on the change in RPI from September 2007 to September 2008, as in previous years.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
None of the Directors have any rights under the Companys money purchase pension scheme.
There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 30 June 2009 and 22 September 2009.
The Remuneration report was approved by the Board on 23 September 2009 and signed on its behalf by: R J Davies, Non-Executive Director 23 September 2009 52 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009
