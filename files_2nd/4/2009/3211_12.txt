Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the normal dividend payment date.

As at 31 December 2008, the Companys EPS growth had exceeded RPI by 25.1% and as a result 82.14% of the EPS shares allocated vested.
At the end of the performance period to 2 April 2009, the Company ranked 19th against the FTSE 100 comparator group as constituted at the start of the performance period and as a result 100% of the TSR shares vested.
Consequently, overall 91.07% of the original allocations were released to participants on 7 April 2009. ii LTIS awards made in September 2006 were subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions.
At the end of the performance period to 3 September 2009, the Company ranked 34th against the FTSE 100 comparator group as constituted at the start of the performance period and as a result 65% of the TSR shares vested.
Consequently, overall 73.57% of the original allocations were released to participants on 9 September 2009. iii Additional shares were released to reflect the value of the dividends that would have been paid over the respective three-year period.
The total shares released were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and employees National Insurance contributions NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following the sale, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2009 on page 54. iv 188,260 shares made in two equal tranches were awarded to Mark Hanafin under SLTIS as part of the terms of his appointment in 2008.

Directors pensions Of the five Executive Directors who served during 2009, Phil Bentley and Chris Weston are members of the Centrica Pension Plan CPP which was formerly known as the Centrica Management Pension Scheme CMPS.
Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centricas pension schemes.
Centrica Pension Plan CPP The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, contributory occupational pension scheme.
Its rules have the following main features: normal retirement at age 62: right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service at the Companys request after age 55: life assurance cover of four times pensionable earnings for death in service: spouses pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the members prospective pension and, on death after retirement, half of the accrued pension.
Childrens pensions on death are also payable at 25% of the members prospective pension at normal retirement age: members contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings.
Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme CUPS are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings above the scheme earnings cap: pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI a maximum of 6% applies to pension accrued after 6 April 2004 : and no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
indd 58 8 3 10 11:49:54 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme CUPS All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines.
As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP, could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance 1.75 million for the 2009 10 tax year after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time.
The CUPS provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members uncapped pensionable earnings.
The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the registered portion of members benefits.
No individuals will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere at 6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Companys Balance Sheet.

The pension accrual rates for 2009 for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston were 2.65% and 2.22% of final pensionable earnings respectively.
For Chris Weston the increase in the accrued pension covers the period since his appointment to the Board on 1 July 2009.
As at 31 December 2008 the accrued pension for Chris Weston as an employee of the Group was 68,700.
The figures shown for the increase in the accrued pension excludes inflation as the annual rate to 30 September 2009 was below the minimum of 0.0%.
This is consistent with the rate used for pension increases for the CPP and CUPS.
