In addition, the Company takes full account of the guidelines published by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds.
During the year, the Committee updated its Terms of Reference and approved the granting of awards under the Sharesave Scheme.
It also approved Directors expenses for the year and assessed and approved awards under the PSP.
A review of calculations was undertaken relating to awards made to Directors under the ABIP, and the annual base salary review for executives within the ABIP was carried out in accordance with the ABIP rules, using the 12-month average Retail Prices Index for UK executives and the Consumer Price Index for US executives and, as the result for both was below 1%, the Committee awarded a zero base salary increase.
In the light of the global financial crisis, the Committee oversaw the temporary suspension of the ABIP and introduction of the IBP, further details of which are given below.
Finally, in response to feedback from institutional investors, the Committee negotiated major changes to the Executive Directors contracts, further details of which are given below.

As previously reported, the Committee and the Board decided not to continue with an executive share option scheme beyond 9 May 2005, the date on which the Companys executive share option schemes lapsed for the purpose of new awards.
Following shareholder approval, the PSP was introduced.
The Company operates an employee savings related share option scheme, the Sharesave scheme, which applies to all UK employees.

compensation which is as far as possible linear.
Participation began for the Executive Directors and the most Senior Independent Director senior managers in 2003 and was extended to a wider group 16,170 p. a. of senior managers in 2004.
HOW THE ABIP WORKS Each participant receives a percentage of the bonusable profit of the business for which he or she has responsibility, with the calculation of bonusable profit being essentially based on adjusted operating profit less a charge for invested capital and certain exceptional items.
Adjustments can be made for restructuring charges relating to strategic manufacturing initiatives, to match the costs of those initiatives to the benefits over a period of up to three years.
Elements of remuneration audited information Variable compensation under ABIP continued James Nicol The Awards made to senior participants, including Executive 2008 2007 2006 Directors, are paid four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in Cash & Restricted Restricted Award Shares and two-sevenths in Deferred Award Award Shares $541,000 $1,633,000 $1,731,000 Shares.
The Awards payable to the remaining participants are paid three-quarters in cash, one-twelfth in Restricted Award Deferred Award Shares and one-sixth in Deferred Award Shares.
Interim Shares $216,000 $652,000 $692,000 payments are made at the end of June, September and December based on 75% of the Award earned in respect of $3,000,000 the relevant quarter, with the balance of the full entitlement for the calendar year paid at the end of March following the $2,500,000 calendar year-end.

The decline in variable compensation paid to James Nicol under As a condition of continued participation in the ABIP, senior the ABIP corresponded directly to the underlying decline in the participants, including Executive Directors, are required to bonusable profit of the Group.
As economic conditions retain shares with a value equivalent to one years total afterworsened, culminating in the collapse of the North American tax remuneration including compensation under the ABIP, housing and automotive markets, Tomkins saw its bonusable based on an average of the previous three years.

Increases in annual base salary of all THE IBP participants, including Executive Directors, are restricted to the RATIONALE FOR THE IBP equivalent rate of increase in the Retail Prices Index in the UK As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, the Committee or equivalent overseas index.
The restrictions on the increases reviewed in early 2009 the Groups immediate priorities and in salary, together with the growth in the value of the Awards, the most suitable mechanisms for incentivising those priorities.

HOW THE IBP WORKS For the reasons noted above the IBP was put in place solely for the 2009 financial year.
To the extent that a participant receives IBP benefits for 2009, this programme replaces the ABIP with respect to that year.
The terms of the ABIP are incorporated by reference with appropriate replacement of the Award entitlement of the IBP.
The total benefits under the IBP are capped at 100% of base salary payable 80% in cash and 20% in Restricted Award Shares with, as under the ABIP, a 2:1 matching award of Deferred Award Shares vesting at the end of three years.

After a benchmarking analysis, Mr Zimmermans salary was found to be significantly lower than the median.
Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 2010, it was increased by 15% to $686,000 per annum.
Elements of remuneration audited information The maximum award of shares is calculated by dividing the continued maximum value by an estimate of the share price required to achieve an increase of 60% TSR.
