53 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I corporate governance Report of the Remuneration Committee advice During the year, Filtronas Director of Group Human Resources was invited by the Remuneration Committee to provide views and advice.
In addition, with the approval of the Remuneration Committee, the Company received services and advice from the following independent and expert consultants: Hewitt New Bridge Street, a part of Hewitt Associates, who provided advice on the Companys long-term share incentive plans and on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives within the Company Mercers Human Resource Consulting Mercers who provided advice and information on pension matters Mercers provide actuarial and investment consulting services to the Trustees of the UK pension schemes and Hewitt Associates provide actuarial advice to the Company for the US pension schemes.
remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to the Board the framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Chief Executives remuneration proposals for the members of the Executive Committee and other senior executives are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and recommendations are made to the Board.
The Remuneration Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy as detailed by the Chief Executive in respect of other levels of management in the Company and makes such recommendations to the Chief Executive as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee has regard to the proposed remuneration policy for other management and employees, across the Group, when determining recommendations on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
No Director is involved in determining or voting on their own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committees objective is to ensure that those individuals are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner having regard to the performance of the Company, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
alignment with group strategy The Board as a whole establishes the remuneration policy and it considers the alignment of Group performance and the remuneration of its senior executives, including the Executive Directors, to be of the upmost importance.
It believes that senior management should be highly rewarded on a market competitive basis for the delivery of stretching goals, but should receive reduced rewards when the business does not perform to expectations.
To achieve this alignment, Filtronas remuneration package is leveraged with a high percentage of pay at risk against the achievement of stretching targets.
Furthermore, one half of any annual bonus is delivered in the form of Filtrona shares.
These requirements closely tie the long-term value of executive remuneration to the interests of shareholders.
The Groups strategic priorities are set out elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Those priorities are reflected closely in the design of appropriate remuneration packages which seek to drive their delivery through a combination of financially driven targets and key personal objectives based around operational issues.
Remuneration packages for senior executives including the Executive Directors consists of: Basic salary Internal and external parity in basic salary positioning is an important contributor to a motivational remuneration package.
Company policy takes into account a range of market data reflecting practice in other FTSE 250 companies Annual bonus plan Bonus structures are effective if they help drive the achievement of targets, whilst respecting the Companys appetite for risk, and allowing for sustained profitable growth.
The targets set should not provide an incentive to promote behaviours which would be detrimental to the Companys long-term interests.
As such, management must provide robust justification for the targets it recommends.
The Remuneration Committee assures itself that the targets provide appropriate incentives and are sufficiently challenging, but remain achievable Long-term incentive plan The LTIP encourages a longer-term focus on EPS and relative total shareholder return TSR.
These metrics measure how the Company is performing, in both absolute and relative terms, for the shareholders The Remuneration Committee considers all these elements, plus pension and other benefits, as a whole.
It looks to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between each component so that the need for both short-term success and long-term sustainable growth is recognised.
The Remuneration Committee also ensures that the non-financial business measures and individual objectives reflect adequately the Companys environmental, social and governance responsibilities.
Share ownership guidelines In order to align the interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has established guidelines recommending that the Executive Directors and other senior executives should build a minimum shareholding in the Company over a five year period.
For Executive Directors this is equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
Shares held in unvested LTIPs are not taken into account in assessing compliance with this guideline.
54 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I BUSIneSS corporate FInancIaL overvIeW revIeW governance StateMentS At 31 December 2009, Mark Harper had a shareholding of 155% of basic salary and Steve Crummett had a shareholding of 53% of basic salary.
Non-executive Directors are encouraged, under their letters of appointment, to own a minimum of 7,500 shares.
Details of the Directors shareholdings can be found on page 61.

Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable performance-related pay element forms a significant portion of each package.
The majority of total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive from the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to the Companys strategic objective to secure the creation of long-term shareholder value.

Salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual and pay awards and conditions elsewhere in the Company.
Salaries are reviewed annually with any increase being effective from 1 January unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are determined taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies.
The Company aims to position base salary around the mid-market level of the relevant comparator companies to remain competitive.
A review of salary levels was undertaken in December 2009.
In line with average pay awards across the Group, and taking into consideration the overall performance of the business and the markets within which it operates, both Executive Directors were awarded an increase of 2%.
Mark Harper Steve Crummett 1 Annual salary effective from 1 January 2010 515,100 280,500 1 Annual salary effective from 1 January 2009 505,000 275,000 1 excluding supplementary pension payment annual bonuses Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2009, Mark Harper and Steve Crummett were each potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 100% of basic salary.
Bonus payments are made 50% in cash and 50% in shares in the Company, the entitlement to such shares being deferred for three years, in accordance with the rules of the DASB.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the performance targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee and were based upon Filtronas reported operating profit and with reference to continuing operations adjusted earnings per share at constant exchange rates Adjusted EPS performance relative to prior year.
Company performance was required to reach a minimum threshold operating profit of 65.6 million for a cash bonus of 7.94% of basic salary to be payable.
In addition, the Executive Directors had the opportunity, subject to the achievement of personal objectives, to earn a bonus of up to 10% of salary.
The Company failed to meet its financial targets for 2009.
The Executive Directors met their personal objectives during the year and have been awarded a 10% cash bonus.
A matching 10% deferred share bonus award under the DASB will be made to each Executive Director.
When assessing the approval of the bonus awards, the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the impact of certain exceptional items upon the Companys financial performance and had due regard to the interests of the shareholders.
Deferred annual Share Bonus plan The DASB provides for Executive Directors and other senior executives to receive existing issued ordinary shares in the Company for nil payment.
The number of shares subject to an award is determined at the time the award is granted and is based upon the performance in Filtronas preceding financial year of the participant and or the Company and or the division in which the participant worked.
56 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I BUSIneSS corporate FInancIaL overvIeW revIeW governance StateMentS Under the rules of the DASB, the aggregate value of shares made subject to awards granted to a participant in any one financial year may not exceed 100% of their basic salary as at the award date.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that, in accordance with the Companys bonus arrangements, awards under the DASB will not normally exceed 50% of basic salary.
Shares awarded under the DASB are held in trust until 1 March in the third calendar year after the year in which the award was made, or any such other later date as the Company may determine is reasonably practicable, at which point they are transferred to the participant, subject to the participants continued employment within the Group.
During the year the DASBs awarded in March 2006 were transferred to the participants, in accordance with the rules of the DASB.
DASBs were also transferred, in accordance with the rules of the DASB, to a relevant senior executive, who left the employment of the Group, following the sale of the North American Plastic Profile & Sheet business in March 2009. amendment to the terms of certain DaSB awards A variation to the terms of the awards that were granted under the DASB to senior executives in 2008 and 2009 has been made available to certain United Kingdom tax resident executives.
These awards including awards held by Mark Harper and Steve Crummett will be permitted to vest during March 2010, rather than their normal vesting date of 1 March 2011 and 1 March 2012.
The amendment provides an opportunity for the taxation of the awards to fall within the 2009 10 tax year potentially leading to a taxation saving for the participants.
The Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to have provided the UK participants with such an opportunity, in respect of these historic bonuses.
The terms of such acceleration will include that the shares vesting early under the awards net of those sold to meet tax liabilities must then be held subject to a risk of forfeiture until the original vesting date for the relevant award.
Such terms of forfeiture shall provide that in the event that the benefit of the awards would have otherwise been lost between the new vesting date and the normal vesting date in accordance with the DASB e. g. in bad leaver circumstances the appropriate number of such shares will be forfeited by the executive to the Companys employee benefit trust for nil consideration.
In such clawback circumstances, the executive may also be required to pay the Company a cash sum equal in value as at the time of early vesting to the value of any shares that would have been lost otherwise, that were sold to meet the tax liabilities arising from the early vesting of the awards.
All other terms of the awards remain unchanged and no additional costs should be incurred by the Company as a result of the amendment.
executive share-based incentive plans The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that offering Executive Directors and nominated senior executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating, rewarding and retaining key employees so that they may drive and participate in the future growth of the Company.
It is also of the view that the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives should be encouraged to invest directly in the Company through the purchase of shares.
The Companys DASB and LTIP are both intended to support these objectives.
The award of shares or options under the executive share-based incentive plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the role of the individual and such other criteria as the Remuneration Committee may determine from time to time.
The current policy is that participation in the DASB and LTIP Part B is restricted to Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Since 2008, Executive Directors and other senior executives have not been eligible to receive further awards under LTIP Part A and participation in LTIP Part A has been limited to other designated employees.
Awards under the Companys share-based incentive plans will be satisfied using market purchases, new issue shares and or shares held in treasury.
Long-term Incentive plan LtIp part B A performance share award under LTIP Part B consists of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to performance conditions, on the basis described below.
Participants make no payment for the grant and exercise of performance share awards.
Participants may receive performance share awards over shares worth up to two times their basic salary in any financial year.
A performance share award will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
The awards are structured as nil cost options.
For employees based outside the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth anniversary of grant.
For employees based in the US, once the performance conditions have been satisfied the options must be exercised within 30 days of vesting.
For awards granted prior to 2008, the extent to which performance share awards vest is subject to the Companys TSR performance over a fixed three-year period relative to the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts at the start of the three year performance period.
Such performance share awards will vest in full only if the Companys TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the peer group over the performance period.
For median performance, one quarter of such awards vest, rising proportionally up to full vesting thereafter.
For below median performance, no such awards will vest.
57 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I corporate governance Report of the Remuneration Committee The performance condition will be tested after three years and there is no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three years, the relevant awards will lapse.
For awards granted in 2008 and beyond, 50% of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition and 50% of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards will require the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation over three financial years to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum for 12.5% of the awards to vest.
The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight line basis and for 50% of the awards to vest such adjusted EPS growth must exceed inflation by an average of at least 8% per annum.
The performance condition will be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant awards will lapse.
During the year, the Committee decided that any future LTIP B awards which are granted in the last four months in any year will utilise the adjusted EPS figure as at the end of that relevant financial year as the base figure rather than the preceding years adjusted EPS.
The performance period will begin with the three year period commencing with the financial year immediately following the date of grant and awards will therefore have a vesting period of between three and three and a half years.
The first awards under this new policy were granted in September 2009.
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions each time performance share awards are granted under LTIP Part B in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share awards granted in subsequent years.
Details of the awards granted and outstanding during the year to the Executive Directors under the LTIP Part B and DASB are as follows: Share price At 1 Jan Awarded Transferred Lapsed At 31 Dec at date of Scheme 2009 in year in year in year 2009 award Earliest vesting date Expiry date Mark Harper LTIP Part B Performance 141,533 141,533 318.00p 13 March 2009 12 March 2012 LTIP Part B Performance 173,073 173,073 249.75p 2 March 2010 1 March 2013 LTIP Part B Performance 325,581 325,581 150.50p 25 April 2011 24 April 2014 LTIP Part B Performance 121,991 121,991 180.75p 29 August 2011 28 August 2014 LTIP Part B Performance 378,750 378,750 115.00p 5 March 2012 4 March 2015 1 LTIP Part B Performance 134,070 134,070 169.50p 28 February 2013 27 September 2015 DASB 48,993 48,993 292.00p 1 March 2009 1 March 2009 DASB 58,858 58,858 246.00p 1 March 2010 1 March 2010 DASB 114,499 114,499 189.75p 1 March 2011 1 March 2011 DASB 102,083 102,083 115.00p 1 March 2012 1 March 2012 Steve Crummett LTIP Part B Performance 146,179 146,179 150.50p 25 April 2011 24 April 2014 LTIP Part B Performance 91,286 91,286 180.75p 29 August 2011 28 August 2014 LTIP Part B Performance 206,250 206,250 115.00p 5 March 2012 4 March 2015 1 LTIP Part B Performance 73,008 73,008 169.50p 28 February 2013 27 September 2015 DASB 29,191 29,191 189.75p 1 March 2011 1 March 2011 DASB 42,700 42,700 115.00p 1 March 2012 1 March 2012 1 Subject to the date of announcement of the Companys financial results for the previous year in accordance with the Model Code A total of 1,633,821 2008: 1,841,949 share incentive awards were granted to Executive Directors and other senior executives under the LTIP Part B and the DASB during the year ended 31 December 2009.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2009 was 189.00p.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company during the year ranged from 108.50p to 189.00p.
The awards granted in 2006 and 2007 under LTIP Part B are subject to relative TSR performance targets.
For the awards granted in 2007, as at 31 December 2009 Filtrona was ranked between the median and upper quartile of the comparator group, which would indicate potential vesting of 53.32% of options awarded.
The position may change depending on the Companys performance as at the date of the relevant third anniversary.
During the year, the LTIP Part B options awarded in March 2006 lapsed due to the performance targets not being met.
The awards granted in 2008 and 2009 under LTIP Part B are subject to a performance condition which is 50% dependent on relative TSR performance targets.
58 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2009 I BUSIneSS corporate FInancIaL overvIeW revIeW governance StateMentS For the awards granted in April 2008, as at 31 December 2009, Filtrona was ranked between the median and upper quartile of the comparator group, which would indicate potential vesting of 83.98% of 50% of the grant.
For the awards granted in August 2008, as at 31 December 2009, Filtrona was ranked between the median and upper quartile of the comparator group, which would indicate potential vesting of 72.76% of 50% of the grant.
For the awards granted in March 2009, as at 31 December 2009, Filtrona was ranked between the median and upper quartile of the comparator group, which would indicate potential vesting of 25.00% of 50% of the grant.
Long-term Incentive plan LtIp part a The LTIP Part A provides for participants to receive share option awards over shares worth up to two times basic salary or 250,000 whichever is the greatest in any financial year, subject to performance conditions.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors and other senior executives no longer receive LTIP Part A share option awards the last awards being granted in 2007.
Awards will continue to be made to other participants and the exercise price set will be equal to the share price at the date of the grant.
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the criteria being applied when quantifying the level of individual awards being granted.
As a result, the Remuneration Committee has recommended that emphasis be placed on the participants contribution relative to the part of the Group in which they work in contrast to current performance of the Company as a whole.
A share option award will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following its grant, but only if the specified performance condition has been satisfied.
The performance conditions attached to previous LTIP Part A awards were based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation relative to inflation over three financial years, requiring such earnings per share growth to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant share option awards will lapse.
The performance conditions attached to the awards granted in 2005 and 2006 have been satisfied.
Save as You earn Scheme In addition to the LTIP, the Company operates a Save As You Earn share option scheme SAYE.
During 2009, the Company decided not to launch a SAYE, having had regard to the potentially adverse accounting implications.
Mark Harper joined the SAYE in 2006 and Steve Crummett joined the SAYE in 2008, both contributing the statutory maximum monthly amount of 250.
Details of the awards granted and outstanding during the year to Executive Directors under the LTIP Part A and the SAYE are as follows: At 1 Jan 2009 and 31 Dec Exercise Executive Director 2009 price Earliest vesting date Expiry date Mark Harper LTIP Part A 156,903 239.00p 23 June 2008 22 June 2015 148,380 254.75p 8 September 2009 7 September 2016 190,376 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,793 237.00p 1 May 2011 31 October 2011 Steve Crummett LTIP Part A 106,694 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,324 151.80p 1 May 2011 31 October 2011 performance graph The graph opposite represents the comparative TSR performance of the Company against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts Index from the date of the listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange until 31 December 2009 highlighting the intervening financial year-ends.
