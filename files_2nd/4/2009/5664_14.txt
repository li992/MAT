Half of the maximum bonus potential was payable at target performance levels.

Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP allows the Committee to make awards which are a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
Annual awards may not exceed an amount equal to two times base salary.
An award will normally vest i. e become exerciseable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
The extent to which awards may vest will be subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period relative to the TSR performance of a specified comparator group of companies.
These share awards will vest in full only if the Companys TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the comparator group and the following vesting schedule will apply: TSR Proportion of LTIP award exerciseable Below median Nil Median 25% Median to upper quartile Pro rata between 25%100% Upper quartile 100% The TSR comparator group are: BHP Billiton Rio Tinto Xstrata Alcoa Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Teck Cominco Vedanta Resources Mount Gibson Antofagasta Cameco Kazakhmys Peabody Energy Fortescue Metals Cliffs Natural Resources Vale SA Group Mexico Ferrexpo Aluminium Corp of China Mitsubishi Materials Corp Outokumpo OYJ The performance condition for all awards under the LTIP provides for the exclusion from the comparator group of those companies that cease to be listed and the exclusion of those companies that have been subject to a recommended takeover offer and are therefore in the process of delisting.
Where companies are excluded from the comparator group, the median upper quartile rankings are recalculated using the reduced number of companies in the comparator group.
Although there has been a reduction in the number of comparator companies from 22 to 20, the Committee still views them as effective comparators.
The comparator companies that were removed were Portland which was acquired by Cleveland Cliffs Inc now known as Cliffs Natural Resources on 11 December 2008 and Aricom which was acquired by Peter Hambro on 22 April 2009.
In addition to the above, the awards will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR over the performance period reflects the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The Committee considers that TSR remains the most appropriate measure of long-term Company performance, providing alignment of interests between management and shareholders, and therefore the 2010 LTIP awards will be subject to the same performance condition.
In 2009, the maximum level of award under the LTIP was set at 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, based on the average market value of the shares over the five days preceding the date of grant.
As announced on 25 March 2009, Miguel Perry decided to step down as CFO of the Group with effect from 30 June 2009.
Accordingly, no LTIP award was made to him in April 2009.
