Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT INTRODUCTION This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Combined Code and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part of the remuneration report.
The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
RESPONSIBILITIES The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on the Groups website and include the following: determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers: determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers: consideration of executive directors service agreements, pensions and related matters: making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans: and exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Companys savings-related and executive share option schemes.
MEMBERSHIP The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Robin Southwell Chairman, Norman Broadhurst, Gary Bullard, John Hughes appointed 3 February 2009, Paul Lester and Eric Tracey.
On Robin Southwells retirement as a director on 29 July 2008, Gary Bullard took over the chairmanship of the Committee.
ADVISERS During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief Executive and the Group Personnel Director, neither of whom took part in the determination of their own remuneration.
Advice was also received from the Company Secretary in relation to the operation of the Companys share-based incentive plans.
Advice was obtained from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive arrangements, including employee share schemes.
HNBS has no other connection with the Company.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its performance through the process outlined on the corporate governance report on page 37.
The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the skills and experience to perform its responsibilities.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS POLICY ON REMUNERATION The fees of non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board and were reviewed during the year.
The policy is to set fees at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market capitalisation.
Fees do not contain any performance-related element and the non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or performance share schemes.
Additional fees are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reecting the additional workload and responsibility of these appointments.
Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment, and take no part in the determination of their own remuneration.
Details of the fees paid during the year are included in the table headed Summary of Remuneration on page 46.
The annual fee level for 2009 2010 is unchanged from 2008 2009, as follows: Fee Office 000 Chairman 115.0 Non-executive director 36.5 Remuneration Committee chairmanship additional fee 5.0 Audit Committee chairmanship additional fee 6.0 ANNUAL REPORT 2009 41 Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT TERM OF APPOINTMENT The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms of approximately three years.
Their letters of appointment have no contractual notice period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every two years.
The dates on which the current respective letters of appointment came into effect are as follows: Norman Broadhurst 3 April 2007: Gary Bullard and Eric Tracey 2 December 2008: Paul Lester 1 September 2007: and John Hughes 1 January 2009.
Robin Southwells term of appointment expired on 20 January 2008, and was extended to 29 July 2008, the date of the Annual General Meeting.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS POLICY ON REMUNERATION The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short and long-term incentives and benets, which form a competitive and fair total remuneration package.
Performance-related remuneration in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance shares, comprises a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which require substantial improvement in financial performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE BASE SALARY The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable industry sectors.
In particular, base salaries recognise salary levels in a group of comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors.
Details of salaries, bonuses and benets paid to executive directors during the year are included in the table headed Summary of Remuneration on page 46.
The basic annual salaries of Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner with effect from 1 April 2009 are: T R Cobbold 350,000 N W Warner 250,000 These represent a nil increase for Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner.
ANNUAL BONUS Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors.
Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues.
For the year under review, the financial measure applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors was actual adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year, with on-target performance at 10% growth and maximum bonus payable at 28% growth.
In 2008 2009 for the Group Finance Director and other senior executives, up to 25% of maximum bonus was dependent on achievement of personal objectives, in addition to the financial target.
The Chief Executives bonus is dependent entirely on adjusted earnings per share performance.
For the executive directors and two senior executives, the maximum award under the 2008 2009 annual incentive plan was 100% of base salary.
Bonus amounts earned up to 55% of base salary are paid in cash.
If the bonus earned exceeds 55% of base salary, the bonus earned between 50% and 75% of base salary is deferred into shares which are released after two years, subject to the executive director senior executive remaining in the Groups employment.
Bonus payable in excess of 75% of base salary is payable in cash.
Bonus shares earned by the executive directors under the deferred bonus plan and not yet released by the Company are included in the table headed Interests under Share Plans starting on page 47.
Bonuses earned by the executive directors and senior executives under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
The amount of bonus payable under this scheme is dependent on achievement of stretching financial targets and, in the case of the Group Finance Director and the senior executives, personal objectives also.
SIGNING ON ARRANGEMENTS Tim Cobbold joined the Group on 1 June 2007 as Chief Operating officer and as an executive director.
In addition to participating in the performance-related long and short-term incentive plans, life insurance and pension scheme and receiving benets in kind, he is entitled to receive the following additional payments in each of the first two calendar years of his employment, to assist with the transition from his previous employment: A bonus of 50,000, net of income tax c. 85,000 gross.
42 ANNUAL REPORT 2009 The Committee considers these payments, which total c. 127,000 per annum gross, to be reasonable having regard to the need to attract the best candidate for this demanding role.
The payments made during the year to 31 March 2009 are included in the table headed Summary of Remuneration on page 46.
Mr Cobbold is also entitled to reimbursement of certain costs if he decides to purchase a property closer to the Group head ofce in London.
BENEFITS IN KIND The taxable benets provided to executive directors during the year under review were use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance and medical cover.
PENSIONS During the year, the executive directors were members of the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme the 1996 Scheme.
This Scheme is a funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme.
It provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings up to normal retirement age under the Scheme, depending on service.
The 1996 Scheme also provides for dependants pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension Entitlements on page 46 shows the retirement benets, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the dened benefit section of the 1996 Scheme to the executive directors during the year, together with the total accrued annual pension to which each of them would be entitled under dened benefit arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme adopted a cap on pensionable salary in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral to the Group.
The pension benets of the executive directors are subject to this cap and they each received salary supplements in relation to salary in excess of the cap.
The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 46 headed Summary of Remuneration.
EXECUTIVE SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES POLICY The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased share ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and executive directors.
The policy is to make annual grants of share options and or performance shares, with a combined annual aggregate limit on the value of shares under award of two times basic salary.
The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive more value under a combination of Performance Share Plan awards and Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS grants than he could have under only one plan.
In calculating the value of awards, a performance share is deemed equal to two ESOS awards.
For example, an individual could receive a maximum ESOS option grant of 200% of salary or a performance share grant of 100% of salary.
Alternatively, he could receive a 100% ESOS option grant and a 50% performance share grant to receive the maximum level of award per annum.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME The current share option scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options granted under this scheme are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Companys adjusted earnings per share EPS growth over a period of at least three consecutive financial years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by: 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of base salary: 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more than 150% of base salary: and 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of base salary.
In the case of options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant.
Adjusted EPS as disclosed in the report and accounts was chosen as the basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth in EPS necessary before options may be exercised would require a substantial improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
No options were granted to the executive directors under this scheme during the year.
ANNUAL REPORT 2009 43 Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN The Group also operates a Performance Share Plan PSP.
The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the PSP is 100% of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder return TSR performance target is met over a xed performance period of three financial years.
The TSR target for the years to 31 March 2009 compares the Companys TSR with that of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts.
As the Company is now a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts, the Committee has decided that the Companys TSR should be measured against that index for awards granted from June 2008 onwards.
Awards vest as follows: Chlorides ranking % of awards which vest Below median 0% Median 30% Between median and upper quartile Straight line between 30% and 100% Upper quartile 100% In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Companys EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 2% p. a. over the performance period.
PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 ESOS and the PSP, the Company operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme, unapproved options were granted to executive directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable.
No further options can be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes.
Options granted under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the performance measures stated in the notes to the table headed Interests under Share Plans on page 47.
SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME The Group operates a savings-related share option scheme the 2007 Scheme, which expires in July 2017.
Under the Scheme, options which are available to eligible UK employees who contract to save a specified monthly amount are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or, depending on an individuals initial election, five years from the contract start date.
The 1997 savings-related share option scheme expired in July 2007, and no further options can be granted under it.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the savings-related share schemes and the PSP are set out in the table starting on page 47 headed Interests under Share Plans.
CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12 months notice if terminated by the Company and six months notice if terminated by the director.
The executive directors current contracts of employment became effective on the following dates: Tim Cobbold 29 July 2008 Neil Warner 23 April 1997 In the event of termination by the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months salary, pension benets, salary supplement and benets in kind.
In an appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing directors duty to mitigate loss.
However, the contracts of employment of the directors contain special terms relating to dismissal following a change of control of the Company, under which they would each be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months salary and benets including a bonus payment of 20% of basic salary.
Four senior executives also have contracts of employment containing this formula for a prescribed compensation payment on dismissal following a change of control.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year.
44 ANNUAL REPORT 2009 POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval of the Board.
Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual.
During the year, fees received and retained were as follows: Fee 000 Company Keith Hodgkinson 15.7 fide La Rue plc Neil Warner 36.3 Dechra Pharmaceuticals plc Mr Hodgkinsons fees relate to the period 1 April 2008 to 29 July 2008, this being the date he retired as a director of Chloride Group PLC.
