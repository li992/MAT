The maximum award limit is 100% of salary in any year in normal circumstances and 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
Awards to Directors and other senior managers will not normally vest until three years after the award and the performance conditions have been met.
Options granted under the 2006 Scheme have two separate conditions.
The first condition is that the total shareholder return TSR of the Company must exceed that of the 250 largest companies in the FTSE index.
No part of the award will vest for below median TSR: 12.5% of the Option vests at Median TSR: 50% vests at upper quartile TSR and pro-rata between these points.
The second condition is growth in earnings per share EPS 12.5% of the Option will vest at EPS growth of RPI 3% p. a. nil below this : 50% will vest at RPI 5% p. a. : and pro rata between these points.
These performance conditions were chosen by the Remuneration Committee in the light of institutional guidelines in order to incentivise the executives to increase shareholder value.
Under the 2006 Scheme, should the performance conditions not be met, re-testing is not permitted.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2009 Remuneration Report 59 The status of both performance conditions on share options outstanding during the year is set out below.

They are not normally exercisable before the third anniversary of the date of grant and, in all circumstances, will lapse if not exercised within ten years.
No Directors options had their terms and conditions varied during the year.

Pensions entitlements and cash allowances The Group operates a two-tier defined benefit pension scheme for senior employees including most of the Companys executive Directors, details of which are given on page [x].
It is the Companys policy that annual bonuses, payments under the Executive Bonus Scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Prior to 6th April 2006, the Committee reviewed in detail the impact of the pensions tax regime operating from that date.
It developed a new policy, designed to be neutral in terms of cost compared to existing expenditure on pensions.
This new policy incorporated the removal of the pensionable earnings cap for pension accruing after 6th April, 2006.
Individual executive Directors were affected very differently by these changes and for some it was not tax-efficient to accrue further pension for service from 6th April, 2006.
However, it is for individual Directors to decide when to opt out of the scheme, in which case a cash allowance is paid.
Cash allowances paid in lieu of pensions are shown on page 49.
Under the prescribed transitional arrangements, their accrued pension at that date will remain linked to future increases in pensionable earnings and they will continue to be eligible for death in service benefits.

The normal retirement age under the Fund for this group is sixty.
For each Director, the accrued entitlement at 4th October, 2009 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, based on the salary of each Director at this date and pensionable service accrued to 5th April, 2006 or subsequent date of opting out of the Fund.
A spouses dependants pension equal to two thirds of the Directors pension is incorporated and the Director can currently elect to receive the pension from age fifty, subject to a discount if retirement takes place before sixty.
The pension, when in payment, will receive annual increases in line with inflation, which may be limited when inflation exceeds 3% per annum.
ii All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with UK legislation.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
