Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 and also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Companies Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 12 November 2009 at which the financial statements will be put to shareholders for approval.
The Companies Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on an overall remuneration package for the executive directors and the Chief Operating Officers of the Company.
The Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors Nigel Turner Chairman, John Hawkins and Mike Buzzacott from 7 May 2009.
John Worby was a member of the Committee until his appointment as Group Finance Director on 26 February 2009.
In the period between 26 February 2009 and 7 May 2009 when Mike Buzzacott was appointed as a director of the Company, the Company did not comply with provision B.
2.1 of the Code in that the Remuneration Committee comprised only two independent non-executive directors, namely Nigel Turner and John Hawkins.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board and no director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy The Companys executive and senior management remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain individuals of the high calibre required to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management: base salary: annual bonus: share awards: pension: and benefits-in-kind.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors and senior management should be based on corporate and individual performance related targets that support the Companys strategy and objectives.
The policy is intended to create a strong link between business performance and reward and to generate value to shareholders, employees and the Company.
Base Salary The executive directors basic salary is reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each financial year, taking into account individual and corporate performance, an assessment of comparator companies and levels of increases applicable to other employees in the Company.
Executive directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 November 2009.
Genus Annual Report 2009 I 39 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Continued Annual Bonus The Committee establishes the performance measures and objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
The performance measures in the bonus scheme applicable to the directors and senior management of the company in the period include the achievement of stretching targets which relate to adjusted profit before tax, net debt and personal objectives.
Account is also taken of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which the senior management are responsible and the extent to which the strategic objectives set by the Board are being met.
Measurement of profit before tax in the bonus scheme is made on the basis of actual reported rates for Executive directors and on the basis of a combination of actual reported rates and regional performance for the senior management of the Company.
Share Awards In 2004 the Company adopted a strategy to offer long term share incentives by way of share awards to the directors and senior management of the Company and by way of share options to middle management.
Since 2004 no share options have therefore been granted to the directors of the Company.
The long term share awards are granted under the Genus plc 2004 Performance Share Plan the Plan.
Under the Plan, incentives can take the form of conditional share awards or nil cost options and are driven by the achievement of growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share normally over a three year period, with the proportion of the grant that vests being as shown in the table below: Per annum growth in underlying EPS % of award vesting Per annum growth in underlying EPS % of award vesting RPI 4% Nil RPI 7% 70% RPI 4% 40% RPI 8% 80% RPI 5% 50% RPI 9% 90% RPI 6% 60% RPI 10% 100% growth in underlying EPS over the three year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate.
a linear scale will be applied when performance falls between the bands.
For grants of share awards made prior to 15 October 2008 the following performance conditions apply: Per annum growth in underlying EPS % of award vesting Per annum growth in underlying EPS % of award vesting RPI 3% Nil RPI 6% 70% RPI 3% 40% RPI 7% 80% RPI 4% 50% RPI 8% 90% RPI 5% 60% RPI 9% 100% growth in underlying EPS over the three year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate.
Prior to the vesting of any grant, the Remuneration Committee reviews the basis of calculation of growth in underlying EPS to satisfy itself that the performance conditions have been met.
Shares granted to a participant under a conditional share award automatically transfer to a participant in the Plan and become a taxable benefit upon the decision of the Remuneration Committee that a grant or part shall vest.
Under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan grants are made to incentivise middle management executive directors and senior management do not participate in this plan and the vesting of options is also conditional on achievement of growth in underlying earnings per share exceeding RPI 5% over a three year period.
Details of awards made to directors are shown in the table of directors interests on page 43 and details of the performance criteria for the Companys share award and share option schemes are also included in note 31 to the financial statements.
