Remuneration Report The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2009.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 22 April 2010.
This report has been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for setting the Chairmans and each executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee also reviews the remuneration of the Groups divisional boards.
The Committees current terms of reference were adopted on 25 February 2004 and are available on the Companys website, or from the Group Company Secretary.
The Committee is comprised of three non-executive Directors, Nicholas Wrigley Chairman, David Thompson and Neil Davidson, all of whom the Board considers to be independent.
The Committee held three meetings during the year which all members attended.
Remuneration policy for the executive Directors The Committees policy for the executive Directors is to have a remuneration package which will retain a talented executive team who can deliver excellent Group performance, be performance orientated and closely align the Directors interests with those of shareholders.
The policy is to provide different elements of fixed and performance related pay, with a high emphasis on performance related pay.
If performance targets are met in full, around two thirds of an executive Directors earnings for 2010 will be performance related.
The executive Directors remuneration package includes basic salary, annual bonus, long term incentive plan awards, pension and benefits.
The basic salary, pension and benefit elements of the remuneration are fixed elements of remuneration and are intended to be at market competitive levels.
Annual bonus and long term incentive awards are performance related and intended to incentivise the executive Directors over the medium and longer term and align their interests with those of the shareholders.
The Committee considers that the policy for executive Directors remuneration is in line with current market standards and best practice.
The Committee reviewed the level of remuneration of the executive Directors during 2009 and in doing so sought independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS.
HNBS were appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other service to the Group: however their parent company does provide advice on the Groups pension schemes.
In addition, the Committee consulted with John White, Group Chairman and Mike Farley, Group Chief Executive, although neither participated in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
Basic salaries are reviewed annually with increases usually taking effect from 1 January.
Annual bonus performance conditions are reviewed annually by the Committee and its policy is to have bonus performance conditions which take into consideration the outlook for the Group over the medium to long term.
The Committee chooses performance targets which it considers will incentivise the executive Directors to achieve excellent performance and align executive remuneration with shareholders interests.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards are designed to align the executive Directors interests with the Companys longer term financial performance and with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee reviews annually whether LTIP awards should be granted to executive Directors and the level of any awards made.
The Committee also reviews the performance conditions attached to the vesting of new LTIP Awards annually to ensure that the conditions are stretching and appropriate to current market conditions.
Upper quartile targets have to be met for full vesting of the awards to be achieved.
The Companys policy is to also make annual awards to senior management and staff under the LTIP to incentivise them to achieve excellent long term financial performance.
In addition, the Company has a policy to make invitations under the Save As You Earn Scheme to all permanent employees with more than six months service, to encourage the interest of all employees in the financial performance of the Group.
The Committee has considered whether a non-financial target, taking into consideration environmental, social and governance matters, should comprise part of annual bonus or LTIP award performance conditions.
The Committee believes that financial targets are more appropriate for the executive Directors at this time and considers that there are procedures in place throughout the Group that ensure non-financial matters are carefully considered and are integral to the Groups business operations.
Full details of both the quantum of the individual components of the packages payable to executive Directors and the structure of annual bonus and LTIP awards, including details of the performance conditions are summarised as follows.
Basic salary Following the review carried out in the fourth quarter last year and after taking into consideration current market conditions, the Committee has agreed that basic salaries will be increased by 2% from 1 January 2010.
Basic salaries were not increased during 2009, except for Jeff Fairburn on his promotion to the Board.
Basic salaries are as set out below: 2010 2009 Mike Farley 646,119 633,450 Mike Killoran 420,240 412,000 Jeff Fairburn 255,000 250,000 From 1 July 2009 for Jeff Fairburn full details of Jeff Fairburns actual remuneration in the year as a Director of the Company are detailed on page 35.
32 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 Remuneration Report Annual bonus Annual bonuses are performance related and non-pensionable.
There were two performance conditions for annual bonuses that were earned for 2009, one based on profit before tax pre exceptional items PBT and one based on cash generation.
PBT targets were set on Group performance for Mike Farley and Mike Killoran and on North Division performance for Jeff Fairburn.
The cash generation performance condition was met in full and the PBT performance conditions were partly met.
The Committee has agreed that annual bonuses for 2010 will be based on a PBT performance target, as it considers that this performance condition will incentivise the Directors in line with the Groups strategic aims.
The Committee has determined an appropriate sliding scale around a target figure for PBT.
In determining the target figure the Committee has taken into consideration the current market conditions faced by the housebuilding industry and forecasts for PBT.
The aim of the Committee is to set stretching targets which will incentivise the executive Directors and reward them for excellent performance.
The Committee has determined that the total level of potential annual bonus payable to the executive Directors in 2010 will be capped at 100% of basic salary.
Any annual bonuses earned for 2010 will be paid in cash.
Maximum annual bonus potential for 2010 as a percentage of salary 2010 2009 Mike Farley 100 100 Mike Killoran 100 100 Jeff Fairburn 100 100 Prior to 2009, the maximum annual bonus an executive Director could receive in cash was between 150% and 200% of basic salary, with any excess bonus being paid in shares which vested in two equal tranches one year and two years after the date on which the bonus was awarded.
Details of outstanding Bonus Share awards are shown on page 37.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The executive Directors may be granted awards under the Companys LTIP up to a maximum value of 250% of basic salary.
LTIP awards vest after a three year performance period if the performance conditions attached to the awards are met.
During 2009 Mike Farley, Mike Killoran and Jeff Fairburn received LTIP awards of 150%, 100% and 50% of their basic salary respectively.
In 2010 the Committee intends to make awards at 200% of basic salary to Mike Farley and 150% of basic salary to Mike Killoran and Jeff Fairburn.
The performance conditions for 2010 awards will be based half on TSR and half on PBT targets.
The Committee considers this provides a good mix between rewarding stock market performance and long term financial performance.
TSR combines the growth of a companys share price and dividends paid to show total return to a shareholder.
Reflecting that the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 250, the condition based on TSR performance will measure the Companys TSR against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts as at the date of grant.
The Committee considers the FTSE 250 to be the most appropriate benchmark against which to compare the Companys TSR, as there are an insufficient number of large housebuilders to provide a robust comparator group.
The vesting schedule for the half of the award linked to TSR performance will be 25% of the award for median performance, with sliding scale increases until full vesting at or above upper quartile performance.
The Committee considers that a PBT performance condition is more suitable than cash generation for awards to be granted in 2010 and consequently one half of an award will be linked to a PBT target.
The precise target range is contained in budgets which are confidential.
There will be full details of the range in the disclosure of vested awards in the future.
Performance conditions for awards granted in 2009 were based 50% on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR versus a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 250 and 50% on a cash generation performance condition.
The TSR performance condition is median to upper quartile performance for between 25% to 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The targets for the cash generation condition will be disclosed on the vesting of the awards.
For the awards made in 2007 and 2008 the performance conditions were based on Total Shareholder Return TSR versus a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 100 and Return on Capital Employed ROCE, with 50% of an award linked to TSR and 50% linked to ROCE.
The TSR performance condition was median to upper quartile performance for between 25% to 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The ROCE target was 15% to 22% for between 25% to 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The performance conditions relating to LTIP awards made in 2007 have not been achieved and as a result no shares will vest in 2010 in respect of these awards.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 33 Remuneration Report Pension The executive Directors are members of the Groups main defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme.
The normal retirement age for Mike Farley and Mike Killoran is 60 and for Jeff Fairburn is 65.
Mike Farley has elected not to accrue any further service in the Scheme and receives a salary supplement of 30% of basic salary, which the Committee considers is cost neutral to the Company.
However his pension will continue to be based on his pensionable salary at the date of leaving the Group or the Scheme and he remains a member of the Scheme for life insurance purposes.
A salary cap for pension purposes was introduced for Mike Farley in 2007.
Mr Farleys pensionable salary cap is 441,252, which is substantially below his basic salary.
Mike Killoran elected to continue service in the Scheme after 6 April 2006 and accrues benefit at 1 45th of his basic salary for each year of service.
Mike Killorans service in the Scheme prior to this date is subject to a cap which is 122,038.
The pensionable salary caps for Mike Farley and Mike Killoran will increase annually in accordance with their increase in basic salary, up to a maximum of 5% p. a.
As basic salaries have increased by 2% in 2010, pensionable salaries will increase by the same amount.
Jeff Fairburn accrues benefits at 60ths in the Scheme, subject to a Scheme salary cap of 123,600.
Mr Fairburn is also a member of the Groups stakeholder pension scheme and in addition to his defined benefit scheme membership receives matching contributions into his Group stakeholder policy at 9% of the difference between the Scheme cap and his basic salary.
This arrangement is in place for other employees within the Group below Board level whose benefits in the Scheme are limited to the Scheme cap but who are paid a higher level of basic salary.
Benefits in kind Each of the executive Directors remuneration also includes fully financed cars or cash car allowance, membership of the Group private medical scheme, the Group income protection scheme, subscriptions and some telephone costs.
These benefits are not pensionable.
All employee share scheme The executive Directors may also participate in the Companys Save as You Earn Scheme, which is open to all permanent employees who have more than six months service.
Service contracts All executive Directors have service contracts and in line with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, the notice period for each executive Director does not exceed 12 months.
Mike Farley and Mike Killorans contracts would normally expire on their 60th birthday: Jeff Fairburns contract would normally expire on his 65th birthday.
Only where dismissed in breach of contract is an executive Director entitled to payments for termination of employment.
Such payments will be subject to mitigation by the Director and will not in any event exceed 12 months remuneration.
Mike Farley and Mike Killorans contracts are dated 24 April 2002 but are effective from 1 January 2002, Jeff Fairburns contract is dated 4 August 2009 but is effective from 1 June 2009.
Mike Farley, Jeff Fairburn, David Thompson, Neil Davidson and Jonathan Davie will retire at the 2010 Annual General Meeting and are offering themselves for re-election.
Mike Farley and Jeff Fairburns service contracts are as set out above.
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
Share ownership guidelines The Committee has for some time encouraged significant long term share ownership of the Companys shares by the executive Directors.
In order to comply with best practice, formal share ownership guidelines were established in 2002.
As a result, the Committee requires each executive Director to hold Persimmon shares.
Mike Farley has to hold a minimum value of shares equivalent to three times his basic salary, and the other executive Directors are required to build up and maintain shareholdings equivalent in value to two times their basic salary.
Jeff Fairburn does not currently hold the required shareholding and will be required to retain LTIP and other share option awards except for sales of shares to pay income tax and National Insurance due on the exercise of the award until he increases his shareholding to the minimum value.
John White is required to hold shares which vest pursuant to the Synergy Incentive Plan for the period of his term as Chairman, except for sales of shares to pay income tax and National Insurance due on the exercise of the award.
The Committee recognises that Directors may be required to sell sufficient shares in the Company to satisfy any tax liability arising on the vesting of Bonus Shares or the exercise of options and vesting of awards granted under the Companys LTIP and Synergy Incentive Plans from time to time.
34 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2009 Remuneration Report External appointments None of the executive Directors currently has an external appointment.

250 200 150 100 50 0 Dec 04 Dec 05 Dec 06 Dec 07 Dec 08 Dec 09 Source: DATASTREAM Persimmon Plc FTSE 250 Index Chairman The Committee is also responsible for setting the Chairmans remuneration.
The Chairmans remuneration was reviewed and amended in 2008 and the Committee considers his current remuneration to be consistent with that of a Chairman of a FTSE 250 company.
Mr White has a letter of appointment dated 25 February 2009 to his role as Group Chairman which is subject to a six month notice period.
John White will be paid a salary of 295,800 p. a. for 2010, an increase of 2% on his salary for 2009.
Mr White does not participate in the annual bonus scheme, does not receive a pension salary supplement, nor LTIP awards or other benefits, except he remains a member of the Groups private medical scheme.
Non-executive Directors The remuneration policy for non-executive Directors is to pay fees commensurate with their duties which are non-pensionable.
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts and their appointments may be terminated on one months notice.
Nonexecutive Directors do not qualify for performance related bonuses.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the non-executive Directors.
The fees for 2010 have increased by 2% to 48,960 p. a. plus an additional fee of 8,670 p. a. for extra responsibilities in chairing a committee.
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
As a result the salary paid to each of Mike Killoran and Jeff Fairburn as members accruing service in this scheme was reduced by 9% of their pensionable salary, which would have been the member rate of contribution to the scheme.
Salary related benefits remain based on the salaries published on page 32.

Hamish Leslie Melvilles non-executive fees are paid in full to his employing company, Credit Suisse Securities Europe Ltd. Nicholas Wrigleys fees to 31 March 2009 were paid to his employing company, N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd, and thereafter directly to him.
