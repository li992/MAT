40 Governance Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Remuneration report Composition of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board is chaired by D K Nichol and also comprises the non-executive directors, S G Wilson and R E Lerwill.
When appropriate, the Committee also invites the views of the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director and Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The Group is mindful of best practice in areas of corporate governance and executive remuneration.
The Companys executive remuneration policy is in line with the Companys overall practice on pay and benets.
This is to reward employees competitively, taking into account performance and market comparisons.
In setting executive salaries, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, including market conditions, salaries in comparable companies in similar industries, and affordability, in order to attract and retain competent executives.
The Committee recognises the need to link an executives remuneration package to individual and corporate performance.
The Committee does not consider that the targets that are included in the executives remuneration package are incompatible with the directors responsibility for environmental, social and governance matters.
Whilst the Committees terms of reference do not require specic targets on these matters, the Committee is obliged to ensure that, when setting remuneration policy, appropriate incentives are provided to encourage enhanced performance in a fair and reasonable manner.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are disclosed below.
Components of executive directors remuneration Overview The principal components of executive directors remuneration packages are base salary, on which pension benets are calculated, annual bonus scheme, long-term incentive plan and pension benets.
Each of these components is explained further below.
Salary The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive directors.
Remuneration is considered with regard to personal performance, responsibilities and experience and this is benchmarked alongside independently compiled salary survey information.
The Committee also reviews the policies adopted regarding remuneration across the Group.
During the year under review the base salary levels of the Chief Executive and Finance Director were increased by only 3%, which was in line with the level of pay increases across most parts of the business.
These rises were considered appropriate recognising that the Group had previously grown rapidly but needed to place increased emphasis on improving margins and restraining costs.
Only base salary is pensionable.
Incentive arrangements Annual bonus scheme The executive directors participate in the Groups performance-related annual bonus scheme.
Bonuses are currently awarded for achieving profit and cash ow targets set by the Board, together with a smaller element related to achieving the Groups strategic objectives during the year.
The executive directors are entitled to receive their full bonus if all of these objectives have been achieved.
R M Steevess maximum bonus represents 75%, I M Jacquess 55% and M L M Smits 30% of base salary.
No bonus payments are pensionable.
The Board aims to achieve a balance between short-term targets that are rewarded by an annual cash bonus payment and longer term targets that are rewarded by share-based incentives.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The Long-Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders in 2005.
The principal features are as follows: All executive directors and senior executives nominated by the Committee are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under the LTIP.
The awards take the form of an option over shares LTIP option, where granting the option is conditional upon the performance of the Company over the measurement period.
The performance conditions were chosen because the Committee believes that these targets are aligned and compatible with the interests of shareholders and the creation of shareholder value.
An award made under the LTIP to a nominated participant will take two forms.
1 The first type of award is a right to acquire a specified number of shares by way of an option LTIP Option, with award conditional upon the performance of the Company over the measurement period.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to set the level of conditional award up to a maximum of 450% of basic salary.
The initial conditional award granted in June 2005 in respect of R M Steeves and I M Jacques was 450% of basic salary and that of M L M Smit was 150% of basic salary.
The maximum conditional awards for 2006 and 2007 did not exceed 150% of basic salary.
In accordance with the conclusion of the Remuneration Committee reported in last years Remuneration report that a conditional award of 200% of basic salary is appropriate for the Chief Executive, a conditional award of 200% of salary was made to R M Steeves.
Conditional awards of 150% of salary were made to I M Jacques and M L M Smit.
It should be noted that the targets are currently very demanding, notably that, in order to receive the maximum award relating to the part of the award described in note a below, the earnings per share must grow by 25% on a compound basis over the three year measurement period.
The appropriateness of both the EPS and TSR targets are currently under review.
41 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 The vesting of the shares will be dependent on the extent to which the following performance targets have been satisfied: a 50% of the LTIP Option is determined by a comparison of the earnings per share gure at the end of the measurement period with that at the start.
For these purposes earnings per share will be adjusted for amortisation of intangibles, non-recurring items, share option charges and any other items deemed reasonable by the Committee.
b The other 50% of the LTIP Option is determined by the Total Shareholder Return generated by the Company in comparison to that generated by companies in the FTSE Small Companies excluding investment trusts Index.
A table ranking the companies in order of performance will be produced in July of each year of the measurement period, the ranking of the Company in that table will be established.
The appropriateness of this comparable index is currently under review.
The shares in each element of the conditional award will vest in accordance with the following table: Vesting level EPS growth Position in the TSR table Vesting at 100% 25% Top 10% Vesting on straight line basis between 50% and 100% Between 20% and 25% Top 25% but outside top 10% Vesting on straight line basis between 25% and 50% Between 15% and 20% Top 50% but outside top 25% None of the shares will vest Below 15% Below top 50% 2 The second type of award takes the form of a co-invest arrangement and requires that the participant to whom the award is to be made invests in shares in the Company and continues to hold those shares throughout the measurement period LTIP Co-invest.
At the end of the measurement period, depending upon the growth in earnings per share adjusted as above of the Company over the measurement period, the participant will receive a number of free matching shares under the LTIP Co-invest.
The maximum amount that a participant may invest is the bonus achieved under the annual bonus scheme during the previous financial year.
The number of matching shares will be determined in accordance with the following table: Growth in earnings per share Ratio of matching shares received Over 15% each year Two shares for each one purchased Between 10% and 15% each year One share for each one purchased Pensions Executive directors are eligible to participate in the appropriate dened contribution pension schemes and other regular employee benefit plans including health and life insurance.
The Company makes pension contributions equivalent to 10% of annual salary for I M Jacques and 15% of annual salary for R M Steeves into dened contribution schemes.
M L M Smit participates in a multi-employer industry-wide dened benets scheme.
As the Companys share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cannot be determined accurately, the Companys share of the overall surplus deficit of the scheme is treated as dened contribution in nature.
Pension contributions in respect of M L M Smit were equivalent to 17% of his basic salary.
Service contracts The Committee has determined that the Companys executive directors are appointed to the Board on terms of a contract that can be terminated by the Company with 12 months notice after the first year of service.
Contracts on this basis were granted to R M Steeves and I M Jacques.
The executive directors are required to give the Company 12 months notice if they wish to terminate their contracts after the first year of service.
M L M Smits service contract requires six months notice to be given to the Company and 12 months notice to be given by the Company.
If the Company serves notice then in addition to such notice M L M Smit is entitled to compensation of not less then 24 months salary and benets, plus the bonus for the previous calendar year.
This clause existed prior to the acquisition of Lips Textielservice B. V. by the Group by whom M L M Smit was employed.
