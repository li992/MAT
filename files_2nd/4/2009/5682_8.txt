Directors Re muneration Report Introduction This remuneration report sets out the groups policy and structure for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting on January 21 2010.
The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is chaired by JC Botts.
Its other members during the year were The Viscount Rothermere and MWH Morgan.
All members of the committee are non-executive directors of the company.
The Viscount Rothermere and MWH Morgan are also directors of Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT but have no personal financial interests in the company other than as shareholders, and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The executive chairman normally attends meetings of the remuneration committee, but is not present at any discussion concerning his own remuneration.
For the year under review, the committee also sought advice and information from the companys managing director and finance director.
The committees terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional external advice on any matter, at the companys expense, although none did so in 2009.
The group itself can take external advice and information from many sources in preparing proposals for the remuneration committee, but no material assistance from a single source was received in relation to remuneration decisions for 2009.
Remuneration policy The group believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.
The two consistent objectives in its remuneration policy since the companys inception in 1969 have been the maximisation of earnings per share and the creation of shareholder value.
The first objective is achieved through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors and key managers to the profits and growth in profits of the group or relevant parts of the group.
This scheme is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling.
To support the implementation of the policy of profit sharing, the group is divided into a number of profit centres.
The manager of each profit centre is paid a profit share related to the profit centres profits and profit growth.
Each profit centre is part of a larger business group.
Each business group manager has an incentive based on the business groups profits and profit growth.
Profit sharing encourages directors and managers to grow their businesses, to launch new ventures and to search for acquisitions that would fit well with their businesses.
All executives on profit shares are aware that if profits rise, so does their pay.
Similarly if profits fall, so do their profit shares.
The profit shares of executive directors and senior managers make up much of their total pay.
For example, of the total remuneration of the 13 executive directors who served in the year, 83% was derived from profit shares.
The creation of shareholder value is also encouraged through an executive share option scheme and the 2004 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2004 and, from October 1 2009, the 2010 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2010.
The current executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders in January 1996.
The performance criteria under which options granted under this scheme may be exercised are set out on page 37.
This scheme expired in 2006, but no share options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options previously granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
CAP 2004 was approved by shareholders in February 2005, and is a highly geared performance-based share option scheme which not only directly rewards growth in profits of each executives businesses but also links more robustly equity reward with the delivery of economic shareholder value.
The CAP 2004 profit target was achieved in 2007, a year ahead of expectations, and exceeded again in both 2008 and 2009 resulting in the second and final tranche of options vesting, subject to the additional performance condition also being met by the individual businesses.
A more detailed explanation of the CAP is given on page 37.
Shareholders approved CAP 2009 at the 2009 Annual General Meeting.
This incentive scheme has been revised during the year and shareholders will be asked to re-approve it at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
The revised incentive scheme, CAP 2010, will replace CAP 2009.
CAP 2010 is deliberately similar to CAP 2004, and aims to mirror the success of CAP 2004 for both shareholders and employees by delivering exceptional profit growth over the four years to 2013.
Further details of CAP 2010 are set out on page 36.
The directors believe that these profit sharing and share option arrangements are responsible for much of the companys success since 1969.
These arrangements serve shareholders by aligning the interests of the directors and managers with those of shareholders and are considered an important driver of the companys growth strategy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board.
34 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Remuneration structure Executive directors It is the groups policy to construct executive remuneration packages such that a significant part of a directors compensation is based on the growth in the groups profits contributed by that director.
The details of the remuneration packages of individual directors are set out below.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salary and benefits are generally not the most significant part of a directors overall compensation package.
Each executive director receives a salary which is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee.
Certain non-cash benefits are also provided including private health care, and life assurance through the membership of one of the pension schemes.
Pension schemes Each UK-based director is entitled to participate in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme, closed to new directors, the Euromoney Pension Plan PensionSaver money purchase plan or their own private pension scheme.
Directors based overseas are entitled to participate in the pension scheme arrangements applicable to the country where they work.
Details of pension scheme contributions can be found on page 41 of this report.
There are no other post-retirement benefits.
Profit share scheme The group believes in aligning the economic interests of management with those of shareholders and achieves this through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of each executive director to the profits and growth in profits of the businesses that the executive director manages.
The executive directors who manage business divisions are set profit thresholds for the businesses for which they are responsible.
The profit thresholds are set at the time the director takes on responsibility for the businesses concerned, usually based on the profits of the previous 12 months, and are adjusted if such responsibilities change.
The normal profit share arrangement pays 1% of profits from zero up to a threshold and then 5% of profits achieved in excess of this threshold.
Some of the directors have schemes which have been in place for a number of years and pay profit shares at slightly higher rates or which are subject to additional thresholds.
The profit shares of the chairman and managing director are based on the adjusted pre-tax post-minority profits of the group, thereby matching their profit share with the pre-tax return the group generates for its shareholders.
The chairman is entitled to 5.32% 2008: 5.54% of the adjusted pre-tax profit.
The managing director is entitled to 3.15% 2008: 3.28% of the adjusted pre-tax profit up to a threshold of 31,972,645 and an additional 1.18% 2008: 1.23% of adjusted pre-tax profit in excess of this threshold.
The finance director receives a profit share linked to the pre-tax adjusted earnings per share EPS of the group.
A fixed sum is payable for every percentage point the EPS is above 11p and an additional fixed sum is payable for every percentage point that EPS is above 20p.
CHC Fordham, in addition to his profit share, has an incentive linked to the performance of acquisitions.
JL Wilkinson, who is responsible for all the groups marketing activities, receives an incentive based on the growth in the groups subscription and delegate revenues.
Each of the executive directors profit share schemes is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling and is designed to be the most significant part of the executive directors remuneration package.
Each directors profit share scheme is subject to remuneration committee approval, and can be revised at any time if the directors responsibilities are changed.

Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 250 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The executive directors who are participating in this scheme are PM Fallon, PR Ensor, NF Osborn, DC Cohen, CR Jones, SM Brady and CHC Fordham, details of which can be found on pages 43 to 47 of this report.
Share schemes The directors consider that share schemes are an important part of overall compensation and align the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders.

2010 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2010 CAP 2010 is being presented for approval by the companys shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
CAP 2010 is a revised version of CAP 2009 which was approved by shareholders on January 28 2009, and replaces CAP 2004 as no further awards may be granted under CAP 2004.
If approved by shareholders, CAP 2010 will replace CAP 2009.
The grant of awards under CAP 2010 is expected to be made soon after the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration committee intends to offer participation in CAP 2010 to approximately 150 directors and senior employees of the group who have direct and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CAP 2010 award will comprise two equal elements an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share, and a right to receive a cash payment.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2010, no consideration will be payable for the grant of the awards.
The award pool will comprise a number of ordinary shares which have an option value calculated at date of grant using an option pricing valuation model of 15 million and cash of 15 million, limiting the total accounting cost of the scheme to 30 million over its life.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards become exercisable on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and lapse to the extent unexercised by September 30 2020.
The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in a subsequent financial year in which the profits achieved in the year of initial vesting are again achieved.
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and an additional performance condition.
The primary performance condition requires the group to achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of 100 million by no later than the financial year ending September 30 2013 and that profits remain at this level or more for the vesting period of the second tranche.
If the primary performance condition is not met, the secondary performance condition requires the group to achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of at least 84.9 million 60% of the growth under the primary performance condition for the year ending September 30 2013 and remain at this level or more for the vesting of the second tranche of awards.
If the secondary performance condition is met but not the primary condition and adjusted pre-tax profits increase in the following year then the award pool for the second tranche of options is increased catch-up award.
In the event that either the primary or secondary profit target is achieved, the award pool will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the performance condition, but no individual may have an award over more than 6% of the award pool they participate in.
The catch-up award is also allocated between the CAP participants in the same manner but by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the profit growth in the year the catch-up award applies only.
36 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Share schemes continued The additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of the award, requires that the profits of the respective participants businesses in the subsequent vesting period remain at least 75% of that achieved in the year the primary or secondary performance condition was met.
Thus the CAP 2009 is designed so that profit growth must be sustained if awards are to vest in full.
2004 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2004 The CAP 2004 was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005 and replaced the 1996 executive share option scheme.
Each CAP 2004 award comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2004, no consideration was paid for the grant of the awards.
The awards vests in three equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards became exercisable on satisfaction of a primary performance condition and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The other two tranches of awards became exercisable following the results achieved in the 2008 and 2009 financial years when the profits exceeded those achieved in 2007 the year the primary performance target was met was again achieved but only to the extent that an additional performance condition was also achieved.
The scheme was potentially available to all employees.
The primary performance condition, broadly, required that the company achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of 57 million by no later than the financial year ending September 30 2008 and remain at least this level for two further vesting periods.
For the purposes of 2009 profits, redundancy costs were charged against profits for CAP purposes.
The additional performance condition requires that the profits of the respective participants businesses in the subsequent two vesting periods remain at least 75% of that achieved in the year the primary performance condition was met.
The CAP 2004 profit target was achieved in 2007 and the option pool of a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the primary performance condition, subject to the condition that no individual had an option over more than 10% of the option pool.
One third of the awards vested immediately.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2009 and, after applying the additional performance condition, approximately 1.5 million options from the third final tranche of options will vest in February 2010.
For those individual participants where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranches have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
The actual value of the second tranche of the CAP 2004 award to each director is set out in the directors share option table on pages 43 to 45.
The number of options received by the directors for the final tranche is provisional and will depend on the extent that the additional performance test has been met for their respective businesses.
The remuneration committee require the results of the businesses to be reviewed and subsequently modified for true-up adjustments during the period to December 31.
The provisional number of options anticipated to be received by the directors for the final tranche is given in the directors share option table on pages 43 to 45.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to calculate its value are set out in note 23.
1996 executive share option scheme The executive directors have options from a previous executive share option scheme approved by shareholders in 1996.
This scheme expired in 2006 and no share options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
These options are exercisable subject to certain performance conditions.
For options expiring on January 5 2010 the performance test set by the remuneration committee requires the growth in the companys earnings per share for the three consecutive financial years commencing from the year of grant to exceed the growth in the retail prices index by an average of 4% a year.
For all other options expiring after 2005, the performance condition set by the remuneration committee requires that the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the company exceeds that of the average TSR for the FTSE 250 index for the same period.
For the performance condition to be satisfied, the TSR of the company must exceed that of the FTSE 250 on a cumulative basis, measured from the date of grant of the option, in any four out of six consecutive months starting 30 months after the option grant date.
Internet Securities, Inc. ISI option scheme GG Mueller and NF Osborn are also participants in the Internet Securities, Inc. option scheme.
There are no performance conditions attached to these options.
Their options, all of which are fully vested and exercisable, are set out on page 46.
JC Botts was also a participant in the ISI option scheme and exercised his options during the year.
The market price at the date of exercise is determined by an independent financial valuation of Internet Securities, Inc.
Adjusted pre-tax profits are before goodwill amortisation and impairment, exceptional items, movements in acquisition option commitment values, imputed interest on acquisition option commitments, foreign exchange gains on losses on tax equalisation contracts on hedges of intra-group financing, foreign exchange loss on restructured hedging arrangements, the cost of the CAP itself and for 2009, after charging redundancy costs.

The remuneration committee seeks to minimise termination payments and believes these should be restricted to the value of remuneration for the notice period.
With the exception of Sir Patrick Sergeant, none of the non-executive directors has a service contract.
All executive service contracts are reviewed from time to time and updated where necessary.
A service contract terminates automatically on the director reaching his her respective retirement age.
Following an independent recommendation from the nominations committee, the board has resolved to extend PM Fallons retirement date under his service contract by two years to the date of the Annual General Meeting in 2012.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 41 COMPANY ACCOUNTS GROUP ACCOUNTS OUR PERFORMANCE OUR GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report continued Group pension contributions continued Under the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, the following pension benefits were earned by the directors: Increase Accrued annual Increase in in accrued pension at Transfer value Transfer value transfer value annual pension September 30 September 30 September 30 net of directors during the year 2009 2009 2008 contributions Director PM Fallon 1,000 9,000 170,000 170,000 PR Ensor 64,200 1,380,000 1,460,000 80,000 DC Cohen 1,900 26,900 410,000 380,000 30,000 CR Jones 5,100 35,800 490,000 410,000 80,000 The accrued annual pension entitlement is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to September 30 2009 and ignores any increase for future inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Transfer Values GN11 published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent a sum paid or payable to individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
During the year there was a change to the assumptions used to calculate transfer values, which made allowance for the expectation that members will live longer in retirement than had previously been assumed as well as reflecting a fall in long-term interest rates.
These changes contributed to the increase in transfer value net of directors contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The normal retirement age for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme is 62 years.
PM Fallons pension benefits relate to a deferred pension in the Mail Newspapers Pension Scheme for pensionable service between April 1 1978 and April 1 1986.
No further contributions have been made to this scheme by the group or PM Fallon.
Options granted relate to those that were issued under the second tranche of the CAP which vested on February 13 2009, three months following the announcement of the companys results.
The number of options granted to each director was provisional and was trued-up following adjustment for the allocation of options belonging to leavers and adjustments to profits of the respective directors individual businesses as required by the remuneration committee.
As such the actual number of options granted was different from that reported last year.
Options granted are those expected to be issued under the third tranche of the CAP which vest on February 12 2010, three months following the announcement of the companys results.
The number of options granted to each director is provisional and will require a true-up to reflect adjustments to the respective directors individual businesses profits between year end and December 31 2009 as required by the remuneration committee.
As such the actual number of options granted could vary from that disclosed.
The high and low share prices during the year were 3.80 and 1.47 respectively.
There were 428,075 options granted during the year 2008: 640,914.
The aggregate gain made by directors on the exercise of share options in the year was 1,188,869 2008: 2,100,777.
