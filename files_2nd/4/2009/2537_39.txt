DiRectORS RemuneRAtiOn RePORt For the year ended 27 September 2009 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee the Committee, which has been approved by the board of Britvic plc for submission to shareholders.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
It provides the companys statement of how it has applied the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration and is intended to communicate the companys policies and practices on executive remuneration to the companys major shareholders and relevant institutions.
In accordance with the Companies Acts 2006, a resolution will be submitted to the AGM to approve the Directors Remuneration Report.
MEMBERShIP OF REMUnERaTIOn COMMITTEE During the year, the Committee consisted wholly of independent Non-Executive Directors: Bob Ivell Chairman Michael Shallow Ben Gordon Gerald Corbett At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director attend the meetings of the Committee except when their own remuneration is under consideration.
Details of the attendance by Committee Members at Committee Meetings are shown in the Corporate Governance Report on page 41.
COMPOSITIOn anD TERMS OF REFEREnCE The Committees composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code and are available on the companys website or on request.
The Chairman of the board is a member of the Committee.
However, he absents himself from discussions when his own remuneration is under discussion.
The Committee meets not less than three times a year and has responsibility for: i making recommendations to the board on the groups policy on the remuneration of the companys Chief Executive, Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee: ii the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of the remuneration of the Chairman and of specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, including pension rights, any compensation payments and benefits: and iii the determination of awards under the companys employee share plans to the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee.
The Committee also ensures compliance with the Combined Code in this respect and takes into consideration the wider pay and employment conditions of the employees across the company.
aDvISORS The Committee has appointed an external consultant, Towers Perrin, to advise on executive compensation issues and in developing its performancerelated remuneration policy.
From time to time the company is also advised by Towers Perrin on other remuneration-related issues.
The following individuals also provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year: Paul Moody Chief Executive John Gibney Chief Financial Officer Doug Frost Human Resources Director Michael Mountford Head of Compensation & Benefits REMUnERaTIOn POLICy The remuneration policy with respect to Executive Directors has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to appropriate peer groups for base salary and incentive opportunity, respectively.
In the case of base salary, the Committee primarily considers mid-market data for a peer group of UK-listed companies of similar revenue size and scope to the company, in addition to consideration of pay levels at the few relevant companies in the UK food and beverage sector.
The Committees decisions are also informed by the performance of Executive Directors and the business and pay decisions elsewhere in the company.
The Committee believes that the remuneration of Executive Directors should comprise of an appropriate balance between base salary and performancerelated pay elements with the predominant proportion of potential reward being linked to performance.
In setting levels of incentive opportunity the Committee, therefore, also considers mid-market data on short and long-term incentive opportunity from a peer group of FMCG fast moving consumer goods and retail sector companies.
As a result, approximately three quarters of total remuneration excluding pension is performance-related for superior performance and approximately three-fifths of total remuneration is performance-related for on target performance.
The Committee constantly reviews remuneration policy to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the companys business operations and environment and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholder interests.
The Committee believes the pay policy described above, which also applied in 2008 09, remains appropriate and that it will continue for the time being.
REMUnERaTIOn OBJECTIvES The principal objective of the policy described above remains the same as in previous years and is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration, including incentive arrangements, which will reward successful execution of the companys short-term and long-term strategy.
The Committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries and incentive levels for the sector, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth plans of the company A reward structure that places an appropriate emphasis on short-term and long-term performance to support operating performance and to reward sustained longer-term performance Competitive incentive arrangements that are underpinned by a balance of operational and long-term performance metrics to provide both a focus on business performance and alignment with returns to the companys shareholders Britvic plc Annual Report 2009 43 Directors Remuneration Report continued COMPOnEnTS OF REMUnERaTIOn FOR 2009 10 Purpose Performance measure Positions the role and the individual fairly within Individual contribution and sustained value Base Salary a competitive market range derived from a peer in the business.

even split of relative TSR against a peer group of similar sector companies and average Return on Invested Capital ROIC.
REMUnERaTIOn In PRaCTICE Base Salary Salaries are reviewed annually to take account of market movement, individual contribution and increases elsewhere in the company.
Despite the strong continued performance of the business, the Committee has decided that due to the current uncertain economic climate there will be no salary increases for Executive Directors in January 2010.
Short-Term Incentive Plan Targets were approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year and were aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives for 2008 09.
Up to 70% of salary for the Chief Executive and 60% of salary for the Finance Director is payable for the achievement of target PBT, net revenue growth and free cash flow performance.
Up to a maximum of 140% and 120% of salary is payable for the achievement of exceptional performance targets for the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
For 2008 09, a bonus of 106% of salary for the Chief Executive and 90.9% of salary for the Finance Director was earned for above target performance against PBT and free cash flow but below target performance in net revenue growth.
Details of PBT and net revenue are shown on page 51 and free cash flow on page 53.
The Committee has decided that the key short-term operational drivers of the business for 2009 10 remain appropriate and therefore the same bonus structure as applied in 2008 09 should continue.
Therefore bonuses will be paid for achievement of performance targets based on PBT, net revenue growth and free cash flow and will be set at appropriately stretching levels.
The Committee has also decided to maintain the same target and maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in 2009 10 as applied in 2008 09.
Executive Share Option Plan Annual grants of options were made in 2008 09 at the discretion of the board over shares in Britvic plc at the market price at date of grant to senior executives 25 in total.
The level of option grant and the performance conditions are determined and reviewed by the Committee annually.
For 2008 09 the policy was to grant the options over shares worth 300% and 250% of annual salary to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
A performance condition is applied such that 25% of the grant vests for the achievement of EPS growth over the three-year performance period equivalent to RPI 3% per annum.
No awards will vest below this threshold level of performance.
For achievement of EPS growth equivalent to RPI 7% per annum over the same period, 100% of the grant will vest, with straight line vesting between threshold and maximum.
Options lapse to the extent that the performance condition is not achieved.
For 2009 10, the Committee has decided to maintain the same focus on long-term EPS growth and believes the current performance range remains sufficiently stretching in the context of the current business outlook and growth strategy of the company.
Performance Share Plan The annual grant of performance shares in 2008 09 was made at the discretion of the board to senior executives and managers 96 in total.
The awards normally vest at the end of the three-year performance period, to the extent that the performance condition is achieved, and lapse to the extent it is not achieved.
For 2008 09 the policy was to grant the equivalent of 100% of annual salary to Executive Directors, calculated on the basis of the market price at the date of grant.
In 2008 09, as detailed below, vesting of 50% of the award was subject to a TSR performance condition and vesting of the other 50% of the award was subject to a ROIC performance condition.
44 Britvic plc Annual Report 2009 For the TSR element of the 2008 09 awards to vest in full under this plan, the companys relative TSR must rank in the top quartile of the peer group of the following 22 similar sector companies over the same period: AG BARR Nichols Associated British Foods Northern Foods C&C Group Origin Enterprises Cadbury Schweppes Premier Foods Dairy Crest Reckitt Benckiser Diageo SABMiller Fuller Smith & Turner Smith & Nephew Glanbia SSL International Greencore Tate and Lyle Greene King Uniq Marstons Wetherspoon No awards will vest for performance below median, with 25% of the TSR element of awards vesting at median, rising to 100% at upper quartile on a straight-line basis.
For the ROIC element of the 2008 09 awards to vest in full under this plan, three-year average ROIC of 18.8% must be achieved or exceeded.
For the purposes of the PSP ROIC will be defined as Operating Profit after Tax divided by Average Invested Capital including Goodwill, expressed as a percentage.
25% of the ROIC element of awards will vest at three-year average ROIC of 16.8% rising to full vesting on a straight-line basis at ROIC of 18.8%.
No award will vest for three-year average ROIC below 16.8%.
For 2009 10, the Committee has also decided to maintain the focus on long-term relative TSR and ROIC.
The Committee believes that maintaining the ROIC performance target provides closer alignment with underlying financial performance than relative TSR growth alone, as well as providing an appropriate balance with the EPS growth targets set under the Option Plan.
In particular, the Committee believes that ROIC directly aligns pay with an appropriate balance between future investment and capital spending plans and the need to maintain appropriate margins in an uncertain trading environment over the next few years.
Following a review of the calibration of the performance conditions relating to the PSP, the Committee believes the TSR target detailed above remains appropriate.
The ROIC range for 2009 10 will be increased such that threshold vesting occurs at three-year average ROIC of 21.9% and full vesting occurs at three year ROIC of 23.2%.
Shareholding Guidelines To align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, a shareholding guideline is in place.
The guideline requires Executive Directors to acquire a shareholding equal to their annual salary within five years from IPO calculated at the IPO share price.
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares other than to finance the cost of exercising options and any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of long-term incentive plans, unless approved by the Committee, for example, in cases of financial hardship.
Retirement Benefits The Executive Directors currently participate in the defined benefit section of the Britvic Pension Plan the Plan.
The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Bonus payouts and other incentive awards are not pensionable.
The Executive Directors also currently participate in the Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme, the companys unfunded supplementary retirement benefits scheme.
Prior to the legislative changes on 6 April 2006 A-Day, the Top Up Scheme provided pension benefits above the previous HM Revenue & Customs HMRC earnings cap to which the Plan was subject.
Post A-Day, this earnings cap has been removed for future service within the Plan.
For pre A-Day service the earnings cap is maintained within the Plan and will be indexed by inflation in line with Treasury notification.
The Top Up Scheme is maintained to provide pension benefits above the earnings cap for pre A-Day service and to provide benefits above the new lifetime allowance for post A-Day service.
The defined benefit section of the Plan was originally designed broadly to provide a pension of two thirds of final salary at normal retirement age, along with life assurance, ill health and dependants pensions.
Following a strategic review of pension policy in 2007 08 the defined benefit rate of pension accrual for Executive Directors for service from 1 July 2008 onwards was reduced by one-third.
The cap on the rate of annual increase to pension in payment was also reduced to 2.5%, instead of the previous 5%, for pension in payment resulting from the reduced rate of pension accrual.
The defined benefit section of the Plan is closed to new entrants.
All new entrants are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Plan with similar life assurance, ill health and dependants pensions.
Other Benefits Executive Directors receive an annual car benefit or allowance and membership of the companys private medical healthcare plan.
