INTRODUCTION This last year has been one of the most challenging for remuneration in banking, following on from 2008 which was a year of unprecedented change and turmoil across the sector.
The committee is also aware that remuneration is a sensitive issue for society as well.
At the same time, the Group has been faced with the immense task of integrating the Lloyds TSB and HBOS businesses - one of the biggest integrations ever undertaken in the sector and where considerable progress has been made during the first year of the three year programme, as described elsewhere in this report.
In making decisions on remuneration, the remuneration committee has continually had to balance the current operating environment and the fact that the Group is in a loss making position with the need to motivate the executives to run the business in a way to maximise the returns for the shareholder, including the tax payer.
The committee has sought to strike this balance by maintaining the prudent approach to reward overall that it has adopted in previous years, whilst ensuring that the right incentives are in place to reward future performance.
At the same time the committee has during 2009 built on the work of 2008 to ensure that the Groups remuneration policy and arrangements comply with the FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration.
A PRUDENT REMUNERATION POLICY The committee reviewed very carefully the decisions made in respect of remuneration for 2009.
There were no salary increases for executives, executives waived any entitlement to annual incentives in respect of the 2008 performance year and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP opportunity was reduced from 2008 levels by up to 175 per cent of salary.
Awards under the annual incentive plan for 2009 have been made based on a rigorous assessment of performance against targets.
In reaching its decisions, the committee has sought to take into account the Groups performance against the main financial targets where the outcomes were better than expected as well as the delivery of a number of milestones that are a key part of the Groups medium term recovery plan.
It is important to note that 100 per cent of the award will be deferred into shares and released in 2012 unless subject to clawback at that time.
The committees approach has continued in the review of remuneration for 2010, with any decisions on remuneration discussed extensively by the committee and shareholders consulted ahead of any decisions made.
The committee does have concerns that by continuing to hold base pay levels at 2008 levels, remuneration for the executive directors is likely to become uncompetitive versus our peer group.
However, by adding the share price related element to the 2010 LTIP it is hoped that this will go some way to addressing this.
But this is an area that will be kept under close and continuous review by the committee and one where we will continue to engage with shareholders during 2010 as their views are essential in this debate.
Extensive work has been undertaken in 2009 and will continue in 2010 to ensure compliance with the FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration.
The terms of reference of the remuneration committee were revised during 2009 to extend the remit of the committee to include the overall remuneration policy and philosophy for all colleagues, whilst retaining direct responsibility for the remuneration for certain colleagues.
Divisional remuneration committees were introduced in 2009 to provide a robust framework for decisions on remuneration throughout the Group.
The role of risk in remuneration decision making has been formalised and the chief risk officer now attends remuneration committee meetings as appropriate and divisional and group risk officers are members of the divisional remuneration committees.
This work will continue in 2010 as the FSA refines its Code and takes into account the recommendations in Sir David Walkers review of corporate governance in UK banks and other financial industry entities.
The committee will take into account any change in disclosure requirements as they are formalised and reflect them in the 2010 report.
106 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued 2010 REMUNERATION DESIGN The committee has determined that the design of remuneration for 2010 will remain broadly as for 2009.
There will again be no base pay increases for executive directors in 2010, with base pay levels held at 2008 levels.
The structure and annual incentive opportunity remain unchanged from 2009.
The maximum LTIP opportunity has been increased from the 2009 level which reflected the extraordinary circumstances of that year.
However, the maximum level of award made to executive directors remains below 2008 levels, by up to 100 per cent of base salary and is lower than the historical sector average.
Performance conditions for the LTIP will continue to be based on EPS and economic profit, with an additional performance measure for 2010 related directly to achieving stretching share price performance over the next three years.
Following discussions with shareholders two key changes have been made to the proposed design of the 2010 LTIP.
Firstly the performance conditions have been made even more stretching.
Secondly, further alignment of the interests of the executive directors with those of the shareholders has been created through an additional requirement that any shares vesting in 2013 as a result of the share price performance element of the 2010 LTIP must be retained for a further two years.
Furthermore, and reflecting shareholder representation on this matter, the committee will review performance against the targets for the 2010 annual incentive plan at the end of the year, taking into account the overall operating performance of the business in determining how much of any bonus will be paid out.
The committee also reserves the right to exercise its discretion in reducing any payment that otherwise would have been earned, if they deem this appropriate.
CONCLUSION Our approach to remuneration has been developed with extensive input and consultation from both our shareholders and regulators during 2009 and the early part of 2010.
The remuneration committee believes that this approach strikes the best balance possible given the unique circumstances that exist for the Group at this time and the need to continue to motivate and retain the management team.
The committee believes that the approach this year achieves an appropriate balance between recognition of the sensitivity of the current environment and this longer term policy objective.
We therefore recommend this report to shareholders and ask for your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Dr Wolfgang Berndt Chairman, remuneration committee OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 18 The board 96 Report of the independent Shareholder information 261 auditors on the consolidated Group strategy 2 Divisional results 24 Directors report 98 Glossary 262 financial statements 126 Divisional overview 3 Our people 50 Corporate governance 100 Abbreviations 265 Consolidated financial Group performance 4 Corporate responsibility 52 Directors remuneration report 105 Index to annual report 266 statements 127 Group KPIs 5 Risk management 56 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 133 Chairmans statement 6 Five year financial summary 95 Report of the independent Group chief executives review 10 auditors on the parent Group chief executives Q&A 14 company financial statements 249 Marketplace trends 16 Parent company financial statements 250 107 Notes to the parent Lloyds Banking Group company financial statements 253 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 REMUNERATION DECISIONS FOR 2009 2010 KEY HIGHLIGHTS In 2010, our remuneration package will continue to have the same main elements as for 2009: Base salary Annual incentive Long-term incentive plan In addition, executive directors participate in pension arrangements and receive benefits such as life assurance and medical insurance.
The following key decisions have been made for 2009 2010 remuneration: 2010 base salaries for executive directors will continue to be frozen at 2008 levels At his own request the group chief executive waived his award under the annual incentive plan for 2009 Awards under the annual incentive plan for 2009 for executive directors amounted to between 150 per cent and 185 per cent of salary All awards under the annual incentive plan are deferred into shares and subject to clawback, with any awards released in 2012 LTIP award below historic award levels at a maximum of 275 per cent of salary subject to stretching performance conditions based on EPS, economic profit and the achievement of stretching share price targets Any shares vesting as a result of the element of the LTIP relating to the share price targets must be retained for a further two years post vesting The approximate make-up of the main components of our new package for executive directors on an expected value basis is shown below: Long-term incentive Based on a combination of performance targets comprising Paid in shares after 40% earnings per share, economic profit and the achievement of three years stretching share price targets Short-term incentive Based half on financial measures and half on a balanced Deferred into shares until 30% scorecard of non-financial measures 2012, subject to clawback Salary Based on role, market competitiveness, and performance Paid in cash 30% The split in the components in the above chart are for executive directors.
Comparable numbers for the group chief executive are: long term incentive 40 per cent, short term incentive 32 per cent and salary 28 per cent The 2010 package is designed to encourage a long-term and risk-based focus: Salary is a significant proportion of the total package, avoiding excessive leverage All incentives will be paid on a deferred basis at the end of three years Deferred annual incentive is subject to clawback: ie it is not released when information subsequently comes to light about the performance on which the incentive award is based, which had it been known prior to the determination of the awards would have affected the original award decision A combination of financial and non-financial measures encourages a long-term focus Economic profit, which is a risk-adjusted profit measure, is a core financial target target used in both the annual incentive plan and the LTIP Shares resulting from the vesting of the share price performance part of the LTIP must be retained for a further two years post vesting We believe that these arrangements are well aligned with the FSAs Code of Practice on Remuneration.
108 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT An essential component of our approach to remuneration is the governance process that underpins it.
This ensures that our policy is robustly applied and risk is managed appropriately.
The overarching purpose of the remuneration committee is to consider, agree and recommend to the board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is aligned to its long-term business strategy, its business objectives, its risk appetite and values, and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders.
The remuneration policy and philosophy covers the whole Group, but the committee pays particular attention to the top management group and those colleagues who perform significant influence functions for the Group and those who could have a material impact on the Groups risk profile.
The committees role is to ensure that these colleagues are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage them to enhance the performance of the Group and that they are rewarded for their individual contribution to the success of the organisation, whilst ensuring that there is no reward for excessive risk taking.
The committee determines the pensions policy for all colleagues and advises on other major changes to employee benefits schemes.
It also agrees the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the group chief executive and the chairman.
It has delegated power for settling remuneration for the chairman, the group executive directors, the company secretary and any group employee whose salary exceeds a specified amount, currently 350,000, and or whose short-term incentive opportunity exceeds 250,000.
The committee monitors the application of the authority delegated to the group executive committee and the divisional remuneration committees to ensure that policies and principles are being fairly and consistently applied.
The committee liaises with the risk oversight committee and the risk function in relation to risk-adjusted performance measures.
All the independent non-executive directors are invited to attend meetings if they wish, and they receive the minutes and have the opportunity to comment and have their views taken into account before the committees decisions are implemented.
The committees terms of reference are available from the company secretary and are displayed on the Groups website, www.
The committee met on 13 occasions during 2009, and the members were as follows: Dr Wolfgang Berndt chairman Sir Victor Blank until 14 September 2009 Sir Winfried Bischoff from 15 September 2009 Mr Philip Green until 23 October 2009 Sir Julian Horn-Smith Lord Leitch from 18 May 2009 Sir David Manning until 2 November 2009 Ms Carolyn McCall from 23 January 2009 until 31 December 2009 The committee welcomed Lord Leitch and Ms Carolyn McCall to the committee and Sir Winfried Bischoff, on his appointment as chairman of the Group.
We thank Sir Victor Blank, Mr Philip Green, Ms Carolyn McCall and Sir David Manning for their contributions to the committee during 2009 up until their departures from the Group.
We also thank all committee members for their commitment during the last year and attendance at the unprecedented number of meetings.
The committee appoints independent consultants to provide advice on specific matters according to their particular expertise.
Towers Perrin, Hewitt New Bridge Street and Kepler Associates were retained by the committee during 2009 to advise on various matters relating to executive remuneration.
In addition,  LLP PwC were also retained in 2009 specifically to complete the committees project to review executive remuneration arrangements in light of the acquisition of HBOS, given their particular expertise in the remuneration aspects of transactions.
This project had commenced in 2008.
As PwC are also the auditors to Lloyds Banking Group and to mitigate any threat to audit independence, Kepler Associates continue to be retained as the remuneration committees primary independent advisors, and were commissioned to provide comment on PwCs advice.
In addition to their advice on executive remuneration, during 2009 Towers Perrin also provided market remuneration data as well as other remuneration consulting services to the Group, Hewitt New Bridge Street provided pension consulting services.
During 2009, Alithos Limited continued to provide information on behalf of the committee for the testing of total shareholder return TSR calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price performance conditions for the Groups long-term incentive schemes.
Mr Daniels, Mrs Risley Group Human Resources Director and Ms Kemp HR Director, Total Reward provided guidance to the committee other than for their own remuneration.
Mrs Carol Sergeant Chief Risk Officer also attended the committee to advise on risk matters.
The remuneration committee ensures that appropriate remuneration and governance arrangements are in place throughout the organisation, with the Group functions providing an oversight role in the development of remuneration policy and practice below the senior executive population.
During 2009 as part of the review of compliance with the new FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration and the developing governance environment, the committee reviewed and adopted new terms of reference.
In addition divisional remuneration committees were established to ensure a strong oversight from the group remuneration committee into the divisions.

This report will be supported by independent commentary from the chief risk officer in the context of the Groups risk appetite and by positive assurance from each group executive director that all remuneration arrangements within their division function reflect fully the Groups overall approach to remuneration: and The chief risk officer will attend the remuneration committee for at least two meetings a year.
The role of the divisional remuneration committees is to ensure a strong oversight from the group remuneration committee into the divisions.
Specifically: The relevant group executive director will be accountable for the effective implementation of the remuneration policy in their division: The divisional remuneration committee, which will have representation from both divisional and group reward and risk functions, will ensure that the policy is effectively and efficiently executed in the division: Formal positive assurance through annual reporting as to how the remuneration policy is being applied across the group will be provided to the group remuneration committee from each divisional remuneration committee: and The divisional remuneration committee will be responsible for ensuring the effective governance of divisional specific remuneration arrangements, especially the design and outcome of short-term incentive bonus schemes.
We believe our approach is well aligned with the FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration but we will continue to work with the FSA to ensure ongoing compliance and implement changes as appropriate.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The Groups remuneration policy supports our business strategy, which is based on building long-term relationships with our customers and employees, and managing the financial consequences of our business decisions across the entire economic cycle.
The policy is to position base salaries to reflect the relevant market median and the total package is designed to enable upper quartile performance to be rewarded with upper quartile remuneration levels.
Overall the policy is designed to ensure that cost effective packages are provided which attract and retain executive directors and senior management of the highest calibre and motivate them to perform to the highest standards.
At the same time, the objective is to align individual rewards with the Groups performance, the interests of its shareholders, and a prudent approach to risk management.
In this way we balance the requirements of our various stakeholders: customers, shareholders, employees, and regulators.
We believe that this approach is in line with the Association of British Insurers best practice code on remuneration as well as the FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration, as the policy seeks to reward long-term value creation whilst not encouraging excessive risk taking.
We summarise below how each of these policy objectives is met by our remuneration packages.
Policy objective How achieved Building long-term We build relationships with our customers and people rather than viewing them as counterparties in a money-making relationships transaction and are in the process of extending this philosophy across the integrated Group.
This means that working for the Lloyds Banking Group should be about more than pay.
While our relationship with our people means that we will pay them fairly and competitively, our pay is positioned conservatively against the market and we will not seek to be among the highest payers in the sector.
In setting pay for executive directors, we take account of the terms and conditions applying to other employees of the Group.
Our incentive measures are not just financial.
Half of the annual incentive for executives is linked to a scorecard including how they perform against targets that measure how satisfied our customers are, and the extent to which our employees feel engaged with and committed to working for the Lloyds Banking Group, both of which are important foundations of a relationship-based strategy.
Managing the financial Economic profit is a key measure by which we manage our business.
This measure takes into account the level of capital consequences of our required to generate profits as well as the risks taken.
The same level of profit generated at lower risk results in higher business through the economic profit.
Economic profit also measures risk based on an assessment of how business will perform through the economic cycle economic cycle.
Therefore, for example, in good times, when default rates on loans are low, we adjust the economic profit measure downwards based on a higher average expected default experience over the economic cycle.
This encourages us to avoid business and funding strategies that are only profitable during boom times but turn bad in a recession.
Economic profit plays a prominent role in our incentive plans for executives, a role which was further enhanced in 2009, with its inclusion in the long-term incentive plan performance measures.
110 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Policy objective How achieved Aligning individual The majority of our executives pay is linked to stretching performance targets through annual and long-term rewards with Group incentives.
Performance measures on the annual incentive are directly aligned to the Groups financial and non-financial performance and performance.
shareholders Executives are aligned with shareholders through the long-term incentive plan, which pays out based on performance against Group targets over a three year period, and which is paid in shares to further improve alignment with shareholders.
This objective of aligning the interests of executives with those of shareholders throughout the economic cycle can be seen through the vesting outcomes of awards made to executives under the LTIP plans.
In 2009, historic LTIP and option plans from 1999, 2005 and 2006 lapsed as their performance conditions were not met.
The same outcome is envisaged for the 2007 LTIP with a performance period ending in 2010.
Executives are required to build up a holding in Lloyds Banking Group shares of value equal to 1.5 times salary for executive directors 2 times salary for the group chief executive.
They are expected to retain 100 per cent of the net-of-tax proceeds of the 2009 LTIP until they reach this target.
In addition they are required to retain any shares vesting from the share price performance element of the 2010 LTIP for a further two years post vesting.
Finally, we operate tough contract provisions whereby no executive has an entitlement to more than 12 months notice, compensation on termination is limited to basic salary, and any compensation is paid monthly over 12 months and is mitigated if the executive gets another job.
This approach avoids the risk of payment for failure.
These requirements are among the toughest in the FTSE 100.
A prudent approach to Economic profit measures profit relative to the risk taken to generate that profit.
Its use in our incentive plans therefore risk management encourages executives to take a prudent approach to risk.
We also have non-financial measures of performance against risk objectives in the plan for executives, which enables a more rounded assessment of risk-taking behaviour.
For the 2009 annual incentive we increased the alignment to long-term prudent risk management by deferring all of the award.
For executive directors any cash incentive earned will be deferred 100 per cent into shares and paid out in 2012.
If the performance that led to the incentive is found to be unsustainable during the deferral period, then some or all of the award may be forfeited.
We pay competitively but not excessively.
Our prudent approach to positioning compensation means that we reduce the incentives to take excessive risk for personal gain.
This means that we do not attract employees with an extreme appetite for risk.
We have a robust governance framework with an independent remuneration committee reviewing all compensation decisions.
This approach to governance and review is cascaded through the organisation.
Cost effective packages We aim to ensure that the totality of remuneration for executive directors is competitive against our benchmark to attract and retain groups.
These groups are other major UK banks, and also the top 20 companies in the FTSE 100, reflecting practices executives in comparably sized large UK companies across all sectors.
We aim to be competitively but conservatively positioned against the market.
We aim to choose incentive plan targets that are directly linked to the business strategy and priorities.
This not only ensures alignment with company performance, but also means that the targets are meaningful to executives and therefore motivating.
This ensures that incentive packages are valued by executives and are cost effective.
REMUNERATION FOR 2010 The remuneration committee undertook an extensive review of executive remuneration during late 2008 and into 2009 in light of the HBOS acquisition.
That review in conjunction with detailed consultation with shareholders led to the remuneration decisions for 2009.
The committee continued to review remuneration during 2009 in light of the FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration, the outcomes of the G20 meeting in September 2009 and Sir David Walkers review of corporate governance in UK banks and other financial industry entities.
This ongoing review process has found that the structure of the remuneration package, in particular the focus on risk through the long-term incentive plan measures and balanced scorecard, was well aligned with emergent best practice in the sector.
The review process has highlighted the concern on how to maintain an appropriately competitive incentive for the senior executives of the Group, following the significant reduction in incentive levels in 2009, whilst recognising the sensitivity of the operating environment and the fact that the Group is still in a loss-making position.
Following consultation with shareholders, the remuneration committee is proposing a package for 2010 that is closely based on the structure and principles of 2009, but with an additional LTIP performance measure based on the achievement of stretching share price targets.
With the addition of this performance measure, the maximum LTIP award for 2010 will be 275 per cent of salary, still 100 per cent of salary lower than the 2008 maximum level.
To achieve maximum vesting of this award, not only will stretching EPS and economic profit targets need to be achieved but also stretching share price targets.

The environment for remuneration in the banking sector remains very sensitive and the committee is aware of this.
Consistent with best practice, shareholders were fully consulted during the process and their views have been taken into account in the decisions the committee has made.
At the same time, the ongoing challenges of the HBOS integration to create the UKs leading consumer bank were also considered by the committee as is the need to retain and motivate the management team to build on the outstanding start made to this process in 2009.
BASE SALARY Basic salaries are reviewed annually, usually in December, taking into account individual performance and market information which is provided by Towers Perrin and supplemented with information from Kepler Associates as appropriate and then adjusted from 1 January of the following year.
The remuneration committee confirmed during the 2009 review that the FTSE 20 was the most appropriate comparator group to use to benchmark overall competitiveness of the remuneration package whilst taking particular account of the remuneration practice of our direct competitors, namely the major UK banks.
The FTSE 20 is regarded as providing a realistic and relevant comparison in terms of company size and complexity, as well as being a key market for talent.
However, in recognition of the current operating environment base salaries for 2010 remain unchanged from the salaries set for 2008.
Base salary increases for other employees across the Group will remain in line with any market movement, but will, in general be significantly lower than in previous years.
Name J E Daniels A G Kane G T Tate T J W Tookey H A Weir As at 1 January 2010 1,035,000 590,000 640,000 600,000 625,000 112 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN The combination of financial and non-financial measures, which support our prudent approach to managing risk, are retained in the annual incentive plan, whilst the operation of the plan is enhanced in order to increase the alignment between risk and reward still further.
The committee recognises the challenges of setting robust targets in the current operating environment.
Furthermore, the committee will review the performance against the targets for the 2010 annual incentive plan at the end of the year, taking into account the overall operating performance of the business in determining how much of any bonus will be paid out.
The committee reserves the right to exercise its discretion in reducing any payment that otherwise would have been earned, if they deemed this appropriate.
Consistent with the aim of ensuring that short-term financial results are only achievable sustainably, the committee has decided that the incentive will be deferred and released in tranches over a three year period.
The deferred incentive will be subject to 100 per cent clawback if the performance that generated the incentive is found to be unsustainable.
The maximum annual incentive opportunity remains unchanged at 200 per cent 225 per cent for the group chief executive of base salary for the achievement of exceptional performance targets.
The remuneration committee believes that the structure of the incentive in particular the use of risk-adjusted and non-financial measures has been highly successful in promoting a long-term focus within the senior management team.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD Given the extraordinary circumstances during 2008, the remuneration committee made a reduced maximum LTIP award of 200 per cent of salary in 2009, 175 per cent less than the maximum award for 2008.
For 2010, the remuneration committee continues to believe that it is appropriate to make LTIP awards below the maximum levels that the plan allows 400 per cent and less than the award levels for 2008 maximum award 375 per cent.
Notwithstanding the increased size and complexity of the Group since the HBOS acquisition and the concerns about retention and motivation, the committee believes that the current environment requires a demonstration of continued restraint in relation to remuneration.
At the same time, the committee believes in the importance of aligning shareholder and executive motivation and therefore it has approved maximum awards for the group chief executive and executive directors for 2010 of 275 per cent of base salary of which 200 per cent of the award will be based on the same performance conditions as for 2009, namely EPS and economic profit, with the remaining 75 per cent based on the achievement of stretching share price targets.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES In continuing with the same financial performance measures as for 2009, the remuneration committee has continued to create a focus on long-term performance, taking appropriate account of risk.
Performance targets have been set by reference to analysts expectations, internal business plans, competitive performance assessments and probability modelling.
Stretch performance will be equated to the remuneration committees assessment of an upper quartile performance level or greater.
Shareholders have been consulted on the targets and the targets have been made more stretching as a consequence of those discussions.
The details of the targets for the proposed measures are set out below: Earnings per share applying to award of 100 per cent of salary Earnings per share continues to be an important measure of our profitability and ability to generate cash.
The committee has therefore decided to retain this well-recognised measure in our incentive system.
For the EPS element of the award, performance will be measured based on EPS growth over a three year period from the baseline EPS of 2009.
EPS absolute Vesting percentage % improvement Threshold 25% 158% Maximum 100% 180% Economic profit applying to award of 100 per cent of salary The use of economic profit has been very successful in introducing a long-term, risk-based approach to managing our business.

PENSION As stated last year, in April 2012, all executive directors will transition to defined contribution pension arrangements with contributions of 25 per cent of base salary for the group chief executive and other executive directors, with no compensation for ceasing final salary accrual.
OTHER SHARE PLANS The executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Groups sharesave and shareplan schemes.
These are all-employee share schemes.
CHAIRMANS REMUNERATION The chairmans remuneration comprises salary and benefits.
He does not participate in the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements, nor is he entitled to pension benefits.
The chairmans salary was reviewed at the time of the appointment of Sir Winfried Bischoff in 2009.
The review took into account the market information and also the significant amount of time the chairman would be expected to focus on the Groups activities particularly during the current period.
The chairman was appointed on a salary of 700,000 per annum.
His salary will next be reviewed at the end of 2010, with any adjustments effective 1 January 2011.
INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES The fees of the independent non-executive directors are agreed by the board within a total amount determined by the shareholders.
Directors may also receive fees, agreed by the board, for membership of board committees.
The fees are designed to recognise the various responsibilities of a non-executive directors role and to attract individuals with relevant skills, knowledge and experience.
The fees are neither performance related nor pensionable and are comparable with those paid by other companies.
The annual fees from 1 January 2010 are unchanged and are listed below.
Board 65,000 Audit committee chairmanship 50,000 Audit committee membership 20,000 Nomination and governance committee membership 5,000 Remuneration committee chairmanship 30,000 Remuneration committee membership 15,000 Risk oversight committee membership 15,000 Independent non-executive directors who serve on the boards of subsidiary companies may also receive fees from the subsidiaries.
The fees paid in 2009 to the current non-executive directors are shown in the table in the following section.
114 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued REMUNERATION FOR 2009 2009 ANNUAL INCENTIVE SCHEME The annual incentive scheme for executive directors is designed to reflect specific goals linked to the performance of the business.
Incentive awards for executive directors are based upon individual contribution and overall corporate results.
Half of the incentive opportunity is driven by corporate performance based on the stretching target relating to profit before tax and economic profit.
The level of achievement against the targets for profit before tax and economic profit that results in the lower payout will determine the extent to which the target has been met.
The other half of the incentive opportunity is determined by divisional achievement driven through individual performance.
Individual targets relevant to improving overall business performance are contained in a balanced scorecard and are grouped under the following headings: Financial Franchise growth Customer service Risk People development These targets are weighted differently for each of the executive directors, reflecting differing strategic priorities.
The non-financial measures include key performance indicators relating to process efficiency, service quality and employee engagement.
The maximum annual incentive opportunity is 200 per cent 225 per cent for the group chief executive of basic salary for the achievement of exceptional performance targets.
The maximum payment under the corporate half of the annual incentive is only available if exceptional performance is achieved against the stretching corporate target.
An amount equal to 50 per cent of this element of the incentive is available on the achievement of the stretching corporate target.
Failure to achieve at least 90 per cent of the stretching target would result in no payment under the corporate half of the incentive.
In 2009, the Group delivered a resilient trading performance against the backdrop of a marked slow down in the UK economic environment and continued challenges in financial markets.
This has been a year of substantial achievement with the creation of a sound platform for future growth of the combined franchise.
Positive trends have been established in margins, costs and impairments.
The interest margin improved in the second half of the year and is expected to increase in 2010, with further improvements expected in subsequent years.
Costs fell by five per cent in the year as integration related savings have started to be realised, with 534 million of cost synergy savings in 2009.
Impairments peaked in the first half of the year, falling off by 21 per cent in the second half.
A similar rate of improvement is expected through 2010.
The Groups funding and liquidity positions were also strengthened during the year.
A number of actions were taken during the year to create a robust capital position, including the 4 billion ordinary share placing and compensating open offer in June and the successful 22.5 billion equity raising at the end of the year.
Franchise growth has been strong in both Retail and Wholesale and there has been a 48 per cent improvement in cross sales income from the Lloyds TSB customers.
There were strong levels of mortgage lending with over 34 billion of gross new lending.
The Lloyds TSB conservative approach to risk management has been implemented across the Group.
All new lending is within the Groups risk appetite.
Our employee engagement index has remained high through the year and has performed well against the UK norm.
Additionally a number of significant activities were delivered on during 2009 which were not anticipated when the targets were set.
These activities have contributed to placing the Group in the best position possible to grow and develop the combined franchise.
They include the largest ever capital raising and the successful conclusion of negotiations with the European Commission on State Aid.
These have all been achieved at the same time as delivering the business as usual agenda and the integration programme.
Any payments under the plan are deferred 100 per cent in shares until June 2012 and subject to claw back.
The calculation of the annual incentive plan payments for executive directors, based on the achievement of performance against targets in respect of performance in 2009, has been independently checked.

Under normal circumstances, awards are made of 300 per cent of salary with the additional 100 per cent available for circumstances that the remuneration committee deems to be exceptional.
In 2008, awards were made of 375 per cent of base salary to the chief executive and two of the executive directors for retention purposes, and in light of data reviewed by the committee which showed total remuneration to be behind median both for the FTSE 20 and the other major UK banks.
Further information viewed by the committee through 2008 continued to show that total remuneration for the executive directors was materially behind the median of our peer groups, even before allowing for the increased responsibilities of running the combined bank and the magnitude of the task of integrating the two businesses.
However, due to the external environment and following extensive consultation with shareholders, the committee determined that for 2009 the grant level for executive directors should be set at 200 per cent of base salary, 175 per cent less than the maximum award for 2008.
Details of the plan, including the specific performance conditions, can be found on page 124.

The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants on recruitment.
Pension accruals under the defined benefits scheme for Messrs Daniels and Kane will continue until April 2012.
Thereafter they will have the opportunity to either participate in a defined contribution scheme or to receive a cash supplement with no compensation for ceasing final salary accrual.
There is no entitlement to an immediate and unreduced pension should their employment be terminated before the normal date of retirement.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS The Groups policy is for executive directors to have service agreements with notice periods of no more than one year.
All current executive directors are entitled to receive 12 months notice from the Group, but would be required to give six months notice if they wished to leave.
Executive directors normally retire at age 60.
However, following the implementation of The Employment Equality Age Regulations 2006, they may now choose to delay their retirement until age 65.
It is the Groups policy that where compensation on early termination is due, it should be paid on a phased basis, mitigated in the event that alternative employment is secured, and that bonus payments should relate to the period of actual service, rather than the full notice period, and will be determined on the basis of performance.
Any entitlements under the pension scheme or equity plans will be in accordance with the scheme rules on leaving.

Retirement pensions accrue at rates of between 1 60 and 1 30 of basic salary.
For those directors who are members of a defined benefit pension scheme, pension will continue to accrue until 5 April 2012.
On 6 April 2012, defined benefit pension accrual will cease and directors will be offered the option to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme in operation at that date.
Alternatively, they may choose not to join the scheme and elect to receive a pension cash allowance.
Directors have a normal retirement age of 60.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum of four times salary is payable plus, for members of a defined benefit scheme, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members prospective pension.

Columns a and b represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the Group on 31 December 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Column c is the transfer value of the deferred pension in column a calculated as at 31 December 2009 based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant Lloyds TSB Group pension scheme.
The basic method used to arrive at the factors has not changed during the year.
Column d is the equivalent transfer value, but calculated as at 31 December 2008 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
Column e is the increase in pension built up during the year, recognising i the accrual rate for the additional service based on the pensionable salary in force at the year end, and ii where appropriate the effect of pay changes in real inflation adjusted terms on the pension already earned at the start of the year.
Column f is the capital value of the pension in column e. The disclosures in columns e and f are as required by the UK Listing Authority listing rules.
The requirements of the listing rules differ from those of the Companies Act.
The listing rules require the additional pension earned over the year to be calculated as the difference between the pension accrued at the end of the financial year and the pension accrued at the start of the financial year less the increase in the pension earned over the year solely due to inflation.
The transfer value in column f can differ significantly from the change in transfer value as required by the Companies Act because the additional pension accrued over the year calculated in accordance with the listing rules makes allowance for inflation, and the change in the transfer value required by the Companies Act will be significantly influenced by changes in the assumptions underlying the transfer value calculation at the beginning and end of the financial year.
Members of the Lloyds TSB Groups pension schemes have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Major changes to the legislation governing the provision of pensions in the UK known as pension simplification came into effect in April 2006.
Benefits from an approved pension scheme will be limited to the Lifetime Allowance, currently 1.75 million which is equivalent to an annual pension of 87,500.
Any benefit in excess of this amount will incur a tax charge for the individual.
The Group has agreed that if an executive director has benefits in excess of the Lifetime Allowance they may cease to accrue benefits in the Scheme and receive a salary supplement as an alternative.
This will not cost the Group more than the current arrangements.
The Group will not compensate any individual in respect of any increased tax liability arising from pension simplification.
To date, the executive directors affected have elected to continue to accrue benefits in the approved scheme.

If the Company is ranked first in the group, then 100 per cent of the option will be exercisable and if ranked tenth or below the performance condition is not met.
Options granted in 2004 became exercisable as the performance condition was met on the re-test.
The performance condition vested at 24 per cent for Mr Tates March option and at 14 per cent for all other options granted to executive directors during 2004.
March 2005 August 2005 That the Companys ranking based on TSR over the relevant period against a comparator group 15 companies including Lloyds Banking Group must be at least eighth, when 30 per cent of the option will be exercisable.
If the Company is ranked first to fourth position in the group, then 100 per cent of the option will be exercisable and if ranked ninth or below, the performance condition is not met.
Options granted in 2005 became exercisable as the performance condition was met when tested.
The performance condition vested at 82.5 per cent for all options granted to executive directors.
LLOYDS TSB PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN Under the plan, executive directors were required to defer 50 per cent of their bonus awards in 2006 into shares in the Company, known as bonus shares.
The number of bonus shares awarded was calculated after the deduction of income tax and national insurance from the deferred element of the bonus.
The bonus shares are held on behalf of the executive for a period of three years before release.
Executives received a further award of performance shares on the basis of two performance shares for each bonus share.
The receipt of the performance shares is dependent on the satisfaction of a TSR performance condition measured over three financial years of the Company.
The following table details the number of bonus and performance shares released in respect of their 2005 bonus.
Performance shares awarded Performance conditions March 2006 That the Companys ranking based on TSR over the relevant period against a comparator group 15 companies including Lloyds Banking Group must be at least eighth for any shares to be received.
If ranked ninth or below no shares would be received.
The maximum of two performance shares for each bonus share will be awarded only if the Company is first in the comparator group: one performance share will be awarded for each bonus share if the Company is placed fifth: and one performance share for every two bonus shares if the Company is placed eighth.
Between first and fifth positions and fifth and eighth positions a sliding scale will apply.
Whilst income tax and national insurance was deducted from the deferred bonus before the conversion to bonus shares, where a match of performance shares is justified, these shares will be awarded as if income tax and national insurance had not been deducted.
This maintains the original design of the plan prior to the issue of guidance from HM Revenue & Customs in December 2004.
The performance condition attached to the March 2006 award was not met, with Lloyds Banking Group ranked in ninth place.
Bonus shares were released on 20 March 2009, at which time the performance shares lapsed.

LTIP award Performance conditions May 2006 For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the percentage increase in earnings per share of the Group on a compound annualised basis over the relevant period must be at least an average of 6 percentage points per annum greater than the percentage increase if any in the retail price index over the same period.
If it is less than 3 per cent per annum, the EPS Award will lapse.
If the increase is more than 3 per cent but less than 6 per cent per annum, then the proportion of shares released will be on a straight line basis between 17.5 per cent and 100 per cent.
The relevant period commenced on 1 January 2006 and ended on 31 December 2008.
For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award it will be necessary for the Groups TSR to exceed the median of a comparator group 14 companies over the relevant period by an average of 7.5 per cent per annum for the TSR Award to vest in full.
17.5 per cent of the TSR Award will vest where the Groups TSR is equal to median and vesting will occur on a straight line basis in between these points.
Where the Groups TSR is below the median of the comparator group, the TSR Award will lapse.
When tested at the end of the relevant performance period, neither the EPS nor the TSR performance conditions were met and all awards made in 2006 lapsed.
March 2007 For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the performance condition was as described for May 2006 with the relevant performance period commencing on 1 January 2007 and ending on 31 December 2009.
For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award the performance condition was as described for May 2006 with the relevant performance period commencing on 8 March 2007 the date of award and ending on 7 March 2010.
March and April 2008 For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the performance condition was as described for May 2006 with the relevant performance period commencing on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2010.
For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award the performance condition was as described for May 2006 with the relevant performance period commencing on 6 March 2008 the date of the March award and ending on 5 March 2011.
April 2009 EPS: The release of 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the extent to which the growth in EPS achieves cumulative EPS targets over the three year period.
Economic profit: The release of the remaining 50 per cent of shares will be dependent on the extent to which Lloyds Banking Group achieves cumulative Economic Profit targets over a three year period.
The EPS and economic profit performance measures applying to this 2009 LTIP award were set on the basis that the Group would enter into GAPS.
Now that the Group is not participating in GAPS, the remuneration committee has determined that these performance measures will be restated on a basis consistent with the EPS and economic profit measures used for the 2010 LTIP awards.
This restatement will be undertaken in 2010.
The current targets prior to restatement are: EPS Vesting Growth in EPS Threshold 25% 55% Maximum 100% 81% Economic profit Vesting Absolute Improvement in EP Threshold 25% 100% Maximum 100% 185% OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 18 The board 96 Report of the independent Shareholder information 261 auditors on the consolidated Group strategy 2 Divisional results 24 Directors report 98 Glossary 262 financial statements 126 Divisional overview 3 Our people 50 Corporate governance 100 Abbreviations 265 Consolidated financial Group performance 4 Corporate responsibility 52 Directors remuneration report 105 Index to annual report 266 statements 127 Group KPIs 5 Risk management 56 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 133 Chairmans statement 6 Five year financial summary 95 Report of the independent Group chief executives review 10 auditors on the parent Group chief executives Q&A 14 company financial statements 249 Marketplace trends 16 Parent company financial statements 250 125 Notes to the parent Lloyds Banking Group company financial statements 253 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 AUDITED INFORMATION April 2009 Synergy Savings: The release of 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the achievement of target run-rate Integration award synergy savings in 2009 and 2010 as well as the achievement of sustainable synergy savings of at least 1.5 billion by the end of 2011.
The award will be broken down into three equally weighted annual tranches.
Performance will be assessed at the end of each year against annual performance targets based on a trajectory to meet the 2011 target.
The extent to which targets have been achieved will determine the proportion of shares to be banked each year.
Any release of shares will be subject to the remuneration committee judging the overall success of the delivery of the integration programme.
Integration Balanced Scorecard: The release of the remaining 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the outcome of a Balanced Scorecard of non-financial measures of the success of the integration in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The Balanced Scorecard element will be broken down into three equally weighted tranches.
The tranches will be crystallised and banked for each year of the performance cycle subject to separate annual performance targets across the four measurement categories of Building the Business, Customer, Risk and People and Organisation Development.
Performance against the first year of the award has been assessed and all targets have been met or exceeded.
Alithos Limited provided information for the testing of the TSR performance conditions for the Companys long-term incentive schemes.
EPS is the Groups normalised earnings per share as shown in the Groups report and accounts, subject to such adjustments as the remuneration committee regards as necessary for consistency.
OTHER SHARE PLAN LLOYDS TSB GROUP EXECUTIVE SHARE PLAN 2003 Mr Tookey was granted an option under this plan to acquire 35,305 ordinary shares in Lloyds Banking Group plc.
The option was not subject to any performance condition but would normally have become exercisable only if he remained an employee, and had not given notice of resignation, as at 19 April 2009.
As Mr Tookey remained an employee, the option vested on 19 April 2009, and was exercised on 8 May 2009.
In addition, on 26 March 2008 prior to his appointment as an executive director, Mr Tookey was granted an award under the Lloyds TSB Executive Retention Plan 2006.
The award is satisfied in cash only and, subject to continued employment, gives Mr Tookey the right to receive an amount equal to the value of 141,880 Lloyds Banking Group shares on the date of vesting.
The award was adjusted on 2 July 2009 as a result of the placing and compensatory open offer.
The award vests as to 50 per cent on 26 March 2011 and 50 per cent on 26 March 2013.
Mr Tookey has agreed to reinvest the cash proceeds into Lloyds Banking Group shares.
As an executive director, he is no longer eligible to be granted awards under this plan.
None of those who were directors at the end of the year had any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc or its subsidiaries.
The register of directors interests, which is open to inspection, contains full particulars of directors shareholdings and options to acquire shares in Lloyds Banking Group.
