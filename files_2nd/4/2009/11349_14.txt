Directors remuneration report In this report, which will be submitted for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 30 July 2009, we describe how the executive directors are remunerated.
Those parts of the Remuneration Report which are subject to audit by Ernst & Young are marked audited.
The Remuneration Committee The role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee determines the remuneration and terms of employment of the Chairman of the Company, executive directors of NWG and NWL and a further seven senior managers, in accordance with a remuneration policy approved by the Board.
The terms of reference for the Committee are published on our website at www.
co. uk in the about us: corporate governance section or a copy can be requested from the Company Secretary.
The Committee is always available to engage with major shareholders and their representatives to discuss remuneration matters, although no such approaches were received in 2008 09.
Remuneration Committee members The Committee members are Martin Ngre Chairman, Sir Patrick Brown, Alex Scott-Barrett, who are all considered by the Company to be independent, and Sir Derek Wanless.
The membership of the Committee was, therefore, compliant with the Combined Code throughout the year.
Martin Parker, the Company Secretary, is secretary to the Committee.
External advice The Committee continued to receive advice during the year from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS and also from the Managing Director although never about his own remuneration.
HNBS was paid 15,825 for these services in 2008 09 and continues to assist the Committee in maintaining best practice in relation to remuneration.
HNBS does not provide any other service to the Company.
The Committees work in 2008 09 The Committee met three times during the year with 100% attendance by all members, except Sir Derek Wanless who attended two meetings, to: N agree bonus payments for 2007 08: N agree salaries for 2009 10: N determine the vesting percentage to be applied to the LTIP awards made on 9 December 2005, which vested on 9 December 2008: N grant LTIP awards on 15 December 2008 to vest on 15 December 2011 : and N set performance targets for executive directors and senior managers.
As the Committee works closely with NWLs remuneration committee, Committee papers and minutes are circulated to all NWL and NWG non-executive directors, who can give their views direct to the Committee Chairman and can attend meetings if they wish.
Remuneration policy The Committee considers the principles and provisions of the Combined Code when setting its policy and believes it is fully compliant.
The policy of the Company, which applied throughout 2008 09 and applies for 2009 10 and subsequent financial years, is to provide remuneration that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the Company successfully, while paying fairly.
Although HNBS provides the Committee with detailed comparative data on other companies in the sector, the Committee is aware of, and avoids the risk of, remuneration being ratcheted up as a result of benchmarking exercises.
Consistent with its fair pay policy, when considering the remuneration packages of senior executives and directors, the Committee takes into account pay awards to other employees in the Group.
The Committee also considers environmental, social, risk management and governance issues when setting remuneration terms.
54 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 The remuneration policy of the Committee is: N that the setting of base salaries is largely inuenced by individual contributions and internal relativities rather than external comparators although for 2009 10 the Committee has been inuenced by general economic conditions : N that the annual bonus plan recognises the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders shareholders, customers and employees rather than being focused solely on profit: and N that management shares in the longer term value created for the Companys investors, but equity incentive schemes should only reward if there is clear outperformance of the market and other relevant companies.
Elements of remuneration The remuneration of the executive directors comprises: N basic salary: N benets including pension and participation in the Companys SIP : N a performance related annual bonus: and N annual LTIP awards.
In addition to reviewing each constituent element, the Committee reviews the remuneration packages as a whole to ensure that they remain appropriate in terms of structure, gearing and quantum.
The chart below shows the composition of the Managing Directors remuneration as a percentage of basic salary both at target and maximum levels of performance.
Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of LTIP awards.
Fixed Pay Variable Pay Target Maximum 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 250% 300% N Basic salary N Pension and benets N Annual bonus N LTIP Basic salary and benets Basic salary is reviewed annually based on individual contributions and internal relativities.
The Committee also has regard to market practice in other quoted water companies and similar sized companies more generally.
Current basic salaries, together with the previous years salaries, are set out below: As at As at 1.4.
2008 John Cuthbert 295,000 295,000 Chris Green 225,000 225,000 The basic salaries of the executive directors have not been increased for 2009 10 in recognition of the fact that RPI at the date of the review was zero.
All other employees have been awarded a 3% increase in line with the November 2008 RPI in basic pay for 2009 10.
Benets provided to the executive directors comprise membership of a dened benefit pension scheme, car allowance and healthcare.
55 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Directors remuneration report continued Pensions The main features of the Northumbrian Water Pension Scheme are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Basic salary is the only pensionable element of the executive directors remuneration packages.
The executive directors pensions were modied with effect from 1 January 2008, in line with the changes proposed for the pension scheme as a whole, and the executive pension arrangements were closed to new entrants on that date.
The accrued dened benefit pensions and corresponding transfer values for the executive directors are set out in Table 5 on page 62.
Annual bonus The annual bonus plan has been designed to reect the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders.
Consistent with prior years, maximum annual bonus potential for the executive directors for 2009 10 is 70% of salary, which is apportioned as follows: 20% 40% 5% 5% N Shareholders profit before tax PBT N Customers Ofwats Overall Performance Assessment OPA rating N Employees percentage lost time through sickness N Bespoke personal targets Actual performance against the 2008 09 targets was as follows: John Cuthbert Chris Green Max bonus Actual bonus Actual bonus Bonus metric % of salary % of salary % of salary PBT 40 OPA rating 5 1.0 1.0 Percentage lost time through sickness 5 1.5 1.5 Bespoke personal targets 20 15.0 15.0 Total 70 17.5 17.5 51,62539,375 Notes: 1.
The PBT bonus is based on actual PBT performance compared to the budget PBT set by the Board at the beginning of the year.
PBT has been chosen because it is a primary financial measure for the Company, for which the executive directors are accountable.
NWLs estimated OPA score for 2008 09 is 356, against a range for bonus purposes of 341 to 419, being the published range of performance across the ten water and sewerage companies in 2007 08.
NWLs score was adversely affected by sewer ooding.
The year end percentage of time lost through sickness was 2.94%, against a range for bonus purposes of 2.6% to 3.1%.
In 2008 09, John Cuthberts personal targets related principally to managing the PR09 process, maintaining key financial ratios and measures, ensuring that good relationships are maintained with major investors and analysts, implementing the agreed approach to succession planning, ensuring that investment needs are properly quantied and the investment programme is delivered with regulatory outputs met and identifying further opportunities to impact the cost base of NWL and improve its efficiency ranking.
Chris Greens personal targets were focused mainly on managing the PR09 process, maintaining key financial ratios and measures, relationships with major investors and analysts, positioning NWL to respond to Ofwats proposals on accounting separation, ensuring that investment needs are properly quantied and the investment programme is delivered with regulatory outputs met and identifying further opportunities to impact the cost base of NWL and improve its efficiency ranking.
The Remuneration Committee has decided that, in respect of the bonus for 2009 10 and beyond, the calculation of PBT performance will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any variance between the actual and budget interest charge on index linked bonds issued by Northumbrian Water Finance plc, which depends entirely on RPI in July of each year and is, therefore, outside of management control.
56 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual conditional awards of shares in the Company worth up to 100% of annual salary at grant, although only the executive directors participate at this level.
All awards have three year pre-vesting performance conditions.
These are described in detail below but, in summary, the current policy is for half of an award to be subject to relative total shareholder return TSR performance against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and the other half to be subject to a relative return on capital target as monitored by Ofwat.
The Committee, with advice from HNBS, has reviewed the LTIP and is still of the view that it remains the most appropriate equity incentive plan, particularly in the light of the Companys dividend policy.
TSR remains an appropriate performance measure because it ensures that executives are rewarded fairly for value created for the Companys investors.
Relative return on capital employed was chosen as a complementary measure because: N it directly compares NWLs financial performance against that of its peers: N it is objectively measured and veried by a third party Ofwat : N there is no subjectivity in determining what level of return would be a good and excellent result it being a relative measure to which quartile analysis is applied : and N the comparative approach should be able to deal with the five year pricing reviews without the Remuneration Committee having to reset targets.
On 15 December 2008, the Remuneration Committee granted the following LTIP awards: Number of Face value conditional of awards awards granted as a granted % of salary John Cuthbert 103,100 88% Chris Green 78,650 88% Based on a closing share price on 15 December 2008 of 251.5 pence.
For the awards set out above, the three years to be reviewed are 2008 09, 2009 10 and 2010 11.
Over the three year performance period, the return on capital employed will be calculated on a compounded annualised return basis.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance is consistent with the underlying business performance of the Company.
An independent rm is engaged by the Committee to calculate the TSRs and to assess the extent to which the performance conditions have been met, so that the process is rigorous and transparent.
In the event of a change of control, the Committee would determine the extent to which the performance conditions had been met and the proportion of the performance period that had elapsed in deciding whether or not any vesting of awards would take place.
The LTIP award, granted on 9 December 2005, became available to vest on 9 December 2008.
The Committee instructed  PwC to assess the level of vesting of this award.
PwC reported that 29.7% of the award was available to vest being 99% of the award relating to the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index and 0% of the award relating to the Companys TSR performance against the other listed water companies.
Prior to vesting, the Committee satisfied itself that the recorded TSR performance was a genuine reection of the Companys underlying performance.
Details of the number of awards which lapsed and those which were exercised by the directors of the Company are shown in Table 3 on page 61.
Full details of award levels and performance conditions are shown in Table 2 on pages 60 and 61.
Responsible investment The Committee is aware of Guideline 3.2 of the ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure and is satisfied that neither the executive directors annual bonus targets nor the LTIP performance conditions are likely, inadvertently, to motivate irresponsible behaviour.
57 Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Directors remuneration report continued Non-executive directors fees The Companys remuneration policy is that the Chairman and the non-executive directors should receive a xed fee for their normal duties.
Reecting the added responsibilities and time commitment, chairing the Remuneration and Audit Committees attracts an additional fee over the non-executive directors standard base fee.
Fees payable during 2008 09 and the Companys policy from 1 April 2009 in line with the approach taken in respect of the salaries of the NWG executive directors are: 2008 09 2009 10 Chairman 157,500157,500 Non-executive director base fee 36,75036,750 Audit Committee chairing fee 10,50010,500 Remuneration Committee chairing fee 5,2505,250 The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not receive benets in kind and do not participate in bonus, pension or share schemes operated by the Company.
Further details of non-executive directors remuneration are set out in Table 1 on page 60.
Directors interests in LTIP awards The directors conditional interests in the ordinary 10 pence shares of the Company, awarded in accordance with the terms of the LTIP as at 31 March 2009, are set out in Table 3 on page 61.
Ordinary 10 pence shares required to full LTIP awards which have vested may be provided by the Northumbrian Water Group plc Employee Trust, through Northumbrian Water Share Scheme Trustees Limited.
The Trustees are Sir Patrick Brown, Martin Ngre and Anita Frew a non-executive director of NWL.
At 31 March 2009, the Trust held a total of 1,038,252 ordinary 10 pence shares.
This represents 0.2% of the Companys total issued share capital, so is materially less than the 5% limit on shares that can be held in trust.
In line with the ABI Guidelines, dividends are waived on these shares and the voting rights attached to these shares will not be exercised at the AGM.
Share dilution The Companys share plans contain dilution limits that comply with the ABI Guidelines.
Shares for both the LTIP and SIP schemes are provided by purchase on the market.
There has, therefore, been no dilution to date and there is no commitment to issue new shares in relation to either scheme.

Table 2 Summary of LTIP performance conditions unaudited LTIP award made 9 December 2005 Maximum award 75% of salary permitted.
Actual grants to executive directors related to shares worth 70% of salary.
Performance conditions Comparison of TSR with two comparator gr oups over three years: 1 70% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against other listed water companies: AWG plc, Bristol Water Group plc, East Surrey Holdings plc, Kelda Group plc, Pennon Group plc, Severn Trent plc and United Utilities plc: and 2 30% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
East Surrey Holdings plc fide-listed on 28 October 2005, Bristol Water Group plc fide-listed on 18 May 2006, AWG plc fide-listed on 21 December 2006 and Kelda Group fide-listed on 12 February 2008.
These companies have been left in the comparator group for the purpose of the awards and their performance was frozen on the date each company fide-listed.
This means that a constant TSR has been applied at each date after the fide-listing.
Vesting schedules 1 30% vests at median performance and 100% if the Company tops the group.
Between median and upper quartile, the vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis comparing the Companys TSR to that of the median and upper quartile positions.
Where the Companys TSR performance is below the median, none of that element of the award will vest.
2 30% vests at median performance with straight line pro-rating of TSR performance against the members of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, to 100% for upper quartile performance.

Calculated as at 2 June 2009 and rounded to nearest whole month.
The service contracts of the executive directors do not contain provisions relating to compensation for termination.
In the event of termination by the Company, the Remuneration Committee would make recommendations to the Board on what payments, if any, should be made to the director, depending on the circumstances of the termination, taking into account the Combined Code which discourages payment for failure.
The Company would also expect directors to seek to mitigate their loss.
Contracts do not provide for compensation for loss of ofce in excess of fees accrued.
Table 5 Directors pensions and pension benets audited The accrued dened benefit pensions and corresponding transfer values for the executive directors are set out below: Transfer value of net increase Transfer Transfer Total change Increase in in accrued value of value of in transfer Accrued Accrued Increase in accrued pension less accrued accrued value less pension at pension at accrued pension net directors pension at pension at directors 31.3.
Accrued pensions shown are the amounts that would be paid annually at the normal retirement age based on service to the end of the year.
Voluntary contributions paid by the directors and resulting benets are not shown.
The change in transfer value reects uctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as changes in stock market conditions.
The transfer values have been calculated in line with the relevant legislation and using actuarial assumptions agreed by the Trustee.
The directors participate in a salary sacrifice arrangement and, therefore, paid no contributions to the scheme during the year.
