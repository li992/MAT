Directors remuneration policy continued Under the terms of the Scheme, the fourth allocation of conditional shares, to a maximum face value of 125% of base salary, will be made on or after 23 November 2009.
The committee has reviewed the performance criteria and has determined that this allocation will again be measured against compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share, in the range of 5% to 11% at the end of the performance period in September 2012.
Other benefits Executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully expensed company car, private medical insurance, life assurance, home and mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The taxable value of these benefits is included in the table of directors remuneration below.
Directors remuneration Executive directors salaries were reviewed on 1 December 2008 in accordance with normal policy.
George Westons salary was increased by 4.24% to 860,000 and John Basons salary was increased by 5.0% to 577,500.
Executive directors salaries are next subject to review on 1 December 2009 but increases, if any, are expected to be modest.
The board reviews non-executive directors fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors.
Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of days worked.
The current fee for a non-executive director is 54,000 per annum.
The chairman of the Audit committee and the Senior Independent Director are paid an additional fee of 10,000 per annum.
The Chairman is paid an annual fee of 300,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys annual or long-term incentive plans and take no part in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.
No adjustments were made to the fees in December 2008, but the next review will take place in December 2009.
The remuneration paid to all directors for the year to 12 September 2009 was as follows: For the year to 12 September 2009 Salary Annual 2009 2008 or fees bonus Benefits total total 000 000 000 000 000 Non-executive directors Martin Adamson retired 21 April 2009 167 167 266 Charles Sinclair Chairman from 21 April 2009 159 159 Galen Weston Lord MacGregor retired 12 Mike Alexander retired 10 Tim Clarke 64 64 59 Lord Jay 54 54 52 Javier Ferrn 54 54 52 Peter Smith 64 64 61 Executive directors George Weston 832 1,165 14 2,011 1,727 John Bason 552 780 24 1,356 1,167 2008 9 bonus to be paid in December 2009 for the financial year 2008 9.

Directors pensions The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary, defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
The Company pension schemes are HMRC approved but the executive directors also have entitlements under employer-financed arrangements which are unregistered.
Directors pension disclosure for year ended 12 September 2009 The table below shows the defined benefit pension entitlements from the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme the ABF Scheme, and employer-financed arrangements where appropriate, of executive directors of Associated British Foods plc who were members of the ABF Scheme during the year ended 12 September 2009.

Pension accruals A and C relate to the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of year or earlier retirement.
The pension values E, F and G are transfer values calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and without making any deduction for any underfunding.
The value of net increase in pension E represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting from additional service and increases in salary.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation B after deducting the directors contribution during the year D. 4.
The change in the transfer value H includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements.
The directors contributions during the year D are excluded from this value.
Both directors opted out of the ABF Scheme on 5 April 2006 and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme EFRBS.
The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF scheme and the EFRBS.
Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Pension benefits include a 50% spouses pension.
Pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI, limited each year to 5% for service accrued to 31 December 2007, and 2.5% for benefits accrued post 1 January 2008.
Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45 Directors report Governance Remuneration report Remuneration report continued 6 Directors share options There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted: The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme requires options granted to be held for five years before they become exercisable, at which point they are not subject to any performance criteria: and The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme, under which options granted become exercisable by participants after an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied.
Performance criteria are based on robust levels of business performance over the period.
It has been agreed that share option awards will not form part of the normal remuneration package for executives, although the Remuneration committee reserves the right to grant share options on a very selective basis.
The number of share options held by the directors under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were as follows: Earliest normal Options as Lapsed in Exercised Options as Exercise exercise Expiry Exercise Price on at 13.09.08 year during year at 12.09.09 price date date date exercise George Weston 22,500 22,500 484p 17.01.04 16.01.11 John Bason 50,000 50,000 484p 17.01.04 16.01.11 50,000 50,000 497p 07.12.06 06.12.11 50,000 50,000 564p 09.12.07 08.12.12 Granted under The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme.
