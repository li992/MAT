Dilution Investor guidelines recommend that the number of newly issued shares used to satisfy awards under all share plans over any ten-year period should be limited to 10% of a companys issued share capital.
If all options granted had become exercisable on 31 December 2009 and new issue shares had been used to satisfy all exercises, the dilution would have been 4.37% of issued share capital.
Options granted under the 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme have the following performance condition attached: 37 Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of option grants exercisable 3% Up to 0.5x salary 3% to 5% 0.5 to 1x salary pro rata on a straight-line basis 5% to 10% 1 to 2x salary pro rata on a straight-line basis 10% to 15% 2 to 3x salary pro rata on a straight-line basis For options granted in 2003 and 2004, the performance condition may be retested once after the fourth year.
Retesting is not permitted for options granted since 2004.

It was possible to retest the conditions annually over the life of the option if they were not achieved after three years, in each case measuring from the same base point.
Other than as noted above, no directors or members of their immediate families have exercised or sold options during the year.
In addition, other than as noted above, no options have been granted, expired or lapsed during the year in respect of the directors.
The middle market price of the ordinary 5p shares of the Company as derived from the Stock Exchange Daily Of cial List on 31 December 2009 was 119.40p and the range during the year was 67.50p to 119.90p.
The share price on 17 March 2010, the latest practicable date prior to signing of the Annual Report and Accounts, was 127.6p.

In respect of Adrian Chedore, all options outstanding will vest at the end of the performance period subject to achievement of the performance conditions, except those granted in 2008 where up to two-thirds may vest to the extent that performance conditions have been met, and remain exercisable for a period of one year from 31 December 2009.
The number of shares shown represents the maximum number of shares which is capable of vesting at the end of the performance period, if the performance conditions are satis ed to the fullest extent.
The performance conditions for all outstanding awards are set out in the policy section of this report on pages 33 and 34.

Performance graph The following graph illustrates the Companys TSR between 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2009 relative to the FTSE All Share Media Index.
Aegis Group plc is a member of the FTSE All Share Media Index and the Remuneration Committee considers that a comparison of the Companys TSR relative to similar businesses is more appropriate than a comparison with a general FTSE Index, in order to reduce the impact of general stock market trends.
