68 Directors remuneration Dear fellow shareholder, introduction I would like to introduce our Directors remuneration report for 2009.
Over the following pages we set out the principles and practice for Director remuneration, with information on what has been paid to whom and why.
Throughout the report you will see a clear alignment between the rewards for Directors and the relative performance of the Company against a set of independent industry benchmarks.
As a Board we strongly believe that a remuneration policy should be aligned to shareholders interests and we are committed to operating with transparency: in line with this commitment we have provided a question and answer section with concise responses to some of the most common queries.
David Rough Chairman, Remuneration Committee Who serves on the Remuneration Committee?
The Committee is chaired by David Rough Senior Independent Non-executive Director who replaced Alison Carnwath as Chairman of the Committee upon her appointment as Chairman of the Company in November 2008.
The other members are Alison Carnwath and independent Non-executive Directors Sir Stuart Rose and Bo Lerenius.
The Human Resources Director provides information and advice to the Committee and takes independent advice from specialist advisors.
The Chief Executive and Human Resources Director are invited to attend meetings but no Executive Director is involved in any decisions relating to their own remuneration.
What are the Companys principles in terms of remuneration for Directors?
Our pay and rewards should attract the best people to the business and incentivise them to produce superior returns for our shareholders.
Therefore we believe we should reward people for achieving and exceeding Company targets.
This is why a substantial part of our Executive Directors reward is performance-related pay, with incentives to exceed industry benchmarks.
There are three key elements to the remuneration we provide: Salaries reflect an individuals consistent performance and contribution to the business, as defined and decided by the Remuneration Committee.
We aim to pay salaries at a mid-market level.
Please see page 74 for more details on basic salaries.
Annual bonuses reward performance according to a set of key performance indicators, aimed at ensuring the Company delivers on its key priorities for the year.
There is a bonus opportunity of up to 100% of basic salary and, at the Remuneration Committees discretion, this can be increased to 130%.
There is also an additional bonus opportunity of up to 200% of basic salary for exceptional performance.
However, no Director may earn a bonus of more than 300% of basic salary in total.
Tables 52 and 53 on pages 74 and 75 set out the criteria for each type of bonus.
Long-term Incentive Plan rewards for Directors are aligned with our long-term business objectives and the level of value created for shareholders.
Please see pages 71 and 72 for more on long-term incentives.
Land Securities Annual Report 2009 Report of the Directors P0180 Financial statements P81130 Investor resource P131144 Directors remuneration introduction 69 What were the Executive Directors paid this year?
The Executive Directors received only their base salary in the year.
There were no bonus payments, except to Ian Ellis on the completion of the sale of Trillium, and there will be no pay rises.
Table 44 Table 44 details the salaries and annual bonuses given to our Executive Directors this year.
What was the Executive Directors remuneration for 2008 09?

M R Hussey 450 Salary levels are set according to market salary levels and the specific role of each Executive Director and R J Akers 388 are not linked to the Companys profits in any given year.
M F Greenslade 429 Relative performance meant that the Executive Directors would have been entitled to some bonus this year, Resigned 12 January 2009 however in view of the current market circumstances and its impact on the performance of the Company, the Board and the Remuneration Committee agreed that it would not be appropriate for the Executive Directors to receive salary increases or bonuses at the present time.
Under the Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP the Executive Directors will qualify to receive a proportion of vested shares for meeting set performance conditions over the course of the relevant three year period in line with the Schemes rules see pages 71 and 72.
Ian Ellis, who is no longer a Director of the Company, received a bonus as part of the sale process of Trillium.
Has that been applied across the Company?
We have awarded salary increases in the business but generally only to those employees on lower grades in the organisation where we felt it would be unfairly detrimental to their standard of living to receive no pay rise.
The average of this increase was 1.1% across the Group.
With regard to bonuses, we have paid bonuses in the organisation but on a much smaller scale than recent years.
This decision was taken because as a business we felt that despite the unprecedented market conditions that impacted the whole sector we need to retain and motivate our people and reward them for some excellent work in challenging circumstances.
However, to reflect the current market circumstances and performance of the Group the overall bonus payment was 59% down against last year on a comparable basis after adjustment for the sale of Trillium.
How is share price performance factored into the Directors remuneration?
It is factored in through the Long-term Incentive Plan and also through awarding part of the annual bonuses in the form of deferred shares which vest after three years.
In addition, all Executive Directors must, within five years of joining the Board, own shares with a value of at least 1.5 x basic salary and for the Chief Executive 2.0 x basic salary to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
How has the Rights Issue been re ected in the Executive Directors share incentive awards?
As envisaged by the rules of the relevant schemes, awards held by all employees under the Groups share schemes were adjusted as part of the Rights Issue so that the value of their awards was maintained at a constant level.
In the case of certain of these schemes, the adjustments were reviewed by the Groups auditors and approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
For the Executive Directors this meant that for any outstanding share option and LTIP Performance and Matching Shares there was an adjustment made to the number of shares and to the award or option price to reflect the impact of the rights.
The value of the shares awarded following these adjustments remains equal to the value of the originally awarded shares.
With regard to pledged co-investment shares which the Executive Directors had to acquire prior to the granting of Matching Share awards, they were required to purchase the rights on their original purchased shares in the scheme in order to trigger the increase in the Matched Share award following the Rights Issue.
How much do you pay Non-executive Directors?
We pay a base fee and in 2007 this was set at 55,000 for two years.
Non-executive Directors are paid further amounts for specific duties and responsibilities, such as chairing a Board committee, but are not paid additional fees for attending Board Committee meetings.
Please see Table 55 for more information on what we paid our Non-executive Directors this year.
