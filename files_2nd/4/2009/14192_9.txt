48 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors remuneration report Introduction This report meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Remuneration Committee has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
The report complies with the Companies Act 2006 and related regulations.
Unaudited Information Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for Shire plc.
2009 was a challenging and transformational year for Shire.
In his first full year as Chief Executive Officer CEO, Angus Russell led the Group in achieving excellent results, which reflected the success of Shires focused strategy and business model.
Some key accomplishments in 2009 included significant growth in core products, an increasing international reach, and a pro-active approach to cost management, all of which helped to offset the loss of exclusivity for ADDERALL XR.
Growth prospects remain excellent and the Groups core product portfolio currently has robust exclusivity protection.
The Group successfully launched INTUNIV in the US, and several product launches are planned, subject to regulatory approval, in the US, EU, and RoW for 2010, including VPRIV in the US and EU.
To ensure the strategy and the achievement of business objectives are supported by the Groups reward programs, the Remuneration Committee conducted a Total Rewards Effectiveness Review at the end of 2008.
This review resulted in a number of changes being made to our reward policy and compensation plans for both executive directors, senior leadership i. e. Leadership Team members, and the broader employee population.
Shareholder views were also taken into account in the re-design of compensation plans, as a number of changes are aligned with shareholder feedback on best practice.
The Remuneration Committee has approved a number of changes to reward policy and design of the Groups compensation plans for 2010.
Where appropriate, this report includes detail on plans in effect in 2009 as well as descriptions of planned arrangements for 2010.
At the date of the publication of this report, however, the Remuneration Committee is in the process of consulting with shareholders on the proposed changes to the long-term incentive arrangements for the 2010 financial year.
Any material changes which result following this consultation will be explained to shareholders in the Chairmans letter accompanying the Notice of the Companys 2010 Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee believes the changes to be implemented in 2010 will play a key role in helping the Group deliver on its strategy in the coming years.
In addition to revising reward programs we have also revised the remuneration report to improve its usefulness to readers.
For example, to ensure changes are transparent to shareholders, we have included a comparison table in the Executive Remuneration Package Section to provide an at-a-glance summary of key changes.
The remuneration report is grouped into four sections: The Remuneration Committee, which provides information on the individuals making remuneration decisions and their activities for the year 2009: Remuneration Policy, which describes Shires guiding principles on remuneration for Executive Directors, senior leadership, and the broader employee population: The Executive Remuneration Package, which explains the components of Shires 2009 executive compensation packages and how they will change in 2010: and The Performance Graph, to provide information on Shires performance over a five-year period, compared to its competitors.
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a continuing dialogue with shareholders and we take account of your views.
We hope that this report provides helpful context and explanation of the policies and practical considerations that influence our decisions.
Kate Nealon Chair of the Remuneration Committee Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 49 The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for developing, reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the Groups compensation and benefits policy.
The Committee reviews and approves all elements of the Executive Directors remuneration, as well as the broad policy for the remuneration of senior leadership i. e. Leadership Team members and the wider employee population.
The constitution of the Committee complies with the Combined Code.
In February 2010, the Committee reviewed its Terms of Reference and confirmed that these effectively reflect its responsibilities.
The Terms of Reference are available on Shires website at www.
The Board considers all members of the Committee to be independent.
The following Directors served as members of the Committee during the year: Kate Nealon, Chairman Patrick Langlois Dr Jeffrey Leiden Dr Michael Rosenblatt appointed on October 27, 2009 and stepped down on December 23, 2009, when he left the Board The Chairman and the CEO attend meetings of the Committee by invitation, but neither is involved in any decisions relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee was materially assisted in 2009 by JoAnn Verderese, Vice President, Total Rewards.
 LLP served as the independent external advisor to the Committee.
In addition,  LLP also provided a broad range of consultancy services to Shire, primarily in respect of accounting and tax matters in 2009.
Remuneration Committee activities for 2009 The Committee met five times in 2009.
All members attended all meetings they were eligible to attend, except for Dr Rosenblatt, who did not participate in the December 2009 meeting.
In 2009, the Committee discussed the following key topics and standing agenda items: Key topics remuneration Policy, including Guiding Principles for Reward Programs and confirmation of compensation philosophy: changes to the Annual Incentive Plan: changes to the Executive Annual Incentive Plan the EAIP : changes to the Long-term Incentive Plan the LTIP : changes to performance measures for awards to Executive Directors in the LTIP: and tax and immigration impact of CEO relocation to the US.
Standing agenda items final 2008 compensation awards for the Leadership Team, including salary increases, bonuses, and equity awards: assessment of 2008 corporate performance against the 2008 Corporate Scorecard and determination of the Corporate Annual Incentive Modifier for all bonus-eligible employees: 2008 Directors remuneration report: 2009 Annual Equity Grant: 2009 Chairmans fees: CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO objectives for 2009: annual offerings of Employee Stock Purchase Plans ESPP and sub-plans: determination of the vesting percentage of 2006 Portfolio Share Plan for Executive Directors: market data review to determine approach to 2010 salary increases for Executive Directors: compensation for CEO, CFO, and the Leadership Team based on 2009 performance: and updates on regulatory changes.
In addition to impact of decisions on the Executive Directors and the Leadership Team, a number of decisions made by the Committee had significant impact on the wider employee population.
Examples of these include: approval of the new Annual Incentive Plan to apply to all employees below senior leadership: approval of changes to equity plans for employees below senior leadership which will be put to a shareholder vote at the upcoming AGM: and review of the annual compensation process for all employees, including review of overall performance levels, range of salary increases, bonus payouts, and equity awards.
50 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors remuneration report Remuneration policy The Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy, aligned to the Groups business needs, is important to the Groups success.
It directly impacts the Groups ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees of the highest caliber who will be able to deliver sustained value to shareholders, even in the most challenging times.
In 2009 the Committee approved the Total Rewards Guiding Principles for reward programs for all employees, including Executive Directors, senior leadership, and the broader employee population.
The guiding principles are: Guiding Principle Description Simple and understandable Each element of the package has a clear purpose Plan drivers are easily understood by participants Pay decisions are not mechanistic Plans are simple to implement Plans are transparent and easily communicated Competitive Plans are competitive with the external market Plans help to attract and retain talent Strategically and culturally aligned Incentive Plans support success, aligned with Shires goals Plan designs support Shire Culture Performance oriented Differentiate based on performance Maintain link to overall Group Performance Valued by employees Employee perceived value is aligned with cost to Group Plans drive shareholder value Plans minimize accounting cost and provide tax efficiencies where possible In addition, the Committee reconfirmed the following compensation philosophy: pay should be targeted at the 50th percentile for median level performance.
However, compensation plans should allow for the achievement of top quartile pay levels, if appropriate, to recognize the highest levels of performance: benchmarking should consider each individual component of pay base salary, annual incentive, and long-term incentive targets.
Additionally, market data for total cash and total direct compensation will also be part of the pay decision: and percentage of pay at risk should consider the external market.
Further guidelines for Executive Directors and other members of senior leadership include: base pay and incentive targets are determined with reference to a blended US UK market comparison group.
Pay is targeted at or around the median relative to the comparison group and actual amounts may be higher or lower than the median based on performance: the Committee currently aims for variable compensation to represent over two-thirds of total remuneration: and executive Directors and senior leadership are encouraged to own shares in the Company in order to ensure the alignment of their interests with those of the Companys shareholders.
The Remuneration policy, through the Guiding Principles and compensation philosophy, is designed to balance the needs of the Group, the shareholders, and employees.
It recognizes the importance for reward programs to link to Group strategy, with a focus on performance and achieving shareholder value, while also providing programs that are competitive, are valued by employees, and reward them for strong performance in the achievement of Group and individual goals.
The Committee was also mindful of achieving this balance in 2009, in light of the wider economic downturn.
The Committee recognized this external environment in making decisions and was focused on ensuring that salary increases, plan payouts for bonuses and long-term incentives were closely aligned to Group performance and the creation of shareholder value.
The Executive Remuneration Package Following are the main elements of the remuneration package, with specific details for each of the Executive Directors: 1 Salary 2 EAIP a Cash component b Share component 3 Long-term incentives a Portfolio Share Plan i Stock Appreciation rights SARs ii Performance Share Awards PSAs 4 Pension and other benefits Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 51 An appropriate balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short-term financial performance and long-term shareholder value creation.
The EAIP and LTIPs are considered performance-related elements, while base salary is essentially fixed, although performance is considered when determining annual increases.
Assuming on-target performance, the CEOs remuneration for 2010 is 27% fixed and 73% variable, and the CFOs remuneration is 30% fixed and 70% variable.
CEO CFO 21% Base salary 24% Base salary 18% Performance-related annual bonus 19% Performance-related annual bonus 55% Performance-related long-term incentives 51% Performance-related long-term incentives 6% Pension 6% Pension 1 Salary The Committee reviews salaries annually.
Salaries are targeted at or around the median of a comparator group that is a blend of US and UK companies with sector, size, complexity, and international characteristics similar to those of the Group.
Market data is provided by independent external consultants, who also advise the Committee on overall external market conditions.
Base salary levels and salary increase decisions take into account the competitive market data, the Groups budget for performance-related pay increases, and the skills, performance and results achieved by each individual.
Salaries may be positioned below median for those who are new to their role or under-performing, while salaries for consistently strong performers may be positioned at median or higher.
This approach positions pay comparably to those companies with whom the Group competes for talent, while also providing the flexibility to recognize individual performance.
The following salaries for the CEO and CFO were determined based on a review of competitive market data, and on corporate and individual performance results: When Mr Russell was appointed CEO effective June, 2008, the Remuneration Committee decided to set his salary below median, recognizing that future salary growth would be subject to performance in his new position.
As was disclosed in the 2008 Directors remuneration report, the Committee reported it would review Mr Russells salary annually and that subject to continuing satisfactory performance, it would look to bring it to the median over the course of two years.
Consistent with this approach and on the basis of actual performance, Mr Russells salary has been increased for 2010 such that it is now at median compared to benchmark data.
His 2010 salary, effective January 1, will be $1,200,000 equivalent to 750,000 at the exchange rate applied at the time of decision.
Mr Russells salary is now denominated in US dollars to reflect his change in residency to the US.
Mr Hetheringtons salary was increased from 416,000 to 435,000 effective January 1, 2010.
This competitive salary reflects his performance since joining the Group in July, 2008.
2 EAIP Executive Directors and the Leadership Team participate in an EAIP, which rewards participants based on achievement of pre-defined, Committeeapproved corporate objectives and individual objectives.
The EAIP is awarded in a combination of cash, which is delivered shortly after the close of the fiscal year, and restricted shares, which are released on the third anniversary of the date of the award.
The EAIP is designed to provide a strong performance shareholder value orientation and reward executives for the creation of shareholder value.
Corporate objectives are organized and weighted in a scorecard format the Scorecard, which focuses on all areas that drive the success of the business: financial 40% weighting, customer 15% weighting, people and capabilities 15% weighting, and operational excellence 30% weighting.
Each objective includes a description of the objective and key performance measures, including targets and deadlines.
The Committee assesses the level of performance relative to the key performance measures, ensuring that both non financial and financial results are considered.
Financial objectives are assessed on the Groups Non GAAP financial results as reported in the Groups full year earnings release.
These Non GAAP measures exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash items, both recurring and non-recurring, that Shires management believes are not related to the core performance of Shires business.
The extent of awards under the EAIP is determined by the Committee based on the level of achievement for all key performance measures, as well as the Groups response to external opportunities and events that could not have been predicted at the beginning of the year.
52 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors remuneration report 2009 EAIP and results 2009 key performance measures, as provided in the Scorecard, include: achieve target net product sales: achieve target Non GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA : improve ranking among peer group for Non GAAP EBITDA: achieve target proportion of net sales from products that have launched within the last three years: achieve target proportion of net product sales from ex-US markets: achieve selling, general and administrative SG&A and research and development R&D target as a proportion of net product sales: and achieve best-in-class ratings in therapeutic areas.
In addition, the Executive Directors have individual objectives which are approved by the Committee.
The Committee assesses performance against annual objectives in the first quarter of the following year.
The target incentive is paid if Executive Directors have fully achieved their individual objectives and the corporate objectives have been met.
The maximum incentive is paid when the Committee determines that individual and or corporate performance has been exceptional.
The table below outlines the 2009 incentive opportunities for each: Weighting of target incentive objectives Target incentive Maximum incentive as a % of salary as a % of salary Corporate Individual Angus Russell 65% cash 115% cash 100% Will be taken into account CEO 20% restricted shares 65% restricted shares in determining final award Graham Hetherington 55% cash 100% cash 70% 30% CFO 15% restricted shares 55% restricted shares For 2009, the Committee made award determinations for Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington as follows: Mr Russell was awarded a cash award of 81% of base salary and his share award was 46% of base salary: and Mr Hetherington was awarded a cash award of 64% of base salary and a share award of 44% of base salary.
These incentive awards are consistent with the overall performance of the Group in 2009, which included: growth in core product sales of 25% over 2008 and only a 2% decrease in total product sales, despite the loss of exclusivity for ADDERALL XR: non GAAP EBITDA of $982 million, ahead of target, as the marginally lower revenues and Shires increased investment in R&D in 2009, were partially offset by lower SG&A costs from Shires continued focus on cost management: net product sales for ex-US markets at 30% of total product sales, ahead of target: and a successful launch of INTUNIV, and the acceleration of the VPRIV program in response to the ongoing shortage of the currently marketed treatment for Type 1 Gaucher disease.
Employees below senior leadership participate in a cash-based annual incentive plan that applies the same Scorecard format used for Executive Directors and the Leadership Team.
However, the percentage of bonus tied exclusively to Corporate objectives gradually decreases based on each employees level of responsibility within the Group.
Personal objectives are developed for each employee based on corporate objectives and individual awards are determined based on achievement of individual and corporate objectives.
2010 EAIP The 2010 EAIP will continue to use a Scorecard approach for setting and evaluating objectives.
The key performance measures for 2010 will be broadly consistent with those used for 2009.
While the four Scorecard dimensions are unchanged, the weightings have been adjusted to increase the impact of People and Capabilities from 15% to 20% and decrease Operational Excellence from 30% to 25%.
The most significant change to the EAIP is the allocation of cash and shares.
Under the previous plan design, the cash award and the share award were calculated separately, each with its own target, minimums and maximums.
In 2010, participants will have one bonus target, representing both cash and shares.
In the first quarter of the following year, the bonus will be adjusted by a corporate bonus modifier, which will be determined by the Committee based on the achievement of Scorecard goals.
Each EAIP participant will be eligible to receive a bonus based on the combination of achievement of these goals and individual performance.
This bonus will be allocated 75% cash and 25% restricted shares: the shares will be released on the third anniversary of the date of the award.
The maximum award will be 200% of target.
Annual incentive targets for the CEO and CFO and the maximum payment for the CFO have been adjusted slightly to align with the new 200% maximum.
The changes are supported by the blended US UK market data used for benchmarking these roles.
Incentive target Incentive maximum Incentive maximum percent of base salary percent of base salary percent of target Angus Russell 90% 180% 200% CEO Graham Hetherington 80% 160% 200% CFO Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 53 3 Long-Term Incentives 2009 LTIP Long-term incentives in 2009 were granted under the Portfolio Share Plan the PSP.
The purpose of the PSP is to enable the Group to motivate and reward selected employees by reference to share price performance, and to align the interests of these employees with long-term value creation for shareholders.
Participation in the PSP is discretionary.
Under the PSP, awards granted to Executive Directors will be subject to a performance target, which must, in normal circumstances, be met before the award vests.
Performance targets will normally be measured over a period of not less than three years.
Special rules apply if the participants employment terminates early or on a change in control of the Company.
The PSP is comprised of two parts, which can be operated separately.
Part AA SAR Award is the right to receive shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs in Shire plc linked to the increase in value of a specified number of shares over a period between three and five years from the date of grant and, in the case of Executive Directors, subject to the satisfaction of performance targets.
SAR Awards will normally vest three years after the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance targets in the case of Executive Directors, and can be exercised up to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
Part BA PSA Award is the right to receive a specified number of shares or ADSs three years from the date of grant.
In the case of Executive Directors, performance targets must be satisfied before a PSA Award vests.
Upon vesting of the PSA Award, shares will be released to the participant automatically without any action on the part of the participant.
For 2009, the PSP contained individual grant limits set at a face value of six times base salary for SAR Awards in any one year and four times base salary for PSA Awards in any one year.
Annual grants to the CEO and CFO in 2009 had the following face values calculated by reference to the average share price over the prior 12-month calendar period : for the CEO, equivalent to approximately 4 times base salary in SARs and 3 times base salary in PSAs: and for the CFO, equivalent to approximately 2.2 times base salary in SARs and 1.65 times base salary in PSAs.
Performance criteria SAR and PSA Awards under the PSP normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
In the case of Executive Directors, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been satisfied and that, in the opinion of the Committee, the underlying performance of the Group is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
Performance criteria for 2008 and 2009 are based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measured against two comparator groups.
Vesting of 33% of an Award will depend upon the Groups performance relative to the TSR performance of FTSE 100 constituents, excluding financial institutions.
The vesting of the remaining 67% of an award will depend upon the Groups performance relative to the TSR performance of a group of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector see below.
Vesting will be as follows: Percent vesting Performance level achieved 0% vesting Performance below the median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions 33% vesting Performance at median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions 100% vesting Performance at or above upper quartile performance versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions Performance between median and upper quartile versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100, excluding financial institutions, is calculated from 33% to 100% on a straight-line basis.
For 2008, the comparator group of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector comprised the following companies: Allergan, Inc. Altana Aktiengesellschaft, Biovail Corporation Biovail, Cephalon Inc. Cephalon, Forest Laboratories Inc. Forest Labs, King Pharmaceuticals Inc. King, Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. H. Lundbeck A S Lundbeck, Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, Novo Nordisk A S Novo Nordisk, Schering AG, Sepracor Inc. Merck Serono S. A. UCB S. A. UCB, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The Committee has the discretion to amend this group of companies to ensure that the group stays both relevant and representative: however, the change must not have the effect of making the performance criteria either materially easier or materially more difficult to achieve, in the opinion of the Committee, than they were immediately before the change.
For the 2009 award, the Committee has decided that the comparator group will comprise the following international companies from the pharmaceutical sector.
These companies are peers identified by the Group in 2008: Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Amgen Inc. Biogen Idec Inc. BioMarin, Biovail, Celgene Corporation, Cephalon, Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. Forest Labs, Genzyme, Gilead, Ipsen Ltd, King, Lundbeck, Novo Nordisk, UCB the 2009 Comparator Group.
TSR performance will be measured using an averaging period of three months.
In addition, the Committee will have regard to the same calculation using an averaging period of six months as part of a fairness review to ensure that vesting properly reflects underlying performance.
If the performance conditions are not met, awards will lapse.
For the 2006 PSP award which vested in August 2009, Shires TSR was 10.4% for the 3-month averaging period, which placed it 20th among the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions and 4th among its pharmaceutical competitors.
This resulted in a vesting of 99% of the award.
54 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors remuneration report Awards made to Executive Directors under the PSP in 2009 are set out in the audited information below.
2010 LTIP For 2010, the PSP award as a percentage of base salary for the CEO will remain unchanged.
The PSP Award as a percentage of base salary for the CFO has been increased slightly to reflect market practice.
Awards made under the 2010 plan will be SARs approximately equivalent to 300% of base salary and PSAs approximately equivalent to 220% of base salary.
The current performance condition under the PSP is TSR against the two peer groups outlined above.
However, the Committee is, at the date of this report, consulting with shareholders on potential changes to the performance metrics under the long-term incentive plan for the 2010 financial year.
Any material changes as a result of this consultation will be explained to shareholders in the Chairmans letter accompanying the Notice of the Companys 2010 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee will review the quantum each year to ensure this is still in line with the stated philosophy and if any changes are proposed these will be included in the Directors remuneration report in the year ended prior to the awards being made.

The Executive Share Ownership Guidelines are administered by the Committee and are based on the following principles: the Committee believes that share ownership is an important element of an Executives role in leading the Group and represents both a commitment by the Executive as well as an alignment of the Executives interests with those of shareholders: the Committee believes that share ownership by Executives should be strongly encouraged, but not mandated: the Committee understands that, depending on personal and other circumstances, an Executive may not be able to achieve the desired level of share ownership: the Committee believes that Executives should understand the importance of share ownership in the stewardship of the Group, and both appropriate time and latitude will be provided to Executives to achieve desired share ownership levels, where possible: and share ownership levels will be reviewed annually for each Executive.
Executives are encouraged, within a five-year period following the later of either the initiation of these guidelines, or their appointment or election, to attain and hold an investment position no less than the multiples of base salary set forth below.
The following are the guideline share ownership levels for the Executive Directors: CEO: 2 x base salary CFO: 1.5 x base salary All shares beneficially owned by an Executive count towards achieving these guidelines.
The Committee reviews share ownership levels for each Executive on an annual basis.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 55 4 Pension and other benefits The Groups policy is to ensure that pension benefits are competitive in the markets in which Shire operates.
In 2009, the Group contributed 30% of salary towards pension benefits for Mr Russell into a UK HM Revenue and Customs registered defined contribution scheme, which Shire operates for UK employees.
Concurrent with his move to the US, Mr Russell will participate in the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan SERP and 401 k Plan in the US.
The SERP is an unfunded defined contribution scheme: the benefits are payable to certain senior US employees as lump sums on leaving the Groups employment or earlier due to death, disability or termination.
The amount of benefit is based on the value of notional contributions adjusted for earned investment returns as if they were invested in investments of the employees choice.
Shire will contribute 30% of Mr Russells annual salary to these plans.
Mr Hetherington participates in the defined contribution scheme in the UK.
The Group contributed 25% of Mr Hetheringtons salary towards pension benefits for him in 2009, and will continue to do so in 2010.
In addition to pension benefits, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally a car or car allowance, life insurance, private medical insurance and dental cover.
These benefits are not pensionable.
For 2010, Mr Russells benefits will be delivered under US benefits programs.
The value of these benefits is comparable to those that would have been delivered in the UK and are not pensionable.
Service contracts The Executive Directors service contracts are based on a rolling term.
The contracts contain obligations on the Executive Directors in respect of intellectual property, together with post-termination restrictions.
The Committees view is that the Group should retain the right to make a payment in lieu of notice to a Director.
In the event of early termination, Executive Directors should be treated fairly but paid no more than is necessary.
Moreover, there should be no element of reward for failure.
Mr Russells contract, which is dated July 2, 2008, reflects his promotion to CEO in June, 2008 and incorporates contract provisions reflecting current best practice for Executive Directors contracts.
Effective January 1, 2010, Mr Russells contract was amended to reflect his move to the US, including changes to benefits and pension arrangements noted above.
Otherwise, all terms remained the same except for those required for the contract to be compliant with US law.
Mr Hetheringtons contract is dated July 2, 2008.
Mr Russells and Mr Hetheringtons contracts require them to give Shire 12 months notice.
Shire is required to give Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington 12 months notice of termination, other than if termination is for cause.
The contracts contain phased payment provisions which would entitle Shire to terminate an Executive Directors employment and make a severance payment not as a lump sum but in monthly instalments over the length of the notice period.
These provisions allow the payments to be reduced, or eliminated entirely, by income obtained by the director from a new post.
In the event of termination of employment within 12 months of a change in control, the amount payable to Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington is one years salary and the cash equivalent of one years pension, car allowance and other contractual benefits.
Any annual bonus payable is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at the contractual maximum level.
The amount of annual bonus payable upon termination of employment in any other circumstances, other than for cause, is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at the contractual target level.
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman Each Non-Executive Director is paid a fee for serving as a Director and additional fees are paid for membership or chairmanship of the Audit, Compliance & Risk, Remuneration, Nomination and Science & Technology Committees.
The Chairman of the Group receives an inclusive fee.
Fees are determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, with the exception of the Chairmans fee which is determined by the Committee and confirmed by the Board.
Fees are benchmarked against Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees of comparable companies.
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not performance-related.
Details of fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in 2009 are set out in the table below.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to join the Groups pension scheme.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group share schemes or other employee benefit schemes and no options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors in their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of Shire plc.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years.
At the expiration of the two year term Non-Executive Directors are not required to be re-elected by shareholders unless the expiration of the term coincides with a particular Non-Executive Directors turn to retire by rotation, but may be re-appointed by the Board.
Non-Executive Directors who have served on the Board for nine years or more are appointed by the Board for one year terms and, in accordance with the Code, are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office.

Performance graph The graphs below set out the TSR for the three and five years ending December 31, 2009.
The graphs compare the performance of a hypothetical 100 holding of Shire plcs shares with that of a holding of shares in the FTSE 100 Index excluding financial institutions and with a holding in the 2009 Comparator Group.
This comparator group is a blend of US and UK companies with sector, size, complexity and international characteristics similar to those of the Group.
The Group is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purpose of the graphs which are set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index excluding financial institutions as the appropriate index.
These comparisons will also be used to determine achievement of performance conditions relating to the 2009 awards granted under the PSP.

Directors share options The following share options over Ordinary Shares under the Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B Executive Scheme, the Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B 2000 Executive Scheme and the Shire Sharesave Scheme Sharesave Scheme were outstanding, exercised or lapsed during 2009.
The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development, it was considered appropriate that an earnings per share-based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
The performance criteria are based on real growth in the diluted earnings per share reported in the Groups Form 10-K under US GAAP, adjusted to ensure a consistent basis of measurement, as approved by the Committee, including the add back of significant one-time items option EPS.
Therefore, the performance criteria were amended so that an option would become exercisable in full if Shire plcs option EPS growth over a three-year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Prices Index RPI for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 9% Directors, RPI plus 15% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 15% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 21% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 27% The RPI-based earnings per share performance criteria applied to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with certain institutional shareholders, the Group decided that, for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the performance condition will be retested once only, at five years after the grant, if Shires option EPS growth falls short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant.
Hence the level of option EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
In December 2006 the Committee exercised its powers to amend the performance conditions for options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme which had not vested.
The RPI based growth rate was replaced with an equivalent fixed growth rate based on historical and forecast inflation.
Under Part B of the scheme, six weeks prior to the expiration date, any options that have not become exercisable at an earlier date, automatically vest without reference to the performance criteria.
2 Mr Russells approved option under the Executive Scheme did not meet the performance conditions and consequently they lapsed on December 13, 2009.
3 Options granted under the Sharesave scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
Mr Russells options under the Sharesave scheme lapsed on December 31, 2009 at which date he was no longer eligible to participate in the scheme.
4 No options were granted under the Executive Scheme or the 2000 Executive Scheme in 2009.
