com 49 Incentive Plans A substantial proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is based on performance via the Long-Term and Short-Term Incentive Plans described below.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP aims to motivate participants to deliver appropriate longer-term returns to shareholders.
Short-Term Incentive Plan STIP aims to focus management efforts on delivery of annual business priorities, based on a scorecard of key performance indicators relating to both Company and individual performance.
The Board intends to continue to operate the LTIP and STIP for the Executive Directors and senior executives in 2010.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP framework was approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
The LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and options up to an aggregate limit of 200% of salary in normal circumstances.
Initial awards were made in 2008 on the basis of the same number of shares to participants at the same level in the organisation.
Further awards were made in 2009 to the same participants, on a similar basis.
None of the awards granted in 2009 exceeded 100% of salary.
These awards are in the form of performance shares which vest according to the extent to which Ferrexpos three year TSR matches or outperforms that of a comparator index see below.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen relative TSR as the primary long-term incentive measure as it considers this to be the most objective external measure of the Companys success.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the constituents of the comparator index and their weightings prior to the grant of 2009 LTIP awards and increased the weighting on the focused iron ore miners from 30% to 40% and reduced the weighting on the single commodity emerging market miners commensurately.
The resulting comparator index for 2009 awards is based 50% on the median TSR of global diversified mining companies, 40% on the median TSR of smaller focused iron ore miners and 10% on the median TSR of selected other single commodity emerging market miners, as illustrated below.
Aggregate Index component Constituents weighting Global diversified miners 10% each 50% Vale Rio Tinto BHP Billiton Xstrata Anglo American Focused iron ore miners 10% each 40% Cliffs Natural Resources Kumba Iron Ore Fortescue Metals Group Mount Gibson Iron Single commodity emerging market miners 10% 0.5% each African Rainbow Minerals Industrias Penoles Alcoa Katanga Mining Alumina Kazakhmys Aluminum Corp of China KGHM Polska Miedz Antofagasta Lundin Mining Boliden Norilsk ENRC OZ Minerals Eramet Peabody Energy First Quantum Minerals Teck Cominco Freeport McMoRan Vedanta Resources Ferrexpo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 www.
com 50 Corporate Governance Remuneration Report continued TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that comparisons with international comparators listed overseas are fair.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to review the comparator index if any of the constituent companies are affected by mergers and acquisitions.
The Remuneration Committee also reviews the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each LTIP cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
The comparator index will be similar for 2010 LTIP awards.
No performance shares will vest if Ferrexpos TSR underperforms the comparator index.
20% will vest if Ferrexpos TSR is equal to Index TSR: full vesting will occur only if Ferrexpos TSR exceeds the Index by at least 8% p. a. : there will be straight-line pro rata vesting in between those points.
In addition, for any shares to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the recorded TSR is a fair reflection of Ferrexpos underlying business performance.
The vesting schedule is illustrated below: 2008 LTIP vesting schedule 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Ferrexpo 3-year TSR Index Index 8% p. a.
Dividends will accrue on performance shares over the vesting period, and be paid on shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control, awards will be pro-rated for time and performance.
The Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to vary this treatment if it deems it to be in shareholders interests to do so.
Transitional award of performance shares The two-year TSR performance period of these awards ended on 31 December 2009.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that the performance condition had not been satisfied and that the awards should therefore not vest.
Proposed 2010 LTIP awards The Remuneration Committee intends to operate the LTIP framework in 2010 in the same manner as in 2009.
For 2011 the Committee is considering measures to help improve the performance comparison to short-term share price movements at Ferrexpo or at comparator companies.
com 51 LTIP: share ownership guidelines The Committee has agreed that, with effect from 2010, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee should, in line with the growing practice among FTSE 250 companies, be encouraged to build up a holding of shares of equivalent value to a years salary in the case of Executive Directors or six months salary for other members of the Executive Committee.
Executives will be encouraged to retain their vested LTIP shares on an after-tax basis until the applicable guideline is achieved.
Short-Term Incentive Plan A Short-Term Incentive Plan is in place which applies to the members of the Executive Committee, excluding Mr Zhevago.
For 2009 the maximum STIP opportunity for Executive Directors was 150% of salary.
The maximum actual outcome was 90% of salary, due to the exceptionally difficult trading conditions.
The Key Performance Indicators KPIs for 2009 were agreed for each member of the Executive Committee and were weighted to reflect the contribution of each executive to the achievement of that KPI.
KPIs during the year included Financial KPIs and KPIs relating to corporate social responsibility, projects and governance.
Their respective weightings for the relevant Executive Director during the year were as follows: KPI Chris Mawe EBITDA 25% Net operating profit after tax NOPAT 25% CSR 10% Personal, projects and governance 40% In view of the exceptional trading conditions in 2009 and the challenge involved in setting robust performance targets, the Committee retained a broad discretion when deciding on the amounts to be paid out under the STIP.
In 2009 overall financial performance was rated between 20% and 50%.
CSR including health and safety-related performance, projects and governance were rated as between 50% and 80%.
Taking into account these results the Remuneration Committee awarded the Chief Financial Officer a STIP award of 90% of salary.
For 2010, the Remuneration Committee is reviewing the KPI weightings in the light of current market conditions.
Service agreements, notice periods and termination payments The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Ferrexpo AG, a Group company.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts are as follows: Date of Notice Current Name Position contract period basic fee p. a.
1 Kostyantin Zhevago Chief Executive Officer 1 November 2008 Six months from the US$240,000 employee: six months from the employer Chris Mawe Chief Financial Officer 7 January 2008 Six months from the CHF596,000 employee: 12 months from the employer 1 Kostyantin Zhevagos basic fee of US$240,000 is donated at his request to Ukrainian charities.
com 52 Corporate Governance Remuneration Report continued The Remuneration Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors at 12 months or less, which reduces the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
The policy on termination payments is to pay no more than what may be stipulated in an individuals service agreement.
The Executive Directors service contracts contain a provision exercisable at the option of the employer to pay an amount on early termination of employment equal to the respective notice period.
If the Company elects to make a payment in lieu of notice, the Executive Director will also be entitled to receive all components of remuneration, allowances and expenses for the extent of the notice period.
The payment in lieu of notice clauses will be invoked when the speed and certainty afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the shareholders.
Benefits-in-kind Under his service agreement, Kostyantin Zhevago is entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
He is also entitled to furnished accommodation in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe if necessary for the performance of his duties which cost US$38,000 in 2009, and up to US$5,000 per annum for professional tax advice.
Under his service agreement, Chris Mawe is entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
Ferrexpo AG also provides him with CHF63,000 of accommodation rental assistance per annum.
Pensions The Group does not operate a separate pension scheme for Executive Directors.
Chris Mawe and Kostyantin Zhevago are members of the Ferrexpo AG pension plan which is a mandatory insurance scheme under Swiss law provided for all employees of Ferrexpo AG to which the Company contributes an average of 10% of their annual base salaries.
During the year, the operation of the pension plan was reviewed and changes were made as to limit Ferrexpo AGs potential exposure and also require the employees contributions to be made on a more uniform basis.
Pension benefits earned by the Directors in the year ended 31 December 2009 were: Movement in transfer Transfer value during Accrued Increase in value of Accrued Transfer Transfer the period benefit at period net of increase benefit at value at value at less Directors US$000 Age 1 Jan 2009 indexation in period 31 Dec 2009 1 Jan 2009 31 Dec 2009 contributions Chris Mawe 48 16 208 34 259 8 122 114 Kostyantin Zhevago 36 0 9 2 10 0 5 5 Chairman and Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the Chairman of the Board and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid monthly.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not ordinarily participate in any of the Companys long-term incentive or short-term incentive schemes, nor do they accumulate any pension entitlement.
Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company: however, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.
com 53 Non-executive Directors letters of appointment Each of the Non-executive Directors has signed a letter of appointment with the Company.
The Non-executive Directors have each been appointed for an initial period of three years, and their appointments with the exception of those of Mike Salamon and Marek Jelinek may then be renewed on a three-yearly basis, subject to re-election when appropriate by the Company in general meeting.
Unless otherwise determined, neither the Company nor the Director concerned may give less than three months notice of termination of the appointment.
The Non-executive Directors fees are reviewed each year.
