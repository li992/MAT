3 In addition to the LTIP and BSP, which are schemes that the Group intends to operate on a continuing basis, there are three types of one-off share awards which have been granted to the executive directors who served during the period under review.
Details of these awards, which arose from the specific circumstances of the Groups demerger from Anglo American plc in 2007 and which are not intended to form a continuing part of remuneration policy, are set out below: David Hathorn participates in a Co-Investment Plan the Plan, pursuant to which he made an investment of 1,000,000 from his own funds in Mondi plc shares the investment shares in August 2007.
Under the terms of the Plan, provided he retains his investment shares and remains in the Groups employment, he is entitled to receive matching Mondi plc shares based on achievement against a performance condition measured over a four year period from July 2007.
The performance condition will measure the Groups TSR relative to the group of industry competitors consistent with the 2007, 2008 and 2009 LTIP awards.
The Committee determined that a TSR performance condition was appropriate for the Plan to ensure alignment with shareholders interests.
For performance up to the median, David will be eligible to receive a match of 50% of the number of investment shares.
For performance at the upper quintile or above, he will be eligible to receive a match of 250% of the number of investment shares, with a straight-line progression applying for performance between the median and the upper quintile.
The shares, which vested in March 2009, were awarded in August 2007 to replace the value of the portion of subsisting share awards lost as a result of leaving the employment of the Anglo American Group.
Following the Groups demerger from Anglo American plc, retention awards were made in August 2007 pursuant to commitments made in 2006 as part of the preparations for the demerger.
Andrew King received an award comprising a cash bonus of 50% of salary and an award of Mondi plc shares.
In accordance with the terms of the award, half the shares vested immediately and the remaining half vested in July 2009.
Peter Oswald received an award of Mondi plc shares which vested in July 2009.
