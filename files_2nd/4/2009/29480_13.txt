The Remuneration Committee has, for some time, had an overall responsibility to be aware of the remuneration policies and structures The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in of the Group as a whole.

As explained on page 51, half of the annual bonus is paid in cash, with the other half being used to purchase SJP shares which are held in trust for three years under the Deferred Bonus Scheme.
