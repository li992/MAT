The above disclosure of directors pensions is in line with the latest Companies Act 2006 requirements.
The figures for each director give the accrued pension to which each director would have been entitled had they left service at the end of 2009 and the equivalent figure for the preceding year and the increase in accrued pension over the year.
Also disclosed is the transfer value of the accrued pension at the end of 2009 and the preceding year and the increase in the transfer value during the year net of directors contributions.
The transfer values represent a liability of the pension scheme where funded and of the Company where unfunded.
They are not sums due to be paid to the directors.
