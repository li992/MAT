DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT PART I UNAUDITED INFORMATION INTRODUCTION The board of directors of Fresnillo plc is pleased to present their Directors Remuneration Report for 2009.
This Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations and sets out information about the remuneration of the Directors and senior management of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Part 2 of this report has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations.
As required by the Regulations, this report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Companys forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board established the Remuneration Committee on 15 April 2008 and it has met three times during the year.
The Remuneration Committee consists of three Directors, two of which are Independent Non-executive Directors - Lord Cairns, who is the chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and Mr Fernando Ruiz.
Mr Alberto Baillres, who was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee on 18 February 2009, was not independent at the time of his appointment.
The Board believes that Mr Baillres experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committees deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee.
Mr Baillres is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.
Attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee by individual members is detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 73.
Terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have been approved by the Board and its duties include the determination of the framework policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive officer and other members of the Executive Committee, as well as their specic remuneration packages, including pension rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments.
In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee is expected to take into account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
It will approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Company and approve the total annual payments made under such schemes.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available for inspection on the Companys website at www.
The Chief Executive officer usually attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee at the invitation of the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to this committee.
No Director is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
The Non-executive Directors fees are set by the Board under the Schedule of Matters reserved for its approval.
ADVISERS In setting executive salaries, benchmarking information is supplied annually to the Company by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation.
Mercer supplies comparative information on 330 companies in Mexico and Hay Group produces comparative information for 22 companies in the mining sector.
Such information is used when setting salaries for all employees, not just the senior executive thus ensuring consistency between Group pay and executive pay structures.
Benchmark information for international mining companies is provided to ensure that remuneration is competitive compared to the peer group.
Towards the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee agreed that Mercer should be asked to meet with the Remuneration Committee from time to time to present its data on executive remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Remuneration Committee has agreed a remuneration policy to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior management.
The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives with the creation of shareholder value are key objectives of this policy.
78 FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT In setting the basic levels of pay for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and in the international context for gold and silver producers.
Total compensation is set around the median level.
Salaries are benchmarked annually and total remuneration is benchmarked biennially.
The variable component of remuneration is embodied within the short term incentive plan which is available to the Chief Executive officer, the Chief Financial officer, the Vice President of Operations and the Vice President of Exploration as well as other corporate managers.
The achievement of annual performance targets is, therefore, rewarded through an annual performance-related bonus.
The performance targets upon which bonuses are based include a mix of financial and operational performance measures.
It is the Companys policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement.

LONG TERM INCENTIVES Fresnillo does not offer any shareor cash-based long term incentives to management.
SHORT TERM INCENTIVE PLAN STIP At the beginning of the year a STIP was put in place for the members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive officer who is the sole Executive Director.
A number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs were approved by the Remuneration Committee for each member of the Executive Committee and KPI targets were set at which payments equivalent to 0% to 50% of annual salary could be earned.
A scoring system is used whereby each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a points-rating which represents a median performance target for that objective.
Upper and lower points thresholds are set to allow for outstanding performance and ensure that underperformance is not rewarded.
For each member of the Executive Committee including the Chief Executive officer, bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points.
Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows: POINTS VARIABLE PAY MONTHS SALARY VARIABLE PAY PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL SALARY 100-104 Two months 16.67% 105-109 Four months 33.33% 110-114 Five months 41.67% && H m bdci]h %#%% The Chief Executive officer achieved in excess of 115 points for the year to 31 December 2009.
