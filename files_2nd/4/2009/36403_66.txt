55 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2009 Annual review Governance Financials Directors remuneration report Remuneration policy principles The Companys remuneration policy seeks to provide remuneration in a form to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives, with an emphasis on delivering greater variable reward for achieving and exceeding the Groups strategic plan.
This total pay position is analysed by looking across each of the different elements of remuneration including salary, pension, the annual bonus plan and long-term incentives to provide the Remuneration Committee the Committee with a total remuneration view rather than just the competitiveness of the individual elements.
To achieve the Companys remuneration policy, the Committee seeks to position total remuneration around mid-market for on-target performance taking into account the size and complexity of the business as compared to other peer companies in the sector, using a significant proposition of variable reward with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for superior performance through the annual bonus plan, long-term incentive plan LTIP and share matching plan SMP.
In light of the current economic conditions, salaries for the Executive Directors and employees and fees for Non-Executive Directors for the year ended 31 March 2010 have been maintained at 1 April 2008 levels.
The relative size of the components of the Executive Directors variable remuneration has remained unchanged from 2007.
In addition, to ensure closer alignment with shareholders, the absolute NAV performance requirement under the annual bonus plan has been strengthened to include a positive NAV growth underpin so that no payment will be made if there is a fall in NAV when measured year-on-year to 31 March.

The on-target award level for the bonus plan is assumed to be 75% of salary with a maximum award of 150% assuming the newly introduced NAV underpin is achieved.
If the NAV underpin is not achieved, the on-target award level for the bonus plan will be 52.5%.
The on-target award for the LTIP and SMP are based on the market norm expected values provided by Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS of 82.5% of salary for the LTIP and 55% for the SMP with maximums of 150% and 100% respectively.
Details of all payments to Executive Directors in the year, which are disclosed on page 56, show the relative values of the basic and performance related elements of remuneration for the year under review.
Although the NAV target for the annual bonus plan was not met primarily as a result of the movement in yields following the difficulties in the financial markets, overall the Company has continued to perform well, both in its relative performance, and in the Executive Directors achievement of their personal objectives to progress the Companys strategy.
In considering the Executive Directors reward structure for the year to come, the Committee believes that the relative size of the elements of the variable reward structure and performance targets for the LTIP and SMP remain appropriate in the current market environment.
Basic salary and benefits Basic salaries and the level and nature of benefits provided to Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee annually and are assessed having regard to Company, individual performance and responsibilities, as well as salary levels in comparable organisations particularly within the listed property sector.
The Committee is, however, mindful of the need to treat comparisons with caution to avoid an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also takes account of pay and employment conditions across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
Basic salary is the only element of Executive Director remuneration which attracts pension contributions.
On 1 April 2008, following a review of a benchmarking exercise by HNBS, the directors received increases in salaries as follows: Toby Courtauld 446,250 from 425,000, Timon Drakesmith 273,000 from 260,000, Robert Noel 357,000 from 340,000 and Neil Thompson 286,000 from 260,000.
For the current year, the Remuneration Committee has determined that salaries for all Executive Directors should be maintained at the 1 April 2008 levels and has accepted a recommendation from the Executive Directors that all employees salaries should also remain unchanged from 1 April 2008 levels.
Benefits principally comprise life insurance, health insurance, private healthcare subscriptions, car and travel concessions and membership subscriptions.
The taxable value of these benefits for Executive Directors is included in the table on page 56.
