64 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT By maintaining the right balance between fixed and variable pay, together with the challenging performance targets on executive incentive plans, we will continue to ensure pay for performance is central to our decisions concerning remuneration.
Tim Barker Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Introduction This Remuneration report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the relevant schedules of the Companies Act and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations, 2002.
These Regulations require the Companys auditors to report on the Audited information in the report and to state that this section has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations.
For this reason the report is divided into unaudited and audited information.
The Remuneration report is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2010.
Part 1 Unaudited information The Committee During the year, the Committee comprised Tim Barker as Chairman, Jamie Dundas, Mike Grasby and David Lindsell, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
Charles Berry, Chairman of the Company is also a member of the Committee.
The biographical notes of the members of the Committee are set out on pages 46 and 47.
The Committee met on three occasions during the year and its members attendance record is set out on page 57.
Advice to the Committee Philip has attended meetings as Secretary to the Committee and has provided assistance on HR matters to the Committee as he also has overall responsibility for Human Resources.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of the Committee except when her own remuneration is being discussed.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 65 Principal responsibilities The Committees principal responsibilities are: recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the executive directors and senior managers: determining, within that framework, the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and senior managers: approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive arrangements for executive directors and senior managers, including agreeing the annual targets and payments under such arrangements: determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions of service and the specific terms for any individual within the Committees remit, either on recruitment or on termination: determining the policy for, and scope of, executive pension arrangements: and overseeing any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group and reviewing remuneration trends across the Group.
Remuneration policy The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: manage salaries and benefits around market levels, taking into account both industry and cross-industry benchmarks: link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance: award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual business plan targets and personal performance: and provide staff with long-term incentives linked to total shareholder returns.
When applying this policy to senior managers below director level, the Committee selects salary and benefit benchmarks appropriate to individual specialisms.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: motivate executive directors and staff to help ensure that Drax meets challenging performance goals: enable Drax to recruit and retain the expertise needed to manage and develop its business: strengthen teamwork at all levels: and ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests.
During the year under review the remuneration package of executive directors and senior managers comprised: Around 45% of the executive director remuneration package is based on variable pay elements.
The following table shows the mix of remuneration that applied in 2009 for executive directors between variable and fixed, and short-term and long-term remuneration.
During 2009, the Committee, with the assistance of its independent advisers, Kepler, reviewed the Companys remuneration arrangements for its executive directors to ensure that they remain appropriate in the light of recent market developments.
The review included benchmarking practice, the link between variable remuneration and the Companys objectives, the balance between fixed and variable pay, the balance between short-term and long-term pay and the appropriate period over which to measure long-term pay.
Following this review, the Committee believes that the remuneration arrangements are appropriate and fit for purpose with particular reference to the nature of Draxs business.
66 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Components of remuneration The main components of current executive directors remuneration are summarised as follows: Chief Finance Production Executive Director Director 1 Salary 450,000 300,000 255,000 2 Annual bonus % of salary Target 65% 60% 60% Maximum 130% 120% 120% 3 Bonus match maximum match as a multiple of annual bonus award 1.5x 1.5x 1.5x 4 Pension contribution % of salary 20% 20% 20% Notes: 1 Salaries were benchmarked in 2008 against comparator groups of utilities, power generators and selected other industrial and commercial companies with comparable market capitalisation, turnover and employee numbers.
2 25% of any bonus is settled in shares deferred for three years.
Bonuses are based on Group and individual performance against objectives, including a 25% discretionary element.
3 An award of conditional shares which vests based on Drax three-year Total Shareholder Return compared to that of the FTSE51-150 with full vesting at upper quartile and 15% vesting at median zero below median.
The chart values the annual bonus at target with a 5% p. a. forfeiture risk applied to the mandatory deferred bonus.
The Bonus Matching Plan opportunity is based on fair value assuming the annual bonus pays out at target and the fair value of a BMP performance share is 45% of its face value.
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the components of remuneration for executive directors.
Base salary Executive directors base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April.
The review takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness.
Executive director salaries are benchmarked against two relevant comparator groups.
Firstly, an industry sector group comprising companies in the electricity, oil and gas, engineering and utilities sectors.
Secondly, a comparator group comprising companies of comparable size to Drax in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and employee numbers.
However, taking account of market conditions and their effect on the Companys performance, the Committee decided not to award any increase in executive directors base salaries for the pay review year ending on 31 March 2010.
This being the case, the benchmarking exercise was not undertaken in 2009.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 67 Annual performance bonus The Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
Bonuses are based on both Group and individual performance against objectives.
The Committee determines Group performance measures by reference to a balanced corporate scorecard for which the Board sets challenging performance targets as part of the business plan approval process.
Each element of the scorecard is given a percentage weighting.
In 2009 the scorecard had the following elements and weightings: Elements Weighting Financial targets Include profit, cash available for distribution and controllable costs 30% Production targets Include safety, plant and operational performance 20% Include trading, biomass co-firing, sustainability and business Business plan objectives 50% development objectives In setting these measures and weightings, the Committee recognises that the financial performance of the Group is very substantially determined by commodity prices, and especially the dark green spread.
These are factors which predominately are not within the control of the Companys management.
The Committee, nevertheless, believes that the variable elements of pay should be sufficiently linked to financial performance to ensure that there is alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee considers that the annual bonus measures and weightings achieve an appropriate balance between financial performance measures and other key performance measures that are more directly in the control of management.
With the same reasoning, the Committee believes it is appropriate to put a somewhat higher weighting on salary and annual performance bonus relative to the weighting of the longer-term BMP matching share plan, the outcome of which is significantly outside the control of management.
The Committee assesses corporate performance against each of these measures, and has a discretion to adjust the overall score by a factor between 0.75x and 1.25x i. e. -25% to reflect performance and unexpected developments that are not directly included in the scorecard.
The Board determines individual performance objectives for each executive director.
The Committee assesses performance against these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between 0.67x and 1.33x to the corporate score to determine the percentage of target bonus awarded to each executive director.
For bonus awards in 2009, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of base salary respectively.
The maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively.
75% of any bonus award is paid in cash and 25% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and is forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a good leaver before the shares vest.
In 2009, the corporate score led to an award of 120% of target bonus.
This was adjusted according to the individual performance multipliers to set the individual awards.
The amounts payable in cash are shown in the Directors emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.
The target and maximum bonus percentages for 2010 for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors are the same as in 2009, and bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously.
Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan The Group operates a Bonus Matching Plan BMP as a long-term performance share plan.
The BMP was approved by shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, and the first awards under it were made in May 2009.
Under the BMP executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the amount of the executives annual bonus for the prior year.
No payment is made for the shares.
However vesting is subject to service and performance conditions.
Thirty-three per cent of awards granted to those senior executives who are not Executive Committee members will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the Group.
Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance i. e. 67% of the shares granted to other executives will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed by the Group and subject to achievement of a performance condition determined by the Committee and described below.
The Committee has approved a condition relating to the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the three year period measured from the start of the financial year in which an award is granted relative to the TSR over the same period of the FTSE51-150 companies the Comparator Group.
68 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT The TSR condition provides for vesting as follows: Vesting of Matching Awards granted to Vesting of Matching Awards granted to Company rank within the Comparator Group Executive Committee members other participants Within upper quartile 100% 100% At median 15% 33% Below median 0% 33% subject normally to continuing service up to the third anniversary In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has also been a demonstrable and sustained improvement in the Companys performance over the period.
In determining this, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors but in particular will consider improvement in the Companys financial, production and trading performance.
The Committee recognises, as mentioned above, that the Groups performance is very substantially determined by commodity prices but believes that the BMP provides an acceptable balance between the interests of participants and shareholders.
Moreover, it captures both short-term performance through linking grant value to earned annual bonus and long-term performance by linking vesting to Draxs relative TSR.
It also better supports retention by linking vesting partly to time for participants below the Executive Committee.
Pension Executive directors are entitled to membership of the Groups defined contribution pension plan.
The employers contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary.
Contributions were and are capped by the different statutory limits applicable before and after 6 April 2006, although there is no executive director for whom contributions would mean they exceed either the lifetime or annual allowances.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions.
Details of pension contributions for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the Directors emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.
Benefits in kind car, private medical cover, etc Car allowance The Companys policy is to offer a car allowance to executive directors and to certain senior managers, according to their role.
The annual allowance is currently: 17,500 per annum for the Chief Executive: 12,000 per annum for other executive directors: and 9,000 per annum for senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.
Life assurance Life assurance in a sum assured of four times base salary is provided for the executive directors and senior managers.
Private medical cover The Companys policy is to offer BUPA private medical cover to all employees within the Group.
The executive directors and senior managers receive medical cover for them and their dependants.
Relocation expenses and second Relocation expenses are paid where appropriate.
Second base expenses provide an base expenses allowance towards the cost of accommodation and travel when a director is required to spend a significant amount of time at two Drax locations.
Executive Share Incentive Plan Between 2006 and 2008, the Group operated the Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP.
The ESIP is a long-term performance share plan under which executives received conditional awards of shares which vest after a three year performance period, subject to Draxs relative TSR compared to an index of comparator companies.
The ESIP was replaced by the BMP in 2009.
Details of awards made to the executive directors under the ESIP are set out in Part 2 of this report.
The 2006 ESIP award was due to mature on 19 September 2009.
Over the three year performance period, Draxs TSR was below that of the index.
As a result, all awards under the 2006 ESIP award have lapsed and no shares have been transferred to participants.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 69 Current annualised rates of pay The following table shows the current annualised rates of base salary, benefits, bonus at target level and pension contributions for each of the directors: Annual Annual Annual Annual Annual cash 1 2 3 4 salary fees bonus benefits pension 000 000 000 000 000 Tim Barker 58 Charles Berry 200 Jamie Dundas 48 Peter Emery 255 153 12 51 Mike Grasby 58 David Lindsell 58 Tony Quinlan 300 180 35 60 Dorothy Thompson 450 293 18 90 Notes: 1 Includes Board Committee membership fees paid as separate amounts.
2 The annual bonus assumes an on target performance yielding a bonus of 65% of base salary for Dorothy Thompson and 60% of base salary for the other executive directors, of which 25% is required to be deferred into shares.
3 Covers car allowance and second base expenses only.
The cost of other benefits such as BUPA and additional life cover is not easily predicted because they are subject to price variation the amount of which depends on personal circumstances at the time during the year.
4 Annual contribution by the Company to the directors pension plans or cash in lieu.
All employee share plans The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis.
The executive directors may participate in each plan upon the same terms as other employees.
SAYE The SAYE provides for the grant of options which, at the Committees discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a statutory rate.
In May 2006, the plan was operated so that subject to the statutory upper aggregate limit of 250 per month on an individuals savings under all SAYE plans a participating employee could choose to save for either or both periods of three or five years.
The options were granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price determined in accordance with the plan rules resulting in an option price of 636 pence per share and may be exercised upon successful completion of the savings contract to which they are linked.
The three-year contracts matured on 1 July 2009 at which point the options were significantly underwater to the share price of 442 pence and therefore participants simply took their savings plus interest.
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
The Committee has agreed that an invitation will be made under the SAYE in 2010, immediately following the preliminary results announcement.
Once again, the 20% discount to the market price will be applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE contracts over three, five and seven years and contribute in total no more than 250 per month.
70 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT SIP In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the following elements: award Free Shares up to 3,000 in value : allow the purchase of Partnership Shares up to 1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary : allocate free Matching Shares in a maximum ratio of two Free Shares for each Partnership Share : and allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares.
Below is detail of how the SIP has operated between 2006 and 2009: 2006 2007 2008 2009 SIP Free Share Participants received Participants received 2,500 worth of shares in Participants received 1 Award 2,000 worth of shares.
Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of 1,500 subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary in each year.
Partnership shares matched on a 1 for 1 basis in each year.
1 Award Notes: 1 The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares in order to avoid any dilution.
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the employee.
Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years.
The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held in trust.
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
The Committee has decided not to operate the SIP in 2010.
Provision of shares for share plans dilution All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Companys discretionary share plans e. g. BMP.
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of the shares in issue at the date of this report.
Share ownership guidelines The Company has share ownership guidelines for executives participating in its performance share plans.
They are 100% and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager ESIP BMP participants, respectively.
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 71 Service contracts Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, subject to a normal retirement age of 65, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months prior notice except that Peter Emerys contract is terminable by him providing six months notice to the Company.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements other than the Chief Executives, Drax has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2009, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice periods.
No service agreement now includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination.
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances.

External appointments The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Company.
The policy is that an executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the appointment.
Dorothy Thompson was appointed as a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc with effect from 1 September 2007, and received 45,000 in fees for that appointment during 2009.
72 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Non-executive directors The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services.
They do not receive any pension or benefits in kind.
Nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans.
The Chairmans notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
It is designed to: recognise prevailing market rates for non-executive directors fees in other listed companies of a similar market value or turnover to Drax: reflect the responsibilities and time commitment: and attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company.
Chairman The Committee determined that upon his appointment on 17 April 2008, the Chairmans remuneration should be at the annual rate of 200,000, which is reflected in the table of annualised rates of pay on page 69.
The Committee determined that the Chairman would not receive any increase in his remuneration in the review year ending on 31 March 2010.
Other non-executive directors The fees for non-executive directors were determined in April 2008 as shown below: Basic fee 40,000 per annum Board committee membership 2,500 per annum Audit, Remuneration and Health and Safety committee Chairmanship 10,000 per annum Value of 100 invested The following graph shows how the value of 100 invested in the Company on the listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2005 has changed and compares that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.
These indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Companys shareholders may judge their relative returns given that, during the year under review, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.
The graph reflects the total shareholder return determined according to usual market practice for the Company and each of the indices referred to on a cumulative basis over the period from 15 December 2005 to 31 December 2009.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 73 Part 2 Audited information This section of the report which has been subject to audit sets out the remuneration paid to the directors during the year ended 31 December 2009.
Directors emoluments The emoluments payable in respect of 2009 to directors who held office for any part of the financial year, including amounts paid to them as directors of subsidiary undertakings and compensation for loss of office were as follows: Cash bonus in respect of Total Total 1 Salary Fees 2009 Benefits Pension 2009 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Tim Barker 58 58 57 Charles Berry 200 200 157 Jamie Dundas 51 51 57 Peter Emery 255 165 17 51 488 489 Mike Grasby 58 58 59 2 David Lindsell 54 54 4 3 Tony Quinlan 300 201 41 60 602 194 Dorothy Thompson 450 340 23 90 903 894 Notes: 1 Annual contribution by the Company to directors pension plans or cash in lieu.

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
