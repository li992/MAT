The tables below contain the aggregate expected values of each option grant or performance share award.
The expected values for the grants and awards made from 2003 to 2008 have been calculated by Mercer using: a binomial valuation model for the options that uses daily share price data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price and risk-free rate of return, with assumptions as to dividend yield, future volatility and forfeiture: and a Monte Carlo simulation model for the performance share awards using the same inputs and assumptions as for the binomial model, but which projects, many thousands of times, the share price of the company along with the share prices of the comparator group stocks to determine correlations between the companies.
This produces a distribution of share prices and TSR rankings thus allowing complex market-based hurdles to be modelled.
The methods of calculation of expected values have not been audited by  LLP.

2 The performance condition for options granted prior to 2002 required growth in adjusted EPS expressed in sterling of 3% per annum compound in excess of the change in the Retail Price Index RPI over any three-year period within the 10-year option life.
This performance condition was satisfied in respect of all options granted to executive directors in 1999, 2000 and 2001.
3 The performance condition for options granted in 2002 and until 2005 required compound annualised adjusted EPS growth expressed in sterling of RPI 3% subject to testing at three, four and five-year intervals from a fixed base for vesting of the base annual award.
Half of any additional annual amount vested at compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of RPI 4%: and the other half of any additional annual amount vested at compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of RPI 5%.
After the five-year test any unvested portion of the option lapsed.
4 The performance condition for options granted in 2006 and onwards requires compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of RPI 3% from a fixed base for vesting of the base annual award.
Half of any additional annual amount vests at compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of RPI 4%: and the other half of any additional annual amount vests at compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of RPI 5%.
The performance tests are applied to two-thirds of the award after three years and one-third of the award after five years, with any unvested portion of the options lapsing after three years or five years, as the case may be, and with no provision for retesting any part of the awards.

The expected values shown are the aggregate expected values of all outstanding awards estimated by reference to the probabilities of any portion of each award vesting.
2 Performance share awards made prior to 2006 vested only if three year TSR change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period exceeded the median TSR of a comparator group of companies identified at the time of the award.
On reaching the median performance of the relevant comparator group, 25% of the award vested and on reaching at least the upper quartile, 100% of the award vested.
Between these respective levels of achievement awards vest pro rata.
If vested awards were retained for a further two years they would automatically be increased by an allocation of 50% of the number of shares in the original award that vested.
3 Since 2006, 50% of performance share awards have been subject to a TSR performance condition and 50% to an adjusted EPS growth performance condition.
The TSR test is applied to two-thirds of the relevant part of the award after three years and to one-third after five years.
The EPS condition is a three-year adjusted EPS growth target, set by reference to historical and forecast adjusted EPS growth for the six members of the comparator group determined by the committee to be the companys closest peers in the global brewing industry, namely Anheuser-Busch, Carlsberg, Heineken, InBev, Molson Coors and Scottish & Newcastle although Scottish & Newcastle has been dropped from this group for the purposes of awards made in 2008, and Anheuser-Busch has been dropped from this group for the purposes of awards made in 2009.

7 After the year-end, the executive directors 2006 performance share awards were tested against the applicable TSR and EPS performance conditions.
The EPS performance measurement was achieved as to 54% of maximum which resulted in 62,100 and 37,800 EPS awards vesting on 19 May 2009 and 25,462 and 15,499 shares were sold to cover income tax liabilities owing by Mr Mackay and Mr Wyman respectively.
The price on vesting date was 12.57 per share.
