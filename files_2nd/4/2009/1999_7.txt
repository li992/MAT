The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential con icts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described.
A copy of the terms of reference can be downloaded from the Companys website.
The Remuneration Committee was advised by Halliwell Consulting until its acquisition by  LLP on 31 December 2008 and thereafter by  LLP for the remainder of the financial year.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins.
No Director played a part in any discussion about his or her remuneration.
Remuneration Policy Overview The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between xed and performance related compensation is maintained.
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: changing market practice: and changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
As announced with Berkeleys 2007 08 results, changes were made at the 2008 Annual General Meeting to Berkeleys remuneration policy.
This constituted changes to the annual bonus plan performance targets and to the structure of the existing awards under The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 b LTIP, which are discussed later in this report.
In February 2009, Berkeley announced the repositioning of its strategy, enabling the Group to take advantage of current market conditions by investing in land and returning to a more traditional dividend policy, rather than committing to return 3 per share by 2014.
The annual bonus plan performance targets and the 2004 b LTIP had been linked to the return of the 3 per share: therefore a review of the remuneration policy to re-align these targets to the repositioned strategy was required.
This 2009 Remuneration Policy was approved at the Companys Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 April 2009, and is set out in this report.
The 2009 10 financial year started on 1 May 2009 and nishes on 30 April 2010.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Companys comparator group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Bene ts in kind Share incentives Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year ended 30 April 2009: Company name Amec Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls PLC Taylor Wimpey Plc Balfour Beatty Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc Persimmon Plc Travis Perkins Plc Barratt Developments plc Carillion Plc Redrow Plc It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to use the same basis for the comparator group for the year ending 30 April 2010.

The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
Elements of Executive Directors Remuneration Basic Salary Policy: Upper decile Policy It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with the Committees view that the Company has one of the most experienced and capable Executive teams within the sector.
When determining the salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
indb 35 28 7 09 28 7 09 09:46:57 09:46:57 GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 36 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT [CONTINUED] Year ended 30 April 2009 and year ending 30 April 2010 The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2008 for 2008 09, as it had done in May 2007 for 2007 08.
On both occasions the Committee felt that: taking into account the above criteria: the exceptional absolute and comparative performance of the Company during this challenging period: and the fact that with the exception of the Finance Director, the Executive Directors have not had a rise in salaries since May 2003: salary rises were appropriate.
In May 2007, increases of between 5% and 7.5% were awarded by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008.
However, at the time the Executive Directors believed that the current balance of the remuneration package was appropriate and the salary recommendations were therefore not implemented in the year.
In May 2008, further increases of between 6.25% and 9.75% were awarded by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the year ended 30 April 2009.
However, in this case the Executive Directors decided, given the prevailing market conditions, not to take increases and therefore the salary recommendations were not implemented in the year.
In respect of 2009 10, the Committee remains of the view that the previously recommended salaries are appropriate.
However, they have not been implemented for the reasons set out above and therefore the salaries will remain at their historic level.
It should be noted that by keeping salaries at these historic levels the Executive Directors have not taken cumulative increases of between 11.5% and 18% in respect of 2007 08 and 2008 09.

Bonus payments are not pensionable.
General The maximum annual bonus potential is 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the Executive Directors bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
Bonuses up to 100% of salary will be paid in cash.
The Executive must hold shares equivalent to the net value of any bonus paid above 100% of salary for eighteen months.
Year ended 30 April 2009 The targets for the year ended 30 April 2009, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned by the Executive Directors are set out in the following tables: Bonus Potentials & Targets for 2008 09 & 2009 10 The following table shows the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2009 and year ending 30 April 2010.

Following the announcement in February 2009 that Berkeley was repositioning its strategy, this target was re ned in order to avoid a potential con ict of interest arising from the requirement to actually make the payments by the end of this period as the exact timing of suitable opportunities cannot be predetermined, so that now the targets will also be satis ed where the Company has generated an equivalent amount of cash.
This was approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 April 2009.
For the purposes of this target, Additional Land Expenditure is fide ned as expenditure on land over and above the cost of land that has been expensed through the income statement which is set at 13.1%, being the land cost percentage in the land bank at 30 April 2008.
For 2010 11, this is an absolute target.
For 2008 09 and 2009 10, the Remuneration Committee must be satis ed that the Group is on target to meet this test for the bonus to be earned.
Divisional PBT performance condition The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential level of bonus payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues.
The Remuneration Committee con rms that the annual bonus payments set out within this report for the Divisional Executive Directors are appropriate taking into account the level of pro t achieved and the targets set at the beginning of the year ended 30 April 2009.
Share Incentives Policy: Upper decile Executive Directors On 28 August 2008 at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, shareholders approved an amendment to The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan which split the original awards granted into two elements Element 1 and Element 2.
On 15 April 2009, at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company, shareholders approved the introduction of a new incentive plan, The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2009 LTIP.
The 2009 LTIP incorporated and replaces Element 2 of the 2004 b LTIP and the previously approved 2007 LTIP, as set out below: 2004 b LTIP Element 1 9 12 of the number of shares subject to the original awards under the 2004 b LTIP, totalling 15,991,021, were conditionally released on 28 August 2008 following shareholder approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The condition of release was that the Executive Director does not resign prior to the relevant unconditional release date set out in the table below.
If he does so, any element of the conditionally released award which has not been unconditionally released at this date shall lapse: Percentage of Element 1 of the Award Unconditionally Released Unconditional Release Dates 25% 28 October 2008 25% 16 April 2009 25% On or around 1 September 2009 25% On or around 1 March 2010 Of the shares conditionally released subject to shares sold or netted-off to satisfy any tax liability, the Executive Director will only be able to sell each financial year a maximum of 10% of the net award until 31 January 2014 at which point the sale restrictions shall lapse.

This new option is identi ed as Part A of the 2009 LTIP.
These options were awarded after the year end, on 29 June 2009, at which time the Element 2 awards under the 2004 b LTIP were surrendered.
Options will become exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to the relevant Executives continued employment with the Company.
2009 LTIP Part B Part B of the 2009 LTIP is equivalent to the number of shares which shareholders agreed could be issued under the 2007 LTIP.
Following shareholder approval on 15 April 2009 this number of shares is now capable of being granted as Part B of the 2009 LTIP and the 2007 LTIP has been cancelled.
Shares under Part B of the 2009 LTIP will be granted as market priced options which will vest subject to:- continued employment to the relevant vesting date: and the satisfaction of the underpin condition that Net Assets Per Share are at least 5.94 at 15 April 2015.
Vesting of these options will be in two tranches:- on 15 April 2015: and on 15 April 2016.
The total number of shares subject to Part B of the 2009 LTIP is 7,100,000 shares.
The initial awards were made shortly after the results for 2008 09 were announced on 29 June 2009.

Other Senior Employees of the Company The Companys business comprises of a number of operating Divisions.
The Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work.
Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division.
The Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Companys current circumstances.
It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible.
Both the Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
In addition, a number of senior employees of the Company are eligible to participate in Part B of the 2009 LTIP.
Shareholding Requirement The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors.
The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors as at 30 April 2009: Current shareholding as a % of salary Shareholder requirement as a % of salary Name based on 30 April 2009 share price by the year ended 30 April 2009 Group Managing Director A W Pidgley 5,884% 400% Group Finance Director R C Perrins 2,255% 200% Divisional Director A Carey 2,759% 200% Divisional Director G J Fry 2,304% 200% R&A R&A PRINT.

It is not intended to operate any other Executive or all employee share incentive arrangements during 2009 10.
There has been no dilution other than under these special arrangements for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2009.
Pension Policy: Lower quartile to median Messrs Pidgley and Perrins receive payments in lieu of pension at 17% and 15% of base salary respectively all these payments are subject to income tax and national insurance.
These payments are not included in salary gures for the purposes of determining any other bene t entitlement.
The other Executive Directors, Messrs Carey and Fry continue to receive contributions into their respective fide ned contribution plans.
Full details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 41.
Bene ts in Kind Policy: Market practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional bene ts: a fully expensed company car: and medical insurance.
Other Remuneration Matters All Employee Share Plans The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was appropriate to introduce all employee share plans.
The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan.
The Board, therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees.
Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
Non-executive Directors Fees Policy: Upper decile fees All Non-executive Directors have speci c terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The 2008 09 fee levels are based on a speci c survey of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting.

indb 39 28 7 09 28 7 09 09:46:59 09:46:59 GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 40 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT [CONTINUED] Following the review in 2008 09 the Board has determined that no fee increases will be made for 2009 10.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
Executive Directors Contracts The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjusti ed payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors Agreements All Non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required by the Companys Articles of Association.
All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.
