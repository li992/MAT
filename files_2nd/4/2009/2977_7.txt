For the 2005 award, relative earnings per share EPS performance and total shareholder return TSR performance over the threeyear vesting period against a peer group each determined vesting for one half of each award in accordance with the following table: 2005 EPS and TSR Vested award Applies to TSR or EPS peer group ranking % of salary 50th percentile and below 0% 51st percentile 9% 75th percentile or greater 30% Vesting is determined by straight-line interpolation for performance between the 51st and 75th percentiles.
Following the initial test, there is no opportunity to re-test performance for the determination of awards.
Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 27 Directors remuneration report continued Membership of the peer group for each years award, compiled in accordance with advice from Hay Group, is detailed below.
20 September 2005 15 September 2006 Body Shop The Boots Company Plc Countrywide Debenhams DSG International Dixons GUS plc GUS plc Argos Halfords Headlam HMV Group Plc Homestyle Group Plc JJB Sports Plc KESA Kingfisher Land of Leather Marks & Spencer Plc Matalan Plc MFI Furniture Group Plc Next Plc SCS Upholstery Plc Topps Tiles Plc Travis Perkins Woolworths Group Plc WH Smith Plc TSR performance against a peer group determines vesting for one half of the 2006 award but for the other half of the 2006 award vesting is determined by EPS performance over the three year vesting period: Vested award Annualised Vested award TSR peer group ranking % of salary EPS performance % of salary 50th percentile and below 0% Below RPI 3% 0% 51st percentile 12% RPI 3% 12% 75th percentile or greater 40% RPI 5% 40% Vesting for the EPS-based award will be determined by straight-line interpolation for performance between the RPI 3% and RPI 5%.
Once these performance targets have been examined there is no further examination.
For 2009 10 and future awards it is proposed that the proportion of shares vesting after three years will depend on Carpetrights performance with respect to EPS.
The performance target would be underlying EPS, before exceptional items, at 30% per annum compound growth.
A minimum of 15% growth in EPS would be required to trigger an award, with a sliding scale operating to the maximum of 30%, as below: % of salary excluding share price change % award Senior Compound growth performance target p. a. vested Main Board Managers EPS 15% 0% 0% 0% EPS 15% 35% 70% 35% EPS 30% 100% 200% 100% Following a review of the operation of the LTIP by the Remuneration Committee it is proposed subject to receiving shareholder approval to increase the maximum award that can be made in any year under the LTIP from 100% of salary to 300%.
For 2009 10, however, it is intended that no participant, including the Executive Directors, will be given an award in excess of 200% of salary.
The Committee recommends this increase which is to reflect market practice and to allow an increase in the proportion of Directors remuneration that relates to the delivery of enhanced shareholder value over the long term.
28 Carpetright plc | Annual report and accounts 2009 Based on current basic salaries the annual cost of a maximum award under the LTIP would be 1,587,368 for the Directors and 619,000 for the senior executives, giving a total of 2,206,368.
The awards are not pensionable.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Company, the participant generally forfeits all of his awards.
In cases of death or retirement due to ill health a pro rata payment may be made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In the event of a change of control of the Company all awards will vest on a pro rata time and performance basis.
The above is a summary of the LTIP.
No amendments to the advantage of participants may be made to the provisions of the LTIP described above without the prior consent of shareholders except in the event of a minor amendment to benefit the administration or tax treatment of the LTIP.
Accordingly the Company will seek approval of the shareholders to increase the maximum award for Executive Directors that may be made under the LTIP from 100% to 300% of salary at the forthcoming AGM.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Details of options outstanding under the LTIP are shown in note 5 to the accounts.
Pensions Only the Executive Directors basic salaries are pensionable and the main features of the Carpetright plc Pension Plan, which is a defined benefit scheme, in respect of Executive Directors are: a Pensions from age 60 of 2105 of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 4060 of final pensionable salary.
b A cash benefit on death in service of four times annual rate of pensionable salary at date of death.
c Pensions payable in the event of ill-health.

f All pensions are subject to contractual increases each April of 3% in respect of pensionable service prior to 6 April 1997 and the lesser of 5% and the increase in RPI in respect of pensionable service subsequent to 5 April 1997.
The Executive Directors are subject to a notional earnings cap as published by HMRC for registered pension schemes in the calculation of retirement benefits and death in service pensions.
It is confirmed that there are no discretionary practices which are taken into account in calculating transfer values on ceasing service.
Details of pensions earned by the Executive Directors are shown below: Increase Cost to Increase decrease the Plan decrease in accrued of the increase in accrued pension during in pension pension during Increase in the period to in excess the period to transfer Pension 2 May 2009 of contributions 2 May 2009 Transfer Transfer value net accrued at excluding in excess including value as at value as at of Directors 1 5 5 6 2 2 May 2009 inflation of inflation inflation 3 May 2008 2 May 2009 contributions 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 3 Lord Harris 27 1 457 517 60 M J Harris 13 2 19 3 103 153 44 4 J Kitching 46 2 37 4 784 998 209 C G Sollesse 30 2 28 3 377 491 108 1 The cost to the Plan of the increase represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the period, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation after deducting the Directors contribution.
2 The total change in value includes the effects of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting Director contributions.
3 Lord Harris has been in receipt of a pension since 15 September 2007.
4 Mr Kitching left the Board of Directors on 2 May 2009.
5 The transfer values quoted are full amounts and have not been reduced.
6 The transfer value basis was changed during the year.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the period.
The increase or decrease in transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice less Directors contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions but none of the Directors has elected to do so.
