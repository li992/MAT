Remuneration policy The Committee applies a remuneration policy which has at its core the following objectives: to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders to focus on top-line growth, margin improvement and capital discipline to link a significant proportion of remuneration to financial and individual performance, both in the short-term and long-term to provide strong linkage between remuneration and performance to ensure total remuneration is market-competitive and helps attract and retain executives of the highest calibre.
Remuneration arrangements The remuneration of senior executives balances fixed, variable, short-term and long-term remuneration, and is reviewed each year on a total remuneration basis to ensure that executives continue to be appropriately incentivised to achieve the Groups objectives.
For 2008 09, executive directors remuneration comprised basic salary, benefits in kind, annual bonus and pension benefits.
In addition, executive directors and senior executives participate in share-based incentive schemes, which in 2008 09 included the Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, the Smiths Group Value Sharing Plan VSP and the Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP.

The salaries for all participants in the Value Sharing Plan, including executive directors, have been frozen at their 2007 08 levels until 1 August 2010.

The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive was 180% of salary and for the Finance Director was 150% of salary.
Of any bonus earned, 50% is compulsorily deferred into Smiths shares under the rules of the CIP.
The table below summarises the structure of the 2008 09 annual bonus plan and the awards receivable for performance in 2008 09.

Matching share awards vest in full if ROCE exceeds WACC by an average margin of at least 3% a year: a 1-for-1 matching share award vests if ROCE is between WACC 1% and WACC 3% p. a.
Dividends accrue on matching shares that vest.
For2007 08 andearlieryears, executivedirectors  wereableto investupto 100%of anynetbonus earned orif greater, 25% of salary in Smiths shares.
Invested amounts were eligible for a 1-for-1 matching share award after three years based on the pre-tax amount of salary or deferred bonus in question subject to continued employment in the Group and the Companys average ROCE over the performance period exceeding the Companys WACC over the same period by an average margin of at least 1% p. a.
Value Sharing Plans VSPs The Group and divisional VSPs are one-off, long-term incentive plans designed to reinforce Smiths strategy of focusing on shareholder value creation at the Group and divisional levels.
Group VSP Messrs Bowman and Langston are participants in the Group VSP, which rewards executive directors and selected senior executives with a pre-determined number of shares for every 5m of value created above a hurdle over the three-year and four-year performance periods from 1 August 2008 or until a vesting event, if earlier.
On 28 July 2008 Mr Bowman was granted an award under which he will be entitled to receive 1,250 Smiths Group shares for each 5m of surplus value created in respect of each performance period.
On the same date Mr Langston was granted an award under which he will be entitled to receive 500 Smiths Group shares for each 5m of surplus value created in respect of each performance period.
TSR Element One-third of the award will depend on the growth, over each performance period, in Smiths market capitalisation plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders i. e. dividends plus share buybacks less share issues over and above the median total shareholder return of the FTSE 100 companies excluding financial services companies.
Participants will only be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR Element if the Committee is satisfied that this is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
Earnings Element The remaining two-thirds of each award will be determined by the growth, over each performance period, in adjusted Profit Before Tax PBT from a baseline PBT of 338.6m in 2007 08 times a fixed multiple of 12.0 plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders over and above a cost of equity hurdle return of 9.5% a year.
The Committee may reduce the payout of the Earnings Element if an acquisition results in a material reduction in return on invested capital.
No retesting of either performance condition is permitted.
Performance measure selection The Remuneration Committee believes that the combination of relative TSR and PBT provides the best balance between internal line-of-sight and shareholder alignment, between absolute and relative performance and between internal and external perspectives.
PBT is considered the best internal measure of Smiths financial performance as it is highly visible internally and regularly monitored and reported.
Relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders and the FTSE 100 index excluding financial services companies continues to be considered a relevant and robust indicator of the relative value created by Smiths management for its shareholders.
Divisional VSPs In addition to the Group VSP, the Committee has introduced divisional plans for each of the five divisions Smiths Detection, Smiths Medical, John Crane, Smiths Interconnect, and Flex-Tek.
The plans are along the same lines as the Group VSP to help focus the most senior divisional executives on maximising the value of their divisions and returning surplus cash to the Group.
The Shareholder Circular issued in July 2008 which dealt, amongst other things, with the proposed establishment of the VSP stated that the Remuneration  incentives forparticipants in theGrouporDivisional VSPs until 2010.
TheCommittee intends in 2010 to consider potential long-term incentives for participants in the VSP.
Any proposals for such long-term incentives will be the subject of shareholder consultation and the required approvals at the appropriate time.
68 Smiths Group plc Annual report 2009 Directors remuneration report continued Performance Share Plan PSP No awards under the PSP have been made to Executive Directors or other participants in the VSP in 2008 09 and none will be made to these executives in 2009 10.
Awards vest after three years, subject to performance conditions.
One-third of an award is subject to the Companys TSR performance relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the Companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three-year performance period.
Of the award, 25% will vest if the Companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straight-line pro rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award will be subject to earnings per share EPS growth targets measured before exceptional items.
For each of the outstanding three-year cycles commencing in 2006 07 and 2007 08, full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% a year.
If the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% a year, 25% vesting will occur with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
There will be no retesting of the TSR and EPS performance measures.
Sharesave Scheme The Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with at least 12 months service, is subject to UK legislation as to the maximum amount that can be saved.
Participants save a fixed sum of up to 250 a month for three or five years and may use the sum generated by their savings contracts to exercise the options which are usually granted at a 20% discount to the market price.
Share ownership guidelines It is the Committees policy that executive directors should, over time, acquire a shareholding with a value equal to at least one and a half years gross salary two years gross salary for the Chief Executive and retain at least 50% of any net vested share awards after sales to meet tax liabilities until those values are achieved.
Share scheme dilution limits The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the Association of British Insurers.
These restrict the issue of new shares under all the Companys share schemes in any 10-year period to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital and under the Companys discretionary schemes to 5% in any 10-year period.
As at 31 July 2009, the headroom available under these limits was 4.1% and 0.5%, respectively excluding the conditional share awards granted under the VSP on 28 July 2008 and subsequently.
Pension The Company operates pension arrangements for executive directors.
In the case of Mr Bowman, the Company pays a monthly salary supplement worth 42% of salary per annum approved by the Committee to enable him to make his own pension provision.
In the case of Mr Langston, a final salary schemeprovides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
The Companycontinues to apply an earnings cap, on a basis similar to the pre-2006 statutory limit, to determine the proportion of overall pension payable by the regulated pension scheme, with the balance of pension provided by the Company.
This arrangement substantially represents a continuation of pre-2006 practice and involves no additional cost for the Company.
In appropriate cases, the Company permits the waiver of salary and pension supplement entitlements where the arrangement does not involve additional cost for the Company.
Where such waivers are made, incentives and pension entitlements continue to be calculated by reference to salaries prior to these reductions.
Details of the salary supplements, waiver and other pension provisions are set out in the tables on page 70.

Mr Langstons normal retirement age is 60.
An early retirement pension, based on actual service completed, may be paid after age 50 and may be subject to a reduction on account of early payment.
On death, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the directors pension or for death-in-service his prospective pension at age 60 is payable.
All pensions in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP are guaranteed to increase at the lesser of i 7% per annum compound and ii the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index.
There has, however, been a long-standing practice of granting additional discretionary increases on pensions in excess of the GMP to bring them into line with price inflation.
The benefits provided under the relevant pension schemes were not affected by these arrangements.
Transfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with pensions regulations, and represent the amount that the pension scheme would pay to another pension provider if the member elects to transfer all of his benefits out of the scheme.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to the director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.

The mid-market closing price of a Smiths share on the date of awards made to directors under the CIP in the 2008 09 financial year was 777.5p.
Of the 80,761 shares over which options had been granted under the 95 ESOS and SAYE to, and were held by, directors at 31 July 2009, 79,673 were granted at exercise prices below the market price of a Smiths Group share on 26 September 2009 829p.
None of the options or awards listed above was subject to any payment on grant.
Options and awards which lapsed or partially lapsed during the financial year ended 31 July 2009 are indicated in the table above by a hash mark # : no other options or awards held by any director lapsed during the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009.

From 2004 to 2007, senior executives, including executive directors, received awards under the PSP.
PSP awards granted in October 2005 Smiths TSR over the performance period in relation to 2005 PSP awards 20 October 2005 to 20 October 2008 ranked 32nd in the comparator group of FTSE 100 companies excluding financial services companies, a level of performance equivalent to the 54th percentile.
Based on the vesting schedule on which 25% of an award vests at median and 100% vests for upper quartile performance, this performance warrants the vesting of 38% of the TSR element one-third of an award.
Smiths EPS growth over the performance period was 12.2% p. a. warranting the full vesting of the remaining two-thirds of the award.
Overall, 79% of 2005 PSP awards vested.
The performance tests for options granted under the 95 ESOS up to and including October 2005 have all been passed with the sole exception of the grant on 9 April 2002, which failed its initial test and two annual retests.
No further retests of the April 2002 grant will be undertaken.
The April 2002 grant can now only be exercised in the event of a change in control of the Company or by certain good leavers.
