Ladbrokes William Hill This condition was set following a consultation with the Sportingbet Bwin Companys major shareholders in early 2007.
From 2010, 888 Holdings Paddy Power Unibet Cryptologic following feedback from institutional investors in 2009, the Company will adopt a sliding scale rather than cliff vesting.
The threshold level of performance, for which 25% of an The threshold level of performance for which 25% of an award will vest, requires PartyGamings TSR to equal the award will vest, will be set at average Clean EPS growth of median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line 5% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting basis to 100% vesting if the Companys TSR exceeds the for Clean EPS growth of at least 15% per annum.
median by at least 10% per annum over the three-year Executive FMV Plan vesting schedule period.
It is estimated that outperformance of the median awards made from 2007 to 2009 by 10% per annum is broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance over three years.
There is no re-testing of the performance condition and vesting occurs as soon as 100% reasonably practicable after the end of the performance period once the Remuneration Committee has determined 75% the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied.

The Remuneration Committee recognises that whilst it is unusual for a UK-listed company to grant timevesting awards, it considers it essential to attract talented executives from around the world and to retain the Groups existing talent.
Executive Directors are not eligible for awards under the FMV Plan.
Nil-Cost Plan: Since the implementation of the plans described above, awards granted under the Nil-Cost Plan have only been made for key hire or retention purposes.
These awards are not usually subject to performance conditions and normally vest on a phased basis over a fourto five-year period subject to continued employment.
The main exception to this general policy are the awards made to key employees of Cashcade, which will only vest in 2012 subject to the satisfaction of a stretching EBITDA target for that business unit for 2011.
The Combined Code recommends that performancerelated elements of remuneration should form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of Executive Directors.
Whilst the one Nil-Cost Plan award granted to the CEO on his appointment in 2008 forms a significant part of his total remuneration package, the Remuneration Committee was of the view that a performance condition would detract from the attraction and retention capabilities of the award and it was necessary to make the award on these terms in order to secure the CEOs service over an initial five-year term.
All Executive FMV Plan and PSP awards made to the CEO provide for vesting to be conditional on the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions.
The Combined Code recommends that executive share options should not be offered at a discount.
The options awarded under the Nil-Cost Plan have been granted at nilcost on issue and exercise.
At the time the awards were made to the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee was of the view that such terms were necessary in order for the Company to either secure or retain their longterm service.

Following the acquisition of Cashcade in 2009, the Company granted Nil-Cost Options to a small number of key Cashcade employees for the purpose of securing their retention beyond the 2-year acquisition earn-out.
As the Employee Trust did not have sufficient unallocated Shares to provide for these awards, the Company gifted sufficient funds to the Trust to purchase 1 million existing Shares in the market, which it carried out on 21 October 2009.
Consequently, the acquisition of these Shares has had a cash impact on the Company.
The Company may in the future make further such donations to the Employee Trust if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company.
As at 28 February 2010, the Trust held 4,454,961 Shares, of which 4,236,802 Shares have been allocated to existing NilCost Share Options.
The Trusts trustee has waived all dividend and voting rights attaching to the Shares in the Trust.
