This report is subject 1 to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting AGM.
Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Contents Dear Shareholder Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The effects of the 2009 market downturn, following record performance Part 1 Executive directors remuneration in 2008, have inevitably been reflected in the area of remuneration.
I a Remuneration Committee reported last year that the executive directors had themselves proposed b Remuneration policy to hold their base salaries at 2008 levels in one case a temporary c Remuneration arrangements for executive directors reduction was taken.
This proposal was endorsed by the Committee.
i Basic salary and benefits For 2010 the executive directors base salaries are again being held ii Annual bonus at 2008 levels.
Annual bonuses paid in 2009 including the deferred iii Long term incentives element reflected the excellent 2008 performance.
However, bonus iv Pensions levels awarded in 2010 for 2009 performance are on aggregate 31% d Service contracts down for executive directors, reflecting corporate, rather than individual, performance.
The annual bonus is paid one half in the year following Part 2 Non-executive directors remuneration the performance year, with the other half deferred for a further two years.
Full payment of the deferred element had been conditional on a Remuneration policy profit growth of RPI 5%.
However, following a review of the bonus b Annual fee structure scheme compared to our peer group, it was considered that this c Remuneration of non-executive directors in 2009 condition resulted in the scheme being materially below market and, as a result, this condition has been removed.

scheme was introduced with the first cycle covering 2008-2010.
It was clear from early in 2009 that the corporate targets, set at the end of 2007 and accounting for 75% of the award potential, would not be met in the current market environment.
The Committee discussed the possibility of reducing the corporate targets, in the way that we had increased the targets under the previous scheme in a rising market.
indd 45 01 04 2010 14:07 46 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2009 Governance Directors remuneration report continued After careful consideration, the Committee decided that this was not During 2009 we have had to be both pragmatic and flexible in seeking appropriate.
However, it was felt that this could expose the company to maintain a balance between fairness to employees and proper to a potential retention risk between the final payment under the response to a difficult environment.
The Committee will continue to old scheme and a possible payment in 2012 under the second monitor all elements around senior executive remuneration and to act cycle of the existing scheme.
In addition it seemed that the scheme in the interests of the business and its shareholders, and to ensure members would be receiving very little remuneration recognition for the that executive pay continues to be seen in the context of remuneration outstanding 2008 performance and, as a result, LTRP awards were actions and policies throughout the Groups businesses.

is no additional dilution for shareholders involved since the size of the LTRP pool is unchanged and the decision is purely about distribution.
The other key concern for the Committee during 2009 was the setting of Corporate Objectives for the 2009-2011 cycle of the LTIP.
Normally we would expect to set targets by about March of the initial year of the cycle.
When the Committee considered the setting of John Morgan targets for 2011 in the early part of 2009 it quickly concluded that, Chairman, Remuneration Committee given market uncertainty, it did not have enough visibility over this period to set targets which would be fair and effective, either from the perspective of participants or shareholders.
The targets were subsequently set and are referenced in this report.
For the 2010-2012 cycle, we have been able to set the targets in the normal timetable, and these targets are also referenced in this report.
The Committee is conscious of the changing context concerning senior executive remuneration, and believes that the structure for executive pay within the Group remains valid.
The balance of base salary, annual bonus and long term incentive, underpinned by a clear and rigorous process for setting both personal and business objectives, an appropriate level of deferral and an internal and external transparency should, we believe, give our shareholders confidence in the process.

The Committee reviews the level of rewards that are offered by other companies, including those within comparable sectors and geography as well as those of comparable size and complexity in other sectors.
Given that the Group operates in specialised and international markets, regard is also given to remuneration of peers within the same industry sector.
As noted above, one of the Committees key objectives is to align the remuneration of executive directors with the long term strategy of the Group and with maximising shareholder value.
In order to do this, remuneration packages comprise fixed and variable performance related elements.

Long term incentives Long term incentives play an important role in the retention and motivation of executive directors and senior executives, consistent with our goal of maximising shareholder value.
In this respect the Group has put in place a number of long term incentive schemes.
Details of the schemes follow in section 3c, but the table below summaries the schemes: Long term incentive Description LTIS Introduced in 2005 for executive directors and around 35 senior executives, the LTIS provided incentives for performance over a three year period to 31 December 2007.

LTIP Introduced in 2007 for executive directors and around 35 senior executives, this is a replacement for the LTIS above and is designed to provide incentives for three year rolling performance cycles commencing 1 January 2008.
LTRP Introduced in 2003, the LTRP is designed to align rewards to financial performance and results in the awarding of Wood Group par value options to participants.
Since the introduction of the LTIS and LTIP this scheme has primarily been aimed at a group of around 390 employees in the layer below those participating in the LTIP.
ESOS Established in 2002, the ESOS provide for the grant of options to executive directors, senior executives and other employees.
There are currently around 580 participants across the Group.
No awards have been made to executive directors since 2005.
