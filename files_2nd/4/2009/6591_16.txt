The remuneration of the executive Directors in 2009, excluding pension benefits and long term incentives, was as follows: Date of PerformanceCar Other Total Total service Salary related allowance benefits 2009 2008 agreement 000 000 000 000 000 000 a Sir Kevin Smith 24.01.03 648 299 14 7 968 894 b a Marcus Bryson 01.10.07 353 275 15 26 669 576 a Andrew Reynolds Smith 14.11.07 350 150 12 4 516 498 59 c a William Seeger 11.02.08 400 160 12 82 654 549 a Nigel Stein 22.08.01 413 195 12 4 624 594 a 2,164 1,079 65 123 3,431 3,111 a Payments of supplementary allowances to certain executive Directors to assist them towards securing retirement benefits are included in the cash allowances for pension benefit purposes disclosed in the second table on page 62.
The following allowances have therefore been excluded from the total remuneration shown in the table above although they are part of the Directors aggregate emoluments for the purpose of disclosure under Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008: Sir Kevin Smith 299,031 2008 299,031 : M J S Bryson 44,160 2008 37,320 : A Reynolds Smith 112,960 2008 109,920 : W C Seeger 107,225 2008 83,382 : N M Stein 147,960 2008 145,420. b A total of 21,000 of this amount relates to a subsistence allowance to which Mr Bryson was entitled following the relocation of GKNs operational headquarters.
The payment is subject to normal tax and national insurance deductions.
c Under the terms of his service agreement, Mr Seegers emoluments are paid semi-monthly in US$, converted at the exchange rate published in the UK Financial Times on the first business day of the relevant month.
Mr Seeger is a US National who relocated to the UK in 2008 in the role of Finance Director: additional reimbursement was made by the Company in 2009 in respect of expenses relating to his relocation.
Mr Seeger had full US Federal and State hypothetical tax withholding through the US payroll in 2009.
As a result of the complicated interaction of the UK and US tax regimes, an additional payment of 244,160 was made by GKN to the UK and US tax authorities on his behalf in order to avoid a period of double taxation.
All subsequent tax refunds resulting from the tax paid by GKN will be refunded to the Company in due course.
A figure of 60,858 is contained within the benefits figure shown, being the best estimate of the amount which is not expected to be refunded based on information available to date.
An amount totalling 58,023, relating to an element of UK tax paid but not reported in 2008, is not included in the above figures.
The 2009 performance-related payments made under the STVRS were triggered by the achievement of a number of Group and, where appropriate, individual portfolio targets relating to profit and cash flow performance and Group net debt.
The maximum amount that an individual could receive and actual total payments to executive Directors under the 2009 STVRS were as follows: Element Maximum % Actual % a Profit 50.0 10.0 to 43.4 Cash flow 12.5 10.0 to 12.5 Group net debt 17.5 17.5 b 80.0 37.5 to 73.4 a 60% for the Chief Executive Aerospace.

b The accrued annual pension includes entitlements earned as an employee prior to becoming a Director as well as for qualifying services after becoming a Director.
c Increase over the year in accrued pension in excess of inflation to which the Director would have been entitled on leaving service.
d A transfer value represents the present value of accrued benefits.
It does not represent an amount of money which the individual is entitled to receive.
The change in transfer value over the year reflects the additional pension earned and the effect of changes in stock market conditions during the year.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the method and assumptions used to calculate transfer values from the GKN Group Pension Scheme.
These assumptions were adopted by the Trustees with effect from April 2008 in order to meet the requirements of new transfer value legislation which came into effect on 1 October 2008.
