Consistent with the legislation, affected executives will be entitled to a pension determined by reference to pensionable earnings at retirement, provided this does not breach the enhanced protection requirements.
From 1 January 2009 onwards, the increases in pensionable salary under the plan have been capped at a maximum of 2.5% each year for active members including relevant executive directors.

70 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 GoVernance Directors report on remuneration.
Change in transfer value tV : the increase in the accrued benefit, which is the actual benefit for the affected executives, increased by between 5,000 and 25,000 for each individual.
this is consistent with the calculation of the entitlement as explained in the Benefits section on page 68. the above table also shows the increase in transfer value being the current capital value now of the pension ultimately due.
in the case of tim Breedon and John pollock this level of increase did not arise as a result of extra accrual - they ceased accruing any additional pension entitlement with effect from 31 December 2008. the reasons for the increase in transfer value are primarily a combination of the revaluation of their deferred pension entitlements at 31 December 2008 in line with the National average earnings Nae index, which was was 5% in 2009, and the fact that the transfer value factors increase with age.
Directors loans at 31 December 2009 there were no outstanding loans made to directors.
